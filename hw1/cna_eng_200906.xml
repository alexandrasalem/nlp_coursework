(By Huang Juei-hung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Ma Ying-jeou  told his host,  Guatemalan  President
Alvaro Colom Caballeros, Saturday that Taiwan would like to help Guatemala
conserve its historic relics.</P>
      <P>"Conserving historic relics or sites is a mammoth engineering task that takes a
long time to complete, " Ma said during a dinner party held in Guatemala City,
adding that the ROC government would like to extend a helping hand if necessary.</P>
      <P>Ma and his wife Chow Mei-ching hosted the dinner party to thank Colom for his
nation's hospitality during their three-day visit to Guatemala -- one of
Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the Taiwan first couple visited the Tikal area, where they

    <HEADLINE>Bird strike at Taoyuan airport in April caused by eagle: report</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  May 31 (CNA)

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The bird strike incident involving a China Airlines flight at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport April 16 was caused by a crested serpent eagle, according
to a report released last week by the Flight Safety Foundation-Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report said that an examination of a small amount of flesh and feathers from
what was left of the shredded bird showed that the CAL flight collided with the
medium-large raptor known scientifically as Spilornis cheela, a reptile eater
that hunts over woodland mainly for snakes and lizards.</P>
      <P>Flight safety experts at the foundation noted that the airport authorities had
launched a drive to eliminate rodents around the airport shortly before the
incident. They said in the report that the eagle was probably attracted by rat
carcasses or slow-moving rodents under the influence of rat poison.</P>
      <P>A bird strike at the Taoyuan airport caused by a bird of prey of such a large
size is a rare occurrence, as previous incidents involved only small birds, the
report said.</P>
      <P>The CAL jetliner involved in the strike was taxiing on the runway at the time
and did not suffer serious damage, it added.</P>
      <P>Bird strikes are a perennial problem for aircraft at Taiwan's 27 airports for
civilian and military aircraft.</P>
      <P>The Flight Safety Foundation recorded six such incidents in April and May at
airports in Taoyuan, Taipei, Tainan, Chiayi, Gangshan and Hualien -- caused by a
variety of birds, including red turtle doves, barn swallows and large Indian
pratincoles.</P>
      <P>The air force has lost four expensive jet fighters to bird strikes since 1991,
but there have been not crashes of civilian aircraft attributed to bird strikes.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the foundation, there were 841 bird strike
incidents involving military and civilian aircraft in Taiwan between 2002 and
2005, 108 of which resulted in damage and causing 22 planes to abandon their
scheduled takeoffs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Medical students protest against academic credentials policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, May 31 (CNA)
05/31/09  16:59:02
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 1,000 students from Taiwan's major medical schools took it to the
streets Sunday to protest a policy they claim favors Taiwanese doctors who have
received medical education abroad.</P>
      <P>The policy  against  which  they  were  protesting  allows foreign-trained
Taiwanese doctors to practice in Taiwan once they pass a two-stage national
medical exam, which is generally considered not very difficult.</P>
      <P>Liu Tzu-hung, a senior at National Taiwan University School of Medicine who co-
organized the protest, said they hope foreign-trained medical school graduates
should also have to do internships at local hospitals before being allowed to
sit national medical exams.</P>
      <P>Liu said these people, some of whom received their medical education in eastern
European countries such as Poland and Romania, may have received diplomas from
abroad, but lack on-the-spot clinical experience in Taiwanese hospitals.</P>
      <P>"Because they have not done internships and because of their lack of clinical
experience in Taiwanese hospitals, critical conditions and emergencies occur as
a result of their practices, often requiring their locally educated peers to
scramble to correct their errors, " Liu elaborated.</P>
      <P>The protesters  also demanded  that foreign medical school graduates should have
their academic credentials certified by the Ministry of Education before being
allowed to sit national exams.</P>
      <P>The protesting students also opposed a "sunset bill" proposal that would exempt
those who are now studying at medical schools in Eastern European countries from
being subject to the new regulations.</P>
      <P>The students said they want relevant draft amendments to be included on the
agenda of the present legislative session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>12th swine flu case confirmed in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  May 31 (CNA)
05/31/09  17:30:35
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC) confirmed another imported case of
swine flu Sunday, bringing to 12 the number of people infected with the
influenza A(H1N1) virus in the country.</P>
      <P>"The 12th case is a 33-year-old Taiwanese businessman who flew back to Taiwan
from the United States via Hong Kong May 27, " said CECC spokesman Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>The man suffered a fever aboard the flight that departed from New York,
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>"Since the businessman was traveling first class to Hong Kong, no other
passengers came into close contact with him during the flight," Shih said.</P>
      <P>However, he then boarded another flight from Hong Kong to Taiwan on which he
traveled economy class. A total of 40 people were seated in the three rows in
front of and behind him during that flight, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>Once back in Taiwan, he went to a movie with his wife and two friends in Taipei
City.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, a total of 44 people have come into close contact with him
over the past three days, all of whom have been notified and told to closely
monitor their health and contact the CECC if any flu symptoms develop.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid causing public panic, the CECC decided last week that it will
no longer identify the flights taken by swine flu patients unless there is
evidence to show that the virus was contracted during the flight.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Shih said that as Taiwan has not reported any more indigenous case for
seven days, the country's swine flu alert was downgraded to the second level
Sunday as previously scheduled.</P>
      <P>To date, 12 swine flu cases have been confirmed in Taiwan, with no deaths.</P>
      <P>The CECC raised the level of the country's swine flu alert to the third stage of
yellow May 25 -- which denotes a situation in which imported cases have already
caused a second wave of infections -- after the first case of domestic infection
was confirmed that same day.</P>
      <P>As of 2 p.m. Friday, 53 countries had officially reported 15,510 cases of
A(H1N1) infection, including 99 deaths, according to the latest World Health
Organization report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Couple tie the knot again after six decades of separation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 92-year-old veteran and his "former" wife tied the knot again Sunday, after
being separated for decades with one in Taiwan and the other in China as a
result of the Chinese civil war more than 60 years ago.</P>
      <P>Lee Fu-tang, dressed in a trim business suit, arrived in a limousine to marry
Kuan Wen-ying, 85, at his home in Yuanlin township in the central county of
Changhua that morning.</P>
      <P>A wedding ceremony was held at the courtyard of Lee's home, where the couple has
lived since 2007 after Kuan came to Taiwan from their hometown in China's
northern province of Shandong, followed by a wedding banquet, also held in the
courtyard.</P>
      <P>The wedding was organized with the assistance of the Taichung City-based Hondao
Senior Citizen's Welfare Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation decided to help organize the wedding after hearing of Lee's long-
held hope of being able to remarry his wife in a "more formal wedding ceremony."</P>
      <P>Lee said that he and Kuan used to play together as children when they were
neighbors back in Shandong. They were later wed through a marriage arranged by
their parents, but only over a table at a small restaurant with just their
parents attending.</P>
      <P>Lee said he left home three years later to join the Nationalist army and fight
against Japanese invading troops and the emerging Chinese communists. Their son
was also born at around that time, he went on, adding that he did not see Kuan
and their only son again until 1993, when he got in contact with them and they
began exchanging photos.</P>
      <P>He traveled to Shandong to bring Kuan to Taiwan to live with him in 2007 --
after nearly 60 years of separation across the strait, during which they both
remarried and had families of their own. Both Lee's Taiwanese wife and Kuan's
Chinese husband had died by the time Lee made the trip to Shandong.</P>
      <P>Lee kissed a shy Kuan on the cheek during the wedding ceremony, in which the
couple vowed to keep each other company for the rest of their lives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$20 surcharge on cigarettes from June 1: DOH</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The health and welfare surcharge on tobacco products will be increased from the
present NT$10 per pack to NT$20 per pack from June 1, a senior health official
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, director of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH), said retail stores are allowed to sell off their
existing cigarette stocks without asking their customers to pay the extra NT$10
surcharge.</P>
      <P>He urged consumers to examine the cigarettes they buy to make sure the pack
carries a sticker certifying the imposition of a NT$20 health and welfare
surcharge.</P>
      <P>The 100 percent surcharge increase will raise the average per-pack price for
cigarettes to between NT$55 and NT$70 (US$2.15) per pack, depending on the
brand.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by Chao, the new measure is expected to boost annual
revenues from the health and welfare surcharge from NT$20 billion to between
NT$32 billion and NT$36 billion.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act and the regulations
governing the distribution of the tobacco health and welfare surcharge, the DOH
will use 4 percent, or NT$1.39 billion, of the revenues from the surcharge as
subsidies to help 470,000 less privileged people obtain national health
insurance, Chao said.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance will receive 70 percent of the surcharge
revenues and will spend NT$10 billion to meet its financial shortfall and the
rest in various areas, including 6 percent for cancer prevention, 5 percent on
raising the standards of medical services, 3 percent in areas lacking medical
resources, another 3 percent on tobacco hazards prevention and 2 percent on
treatment of rare diseases.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Nantou county government in central Taiwan launched a new publicity campaign
Sunday to encourage smokers to replace smoking with reading as part of the
observance of the May 31 World No Tobacco Day.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Lee Chao-ching and Nantou County Council Speaker Wu Chi-hsiang
stubbed out a giant-size burning cigarette in a ceremony held on the county
government plaza to signify their determination to prevent the hazards caused by
tobacco and promote a smoke-free society.</P>
      <P>Noting that the drugs and chemicals found in cigarettes are detrimental to
health, Lee said he looks forward to seeing local smokers quit as soon as
possible for the sake of public health.</P>
      <P>"Smoking not only threatens the health of the smoker but also harms non-smokers
through second-hand smoke," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He urged smokers to take up reading as a replacement for their smoking habits,
saying that reading benefits both physical and mental health and contributes to
national development in the long run.</P>
      <P>Similar ceremonies were also held in the county's 13 major townships and
villages to inspire local smokers.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, 101 infractions had been reported throughout the county since the
newly revised Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act came into effect in January that
bars smoking in indoor public areas and workplaces, a local public health
official said.</P>
      <P>Among the violators, 65 cases involved students younger than 18, the official
said.</P>
      <P>He further said that anti-smoking patrols will be intensified at the county's
major scenic spots and recreational areas, as the county government frequently
receives complaints about illegal smoking in such areas.</P>
      <P>With beautiful mountain scenery, Nantou -- the only land-locked county in Taiwan
-- has long played a significant role in Taiwan's tourism industry.</P>

      <P>A Chinese deckhand on a Taiwanese fishing boat suffered serious shark bite
injuries aboard the boat Sunday while trying to move the seemingly unconscious
fish to a freezer.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Coast Guard Administration's 15th flotilla said they received
a radio request for help from the skipper of the Chin Sheng Fa 13 to help Zhang
Sanqian, 46, a native from Fujian province who was bleeding profusely because of
the shark bites.</P>
      <P>Zhang was given first aid treatment by health workers at a clinic on Green
Island to stop bleeding before a helicopter from the National Airborne Services
Corps lifted him to the Taitung branch of Macay Memorial Hospital in
southeastern Taiwan for further treatment.</P>
      <P>CGA officials quoted other crew members of Chin Sheng Fa 13 as saying that the
crew caught the 80-kilogram shark in waters near Green Island during an
operation to catch hake.</P>
      <P>After Zhang and five other deckhands pulled the shark onto the deck, they had
the fish electrocuted. As Zhang tried to pull the seemingly unconscious shark
toward the freezer, it suddenly attacked him twice with its razor-sharp teeth,
wounding his knee and tearing off large chunks of flesh from the back of his
left lower leg.</P>
      <P>Doctors at Macay Hospital said that Zhang needed 54 stitches to close the
wounds, and that he was "out of danger" by noon. However, the doctors decided
that Zhang should remain in an intensive care unit for a few days to prevent
wound infection.</P>

      <P>A 77-member trade delegation from China arrived in Taipei Sunday to procure a
variety of products ranging from high-tech devices to traditional craftworks.</P>
      <P>The delegation,  headed by Li Shuilin,  president  of the Association for Trade
and Economic Exchange Across the Taiwan Straits (ATEEATS) , is composed of
senior executives of five major Chinese export-import  trade  associations  and
six  leading  industry associations.</P>
      <P>Among the members are also top management officers from more than 40 flagship
companies in China, including Haier Group and Hasee Computer Co. Most of them
have won bids to provide products under China's "home appliances to the
countryside" project as part of its massive economic stimulus package.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is the ATEEATS' main engagement target, Li said many of
Taiwan-produced goods are badly needed in China. Therefore, he added, his
association plans to send more procurement missions to Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait trade and economic exchange association is set up by China's
Ministry of Commerce to handle cross-strait trade deals and promote commercial
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-chuan, secretary-general of the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) who greeted the Chinese delegation at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, said the group will procure electric home appliances,
information technology (IT) products, chemicals, craftworks, textiles,
foodstuffs and many other items.</P>
      <P>TAITRA will organize a presentation at the Taipei International Convention
Center Monday for Chinese buyers to meet their potential Taiwanese suppliers,
Chao said, adding that the council will help local manufacturers to grasp
business opportunities generated by China's "home appliances going to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Salvadoran President-elect Mauricio Funes said Sunday that El Salvador will
continue to maintain formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During a 30-minute discussion with visiting ROC President Ma Ying-jeou,  Funes
said that the decision  was based  on the long-standing friendship and long-term
cooperation between the two countries, according to Tsai Chung-li, director-
general of the Department of Public Affairs under the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However, Funes said his administration will simultaneously seek closer economic
ties with China.</P>
      <P>Funes also expressed the hope that Taiwan will help El Savador with its
agricultural development in particular, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>For his part, Ma congratulated Funes on his imminent inauguration as president
of El Salvador and expressed appreciation to the Salvadoran government for its
staunch support of Taiwan in the international community, which he said helped
Taiwan to join the World Health Assembly this year as an observer.</P>
      <P>Ma told Funes that since he took office one year ago, his administration has
adopted a "modus vivendi diplomacy" strategy aimed at easing tensions across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The efforts have worked, and cross-Taiwan Strait relations have improved
noticeably over the past year, " Ma was quoted as telling Funes.</P>
      <P>"The two sides have been cooperating, even though they are competitors, " Ma
said. "That is the reason why Taiwan is not opposed to its diplomatic allies
also developing business and trade relations with China."</P>
      <P>On agricultural cooperation between Taiwan and El Salvador, Ma said that Taiwan
has rich experience in rice and fruit growing as well as in aquaculture, and is
willing to share its expertise with El Salvador.</P>
      <P>A Salvadoran daily newspaper reported recently that several "Chinese officials"
will be attending Funes' inauguration.</P>
      <P>But ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Francisco Ou said as far as he knows, the
"Chinese officials" will be representatives of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) , rather than officials of Chinese government.</P>
      <P>Ma received a red carpet welcome at the airport upon his arrival in San Salvador
Sunday.</P>
      <P>He also met with outgoing Salvadoran President Elias Antonio Saca later in the
day.</P>
      <P>During the day, he visited El Salvador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend
the formal unveiling of a plaque on a new Taiwan-funded building in the country.</P>
      <P>The plaque states that the building symbolizes the unbroken friendship and
cooperation between the two countries over the past 68 years.</P>
      <P>Salvadoran  Foreign  Minister  Marisol  Argueta  expressed appreciation on
behalf of the Salvadoran government and people to Taiwan for its long-term
assistance to his country, saying that Taiwan's aid has enabled El Salvador to
flourish economically and socially over the past decades.</P>
      <P>Argueta said that over the past five years Taiwan has granted over US$29 million
to El Salvador to help finance various development projects under the leadership
of President Saca.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's first lady Chow Mei-ching visited the El Salvador chapter of
World Vision, a Christian charity dedicated to helping disadvantaged children
and families.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Chow met with a Salvadoran child whom President Ma has been
sponsoring under a World Vision program.</P>

      <P>Li Shuilin, chairman of China's Association of Economy and Trade Across Taiwan
Straits (ATEEATS), said Monday in Taipei that there is no limit on the volume of
Taiwan goods his delegation intends to order on its current procurement mission.</P>
      <P>"As long as Taiwanese companies manufacture the products we need, we intended to
purchase them from Taiwan and nowhere else, " Li said at a news conference held
by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) to
welcome him and a 77-member trade delegation from China.</P>
      <P>"It is difficult to predict the total volume of the procurements, which will
include information  technology products,  precision machinery, petroleum
products, and handcraft. Let's just say that there will be no limit," he added.</P>
      <P>The delegation, which arrived in Taipei the previous day, is composed of senior
executives of five major Chinese export-import trade associations,  six leading
industry associations and top management officers from more than 40 flagship
companies in China, including home appliances manufacturer Haier Group and
computer giant Lenovo China.</P>
      <P>Most of the companies have won bids to provide products under China's new
subsidy program to expand consumer purchase of home appliances in rural areas,
as part of a massive economic stimulus package.</P>
      <P>During its 6-day stay in Taiwan, the delegation is looking to procure a variety
of products, ranging from high-tech devices to traditional craft items.</P>
      <P>Li said the much improved cross-strait relations over the past year has afforded
companies on both sides to a great opportunity to work together and create a
win-win situation.</P>
      <P>His agency is seeking long-term cooperation between Chinese and Taiwanese
companies, and hence bilateral business opportunities will be unlimited, he
added.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang said on the same occasion that by combining
Taiwan's technology and China's market, the two sides will be able create an IT
industry that could dominate the world.</P>
      <P>The ATEEATS' first procurement mission to Taiwan is a step toward boosting
bilateral trade and economic cooperation between Taiwan and China, he said.
TAITRA has arranged 467 one-on-one sessions to help potential Taiwanese
suppliers access the business opportunities generated by China's "home
appliances in the countryside" project, he added.</P>
      <P>TAITRA is a semi-official agency that deals with matters of trade promotion and
international sales.</P>
      <P>ATEEATS Secretary-General Sun Zhaolin said at the news conference that his
agency is planning to organize two more procurement missions to Taiwan this
year. The second group is scheduled arrive in Taiwan at the end of June, while
the third will visit in July, he added.</P>
      <P>The ATEEATS was set up by China's Ministry of Commerce to handle cross-Taiwan
Strait trade deals and promote commercial exchanges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said in El Salvador Sunday that Taiwan will maintain its
efforts to take part in U.N.-affiliated activities, backed by a strong public
mandate and its participation in the recently concluded World Health Assembly
(WHA) in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while speaking with international media reporters at the
Radisson Plaza Hotel where he was staying on the eve of the June 1 inauguration
of El Salvador President-elect Mauricio Funes.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Taiwan's success in participating in the WHA as an observer in mid-
May was an indication that his administration's pragmatic policies have won
support at home and abroad, and that this approach should be maintained.</P>
      <P>The president attributed the positive development to improved Taiwan-China
relations over the past year since he has been at the helm of the government.</P>
      <P>"The incumbent administration's pragmatic and flexible diplomacy has led to
improved ties between Taiwan and China and to the signing of nine accords in
three rounds of bilateral talks, " he noted. "Warming cross-Taiwan Strait ties
has made it possible for El Salvador not to have to take sides between Taiwan
and China."</P>
      <P>"El Salvador can continue maintaining formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan while
developing closer trade and economic links with China," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"As a diplomatic partner of El Salvador, Taiwan will continue its cooperation on
a wide front and will provide necessary assistance, " Ma said, in response to
recent remarks by Funes that El Salvador will seek better links with China when
he takes office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President's diplomatic truce with China triggers war of words at home</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/01/09  17:26:48</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prior to President Ma Ying-jeou's departure from Taipei May 26 for his Central
America tour of Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, mainly  to attend  the  June
1 inauguration  of El Salvador president-elect Mauricio Funes, he said at the
airport that the journey proves that his advocacy of pragmatic diplomacy is
working.</P>
      <P>Although he did not elaborate, observers knew Ma was referring to Taiwan's
relations with El Salvador.</P>
      <P>After Funes won the presidency, fears had mounted in Taiwan that he might follow
through on hints during his election campaign that he would switch diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The potential crisis was quickly defused, however, by China giving an apparent
cold shoulder to Funes, paving the way for Ma's trip.</P>
      <P>The pillar of Ma's pragmatic diplomacy, which he calls a "modus vivendi"
strategy, is seeking a diplomatic truce with China.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration has never actually disclosed how it plans to define the
concept of a diplomatic truce with Beijing, much less strike an agreement on the
issue.</P>
      <P>The president has simply made public appeals that neither side should woo the
allies of the other.</P>
      <P>The war for diplomatic turf between Taiwan and China began as an extension of
the civil war between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese communists after the
gunfire ended in 1949, with each side vying for recognition as the only
legitimate regime governing China.</P>
      <P>It raged even harder after the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power in
Taiwan in 2000 after a half-century of KMT rule.</P>
      <P>Alarmed by the DPP's support for Taiwan independence, Beijing stepped up its
efforts to quash Taiwan's international presence and any hints alluding to the
country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>In its eight years in power, the DPP administration under former President Chen
Shui-bian lost nine allies to China while gaining three, resulting in an overall
decline in the number of its allies from 29 in 2000 to 23 in 2008.</P>
      <P>The fight for diplomatic allies provided shrewd politicians in small, mainly
impoverished Third World states with a chance to play one side against the
other, alternating their loyalties between the two countries to squeeze maximum
gains for their countries or themselves.</P>
      <P>This led to a bidding war, with both sides pitching for the other side's allies
with open wallets --  the notorious  "checkbook diplomacy" -- which only went to
prove in a number of cases that money could not buy long-term friendship.</P>
      <P>For example, the South Pacific island nation of Nauru switched its recognition
from Taipei to Beijing in 2002 and then back to Taipei in 2005; Chad, a cash-
strapped African state, restored official ties with Taiwan in 1997 and severed
them in 2006.</P>
      <P>Senegal, also in Africa, resumed ties with Taipei in 1996 and terminated them in
2005.</P>
      <P>But the game grew increasingly costly. When Beijing persuaded Costa Rica to
abandon Taipei in 2007, it pledged to purchase US$300 million-worth of the
Central American country's bonds and to provide US$130 million in direct aid.</P>
      <P>This diplomatic maneuvering involved a large amount of backroom deals and gave
corrupt  local and foreign  politicians  ample opportunity to grease their
palms.</P>
      <P>Notable examples include two middlemen who made away with US$30 million provided
by Taiwan's Foreign Ministry after saying they could help the country forge ties
with Papua New Guinea in 2006.</P>
      <P>In another glaring example that came to light, former National Security Council
Secretary-General Chiou I-ren was accused of seizing US$500,000 from a US$1.6
million secret fund set aside by the Foreign Ministry  to win the friendship  of
World  Trade Organization Director-General Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand in
2003.</P>
      <P>Rather than enhancing the country's international profile, these secret
diplomatic dealings tarnished Taiwan's global image.</P>
      <P>Ma vowed to get rid of this practice. On May 28, during his visit to Belize, Ma
lambasted Chen's administration for engaging in checkbook diplomacy and made a
pitch for his own administration's pragmatic diplomacy.</P>
      <P>He also said that any diplomatic breakthrough for Taiwan depends on a
breakthrough in its ties with China.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco Ou believes Beijing will buy Ma's idea of a
diplomatic truce -- if, that is, China puts a premium on its ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"With more than 170 allies around the world, Beijing can hardly increase its
prestige by winning one or two of Taiwan's allies, but doing so would cost China
goodwill from Taiwan," Ou said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has not agreed to a truce with Taiwan, but it has refrained from luring
away any of Taiwan's 23 remaining allies since Ma's inauguration in May 2008.</P>
      <P>In addition to El Salvador, Paraguay and Panama have also flirted with the idea
of changing their allegiances but have not followed through on their threats,
possibly after also being given the brush-off by China.</P>
      <P>In Ou's view, Beijing should not only forsake any attempt to lure away Taiwan's
allies but should also reject any countries who approach Beijing seeking
recognition, or it will inevitably harm Taipei's trust in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ma's diplomatic truce with Beijing has also given Taipei more leeway in dealing
with its allies' requests for aid, according to Ou.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan is willing to help its allies, our ambassadors are now capable
of asking their host countries to come up with detailed plans and practical
requests for grants," the minister said.</P>
      <P>However, Jaushieh Joseph Wu, Taipei's representative to the United States in
former President Chen Shui-bian's administration, dismissed Ma's vow to give up
checkbook diplomacy as mere rhetoric.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the diplomatic budget of Ma's administration is no less than
that of the preceding government, and in fact it has spent even more in some
countries.</P>
      <P>"Although Ma's administration hasn't lost any allies thus far, it is traveling
on a dangerous path, as it has given up any efforts to win new friends out of
deference to what it calls its `truce' with China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Beijing is going to great lengths to improve its ties with Taiwan's
allies, which could easily be converted into official ties, Wu warned.</P>
      <P>"Forsaking efforts to foster friendship with non-allies and pinning all hopes on
Beijing is very dangerous," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taipei's  "abrupt  reconciliation"  with  Beijing  has also embarrassed those of
its allies that have spoken out for Taiwan in its struggle with China, and has
baffled other countries that are friendly to Taiwan, Wu claimed.</P>
      <P>"They don't know whether they should continue to extend their support to
Taiwan," Wu further speculated.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng,  a political  science professor  at Soochow University in Taipei,
said the success of Ma's diplomatic truce should not be judged simply by the
number of allies the country can count.</P>
      <P>"What matters is Taiwan's substantive ties with countries that do not officially
recognize it," Lo said.</P>
      <P>"By this measurement, President Ma can hardly claim any progress, because his
leading ministers are still forbidden from setting foot in countries that are
allies of Beijing -- which contrasts sharply with Ma's encouragement to Taiwan's
allies to forge unofficial ties with Beijing," he said.</P>
      <P>"It doesn't take a diplomat to see who gets the upper hand from the truce," he
went on.</P>
      <P>Lo took particular issue with Ma's criticism of his predecessor's checkbook
diplomacy in Belize, describing his comments as unbecoming for a head of state.</P>
      <P>"It is more a piece of campaign rhetoric than a diplomatic statement, suggesting
that our allies have got a lot of mileage out of Taiwan's dispute with China, "
he said.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen how long Ma's truce with China will last. What is obvious,
however, is that the war of words surrounding it will not end any time soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WiMAX, touch-screen technology expected to dominate IT fair</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>WiMAX and touch-screen technology, as well as netbooks, will take the spotlight
at this year's Computex Taipei, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) and Taipei Computer Association (TCA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Touch screen technology is focus of this year's exhibition, with the launch of
many new products by international and local flagship companies expected," said
Walter Yeh, executive vice president of the semi-official trade promotion body
TAITRA at an international press conference on the eve of the opening of
Computex Taipei 2009.</P>
      <P>In addition to Intel and AMD, which will present new products at the Asia's
biggest IT exhibition, companies such as HP, Dell and Hitachi will also take
part and will hold seminars on ICT development trends, he added.</P>
      <P>Li Chang, deputy secretary-general of the TCA, said at the news conference that
he thinks netbooks smaller than 11 inches and long-life laptop batteries will
also draw heavy attention at this year's exhibition.</P>
      <P>"Everyone can foresee the growth of these products in the future," he said.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, among the new products to be launched at Computex Taipei,
those likely to attract the most attention include AMD Phenom X4 Quad-Core 9550,
Intel 4G and 8G Fiber Channel SFP, IBM Thinkpad X41T Series, Notebook Intel N270
and Eee PC S101/S101H.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TAITRA noted that the theme of this year's Computex Taipei is "WiMAX
on the Move, " under which three features -- innovation, leap and launch -- will
be presented. The products featured will be the WiMAX embedded notebook and
netbook, the smallest and lightest WiMAX mobile Internet device, the unique
WiMAX TV dongle, and other epochal WiMAX products, he added.</P>
      <P>Visitors to Computex Taipei 2009 will have access to various WiMAX products on
display at over 700 booths, TAITRA said. The four main Taiwan WiMAX operators --
VMAX, Vee Telecom, TATUNG InfoComm, and Global Mobile -- will demonstrate
several WiMAX application services to the public for the first time, it added.</P>
      <P>This year's exhibition, co-hosted by the TAITRA and TCA, is scheduled for June
2-6 and is expected to attract some 35,000 international buyers and 1,700
exhibitors and generate US$20 billion in business.</P>
      <P>For the first time, the show will include a pavilion dedicated to some 100
companies from China, including big brands such as the IT company Tsinghua
Tongfang and the consumer electronics manufacturer MALATA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japan hopes to step up academic cooperation with Taiwan: envoy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official from Japan's representative office in Taipei expressed hope Monday
that academic cooperation between Taiwan and Japan can be boosted in the latter
part of the year.</P>
      <P>Naohiro  Tsutsumi,  director-general  of  the  Interchange Association's Taipei
Office,  also said the association, which represents Japanese interests in
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, will carefully plan on how to
strengthen such cooperation with Taiwan's academic sector.</P>
      <P>He cited several possible options, including the opening of classes on Japan
studies, exchanges of students and invitations to Japanese professors to conduct
classes in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Through such academic cooperation, we hope Taiwanese undergrad or graduate
students will be more interested in studying Japanese politics, history and
culture," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan and Japan have already made progress in a number of
programs in the first part of this year.</P>
      <P>They include an agreement earlier this year to open regular flights between
Taipei's Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which Tsutsumi said will
boost bilateral tourism revenues and facilitate exchanges after it is launched
this winter.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the Japanese government invited 100 senior high school
students to visit Japan in February, while Taiwan in return will invite 100
Japanese senior high school students to visit Taiwan this December.</P>
      <P>"We hope the two sides will continue to promote exchanges of youngsters based on
this solid basis," he said.</P>
      <P>In related news that same day, applications for working holiday visas for Japan
kicked off Monday,  which will offer a rare opportunity for young people from
both sides to learn about the culture of their respective host countries, he
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that he himself made his first overseas trip to Taiwan at the age of
26. Although it was only a five-day stay, he went on, it left him with a
"wonderful and impressive experience."</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association is accepting applications for working holiday visas
at its Taipei and Kaohsiung offices June 1-5 and Nov. 2-6.</P>
      <P>Japan is the third country to reach such a working holiday agreement with Taiwan
after Australia and New Zealand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung City opens 1st walking trail to promote poetry appreciation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung has inaugurated a walking trail with
poems inscribed on tablets for people to learn about and enjoy poetry while they
are out taking a stroll, a local official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The trail, inaugurated Sunday amid dance and music, is 517 meters in length and
built along the west side of the famous scenic attraction Lotus Pond in the
city's Zuoying District.</P>
      <P>The 15 poems, all written by local poets, will be displayed on the trail, said
Lin Mei-hsiou, an official in the city government's Bureau of Cultural Affairs,
which is in charge of the trail project.</P>
      <P>Altogether, 15 writers' poems will be displayed on the trail, which begins with
four lines of late writer Yeh Shih-tao's prose titled "No Land, No Literature."</P>
      <P>Born in Tainan City in 1925, Yeh was a pioneering Taiwanese writer who
specialized in the literary history of Taiwan. Yeh moved to Kaohsiung in 1965
and died there in 2008.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, other writers whose poems are exhibited on the trail all live
in the city, including two prose writers and 12 poets, such as Wang Chi-chiang,
Cheng Chiung-ming, Chung Shun-wen, Lee Chang-hsien, Chin Lien, Tzeng Kuei-hai,
and Lu Han-hsiou.</P>
      <P>Lin said the poems were selected by a committee convened by the city government,
and are inscribed on tablets made of granite or steel in different shapes to fit
in with the scenic views around the pond.</P>
      <P>Inscriptions of all the poetic writings, as well as the words at the entrance
and exit of the trail, are written in calligraphy by Chung Chao-cheng, an 84
-year-old writer well-known for his literary critiques. Like Yeh, Chung is also
famous in Taiwan's literary circle.</P>
      <P>The city government spent nearly two years on the project, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said at the inauguration ceremony that the trail
dedicated to literature is as meaningful as trails glorifying philosophers in
foreign countries.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that there will be more venues of this kind in the future
to showcase Kaohsiung residents' love for literature and to present literature
with vitality and power by local writers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Disabled Chinese brothers to be cited in Taipei</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two physically challenged brothers from a rural backwater in northern China were
expected to arrive in Taipei Monday to be cited by a local charity for their
"fervent love of life."</P>
      <P>Twenty-nine-year-old Zhang Yunpeng, who paints using his mouth, and his younger
brother Zhang Yuncheng, 28, a published author who types with just one finger,
are scheduled to join 10 other recipients of the 2009 Fervent Global Love of
Life Awards to be presented by the Chou Ta-Kuan Cultural and Educational
Foundation June 4.</P>
      <P>Zhang Yunpeng, who has suffered from incurable muscular dystrophy since the age
of 3, is expected to do a Chinese brush painting at a gathering to be held
Tuesday using his mouth, the only part of his body he can still control.</P>
      <P>The painting will be presented to Terry Gou, CEO and founder of Taiwan's Hon Hai
Group, the world's largest contract maker of consumer electronics by revenue,
according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>Gou, who made the Zhangs acquaintance two years ago when he was invited to
present the "10 Most Touching Figures in China" Award in Hangzhou, decided to
invite the Zhangs for dinner Monday to his business empire's headquarters
located in Tucheng, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Gou has also offered the brothers a suite he owns in Beijing so they can get
away from their shabby home in China's  remote Heilongjiang Province.</P>
      <P>Paralyzed from the neck down, Yunpeng started to use his mouth to hold brushes
to paint at 23. But even his mouth became dysfunctional a year later, and a year
after that, the strength in his neck slipped away, while he also suffered
analosis, causing his skeleton to deform.</P>
      <P>With his weight dropping to less than 30 kg, Yunpeng found himself unable to
move anything except his head, but this did not make him give up his dream of
holding an exhibition of his work. He kept painting with a brush held in his
mouth and finally held his first exhibition in May 2002.</P>
      <P>Zhang Yuncheng, who also has suffered from muscular dystrophy since the age of
3, lost his ability to walk at 16 but in 2000, at the age of just 20, completed
his 170,000-character book If I Were to Walk for Three Days after four years of
painstaking work on the keyboard using only his two index fingers -- the only
mobile parts of his body.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, one week after the book was published, both of his index fingers
also became paralyzed. Even this setback, however, did not cause him to lose his
faith in himself and he continued writing with his right middle finger -- now
his only mobile part.</P>
      <P>His story deeply moved Ma Yun, the founder of Alibaba.com -- the world's largest
online B2B marketplace -- who in turn offered to help him open an online shop of
his own, from which he now sells his books, as well as paintings done by his
brother.</P>
      <P>The income from the shop, which can reach up to 200,000 Chinese yuan (US$29,295)
per year, is donated to other disadvantaged people.</P>
      <P>The Chou Ta-Kuan Cultural and Educational Foundation selected 12 winners this
year from among 1,929 candidates recommended from various sectors around the
world for their excellence in their fields.</P>
      <P>Cheng Mei-chu, a painter from Taiwan's outlying island of Penghu who was born
with ichthyosis -- a severe genetic skin disorder -- was selected as a recipient
for her pursuit of the arts with passion and dedication, despite her physical
disability.</P>
      <P>Another recipient was Daniel Gottlieb, an American practicing psychologist and
family therapist who has been paralyzed from the neck down since an automobile
accident in 1979. He was chosen for his devotion to family and his career while
overcoming paralysis.</P>
      <P>Also on the list is Wang Hung-yi, who founded a one-man band and now performs
overseas using recycled musical instruments.</P>
      <P>Another of the recipients is Mark Inglis,  a New Zealand mountaineer who lost
both legs after he was trapped in an ice cave for two weeks due to a storm in
1982. Inglis was recognized for his dedication to helping physically
disadvantaged individuals. He also won a silver medal at the 2000 Paralympics in
the 1,000 meter cycling individual time trial.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-yun, a third grader from an elementary school in Taichung who became
completely blind as a result of a brain tumor, was honored for the 132 paintings
he has completed.</P>
      <P>The foundation was founded in 1997 by the parents of Chou Ta-kuan in memory of
their son, who died of cancer. Ta-kuan was a young poet who is remembered today
for his great enthusiasm for life.</P>
      <P>Keen to promote Ta-kuan's love for life, his parents have sponsored various
activities  and programs via the foundation, including the presentation of the
Fervent Global Love of Life awards.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Price of red-label rice wine slashed significantly</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
06/01/09  18:23:24
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-operated Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTL) cut the price of its
rice wine from NT$180 to NT$50 per 600 cc bottle, with immediate effect Monday.</P>
      <P>TTL Chairman Wei Po-tao announced the price cut Monday at a news conference  in
Hsinchu City,  northern Taiwan,  following  the Legislature's revision of the
Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act in April to allow for the price adjustment.</P>
      <P>The alcohol content of the rice wine will be reduced from 22 percent to 19.5
percent, which is what it was prior to 2002 when the government monopoly was
lifted and the price was raised to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO)
regulations, Wei said.</P>
      <P>The popular red label wine, used mainly for cooking, will also be repackaged to
let consumers know that it is the same product that was made by Taiwan Tobacco
and Wine Monopoly Board (TTWMB) , the predecessor of TTL, Wei added.</P>
      <P>The name of the liquor will be changed back from "Tao Hsiang red-label rice
wine" to "TTWMB red-label rice wine, " as it was labeled before TTWMB was
converted into an enterprise to end the government's monopoly on liquor and
tobacco products.</P>
      <P>Wei said that with effect from Monday, consumers can either return unopened
bottles of red-label wine or exchange them for the new product.</P>
      <P>Each bottle of 22 percent proof rice wine that was bought for NT$180 can be
exchanged for four bottles of the new product, once consumers pay the NT$20
price difference on the exchange, according to TTL.</P>
      <P>TTWMB red-label rice wine was known to be an indispensable item in Taiwanese
kitchens in the years before Taiwan was forced to impose a high tax on the
locally distilled liquor to comply with WTO regulations.</P>
      <P>The tax pushed the price of red-label rice wine up from NT$22 to NT$180 per
bottle. The hike not only drew public protests, but also resulted in a slump in
the sale of the liquor.</P>
      <P>According to TTL statistics, when the rice wine was being sold at NT$22 per 600
cc bottle, the average sale volume was some 2.1 billion bottles a year.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan joined the WTO in 2002 and was forced to impose the liquor tax on
the wine, the sale volume fell to 7.5 million bottles a year. The latest price
cut is expected to push up sales, TTL said.</P>
      <P>Rice wine is a vital ingredient in Chinese dishes such as "sesame oil chicken"
and "ginger duck."</P>

      <P>Some 130 jobless and retired workers Monday signed up for an agriculture plan in
Daliao township sponsored by the Kaohsiung county government and the local
farmers association, with Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing wishing them good
luck and prosperous business.</P>
      <P>The county government kicked off the program by leasing 45 hectares of farmland
from the state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. -- 25 hectares in Daliao township and 20
hectares in Ciaotou township -- to be farmed by the program participants as part
of the county's efforts to tackle unemployment.</P>
      <P>Each of the 199 new farmers -- 127 from Daliao township and 72 from Ciaotou
township -- was provided with 0.2-hectares of land and a start-up subsidy of
NT$2,000 (US$62) per year from the county.</P>
      <P>Seventy-seven of the new farmers in Daliao township and 54 in Ciaotou township
have opted for organic farming, with the land in Ciaotou township set to be
opened in late June.</P>
      <P>The individuals chosen to participate in the farming initiative will also have
their land rental fees paid for by the local government for three years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the two townships' farmers associations will set up task forces to
help them sell and market their produce.</P>
      <P>The plan, originally aimed at drawing 90 jobless workers into farming, received
greater interest than the county had expected, with 300 people applying to take
part in the program when it was announced in March.</P>
      <P>With more applicants than positions available, priority has been given to those
who lost their jobs involuntarily, Yang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>State-own Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTLC) formally entered the
convenience store battle in Taiwan Monday by launching 13 stores islandwide
simultaneously.</P>
      <P>TTLC Chairman Wei Po-tao officiated a ceremony at a TTLC flagship convenience
store located in the northern Hsinchu City to symbolize the opening of all the
13 stores.</P>
      <P>Tending the store, Wei rolled up his sleeves to tout TTLC products -- cold draft
beer in particular -- which is hotly welcome during summer time.</P>
      <P>Wei said many people have said that they know the TTLC has a wide range of
products, but do not know where to buy them, prompting his company to open its
own convenience store franchise to build its own retailing networks, with long
business hours from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-tzer offered his congratulations to Wei personally,
expressing his wishes that TTLC's retailing business will continue to boom after
it cut the price of the hotly-sought-after Red Label rice wine from the previous
NT$180 per bottle to NT$50 from Monday and having launched a series of
promotional campaigns in both Taiwan and mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number trying to quit smoking up after surcharge hike</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the doubling of the health and welfare surcharge on tobacco products
starting Monday, a northern Taiwan hospital under the Department of Health (DOH)
reported that the number of outpatients seeking to quit smoking has increased by
around one-third over the past two months.</P>
      <P>Tsai Fu-hsun, director of the department of thoracic medicine at Keelung
Hospital, also said that as of the end of May, the number of new patients
wanting to quit had exceeded 100, which he said "represents a marked increase
compared to the just-over 80 recorded for the whole of last year."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that success in quitting depends largely on the individual's
will, adding that only about 20 people in his hospital anti-smoking program have
successfully kicked the habit over the past six months.</P>
      <P>He urged smokers to "just say no" to cigarettes, especially now that the
surcharge has increased from the previous NT$10 per pack to NT$20 per pack.</P>
      <P>The 100 percent surcharge increase has raised the average per-pack price for
cigarettes to between NT$55 and NT$70 per pack, depending on the brand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to encourage more people to join the quitters, the Mackay Memorial
Hospital and the John Tung Foundation, a non-profit anti-tobacco organization,
started a "quit smoking week" activity in which celebrities were invited to
share their experiences of kicking the habit.</P>
      <P>Entertainer-turned-lifetime anti-smoking volunteer Sun Yueh said he had his
first puff at the age of 16 and was a smoker for 37 years before kicking the
habit 25 years ago because he "didn't want to affect others."</P>
      <P>Another spokesperson for the foundation, Chen Shu-li, said smoking is like a
chronic disease and that "it is really hard to kick the habit by force of
willpower alone without professional guidance."</P>

    <HEADLINE>A king of the herring caught on seas off Taitung</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A king of the herring caused a small stir at a fishing port in Taitung County,
southeastern Taiwan, Monday, with some local people fearing it was a sign of
earthquake.</P>
      <P>A local fishing boat,  the "Sheng Fa Tsai, " caught the rarely-seen fish the
previous night in waters off Chenggong Township. The Sheng Fa Tsai skipper, Tung
Chin-hsing, said his crew spotted the fish at around 11 p.m. after seeing a long
silver strip glittering on the water.</P>
      <P>Before gathering it on to the boat, the crew did not recognize it is a king of
the herring, a ribbon-shaped oarfish with a silver-gray glittery body and a red
dorsal that can stretch up to 11 meters long.</P>
      <P>It is known locally as the "king of dragons, " said to rule the sea in Taiwanese
folks tales, Tung said.</P>
      <P>"It was the first time I've seen the legendary king of dragons over the past 30
years," Tung said.</P>
      <P>The 5-meter-long oarfish drew plenty of attention while on display at Singang
fishing port, but no vendors dared to handle the fish due to the legends
surrounding the obscure creature.</P>
      <P>Some said it is an "earthquake fish" related to the occurrence of an earthquake.
Some believed catching the "king of dragons" might trigger a disaster while
others said it might bring good luck.</P>
      <P>A vendor, nicknamed A Chin, rejected Tung's request to sell it as food, saying
she "does not know whether the fish good or bad. It is better not to touch it."</P>
      <P>Eventually, a buyer took it home for NT$2,000, saying he planned to prepare it
for display in his home.</P>
      <P>Ho Yuan-hsin, a researcher at the Eastern Marine Biology Research Center run by
the Council of Agriculture, said the fish, also called a "messenger from the
dragon palace" by local people, usually lives at a depth of between 50 meters
and 250 meters.</P>
      <P>It might have been sick, or something unusual had happened on the seabed that
caused the fish to linger at the surface of the sea, Ho said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>13th swine flu case confirmed in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan confirmed another imported case of swine flu Monday, bringing to 13 the
total number of individuals who have been infected with the influenza A(H1N1)
virus in the country.</P>
      <P>The 13th patient was an 8-year-old Canadian girl of Asian descent who was sent
to a local hospital for treatment and quarantine after arriving at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport early Sunday, the Central Epidemics Command
Centers (CECC) said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The girl showed flu symptoms, such as fever, coughing and vomiting, after
arriving at the Vancouver airport May 29 from Montreal along with her parents.</P>
      <P>The family of three were bound for Cambodia via Taiwan. The girl's parents
informed flight attendants of her health condition after boarding the plane in
Vancouver, and the three wore face masks throughout the flight to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local quarantine officials conducted an on-board health check on the girl after
the plane landed at the Taoyuan airport. The girl was then sent to Taoyuan
General Hospital for treatment and quarantine.</P>
      <P>Laboratory tests confirmed Monday that the girl was infected with the H1N1
virus, making her the 13th confirmed swine flu patient detected in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the girl's mother also showed symptoms of coughing, she was also required to
be tested, but it eventually confirmed she was free of the H1N1 virus, the CECC
statement said.</P>
      <P>Based on an investigation into the girl's case, she likely contracted the virus
in Montreal. As she and her parents all wore masks throughout the flight,  local
quarantine  officials said individuals sitting near them had a low probability
of contracting the disease.</P>
      <P>Thirty of the 54 passengers who were seated in the three rows in front of and
behind the girl flew on to other destinations after a transit stop in Taiwan,
the CECC said, adding that it has informed the World Health Organization (WHO)
and other relevant countries of the case through the International Health
Regulations-affiliated reporting system.</P>
      <P>The center has also notified Canada's representative office of the case, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>As for the 24 passengers who have entered Taiwan, the statement said, they
should contact local health bureaus or the epidemic center through the 1922
phone line to seek medical counseling if they develop flu-like symptoms in the
coming week.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far recorded only one indigenous swine flu case and the remaining
are all imported patients. Most of the confirmed patients have since recovered.</P>
      <P>As the country has not reported any new domestic infections since May 25, the
epidemic center lowered the alert level to the second stage of yellow, which
denotes that there are no community infections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of 2 p.m. Friday, 53 countries had officially reported 15,510 cases of
A(H1N1) infection, including 99 deaths, according to the latest World Health
Organization report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President's diplomatic truce with China triggers war of words at home</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/01/09  17:26:48</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prior to President Ma Ying-jeou's departure from Taipei May 26 for his Central
America tour of Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, mainly  to attend  the  June
1 inauguration  of El Salvador president-elect Mauricio Funes, he said at the
airport that the journey proves that his advocacy of pragmatic diplomacy is
working.</P>
      <P>Although he did not elaborate, observers knew Ma was referring to Taiwan's
relations with El Salvador.</P>
      <P>After Funes won the presidency, fears had mounted in Taiwan that he might follow
through on hints during his election campaign that he would switch diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The potential crisis was quickly defused, however, by China giving an apparent
cold shoulder to Funes, paving the way for Ma's trip.</P>
      <P>The pillar of Ma's pragmatic diplomacy, which he calls a "modus vivendi"
strategy, is seeking a diplomatic truce with China.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration has never actually disclosed how it plans to define the
concept of a diplomatic truce with Beijing, much less strike an agreement on the
issue.</P>
      <P>The president has simply made public appeals that neither side should woo the
allies of the other.</P>
      <P>The war for diplomatic turf between Taiwan and China began as an extension of
the civil war between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese communists after the
gunfire ended in 1949, with each side vying for recognition as the only
legitimate regime governing China.</P>
      <P>It raged even harder after the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power in
Taiwan in 2000 after a half-century of KMT rule.</P>
      <P>Alarmed by the DPP's support for Taiwan independence, Beijing stepped up its
efforts to quash Taiwan's international presence and any hints alluding to the
country's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>In its eight years in power, the DPP administration under former President Chen
Shui-bian lost nine allies to China while gaining three, resulting in an overall
decline in the number of its allies from 29 in 2000 to 23 in 2008.</P>
      <P>The fight for diplomatic allies provided shrewd politicians in small, mainly
impoverished Third World states with a chance to play one side against the
other, alternating their loyalties between the two countries to squeeze maximum
gains for their countries or themselves.</P>
      <P>This led to a bidding war, with both sides pitching for the other side's allies
with open wallets --  the notorious  "checkbook diplomacy" -- which only went to
prove in a number of cases that money could not buy long-term friendship.</P>
      <P>For example, the South Pacific island nation of Nauru switched its recognition
from Taipei to Beijing in 2002 and then back to Taipei in 2005; Chad, a cash-
strapped African state, restored official ties with Taiwan in 1997 and severed
them in 2006.</P>
      <P>Senegal, also in Africa, resumed ties with Taipei in 1996 and terminated them in
2005.</P>
      <P>But the game grew increasingly costly. When Beijing persuaded Costa Rica to
abandon Taipei in 2007, it pledged to purchase US$300 million-worth of the
Central American country's bonds and to provide US$130 million in direct aid.</P>
      <P>This diplomatic maneuvering involved a large amount of backroom deals and gave
corrupt  local and foreign  politicians  ample opportunity to grease their
palms.</P>
      <P>Notable examples include two middlemen who made away with US$30 million provided
by Taiwan's Foreign Ministry after saying they could help the country forge ties
with Papua New Guinea in 2006.</P>
      <P>In another glaring example that came to light, former National Security Council
Secretary-General Chiou I-ren was accused of seizing US$500,000 from a US$1.6
million secret fund set aside by the Foreign Ministry  to win the friendship  of
World  Trade Organization Director-General Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand in
2003.</P>
      <P>Rather than enhancing the country's international profile, these secret
diplomatic dealings tarnished Taiwan's global image.</P>
      <P>Ma vowed to get rid of this practice. On May 28, during his visit to Belize, Ma
lambasted Chen's administration for engaging in checkbook diplomacy and made a
pitch for his own administration's pragmatic diplomacy.</P>
      <P>He also said that any diplomatic breakthrough for Taiwan depends on a
breakthrough in its ties with China.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco Ou believes Beijing will buy Ma's idea of a
diplomatic truce -- if, that is, China puts a premium on its ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"With more than 170 allies around the world, Beijing can hardly increase its
prestige by winning one or two of Taiwan's allies, but doing so would cost China
goodwill from Taiwan," Ou said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has not agreed to a truce with Taiwan, but it has refrained from luring
away any of Taiwan's 23 remaining allies since Ma's inauguration in May 2008.</P>
      <P>In addition to El Salvador, Paraguay and Panama have also flirted with the idea
of changing their allegiances but have not followed through on their threats,
possibly after also being given the brush-off by China.</P>
      <P>In Ou's view, Beijing should not only forsake any attempt to lure away Taiwan's
allies but should also reject any countries who approach Beijing seeking
recognition, or it will inevitably harm Taipei's trust in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ma's diplomatic truce with Beijing has also given Taipei more leeway in dealing
with its allies' requests for aid, according to Ou.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan is willing to help its allies, our ambassadors are now capable
of asking their host countries to come up with detailed plans and practical
requests for grants," the minister said.</P>
      <P>However, Jaushieh Joseph Wu, Taipei's representative to the United States in
former President Chen Shui-bian's administration, dismissed Ma's vow to give up
checkbook diplomacy as mere rhetoric.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the diplomatic budget of Ma's administration is no less than
that of the preceding government, and in fact it has spent even more in some
countries.</P>
      <P>"Although Ma's administration hasn't lost any allies thus far, it is traveling
on a dangerous path, as it has given up any efforts to win new friends out of
deference to what it calls its `truce' with China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Beijing is going to great lengths to improve its ties with Taiwan's
allies, which could easily be converted into official ties, Wu warned.</P>
      <P>"Forsaking efforts to foster friendship with non-allies and pinning all hopes on
Beijing is very dangerous," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taipei's  "abrupt  reconciliation"  with  Beijing  has also embarrassed those of
its allies that have spoken out for Taiwan in its struggle with China, and has
baffled other countries that are friendly to Taiwan, Wu claimed.</P>
      <P>"They don't know whether they should continue to extend their support to
Taiwan," Wu further speculated.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng,  a political  science professor  at Soochow University in Taipei,
said the success of Ma's diplomatic truce should not be judged simply by the
number of allies the country can count.</P>
      <P>"What matters is Taiwan's substantive ties with countries that do not officially
recognize it," Lo said.</P>
      <P>"By this measurement, President Ma can hardly claim any progress, because his
leading ministers are still forbidden from setting foot in countries that are
allies of Beijing -- which contrasts sharply with Ma's encouragement to Taiwan's
allies to forge unofficial ties with Beijing," he said.</P>
      <P>"It doesn't take a diplomat to see who gets the upper hand from the truce," he
went on.</P>
      <P>Lo took particular issue with Ma's criticism of his predecessor's checkbook
diplomacy in Belize, describing his comments as unbecoming for a head of state.</P>
      <P>"It is more a piece of campaign rhetoric than a diplomatic statement, suggesting
that our allies have got a lot of mileage out of Taiwan's dispute with China, "
he said.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen how long Ma's truce with China will last. What is obvious,
however, is that the war of words surrounding it will not end any time soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WiMAX, touch-screen technology expected to dominate IT fair</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>WiMAX and touch-screen technology, as well as netbooks, will take the spotlight
at this year's Computex Taipei, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) and Taipei Computer Association (TCA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Touch screen technology is focus of this year's exhibition, with the launch of
many new products by international and local flagship companies expected," said
Walter Yeh, executive vice president of the semi-official trade promotion body
TAITRA at an international press conference on the eve of the opening of
Computex Taipei 2009.</P>
      <P>In addition to Intel and AMD, which will present new products at the Asia's
biggest IT exhibition, companies such as HP, Dell and Hitachi will also take
part and will hold seminars on ICT development trends, he added.</P>
      <P>Li Chang, deputy secretary-general of the TCA, said at the news conference that
he thinks netbooks smaller than 11 inches and long-life laptop batteries will
also draw heavy attention at this year's exhibition.</P>
      <P>"Everyone can foresee the growth of these products in the future," he said.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, among the new products to be launched at Computex Taipei,
those likely to attract the most attention include AMD Phenom X4 Quad-Core 9550,
Intel 4G and 8G Fiber Channel SFP, IBM Thinkpad X41T Series, Notebook Intel N270
and Eee PC S101/S101H.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TAITRA noted that the theme of this year's Computex Taipei is "WiMAX
on the Move, " under which three features -- innovation, leap and launch -- will
be presented. The products featured will be the WiMAX embedded notebook and
netbook, the smallest and lightest WiMAX mobile Internet device, the unique
WiMAX TV dongle, and other epochal WiMAX products, he added.</P>
      <P>Visitors to Computex Taipei 2009 will have access to various WiMAX products on
display at over 700 booths, TAITRA said. The four main Taiwan WiMAX operators --
VMAX, Vee Telecom, TATUNG InfoComm, and Global Mobile -- will demonstrate
several WiMAX application services to the public for the first time, it added.</P>
      <P>This year's exhibition, co-hosted by the TAITRA and TCA, is scheduled for June
2-6 and is expected to attract some 35,000 international buyers and 1,700
exhibitors and generate US$20 billion in business.</P>
      <P>For the first time, the show will include a pavilion dedicated to some 100
companies from China, including big brands such as the IT company Tsinghua
Tongfang and the consumer electronics manufacturer MALATA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japan hopes to step up academic cooperation with Taiwan: envoy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official from Japan's representative office in Taipei expressed hope Monday
that academic cooperation between Taiwan and Japan can be boosted in the latter
part of the year.</P>
      <P>Naohiro  Tsutsumi,  director-general  of  the  Interchange Association's Taipei
Office,  also said the association, which represents Japanese interests in
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, will carefully plan on how to
strengthen such cooperation with Taiwan's academic sector.</P>
      <P>He cited several possible options, including the opening of classes on Japan
studies, exchanges of students and invitations to Japanese professors to conduct
classes in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Through such academic cooperation, we hope Taiwanese undergrad or graduate
students will be more interested in studying Japanese politics, history and
culture," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan and Japan have already made progress in a number of
programs in the first part of this year.</P>
      <P>They include an agreement earlier this year to open regular flights between
Taipei's Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which Tsutsumi said will
boost bilateral tourism revenues and facilitate exchanges after it is launched
this winter.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the Japanese government invited 100 senior high school
students to visit Japan in February, while Taiwan in return will invite 100
Japanese senior high school students to visit Taiwan this December.</P>
      <P>"We hope the two sides will continue to promote exchanges of youngsters based on
this solid basis," he said.</P>
      <P>In related news that same day, applications for working holiday visas for Japan
kicked off Monday,  which will offer a rare opportunity for young people from
both sides to learn about the culture of their respective host countries, he
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that he himself made his first overseas trip to Taiwan at the age of
26. Although it was only a five-day stay, he went on, it left him with a
"wonderful and impressive experience."</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association is accepting applications for working holiday visas
at its Taipei and Kaohsiung offices June 1-5 and Nov. 2-6.</P>
      <P>Japan is the third country to reach such a working holiday agreement with Taiwan
after Australia and New Zealand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung has inaugurated a walking trail with
poems inscribed on tablets for people to learn about and enjoy poetry while they
are out taking a stroll, a local official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The trail, inaugurated Sunday amid dance and music, is 517 meters in length and
built along the west side of the famous scenic attraction Lotus Pond in the
city's Zuoying District.</P>
      <P>The 15 poems, all written by local poets, will be displayed on the trail, said
Lin Mei-hsiou, an official in the city government's Bureau of Cultural Affairs,
which is in charge of the trail project.</P>
      <P>Altogether, 15 writers' poems will be displayed on the trail, which begins with
four lines of late writer Yeh Shih-tao's prose titled "No Land, No Literature."</P>
      <P>Born in Tainan City in 1925, Yeh was a pioneering Taiwanese writer who
specialized in the literary history of Taiwan. Yeh moved to Kaohsiung in 1965
and died there in 2008.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, other writers whose poems are exhibited on the trail all live
in the city, including two prose writers and 12 poets, such as Wang Chi-chiang,
Cheng Chiung-ming, Chung Shun-wen, Lee Chang-hsien, Chin Lien, Tzeng Kuei-hai,
and Lu Han-hsiou.</P>
      <P>Lin said the poems were selected by a committee convened by the city government,
and are inscribed on tablets made of granite or steel in different shapes to fit
in with the scenic views around the pond.</P>
      <P>Inscriptions of all the poetic writings, as well as the words at the entrance
and exit of the trail, are written in calligraphy by Chung Chao-cheng, an 84
-year-old writer well-known for his literary critiques. Like Yeh, Chung is also
famous in Taiwan's literary circle.</P>
      <P>The city government spent nearly two years on the project, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said at the inauguration ceremony that the trail
dedicated to literature is as meaningful as trails glorifying philosophers in
foreign countries.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that there will be more venues of this kind in the future
to showcase Kaohsiung residents' love for literature and to present literature
with vitality and power by local writers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Disabled Chinese brothers to be cited in Taipei</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two physically challenged brothers from a rural backwater in northern China were
expected to arrive in Taipei Monday to be cited by a local charity for their
"fervent love of life."</P>
      <P>Twenty-nine-year-old Zhang Yunpeng, who paints using his mouth, and his younger
brother Zhang Yuncheng, 28, a published author who types with just one finger,
are scheduled to join 10 other recipients of the 2009 Fervent Global Love of
Life Awards to be presented by the Chou Ta-Kuan Cultural and Educational
Foundation June 4.</P>
      <P>Zhang Yunpeng, who has suffered from incurable muscular dystrophy since the age
of 3, is expected to do a Chinese brush painting at a gathering to be held
Tuesday using his mouth, the only part of his body he can still control.</P>
      <P>The painting will be presented to Terry Gou, CEO and founder of Taiwan's Hon Hai
Group, the world's largest contract maker of consumer electronics by revenue,
according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>Gou, who made the Zhangs acquaintance two years ago when he was invited to
present the "10 Most Touching Figures in China" Award in Hangzhou, decided to
invite the Zhangs for dinner Monday to his business empire's headquarters
located in Tucheng, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Gou has also offered the brothers a suite he owns in Beijing so they can get
away from their shabby home in China's  remote Heilongjiang Province.</P>
      <P>Paralyzed from the neck down, Yunpeng started to use his mouth to hold brushes
to paint at 23. But even his mouth became dysfunctional a year later, and a year
after that, the strength in his neck slipped away, while he also suffered
analosis, causing his skeleton to deform.</P>
      <P>With his weight dropping to less than 30 kg, Yunpeng found himself unable to
move anything except his head, but this did not make him give up his dream of
holding an exhibition of his work. He kept painting with a brush held in his
mouth and finally held his first exhibition in May 2002.</P>
      <P>Zhang Yuncheng, who also has suffered from muscular dystrophy since the age of
3, lost his ability to walk at 16 but in 2000, at the age of just 20, completed
his 170,000-character book If I Were to Walk for Three Days after four years of
painstaking work on the keyboard using only his two index fingers -- the only
mobile parts of his body.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, one week after the book was published, both of his index fingers
also became paralyzed. Even this setback, however, did not cause him to lose his
faith in himself and he continued writing with his right middle finger -- now
his only mobile part.</P>
      <P>His story deeply moved Ma Yun, the founder of Alibaba.com -- the world's largest
online B2B marketplace -- who in turn offered to help him open an online shop of
his own, from which he now sells his books, as well as paintings done by his
brother.</P>
      <P>The income from the shop, which can reach up to 200,000 Chinese yuan (US$29,295)
per year, is donated to other disadvantaged people.</P>
      <P>The Chou Ta-Kuan Cultural and Educational Foundation selected 12 winners this
year from among 1,929 candidates recommended from various sectors around the
world for their excellence in their fields.</P>
      <P>Cheng Mei-chu, a painter from Taiwan's outlying island of Penghu who was born
with ichthyosis -- a severe genetic skin disorder -- was selected as a recipient
for her pursuit of the arts with passion and dedication, despite her physical
disability.</P>
      <P>Another recipient was Daniel Gottlieb, an American practicing psychologist and
family therapist who has been paralyzed from the neck down since an automobile
accident in 1979. He was chosen for his devotion to family and his career while
overcoming paralysis.</P>
      <P>Also on the list is Wang Hung-yi, who founded a one-man band and now performs
overseas using recycled musical instruments.</P>
      <P>Another of the recipients is Mark Inglis,  a New Zealand mountaineer who lost
both legs after he was trapped in an ice cave for two weeks due to a storm in
1982. Inglis was recognized for his dedication to helping physically
disadvantaged individuals. He also won a silver medal at the 2000 Paralympics in
the 1,000 meter cycling individual time trial.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-yun, a third grader from an elementary school in Taichung who became
completely blind as a result of a brain tumor, was honored for the 132 paintings
he has completed.</P>
      <P>The foundation was founded in 1997 by the parents of Chou Ta-kuan in memory of
their son, who died of cancer. Ta-kuan was a young poet who is remembered today
for his great enthusiasm for life.</P>
      <P>Keen to promote Ta-kuan's love for life, his parents have sponsored various
activities  and programs via the foundation, including the presentation of the
Fervent Global Love of Life awards.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Price of red-label rice wine slashed significantly</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
06/01/09  18:23:24
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-operated Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTL) cut the price of its
rice wine from NT$180 to NT$50 per 600 cc bottle, with immediate effect Monday.</P>
      <P>TTL Chairman Wei Po-tao announced the price cut Monday at a news conference  in
Hsinchu City,  northern Taiwan,  following  the Legislature's revision of the
Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act in April to allow for the price adjustment.</P>
      <P>The alcohol content of the rice wine will be reduced from 22 percent to 19.5
percent, which is what it was prior to 2002 when the government monopoly was
lifted and the price was raised to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO)
regulations, Wei said.</P>
      <P>The popular red label wine, used mainly for cooking, will also be repackaged to
let consumers know that it is the same product that was made by Taiwan Tobacco
and Wine Monopoly Board (TTWMB) , the predecessor of TTL, Wei added.</P>
      <P>The name of the liquor will be changed back from "Tao Hsiang red-label rice
wine" to "TTWMB red-label rice wine, " as it was labeled before TTWMB was
converted into an enterprise to end the government's monopoly on liquor and
tobacco products.</P>
      <P>Wei said that with effect from Monday, consumers can either return unopened
bottles of red-label wine or exchange them for the new product.</P>
      <P>Each bottle of 22 percent proof rice wine that was bought for NT$180 can be
exchanged for four bottles of the new product, once consumers pay the NT$20
price difference on the exchange, according to TTL.</P>
      <P>TTWMB red-label rice wine was known to be an indispensable item in Taiwanese
kitchens in the years before Taiwan was forced to impose a high tax on the
locally distilled liquor to comply with WTO regulations.</P>
      <P>The tax pushed the price of red-label rice wine up from NT$22 to NT$180 per
bottle. The hike not only drew public protests, but also resulted in a slump in
the sale of the liquor.</P>
      <P>According to TTL statistics, when the rice wine was being sold at NT$22 per 600
cc bottle, the average sale volume was some 2.1 billion bottles a year.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan joined the WTO in 2002 and was forced to impose the liquor tax on
the wine, the sale volume fell to 7.5 million bottles a year. The latest price
cut is expected to push up sales, TTL said.</P>
      <P>Rice wine is a vital ingredient in Chinese dishes such as "sesame oil chicken"
and "ginger duck."</P>

to a low of 6,892.27.</P>
      <P>A total of 7.42 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$201.85
billion (US$6.23 billion) , posting a drop of NT$21.69 billion from the previous
trading day.</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories apart from construction issues gained ground,

      <P>Foreign investors bought NT$14.83 billion-worth of shares.</P>
      <P>Automobile stocks outperformed the overall market, with Yulon Motor rising by
its 7 percent daily maximum limit because of its development of an abandoned
factory site into a residential and commercial complex expected to be finalized
at the end of this year, according to an analyst.</P>
      <P>Shares in electronics stocks were boosted by the upcoming WiMAX Taipei 2009 and
the Computex Taipei 2009 and the visit to Taiwan by a 77-member trade delegation
from China, the analyst said.</P>
      <P>The analyst predicted selling pressure as the TAIEX hovers between 7,000 and
7,100 unless there is some good news to buoy the market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 130 jobless and retired workers Monday signed up for an agriculture plan in
Daliao township sponsored by the Kaohsiung county government and the local
farmers association, with Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing wishing them good
luck and prosperous business.</P>
      <P>The county government kicked off the program by leasing 45 hectares of farmland
from the state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. -- 25 hectares in Daliao township and 20
hectares in Ciaotou township -- to be farmed by the program participants as part
of the county's efforts to tackle unemployment.</P>
      <P>Each of the 199 new farmers -- 127 from Daliao township and 72 from Ciaotou
township -- was provided with 0.2-hectares of land and a start-up subsidy of
NT$2,000 (US$62) per year from the county.</P>
      <P>Seventy-seven of the new farmers in Daliao township and 54 in Ciaotou township
have opted for organic farming, with the land in Ciaotou township set to be
opened in late June.</P>
      <P>The individuals chosen to participate in the farming initiative will also have
their land rental fees paid for by the local government for three years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the two townships' farmers associations will set up task forces to
help them sell and market their produce.</P>
      <P>The plan, originally aimed at drawing 90 jobless workers into farming, received
greater interest than the county had expected, with 300 people applying to take
part in the program when it was announced in March.</P>
      <P>With more applicants than positions available, priority has been given to those
who lost their jobs involuntarily, Yang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>State-own Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTLC) formally entered the
convenience store battle in Taiwan Monday by launching 13 stores islandwide
simultaneously.</P>
      <P>TTLC Chairman Wei Po-tao officiated a ceremony at a TTLC flagship convenience
store located in the northern Hsinchu City to symbolize the opening of all the
13 stores.</P>
      <P>Tending the store, Wei rolled up his sleeves to tout TTLC products -- cold draft
beer in particular -- which is hotly welcome during summer time.</P>
      <P>Wei said many people have said that they know the TTLC has a wide range of
products, but do not know where to buy them, prompting his company to open its
own convenience store franchise to build its own retailing networks, with long
business hours from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-tzer offered his congratulations to Wei personally,
expressing his wishes that TTLC's retailing business will continue to boom after
it cut the price of the hotly-sought-after Red Label rice wine from the previous
NT$180 per bottle to NT$50 from Monday and having launched a series of
promotional campaigns in both Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>TTLC management said that if business at the first 13 stores prove to be good,
more stores will be opened in all 319 cities and townships around the country.</P>
      <P>In addition to alcoholic and tobacco products, TTLC has also researched and
produced health foods and cosmetics in recent years. Other lines of products
that it has produced include soft drinks and cleansing products.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the doubling of the health and welfare surcharge on tobacco products
starting Monday, a northern Taiwan hospital under the Department of Health (DOH)
reported that the number of outpatients seeking to quit smoking has increased by
around one-third over the past two months.</P>
      <P>Tsai Fu-hsun, director of the department of thoracic medicine at Keelung
Hospital, also said that as of the end of May, the number of new patients
wanting to quit had exceeded 100, which he said "represents a marked increase
compared to the just-over 80 recorded for the whole of last year."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that success in quitting depends largely on the individual's
will, adding that only about 20 people in his hospital anti-smoking program have
successfully kicked the habit over the past six months.</P>
      <P>He urged smokers to "just say no" to cigarettes, especially now that the
surcharge has increased from the previous NT$10 per pack to NT$20 per pack.</P>
      <P>The 100 percent surcharge increase has raised the average per-pack price for
cigarettes to between NT$55 and NT$70 per pack, depending on the brand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to encourage more people to join the quitters, the Mackay Memorial
Hospital and the John Tung Foundation, a non-profit anti-tobacco organization,
started a "quit smoking week" activity in which celebrities were invited to
share their experiences of kicking the habit.</P>
      <P>Entertainer-turned-lifetime anti-smoking volunteer Sun Yueh said he had his
first puff at the age of 16 and was a smoker for 37 years before kicking the
habit 25 years ago because he "didn't want to affect others."</P>
      <P>Another spokesperson for the foundation, Chen Shu-li, said smoking is like a
chronic disease and that "it is really hard to kick the habit by force of
willpower alone without professional guidance."</P>

      <P>A king of the herring caused a small stir at a fishing port in Taitung County,
southeastern Taiwan, Monday, with some local people fearing it was a sign of
earthquake.</P>
      <P>A local fishing boat,  the "Sheng Fa Tsai, " caught the rarely-seen fish the
previous night in waters off Chenggong Township. The Sheng Fa Tsai skipper, Tung
Chin-hsing, said his crew spotted the fish at around 11 p.m. after seeing a long
silver strip glittering on the water.</P>
      <P>Before gathering it on to the boat, the crew did not recognize it is a king of
the herring, a ribbon-shaped oarfish with a silver-gray glittery body and a red
dorsal that can stretch up to 11 meters long.</P>
      <P>It is known locally as the "king of dragons, " said to rule the sea in Taiwanese
folks tales, Tung said.</P>
      <P>"It was the first time I've seen the legendary king of dragons over the past 30
years," Tung said.</P>
      <P>The 5-meter-long oarfish drew plenty of attention while on display at Singang
fishing port, but no vendors dared to handle the fish due to the legends
surrounding the obscure creature.</P>
      <P>Some said it is an "earthquake fish" related to the occurrence of an earthquake.
Some believed catching the "king of dragons" might trigger a disaster while
others said it might bring good luck.</P>
      <P>A vendor, nicknamed A Chin, rejected Tung's request to sell it as food, saying
she "does not know whether the fish good or bad. It is better not to touch it."</P>
      <P>Eventually, a buyer took it home for NT$2,000, saying he planned to prepare it
for display in his home.</P>
      <P>Ho Yuan-hsin, a researcher at the Eastern Marine Biology Research Center run by
the Council of Agriculture, said the fish, also called a "messenger from the
dragon palace" by local people, usually lives at a depth of between 50 meters
and 250 meters.</P>
      <P>It might have been sick, or something unusual had happened on the seabed that
caused the fish to linger at the surface of the sea, Ho said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan confirmed another imported case of swine flu Monday, bringing to 13 the
total number of individuals who have been infected with the influenza A(H1N1)
virus in the country.</P>
      <P>The 13th patient was an 8-year-old Canadian girl of Asian descent who was sent
to a local hospital for treatment and quarantine after arriving at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport early Sunday, the Central Epidemics Command
Centers (CECC) said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The girl showed flu symptoms, such as fever, coughing and vomiting, after
arriving at the Vancouver airport May 29 from Montreal along with her parents.</P>
      <P>The family of three were bound for Cambodia via Taiwan. The girl's parents
informed flight attendants of her health condition after boarding the plane in
Vancouver, and the three wore face masks throughout the flight to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local quarantine officials conducted an on-board health check on the girl after
the plane landed at the Taoyuan airport. The girl was then sent to Taoyuan
General Hospital for treatment and quarantine.</P>
      <P>Laboratory tests confirmed Monday that the girl was infected with the H1N1
virus, making her the 13th confirmed swine flu patient detected in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the girl's mother also showed symptoms of coughing, she was also required to
be tested, but it eventually confirmed she was free of the H1N1 virus, the CECC
statement said.</P>
      <P>Based on an investigation into the girl's case, she likely contracted the virus
in Montreal. As she and her parents all wore masks throughout the flight,  local

of contracting the disease.</P>
      <P>Thirty of the 54 passengers who were seated in the three rows in front of and
behind the girl flew on to other destinations after a transit stop in Taiwan,
the CECC said, adding that it has informed the World Health Organization (WHO)
and other relevant countries of the case through the International Health
Regulations-affiliated reporting system.</P>
      <P>The center has also notified Canada's representative office of the case, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>As for the 24 passengers who have entered Taiwan, the statement said, they
should contact local health bureaus or the epidemic center through the 1922
phone line to seek medical counseling if they develop flu-like symptoms in the
coming week.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far recorded only one indigenous swine flu case and the remaining
are all imported patients. Most of the confirmed patients have since recovered.</P>
      <P>As the country has not reported any new domestic infections since May 25, the
epidemic center lowered the alert level to the second stage of yellow, which
denotes that there are no community infections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of 2 p.m. Friday, 53 countries had officially reported 15,510 cases of
A(H1N1) infection, including 99 deaths, according to the latest World Health
Organization report.</P>

      <P>Taiwan confirmed another imported case of swine flu Monday, bringing to 13 the
total number of individuals who have been infected with the influenza A(H1N1)
virus in the country.</P>
      <P>The 13th patient was an 8-year-old Canadian girl of Asian descent who was sent
to a local hospital for treatment and quarantine after arriving at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport early Sunday, the Central Epidemics Command
Centers (CECC) said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The girl showed flu symptoms, such as fever, coughing and vomiting, after
arriving at the Vancouver airport May 29 from Montreal along with her parents.</P>
      <P>The family of three were bound for Cambodia via Taiwan. The girl's parents
informed flight attendants of her health condition after boarding the plane in
Vancouver, and the three wore face masks throughout the flight to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local quarantine officials conducted an on-board health check on the girl after
the plane landed at the Taoyuan airport. The girl was then sent to Taoyuan
General Hospital for treatment and quarantine.</P>
      <P>Laboratory tests confirmed Monday that the girl was infected with the H1N1
virus, making her the 13th confirmed swine flu patient detected in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the girl's mother also showed symptoms of coughing, she was also required to
be tested, but it eventually confirmed she was free of the H1N1 virus, the CECC
statement said.</P>
      <P>Based on an investigation into the girl's case, she likely contracted the virus
in Montreal. As she and her parents all wore masks throughout the flight,  local
quarantine  officials said individuals sitting near them had a low probability
of contracting the disease.</P>
      <P>Thirty of the 54 passengers who were seated in the three rows in front of and

    <HEADLINE>President meets U.S. secretary of state in El Salvador</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou met U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
briefly in El Salvador Sunday in a rare informal encounter between high-level
officials of the two countries.</P>
      <P>The two met at a state banquet hosted by outgoing Salvadoran President Antonio
Saca, during which Ma shared a table with Clinton.</P>
      <P>Clinton took the initiative to greet and shake hands with Ma, and Ma addressed
the secretary of state as "Mrs. Clinton" and introduced himself as "the
president of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma told Clinton that Taiwan is very grateful to the United States for the
assistance it has provided in improving relations between Taiwan and China and
that Taiwan will try its best to maintain stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The governments of Taiwan and the United States have maintained no formal
contact since diplomatic ties were severed in 1979.</P>
      <P>A similar informal meeting took place in Panama in 2003 between then President
Chen Shui-bian and then U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell during the Central
American nation's 100th National Day celebration.</P>
      <P>Ma is in El Salvador to attend the inauguration of Salvadoran President-elect
Mauricio Funes. This is the final leg of his three-nation Central American tour
that has also taken him to Belize and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Also in El Salvador Monday, Ma held talks with Honduras President Manuel Zelaya,
during which the two leaders reached an agreement on a proposal for Taiwan to
provide hydraulic power technology  to Honduras.</P>
      <P>The proposal, which was put forth by Zelaya, was intended as a substitude for a
previous plan put forward by the state-owned Taiwan Power Company to invest more
than US$360 million in helping Honduras build a hydraulic power plant, said
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>The investment project was canceled after Taiwan's legislature nixed its
funding.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming, the power company,
which lost more than NT$100 billion (US$3.09 billion) in 2008, cannot carry out
the investment project without the budget.</P>
      <P>Providing technical assistance to Honduras instead will be a good solution for
the company, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Ma and Zelaya also reached consensus on proposals for Taiwan
to help Honduras develop clean energy and boost community development.</P>
      <P>Ma is expected to visit Honduras during his next Central American trip slated
for late June, when he will also go to Panama to attend the inauguration of
Panamanian President-elect Ricardo Martinelli.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese high-tech companies once again became  the focal point of the global
ICT (information  and communications technology) industry on Tuesday with the
opening of the 29th Computex Taipei, and the show's strong participation
indicated that the local ICT sector is as dynamic as ever.</P>
      <P>With a total of 1,712 manufacturers from 21 countries and regions occupying
4,498 booths this year and tens of thousands of telecom professional and buyers
expected to attend, the scope of this year's Computex maintained previous levels
despite the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Most of the big names in the industry are exhibiting at this week's show,
including AMD, Arctic Cooling,  Hitachi,  Intel, Microsoft, Marvel, Acer, ASUS,
and Gigabyte.</P>
      <P>Computex Taipei is one of the world's most influential ICT exhibitions. The fact
that it has remained unaffected by the current global economic downturn
underscores the competitiveness of Taiwan's ICT industry, said Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan at the opening ceremony hosted by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
and Development Council (TAITRA) and the Taipei Computer Association (TCA).</P>
      <P>Noting that the global economic slump has shaken up industries, Liu said
Taiwan's ICT can be expected to rebound strongly when the global economy
recovers due to its technical experience, comprehensive global supply chain, and
the core competitiveness and flexibility of its manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang said on the same occasion that Taiwan's ICT
industry occupies a position of competitiveness in the global supply chain that
is irreplaceable.</P>
      <P>To back his point, he cited a report published by the Economist in September
2008 that said the global competitiveness of Taiwan's IT industry had climbed to
second in the world, trailing only that of the United States.</P>
      <P>In  addition,  18 Taiwanese  companies  were  included  in BusinessWeek's 2008
InfoTech 100 IT industry survey, the highest among all Asian countries, ahead of
China (6), Japan (5), and South Korea (4), he added.</P>
      <P>The harsher the economic conditions, the clearer one can witness the vitality
and strong spirit of Taiwan's ICT industry, said TCA Chairman J.T. Wang.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, this year, Computex Taipei will show the whole world the
local sector's hard-earned accomplishments, with WiMAX, netbooks and lightweight
energy-saving notebooks the year's three most notable innovations.</P>
      <P>Building on last year's successful "Computex catch the WiMAX" theme, the theme
of this year's show isWiMAX on the MOVE, which symbolizes the launch of
commercial WiMAX operations in Taiwan, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, with the full support of the Taipei City government and the Industrial
Development Bureau, WiMAX services will be available on the Taipei MRT's Muzha
Line, allowing the public to try out the world's first mobile broadband wireless
access network on a rapid transit system, he added.</P>
      <P>As for the new wave of super lightweight notebooks introduced by Taiwanese
vendors, Wang said they have up to eight hours of battery power but are priced
in the same price range as average notebooks, leading global notebook suppliers
to follow this new standard.</P>
      <P>Co-hosted by the TAITRA and TCA, Computex Taipei 2009 will run until June 6 and
is expected to attract some 35,000 international buyers and generate US$20
billion in business.</P>

      <P>Netbooks incorporated with advance features such as touch screens, long-life
batteries and WiMAX compatibility are one of the biggest draws at this year's
Computex Taipei, which opened Tuesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Several flagship local and international companies such as ASUSTek Computer
Inc., AMD, Microsoft, and Intel all showcased their latest products and
applications of their innovations.</P>
      <P>"Originated in Taiwan, the netbook started as an underdog product but has become
a real phenomenon sweeping through the global market. It demonstrates Taiwan's
ability to stake out a leading position and create product trends in the ICT
industry," said J.T. Wang, chairman of the Taipei Computer Association, at the
opening ceremony of the show.</P>
      <P>WiMAX and super lightweight notebooks with long battery power will also dominate
this year's show, he added.</P>
      <P>Zing Chen, deputy director of Asus' second channel product planning and
management department, told the Central News Agency that her company's latest
Eee PC Seashell and Eee PC Touch netbooks illustrate the ability of local
vendors to stay ahead of the innovation curve.</P>
      <P>Launched two weeks ago, the Eee PC Seashell is the lightest and slimmest 10-inch
netbook available on the market, weighing only 1.1 kilograms and measuring 1
inch in thickness, Chen said. The in-built battery can last for up to six hours
or for 10.5 hours for its all-day-computing series.</P>
      <P>"ASUS is also the first company to launch netbooks using touch-screen
technology, with many innovative supporting software features developed by the
company," she added.</P>
      <P>The single-touch Eee PC Touch is scheduled to go onto the market at the end of
June, but a new model with a multitouch-enabled tablet will also be introduced
later this year to coincide with the launch of Microsoft's Windows 7, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In line with this year's theme of "WiMAX on the MOVE" at Computex Taipei, Intel
demonstrated its latest application of WiMAX modules in laptops, which enable
swift access to the Internet wherever the computer is.</P>
      <P>As to netbooks, Stanley Huang, director of Advanced Technical Sales and Services
at Intel Asia Pacific, said in a press release that compactness and conserving
power are the focal point for netbook development.</P>
      <P>"Following the success of the Atom CPU that is specially designed for netbooks,
Intel will introduce the next generation Atom CPU, featuring higher
integration," he said.</P>
      <P>Regarding the new generation notebook PC operation platform, Consumer Ultra Low
Voltage or CULV, Huang stressed that it is for ultra slim notebooks equipped
with full features, and highlights low power consumption and long battery life.</P>
      <P>Computex Taipei 2009 -- Asia's biggest IT exhibition and the world's leading ICT
procurement platform -- will run until June 6 and is expected to attract 35,000
international buyers and generate US$20 billion in business.</P>

Japan's methods, it was found that 100 percent of the 20 melamine-resin
tableware products tested released melamine when filled with anything hot.</P>
      <P>The raw material used in melamine  tableware  is melamine formaldehyde resin and
the quality of the finished product depends on the temperature and pressure used
during the manufacturing process, said Wang Cheng-huei, deputy director of the
Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection.</P>
      <P>If the process is properly controlled, there should be no concerns over the
release of melamine or formaldehyde from tableware made of thermosetting resin,
he added.</P>
      <P>Melamine is often used in the manufacture of kitchen utensils and tableware, but
such containers are not safe for microwave use, as they absorb the oven's
radiation and heat up.</P>
      <P>Wang said the bureau will work to obtain more information about Japan's sanitary
testing methods for the products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a standard for the maximum amount of formaldehyde released from food
containers, but not one for melamine tableware, Wang said. If the DOH, which
regulates the food container industry, establishes a melamine standard, the
bureau will make an effort to include it in the national standards, he added.</P>
      <P>In the recent experiment, all tableware made of melamine resin tested positive
for melamine release, Wang said, warning that consumers  should not use such
products for hot food or for microwaving.</P>
      <P>Wang also urged melamine tableware manufacturers to clearly label their products
with the warning that they "should not be used in microwave ovens, " and to
remind consumers not to use them for hot food or drink.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation on Monday released the results of the tests which
showed that all 20 sample products contained excessive amounts of melamine.
Eight of the tested samples, or 40 percent, carried no warning against microwave
use, the foundation observed.</P>
      <P>The tests found that the amount of melamine released from the 20 items varied
from 0.04 mg per liter to 20 mg per liter. The foundation recommended  that
consumers use stainless steel and ceramics as alternatives to melamine resin
tableware.</P>
      <P>Melamine is a highly toxic substance commonly used in the manufacture of plastic
resins for household use, such as counter tops, plates and bowls.</P>

    <HEADLINE>103 adult Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins remain in west coast:survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
06/02/09  16:38:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>Only 103 adult Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins remained along the west coast of
Taiwan, according to the results of a survey conducted between 2006 and 2008.</P>
      <P>Chou Lien-siang, a professor at National Taiwan University's Department of Life
Science in northern Taiwan, released the survey results  at  a forum  held  by
the  Environmental  Protection Administration Monday.</P>
      <P>The forum was held to discuss the possible impact of development in western
Taiwan on the population of humpback dolphins, which are also called Chinese
white dolphins.</P>
      <P>The survey covered an area in west-central Taiwan between Taichung County and
Chiayi County and was commissioned by Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) , which is
involved in several development projects in western Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The dolphins, which are white in color and endemic to Taiwan, were discovered in
2002 off the west coast of the island and were listed last August as critically
endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</P>
      <P>Chou said that in 45 survey trips at sea, she observed 54 groups of 259 Chinese
white dolphins, including babies, and in another 45 observation trips on land,
she spotted 20 groups of 59 dolphins.</P>
      <P>The dolphins seen from the land were only 20 to 800 meters from the shore, Chou
said, adding that the dolphins prefer shallow coastal waters where biodiversity
conservation  is often threatened by economic development.</P>
      <P>Chou said she also issued 51 questionnaires on Chinese white dolphin sightings
to fishermen and vendors at three fishing ports in the survey area, and results
showed that all the respondents had seen the dolphins, which usually appear in
the area all year round.</P>
      <P>Chou called on the public to pay attention to conservation of the dolphins,
which have an extremely low birth rate and a life span of 30-40 years.</P>
      <P>It takes 10-12 years for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins to reach sexual
maturity, and a female dolphin gives birth once every 3-4 years, Chou explained.</P>
      <P>Chou said the noise level at construction sites should be measured and bubble
screens should be used to protect the dolphins from noise hazards during such
development projects.</P>
      <P>The humpback dolphins are called "Matsu Fish" by local fishermen because they
usually are seen most frequently between March and April off the western coast
when the northeasterly monsoons weaken and the birthday of Matsu, the Chinese
goddess of the Sea, is celebrated in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei department stores post strong sales over four-day holiday</HEADLINE>

      <P>Most department stores in Taipei reported stronger sales during the just-
concluded  four-day Dragon Boat Festival holiday than during the same holiday
last year, seen by retailers as a sign of improving consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's biggest department store chain, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, had sales of
NT$960 million (US$29.7 million) around Taiwan from May 28 to May 31, an
increase of 90 percent compared to the same period in 2008.</P>
      <P>Shin Kong Mitsukoshi's biggest competitor, Sogo Co., said Tuesday that excluding
its newly-opened department store in Taipei's Tianmu district, its other three
stores in the city saw sales grow 20 percent compared to the June 5-8 Dragon
Boat Festival period last year.</P>
      <P>As for the Tianmu store that was opened May 22, sales over the four-day period
exceeded the company's target by 60 percent, store executives said.</P>
      <P>Other department stores in the upscale Tianmu neighborhood also performed well,
according to analysis done by department store operators in the area.</P>
      <P>Sales at Shin Kong Mitsukoshi's outlet over the last two days of the holiday (a
weekend) rose 15 percent compared to average weekends, and the Dayeh Takashima
department store saw sales rise by 5 percent.</P>
      <P>The analysis found that the new Sogo department store did not have as big of a
negative effect on the competition as had been anticipated because most people
who shopped at the new store were consumers from outside the district.</P>
      <P>The Miramar department store in Dazhi was the only major retailer to post lower
numbers during the long holiday, with sales 2 percent lower over the holiday
weekend than during an average weekend.</P>
      <P>Industry insiders attributed the weak showing to its proximity to the Neihu
Science Park, which has been hit hard by the global economic downturn. Its
location outside the main part of the city also means it relies heavily on
consumers in the area.</P>

      <P>The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) , a major international
telescope project, in which Taiwan is a participant, achieved a major milestone
in late April when faint radio waves emitted by Mars were first collected by two
12- meter diameter ALMA antennas, Taiwan's National Science Council (NSC)
announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ALMA project is an international collaboration among East Asia, Europe, and
North America in cooperation with Chile.</P>
      <P>The ALMA Operations Support Facility, located 5,000 meters above sea level in
the Chilean Atacama desert, is the highest site for ground-based astronomy, Liu
Sheng-yuan, an NSC assistant research fellow and a scientist in the project,
said at a briefing on the project.</P>
      <P>The NSC, in conjunction with Taiwan's top research institute Academia Sinica,
have injected US$32 million in the project, Liu added.</P>
      <P>On April 30, the ALMA research team observed the first fringes--a regular
pattern of alternating strong and weak signals-- by the two ALMA antennas as
Mars moved across the sky. The signals were then processed by state- of-the-art
electronics to turn the two antennas into a single,  high- resolution telescope
system,  called an interferometer, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>ALMA  is the most  ambitious  project  in millimeter  and submillimeter
astronomy which will comprise 66 antennas observing in unison as a single giant
telescope when it is completed in 2012. However, scientific observations will
start from 2011, Liu added.</P>
      <P>The array is expected to resolve distant objects at least five to 10 times
better than the Hubble Space Telescope, which can enable people in Taipei in the
north to observe a one-dollar coin in the southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung, Liu added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices opened high but closed lower slightly Tuesday due to
selling pressure, with the weighted index, the market's key barometer, losing
5.02 points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 6,949.08.</P>
      <P>Following Wall Street's gains overnight and buoyed by a strong showing of Asian
markets and appreciation of the local currency, the local bourse opened at 7,058
and shot to the day's high of 7,084.83, which was also the highest figure so far
this year. It later dropped to a low of 6,899. 98.</P>
      <P>A total of 8.75 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$232.19
billion (US$7.14 billion).</P>
      <P>Three of the eight major stock categories gained ground, with paper and pulp
stocks advancing the most at 1.9 percent. Textile shares rose 1.1 percent, and
machinery and electronics shares surged 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The five other major stock categories  lost ground,  with construction stocks
dropping the most at 2.3 percent. Banking and financial shares lost 1.0 percent,
machinery and electronics shares moved down 0.9 percent, foodstuff shares
dropped 0.6 percent, and plastics and chemicals issues shed 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,255 to 959,  with 140 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Altogether,  the three major institutional investors bought NT$11.44 billion-
worth of shares -- NT$10.54 billion by foreign investors, NT$1.77 billion by
investment trust firms and NT$877 million by securities firms.</P>
      <P>Shares in electronics stocks made a strong showing, boosted by the opening of
WiMAX Taipei 2009 and the Computex Taipei 2009 and the visit to Taiwan by a
77-member trade delegation from China, an analyst said.</P>
      <P>The analyst predicted the market will face some technical resistance because of
profit-taking pressure and the 27.89 percent increase in margin trading volume
in May after the TAIEX index rose above 6,000 points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan confirms 14th case of swine flu</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another imported case of swine flu was confirmed in Taiwan Tuesday, bringing to
14 the total number of individuals who have been infected with the influenza
A(H1N1) virus in the country, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Central Epidemics Command Centers spokesman Shih Wen-yi said the latest victim
was an eight-year-old school boy who returned to Taiwan Sunday from the United
States.</P>
      <P>Shih said on May 29, the boy, who went to Texas last year, developed mild
coughing at the Los Angeles airport on his way home.</P>
      <P>The boy arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport early Sunday. He began
to develop a fever the following day and sought emergency treatment. He was
listed as a case that required investigation. He was confirmed to have been
infected the same night and is still being quarantined for treatment.</P>
      <P>Shih said the boy wore a surgical mask throughout the entire flight. Center
officials estimated that passengers sitting on three rows in front of and behind
the boy, as well as his uncle, who drove to the airport to pick him up, and his
cousin, who had temporarily stayed with the boy, have little risks of being
infected and they only need to monitor their own health.</P>
      <P>But the boy's grandparents, aunt and children from two relatives, all of whom
have stayed long with the boy, "have been given medicine as a preventive
measure," Shih added.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 59 individuals have had close contact with the boy. Among
the 59, eight -- including family members and relatives -- have shown no
symptoms.</P>
      <P>Of the 39 passengers who were on the same flight with the boy and transferred to
other countries, Taiwan has notified related countries through the International
Health Regulations (IHR), an international instrument that is legally binding on
all World Health Organization (WHO) member states.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far recorded only one indigenous swine flu case and the remaining
are all imported patients. Most of the confirmed patients have since recovered.</P>
      <P>As the country has not reported any new domestic infections since May 25, the
epidemic center lowered the alert level to the second stage of yellow, which
denotes that there are no community infections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of 2 p.m Monday, 62 countries have officially reported 17,410 cases of
influenza A(H1N1) infection, including 115 deaths.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scheduled cross-strait flights to begin in July</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 2 (CNA)
06/02/09  18:28:07
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Regular flights between Taiwan and China are set to begin in July in response to
strong market demand, Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  Director-General
Lee Lung-wen announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under an accord inked in April by Taiwan and China that will take effect on June
25, the two sides agreed to expand air links from the current 108 charters to
270 scheduled flights per week, with each side to operate 135, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's two largest carriers, China Airlines and EVA Airways, will each operate
30 scheduled flights to and from destinations in China, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>UNI Airways and Mandarin Airlines will provide 25 weekly two-way flights across
the strait, while TransAsia Airways will operate 24, he said. The remaining one
flight will serve the Taichung-Shenzhen route and will be run by UNI Airways and
Mandarin alternately.</P>
      <P>Among the 19 popular destinations in China, Shanghai will be most heavily served
by the Taiwan carriers, with 28 flights scheduled every week for that Chinese
city, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Nine flights will depart from each of the two airports in northern Taiwan --
Taipei's Songshan Airport and the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport -- and
there will also be two weekly flights from Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan to
Shanghai, he added.</P>
      <P>Other Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shenzhen, will also
be served by 10 two-way cross-strait flights per week, or more, from July, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications announced in late May that Chinese tour
operators who organize charter flights that use airports other the main two in
Taiwan are now eligible for subsidies from the bureau.</P>
      <P>Under a revised tourism incentive program, Chinese travel agents will receive
NT$160,000 (US$4,920) per charter as long as the flight does not use Taipei
City's Songshan Airport or Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and is carrying
at least 100 foreign passengers who are visiting Taiwan for a minimum of two
days.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau officials said that if the charters either take off or land at
one of the two northern airports, or carry between 50 and 100 passengers, the
charter operators will be eligible to smaller subsidies.</P>
      <P>The incentive is designed to expose foreign tourists to parts of the country
outside of the popular northern gateways, including Taiwan's outlying islands,
bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of the current 108 direct charter flights per week between
Taiwan and China use one of the two northern airports, even though a total of
eight local airports have been designated to handle the direct charters.</P>
      <P>Of the 108 direct charters, only four serve the southern port city of Kaohsiung
and two serve Taichung in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau launched the incentive program in May 2005 to encourage
travel agents, primarily in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan and South Korea, to organize
large tour groups to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In light of the rising number of Chinese tourist arrivals since the beginning of
the year, the bureau recently decided to include China in the incentive program
to lure more Chinese visitors to other parts of Taiwan. Taiwan has a daily quota
of 3,000 Chinese tourist arrivals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President downplays 'courtesy encounter' with U.S. secretary of state</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Salvador, El Salvador, June 1 (CNA)
06/02/09  18:46:26

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Monday called his recent exchange with U.S. Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a "courtesy encounter, " as he played down the
significance of the informal chat.</P>
      <P>The two, who were in El Salvador to attend the Salvadoran presidential
inauguration, met Sunday at a state banquet hosted by outgoing President Antonio
Saca, during which Ma shared a table with Clinton.</P>
      <P>The encounter drew much media attention because the governments of Taiwan and
the United States have had no formal contact since diplomatic ties were severed
in 1979, which means that meetings between high-level officials of the two
countries are rare.</P>
      <P>A similar encounter in 2003 in Panama between then President Chen Shui-bian and
then U.S.  Secretary of State Colin Powell was considered by Chen's
administration as a breakthrough in Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue during a casual gathering with Taiwanese media at his
hotel, Ma said he would not play up such "courtesy encounters" as they are very
common in diplomatic settings.</P>
      <P>According to the president, progress in relations between Taiwan and the United
States is unlikely to be achieved through such occasional meetings.</P>
      <P>As to his use of the designation "the president of Taiwan" to introduce himself
to Clinton, Ma explained that the name "Taiwan" is commonly known to represent
"the Republic of China" and is widely used when convenient.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the reference does not change the country's official name or
his status as "the president of the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>On his current Central America visit, Ma said the success of his policy to
improve relations between Taiwan and China and to adopt a moderate, flexible
approach in promoting foreign relations over the past year was validated.</P>
      <P>Ma said he discovered during the visit that Taiwan's allies in the region are in
favor of such a policy, which he added has greatly increased his confidence.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, while Taiwan is working to consolidate its relations with its
diplomatic allies, it does not oppose their attempts to develop unofficial
relations with China that are based mainly on economic and trade activities.</P>
      <P>Pledging to continue Taiwan's aid to its diplomatic allies, Ma said such
assistance will be provided in the form of technical assistance, instead of cash
donations or loans, in order to produce the best results.</P>
      <P>El Salvador is the final leg of Ma's three-nation Central America visit that has
also taken him to Belize and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>He is scheduled to depart El Salvador June 2 and return to Taiwan June 4 via
Seattle after an overnight stopover there.</P>

      <P>Police in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan, released Tuesday an invisible
sticker that carries a set of code numbers that would enable law enforcement
officers to find the owners of lost bicycles.</P>
      <P>The specially-designed sticker with a hidden code can only be revealed with the
use of a special optical device, Yilan police said, adding that the stickers
would not mar the appearance of stylish bicycles.</P>
      <P>The hidden code would interface with the police's data bank where the personal
information of bike owners would be stored, the police explained. If a bike
carrying the invisible sticker is stolen and the police find it, they could
easily identify the owner, based on the hidden code, they said.</P>
      <P>With effect from Tuesday, cyclists with ID cards can ask for the free stickers
at any police station around the county, and at the same time have their bikes
registered as a precaution against theft, the Yilan police said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AmCham urges Taiwan to improve government efficiency</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
06/02/09  19:13:30
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) released its 2009 Taiwan
White Paper Tuesday, in which it praised Taiwan on several breakthrough
achievements of the past year, but cautioned that Taiwan needs to do more to
bolster its competitiveness during a time of unprecedented economic challenges,
especially in improving government efficiencies.</P>
      <P>AmCham Chairman Alan Eusden noted at a news conference that the area where
Taiwan consistently has been weakest is government efficiency, and said that
Taiwan has been losing ground recently, mainly because competing economies are
improving so rapidly.</P>
      <P>"It is the experience of some of our committees that the regulatory bodies that
they deal with often do more to obstruct than to facilitate," Eusden said,
adding that the regulatory process needs to be made more transparent  and to
involve  more  effective consultation with industries.</P>
      <P>"International practices should be adopted instead of inventing unique-to-Taiwan
regulations.  Retraining of civil servants to emphasize service mindedness would
help improve the situation and enable Taiwan to emerge from the recession in
better shape to compete," he added.</P>
      <P>According  to the AmCham,  several examples  of particular frustration were
found in the telecom industry, which has found little opportunity to engage in
meaningful two-way dialogue with commissioners of the National Communications
Commission.</P>
      <P>Also frustrating was the current move to legislate a cap on credit-card interest
rates, which the business organization said would likely hurt rather than help
lower-income consumers and small businesses by shrinking the credit supply.</P>
      <P>Another  area that the AmCham expressed  concern  over is pharmaceutical  and
medical  devices.  It said that given the reimbursement prices from Taiwan's
National Health Insurance system are among the lowest in the world, it would
discourage pharmaceutical companies from launching innovative products that
would enhance Taiwan's healthcare treatment.</P>
      <P>Despite  the above,  AmCham  commended  Taiwan  for making "breakthrough
accomplishments" over the past year that include the start of regular direct
flights between Taiwan and China, the country's accession to the World Trade
Organization's Government Procurement Agreement, and the legislative passage of
the Internet Service Provider bill, which reinforced Taiwan's commitment to
intellectual property rights protection and validating the U.S. decision earlier
this year to remove Taiwan from the Special 301 Watch List.</P>
      <P>Since it was first published in 1996, the AmCham White Paper has served to set
the basic annual agenda for the chamber's meetings with government agencies on a
wide spectrum of economic and business issues.</P>
      <P>Established in 1951, AmCham, which consists of more than 900 individuals
representing more than 500 companies, is the oldest, largest, and the most
active foreign-business organization in Taiwan.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City Government has used meal vouchers to help underprivileged
families weather difficulties amid the global economic downturn, the city
government's Department of Social Welfare said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Department officials said that under the voucher program, underprivileged
families can receive vouchers worth between NT$60 and NT$80 each and use them in
eateries or restaurants that have joined the program.</P>
      <P>The officials said that since the program was launched on a trial basis in
March, it has provided assistance to 639 individual cases, and distributed 5,225
meal vouchers.</P>
      <P>Twenty-nine eateries, cafeterias, beef noodle shops, fast food chain stores, as
well as 28 charity groups have taken part in the program.</P>
      <P>Department commissioner Shih Yu-ling said that the program is made possible
because of the generosity of these eateries and charity groups.</P>
      <P>"The significance of the program is not only to meet the needs of the
underprivileged families, but also to build a more comprehensive social safety

      <P>A department official also said that with the good results of the program, the
department expects it to last until the end of the year, and will not rule out
the possibility of continuing it after that.</P>
      <P>The official said that all 12 administrative districts in Taipei have social
welfare service centers, and the centers will evaluate the situation of needy
families to distribute the meal vouchers.</P>
      <P>"Between six and eight meal vouchers will be distributed each time to these
families," he said, adding that "to make the best use of the limited resources,
families with minors will be given priority."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AmCham encourages Taiwan to sign trade pact with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said Tuesday that Taiwan
should sign the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China to ensure the competitiveness of Taiwan's products in the regional
economic bloc.</P>
      <P>"AmCham welcomes the negotiation of trade agreements with China along the lines
of the ECFA now being discussed. Without it, Taiwan products stand to be
excluded from the China market, as the regional trade bloc centered on the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations expands, " said AmCham Chairman Alan
Eusden at a news conference to release the business organization's annual White
Paper.</P>
      <P>"The chamber regards such an agreement as an economic necessity that should not
be overly politicized," he added.</P>
      <P>Since it was first published in 1996, the AmCham White Paper has served to set
the basic annual agenda for the chamber's meetings with government agencies on a
wide range of economic and business issues.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that an ECFA with China is vital for Taiwan to
avoid marginalization in the region and to help regulate the trade and
investment relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The proposed ECFA would be similar to a free trade agreement between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, told a
cross-strait forum in Xiamen May 17 that China is willing to start ECFA
negotiations with Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to the White Paper, AmCham also hopes to see economic connections
between Taiwan and the United States advance through the scheduling of talks
soon under the bilateral trade and investment framework agreement and by working
toward the start of formal negotiations on a bilateral investment agreement.</P>
      <P>Established in 1951, AmCham, which consists of more than 900 individuals
representing more than 500 companies, is the oldest, largest, and the most
active foreign-business organization in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A group of high school students from the Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) in
Singapore helped farmers in central Taiwan's Nantou County to harvest their
radishes Tuesday as part of an overseas volunteer service program organized by
the school.</P>
      <P>Led by their teachers and assisted by local farmers, the 49 Singaporean
students, braving temperatures of more than 30 degrees Celsius, rolled up their
sleeves and wielded sickles to reap the crop in Puli township.</P>
      <P>Two of the students said the hard work they had to do in the fields made a
strong impression on them -- the first time in their lives they had done such
work -- but said they "had a lot of excitement and fun."</P>
      <P>Living in a city state, Singapore's people seldom have the opportunity to step
on the soil and work in the fields.</P>
      <P>"We hope to help Singaporean teenagers to learn more about the hard work farmers
have to do and to gain a better understanding of Taiwan through this voluntary
service program, " said one of the teachers.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the group visited a tea factory in the county's Shinyi
township to learn about the process of tea-making and everyday life in a
Taiwanese rural village.</P>
      <P>They were also slated to visit a residential community in Mingjian township the
following day, where they were to help clean the streets and trim roadside
trees.</P>
      <P>It is the third year the Singaporean school has sent students to do community

      <P>Israel's representative to Taiwan said Tuesday that the introduction earlier
this year of an Israeli non-invasive treatment for uterine fibroids by a local
medical university hospital has been of great benefit for local women.</P>
      <P>"This serves as a good example of high-tech cooperation between Taiwan and
Israel that has made it possible for Taiwanese women to benefit from Israel's
scientific achievements, " said Raphael Gamzou, head of the Israel Economic and
Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO), in a press release.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has therefore joined Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, South
Korea, Singapore and Israel as advanced countries, according to Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Taipei Medical University Hospital announced at a news conference the previous
day that since the hospital introduced the new ExAblate magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) -guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) incisionless surgery system
for the treatment of uterine fibroids in January, it has received very positive
responses from the 12 patients who have undergone the procedure.</P>
      <P>Manufactured by Israeli medical device company InSightec and approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004, the ExAblate combines MRI to
visualize anatomy, aid in planning the treatment and monitor temperatures and
thermal doses in real time during the treatment.</P>
      <P>This thermal feedback allows the physician to control and adjust the treatment
to ensure that the targeted tumor is fully treated and surrounding tissues
spared. Focused ultrasound is capable of ablating tumors inside the body without
the need for an incision.</P>
      <P>According to the ISECO, the world leading Biomed Israel 2009 that is scheduled
for June 15-17 in Tel-Aviv will feature experts from around to world who will

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is planning two more lines for its mass rapid
transit system, even though the system suffered a massive loss of NT$2.2 billion
last year, a city government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Department of Rapid Transit official said that in order to build the system
into a comprehensive public transport network, the department is planning yellow
and brown lines, which will pass through bustling business, leisure and scenic
districts in the city to end at Chengching Lake in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the existing Red Line and Orange Line intersect each
other at the Formosa Boulevard Station, and said the department believes this
has not made it a comprehensive network.</P>
      <P>It has therefore appropriated  NT$16 million this year to commission a
consultancy company to plan the routes of the two proposed lines to facilitate
the government's efforts to promote the system.</P>
      <P>Both lines will be above ground, in contrast to the two existing lines that
mainly run underground, to save on construction costs.</P>
      <P>The yellow line, which will start at a major shopping mall at the heart of the
Kaohsiung, will be 14.3 km and will cost an estimated NT$11.5 billion.</P>
      <P>The brown line will start from a wharf near Kaohsiung Harbor and end at
Chengching Lake, a distance of 11.29 km. Its price tag is estimated at around
NT$9 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, expansion plans for the existing two lines have been completed and
submitted to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications for review.</P>
      <P>The Red Line will be extended 9.8 km to Kaohsiung Science Park, while the Orange
Line will be extended 14.04 km to neighboring Pingtung City, for a combined
projected cost of NT$49.9 billion.</P>
      <P>The north-south Red Line and east-west Orange Line were inaugurated in March and
September last year, respectively. Since their launch, system's finances have
taken a heavy hit because of low passenger volume.</P>
      <P>In an effort to reduce the financial shortfall, the company has planned to
increase passenger volume by 30 percent to 150,000 and to cut operating costs by
10 percent.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT was constructed on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis at a
total cost of NT$181.3 billion and covers a total of 42.7 km.</P>

various government services about which they were questioned and 67.7 percent
said they found the efficiency of government services to be adequate.</P>
      <P>By service category, eight fields received an approval rating of over 85
percent, with identification card replacement topping the list at 92.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Mass rapid transit services came second, winning acclaim from 88.7 percent of

Down syndrome who was born into a severely dysfunctional family, a local charity

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan confirms 14th case of swine flu</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Another imported case of swine flu was confirmed in Taiwan Tuesday, bringing to
14 the total number of individuals who have been infected with the influenza
A(H1N1) virus in the country, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Central Epidemics Command Centers spokesman Shih Wen-yi said the latest victim
was an eight-year-old school boy who returned to Taiwan Sunday from the United
States.</P>
      <P>Shih said on May 29, the boy, who went to Texas last year, developed mild
coughing at the Los Angeles airport on his way home.</P>
      <P>The boy arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport early Sunday. He began
to develop a fever the following day and sought emergency treatment. He was
listed as a case that required investigation. He was confirmed to have been
infected the same night and is still being quarantined for treatment.</P>
      <P>Shih said the boy wore a surgical mask throughout the entire flight. Center
officials estimated that passengers sitting on three rows in front of and behind
the boy, as well as his uncle, who drove to the airport to pick him up, and his
cousin, who had temporarily stayed with the boy, have little risks of being
infected and they only need to monitor their own health.</P>
      <P>But the boy's grandparents, aunt and children from two relatives, all of whom
have stayed long with the boy, "have been given medicine as a preventive
measure," Shih added.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 59 individuals have had close contact with the boy. Among
the 59, eight -- including family members and relatives -- have shown no
symptoms.</P>
      <P>Of the 39 passengers who were on the same flight with the boy and transferred to
other countries, Taiwan has notified related countries through the International
Health Regulations (IHR), an international instrument that is legally binding on
all World Health Organization (WHO) member states.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far recorded only one indigenous swine flu case and the remaining
are all imported patients. Most of the confirmed patients have since recovered.</P>
      <P>As the country has not reported any new domestic infections since May 25, the
epidemic center lowered the alert level to the second stage of yellow, which
denotes that there are no community infections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of 2 p.m Monday, 62 countries have officially reported 17,410 cases of
influenza A(H1N1) infection, including 115 deaths.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Regular flights between Taiwan and China are set to begin in July in response to
strong market demand, Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  Director-General
Lee Lung-wen announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under an accord inked in April by Taiwan and China that will take effect on June
25, the two sides agreed to expand air links from the current 108 charters to
270 scheduled flights per week, with each side to operate 135, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's two largest carriers, China Airlines and EVA Airways, will each operate
30 scheduled flights to and from destinations in China, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>UNI Airways and Mandarin Airlines will provide 25 weekly two-way flights across
the strait, while TransAsia Airways will operate 24, he said. The remaining one
flight will serve the Taichung-Shenzhen route and will be run by UNI Airways and
Mandarin alternately.</P>
      <P>Among the 19 popular destinations in China, Shanghai will be most heavily served
by the Taiwan carriers, with 28 flights scheduled every week for that Chinese
city, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Nine flights will depart from each of the two airports in northern Taiwan --
Taipei's Songshan Airport and the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport -- and
there will also be two weekly flights from Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan to
Shanghai, he added.</P>
      <P>Other Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shenzhen, will also
be served by 10 two-way cross-strait flights per week, or more, from July, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications announced in late May that Chinese tour
operators who organize charter flights that use airports other the main two in
Taiwan are now eligible for subsidies from the bureau.</P>
      <P>Under a revised tourism incentive program, Chinese travel agents will receive
NT$160,000 (US$4,920) per charter as long as the flight does not use Taipei
City's Songshan Airport or Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and is carrying
at least 100 foreign passengers who are visiting Taiwan for a minimum of two
days.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau officials said that if the charters either take off or land at
one of the two northern airports, or carry between 50 and 100 passengers, the
charter operators will be eligible to smaller subsidies.</P>
      <P>The incentive is designed to expose foreign tourists to parts of the country
outside of the popular northern gateways, including Taiwan's outlying islands,
bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of the current 108 direct charter flights per week between
Taiwan and China use one of the two northern airports, even though a total of
eight local airports have been designated to handle the direct charters.</P>
      <P>Of the 108 direct charters, only four serve the southern port city of Kaohsiung
and two serve Taichung in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau launched the incentive program in May 2005 to encourage
travel agents, primarily in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan and South Korea, to organize
large tour groups to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In light of the rising number of Chinese tourist arrivals since the beginning of
the year, the bureau recently decided to include China in the incentive program
to lure more Chinese visitors to other parts of Taiwan. Taiwan has a daily quota
of 3,000 Chinese tourist arrivals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President downplays 'courtesy encounter' with U.S. secretary of state</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Salvador, El Salvador, June 1 (CNA)
06/02/09  18:46:26
(By Huang Jui-hung and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Monday called his recent exchange with U.S. Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a "courtesy encounter, " as he played down the
significance of the informal chat.</P>
      <P>The two, who were in El Salvador to attend the Salvadoran presidential
inauguration, met Sunday at a state banquet hosted by outgoing President Antonio
Saca, during which Ma shared a table with Clinton.</P>
      <P>The encounter drew much media attention because the governments of Taiwan and
the United States have had no formal contact since diplomatic ties were severed
in 1979, which means that meetings between high-level officials of the two
countries are rare.</P>
      <P>A similar encounter in 2003 in Panama between then President Chen Shui-bian and
then U.S.  Secretary of State Colin Powell was considered by Chen's
administration as a breakthrough in Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue during a casual gathering with Taiwanese media at his
hotel, Ma said he would not play up such "courtesy encounters" as they are very
common in diplomatic settings.</P>
      <P>According to the president, progress in relations between Taiwan and the United
States is unlikely to be achieved through such occasional meetings.</P>
      <P>As to his use of the designation "the president of Taiwan" to introduce himself
to Clinton, Ma explained that the name "Taiwan" is commonly known to represent
"the Republic of China" and is widely used when convenient.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the reference does not change the country's official name or
his status as "the president of the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>On his current Central America visit, Ma said the success of his policy to
improve relations between Taiwan and China and to adopt a moderate, flexible
approach in promoting foreign relations over the past year was validated.</P>
      <P>Ma said he discovered during the visit that Taiwan's allies in the region are in
favor of such a policy, which he added has greatly increased his confidence.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, while Taiwan is working to consolidate its relations with its
diplomatic allies, it does not oppose their attempts to develop unofficial
relations with China that are based mainly on economic and trade activities.</P>
      <P>Pledging to continue Taiwan's aid to its diplomatic allies, Ma said such
assistance will be provided in the form of technical assistance, instead of cash
donations or loans, in order to produce the best results.</P>
      <P>El Salvador is the final leg of Ma's three-nation Central America visit that has
also taken him to Belize and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>He is scheduled to depart El Salvador June 2 and return to Taiwan June 4 via
Seattle after an overnight stopover there.</P>

      <P>Police in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan, released Tuesday an invisible
sticker that carries a set of code numbers that would enable law enforcement
officers to find the owners of lost bicycles.</P>
      <P>The specially-designed sticker with a hidden code can only be revealed with the
use of a special optical device, Yilan police said, adding that the stickers
would not mar the appearance of stylish bicycles.</P>
      <P>The hidden code would interface with the police's data bank where the personal
information of bike owners would be stored, the police explained. If a bike

    <HEADLINE>AmCham urges Taiwan to improve government efficiency</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) released its 2009 Taiwan
White Paper Tuesday, in which it praised Taiwan on several breakthrough
achievements of the past year, but cautioned that Taiwan needs to do more to
bolster its competitiveness during a time of unprecedented economic challenges,
especially in improving government efficiencies.</P>
      <P>AmCham Chairman Alan Eusden noted at a news conference that the area where
Taiwan consistently has been weakest is government efficiency, and said that
Taiwan has been losing ground recently, mainly because competing economies are
improving so rapidly.</P>
      <P>"It is the experience of some of our committees that the regulatory bodies that
they deal with often do more to obstruct than to facilitate," Eusden said,
adding that the regulatory process needs to be made more transparent  and to
involve  more  effective consultation with industries.</P>
      <P>"International practices should be adopted instead of inventing unique-to-Taiwan
regulations.  Retraining of civil servants to emphasize service mindedness would
help improve the situation and enable Taiwan to emerge from the recession in
better shape to compete," he added.</P>
      <P>According  to the AmCham,  several examples  of particular frustration were
found in the telecom industry, which has found little opportunity to engage in
meaningful two-way dialogue with commissioners of the National Communications
Commission.</P>
      <P>Also frustrating was the current move to legislate a cap on credit-card interest
rates, which the business organization said would likely hurt rather than help
lower-income consumers and small businesses by shrinking the credit supply.</P>
      <P>Another  area that the AmCham expressed  concern  over is pharmaceutical  and
medical  devices.  It said that given the reimbursement prices from Taiwan's
National Health Insurance system are among the lowest in the world, it would
discourage pharmaceutical companies from launching innovative products that
would enhance Taiwan's healthcare treatment.</P>
      <P>Despite  the above,  AmCham  commended  Taiwan  for making "breakthrough
accomplishments" over the past year that include the start of regular direct
flights between Taiwan and China, the country's accession to the World Trade
Organization's Government Procurement Agreement, and the legislative passage of
the Internet Service Provider bill, which reinforced Taiwan's commitment to
intellectual property rights protection and validating the U.S. decision earlier
this year to remove Taiwan from the Special 301 Watch List.</P>
      <P>Since it was first published in 1996, the AmCham White Paper has served to set
the basic annual agenda for the chamber's meetings with government agencies on a
wide spectrum of economic and business issues.</P>
      <P>Established in 1951, AmCham, which consists of more than 900 individuals
representing more than 500 companies, is the oldest, largest, and the most
active foreign-business organization in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City Government has used meal vouchers to help underprivileged
families weather difficulties amid the global economic downturn, the city
government's Department of Social Welfare said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Department officials said that under the voucher program, underprivileged
families can receive vouchers worth between NT$60 and NT$80 each and use them in
eateries or restaurants that have joined the program.</P>
      <P>The officials said that since the program was launched on a trial basis in
March, it has provided assistance to 639 individual cases, and distributed 5,225
meal vouchers.</P>
      <P>Twenty-nine eateries, cafeterias, beef noodle shops, fast food chain stores, as
well as 28 charity groups have taken part in the program.</P>
      <P>Department commissioner Shih Yu-ling said that the program is made possible
because of the generosity of these eateries and charity groups.</P>
      <P>"The significance of the program is not only to meet the needs of the
underprivileged families, but also to build a more comprehensive social safety
network in the community to provide better care to the underprivileged
families," Shih said.</P>
      <P>A department official also said that with the good results of the program, the
department expects it to last until the end of the year, and will not rule out
the possibility of continuing it after that.</P>
      <P>The official said that all 12 administrative districts in Taipei have social
welfare service centers, and the centers will evaluate the situation of needy
families to distribute the meal vouchers.</P>
      <P>"Between six and eight meal vouchers will be distributed each time to these
families," he said, adding that "to make the best use of the limited resources,
families with minors will be given priority."</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said Tuesday that Taiwan
should sign the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China to ensure the competitiveness of Taiwan's products in the regional
economic bloc.</P>
      <P>"AmCham welcomes the negotiation of trade agreements with China along the lines
of the ECFA now being discussed. Without it, Taiwan products stand to be
excluded from the China market, as the regional trade bloc centered on the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations expands, " said AmCham Chairman Alan
Eusden at a news conference to release the business organization's annual White
Paper.</P>
      <P>"The chamber regards such an agreement as an economic necessity that should not
be overly politicized," he added.</P>
      <P>Since it was first published in 1996, the AmCham White Paper has served to set
the basic annual agenda for the chamber's meetings with government agencies on a
wide range of economic and business issues.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that an ECFA with China is vital for Taiwan to
avoid marginalization in the region and to help regulate the trade and
investment relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The proposed ECFA would be similar to a free trade agreement between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, told a
cross-strait forum in Xiamen May 17 that China is willing to start ECFA
negotiations with Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to the White Paper, AmCham also hopes to see economic connections
between Taiwan and the United States advance through the scheduling of talks
soon under the bilateral trade and investment framework agreement and by working
toward the start of formal negotiations on a bilateral investment agreement.</P>
      <P>Established in 1951, AmCham, which consists of more than 900 individuals
representing more than 500 companies, is the oldest, largest, and the most

      <P>A group of high school students from the Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) in
Singapore helped farmers in central Taiwan's Nantou County to harvest their
radishes Tuesday as part of an overseas volunteer service program organized by
the school.</P>
      <P>Led by their teachers and assisted by local farmers, the 49 Singaporean
students, braving temperatures of more than 30 degrees Celsius, rolled up their
sleeves and wielded sickles to reap the crop in Puli township.</P>
      <P>Two of the students said the hard work they had to do in the fields made a
strong impression on them -- the first time in their lives they had done such
work -- but said they "had a lot of excitement and fun."</P>
      <P>Living in a city state, Singapore's people seldom have the opportunity to step
on the soil and work in the fields.</P>
      <P>"We hope to help Singaporean teenagers to learn more about the hard work farmers
have to do and to gain a better understanding of Taiwan through this voluntary
service program, " said one of the teachers.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the group visited a tea factory in the county's Shinyi
township to learn about the process of tea-making and everyday life in a
Taiwanese rural village.</P>
      <P>They were also slated to visit a residential community in Mingjian township the
following day, where they were to help clean the streets and trim roadside
trees.</P>
      <P>It is the third year the Singaporean school has sent students to do community

      <P>Israel's representative to Taiwan said Tuesday that the introduction earlier
this year of an Israeli non-invasive treatment for uterine fibroids by a local
medical university hospital has been of great benefit for local women.</P>
      <P>"This serves as a good example of high-tech cooperation between Taiwan and
Israel that has made it possible for Taiwanese women to benefit from Israel's
scientific achievements, " said Raphael Gamzou, head of the Israel Economic and
Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO), in a press release.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has therefore joined Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, South
Korea, Singapore and Israel as advanced countries, according to Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Taipei Medical University Hospital announced at a news conference the previous
day that since the hospital introduced the new ExAblate magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) -guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) incisionless surgery system
for the treatment of uterine fibroids in January, it has received very positive
responses from the 12 patients who have undergone the procedure.</P>
      <P>Manufactured by Israeli medical device company InSightec and approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004, the ExAblate combines MRI to
visualize anatomy, aid in planning the treatment and monitor temperatures and
thermal doses in real time during the treatment.</P>
      <P>This thermal feedback allows the physician to control and adjust the treatment
to ensure that the targeted tumor is fully treated and surrounding tissues
spared. Focused ultrasound is capable of ablating tumors inside the body without
the need for an incision.</P>
      <P>According to the ISECO, the world leading Biomed Israel 2009 that is scheduled

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is planning two more lines for its mass rapid
transit system, even though the system suffered a massive loss of NT$2.2 billion
last year, a city government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Department of Rapid Transit official said that in order to build the system
into a comprehensive public transport network, the department is planning yellow
and brown lines, which will pass through bustling business, leisure and scenic
districts in the city to end at Chengching Lake in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the existing Red Line and Orange Line intersect each
other at the Formosa Boulevard Station, and said the department believes this
has not made it a comprehensive network.</P>
      <P>It has therefore appropriated  NT$16 million this year to commission a
consultancy company to plan the routes of the two proposed lines to facilitate
the government's efforts to promote the system.</P>
      <P>Both lines will be above ground, in contrast to the two existing lines that
mainly run underground, to save on construction costs.</P>
      <P>The yellow line, which will start at a major shopping mall at the heart of the
Kaohsiung, will be 14.3 km and will cost an estimated NT$11.5 billion.</P>
      <P>The brown line will start from a wharf near Kaohsiung Harbor and end at
Chengching Lake, a distance of 11.29 km. Its price tag is estimated at around
NT$9 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, expansion plans for the existing two lines have been completed and
submitted to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications for review.</P>
      <P>The Red Line will be extended 9.8 km to Kaohsiung Science Park, while the Orange
Line will be extended 14.04 km to neighboring Pingtung City, for a combined
projected cost of NT$49.9 billion.</P>
      <P>The north-south Red Line and east-west Orange Line were inaugurated in March and
September last year, respectively. Since their launch, system's finances have
taken a heavy hit because of low passenger volume.</P>
      <P>In an effort to reduce the financial shortfall, the company has planned to
increase passenger volume by 30 percent to 150,000 and to cut operating costs by
10 percent.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT was constructed on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis at a
total cost of NT$181.3 billion and covers a total of 42.7 km.</P>

      <P>After five years of efforts, the Pingtung county government in southern Taiwan
has finally found a new home in the United States for a 7-year-old girl with
Down syndrome who was born into a severely dysfunctional family, a local charity
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The girl, identified as Sunny, will soon settle in the state of Massachusetts
along with her adoptive American parents, " said an executive with the Pingtung
chapter of the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF).</P>
      <P>The charity, which collaborated with the county government to arrange the
child's adoption, organized a farewell party for Sunny Tuesday, the eve of her
departure for her new life in America.</P>
      <P>At the party, Sunny, who has spent most of her life in foster care, met with her
new parents -- James Lindsay, a high school teacher, and his wife Kelly, a
homemaker.</P>
      <P>The couple has three birth children, but have wide experience with physically
and mentally challenged people, including time spent caring for three other
children with Down syndrome, so they were very willing to take Sunny into their
family.</P>
      <P>According to a TFCF executive, Sunny, a first grader at a local elementary
school, has good academic records as she has received government-subsidized
medical treatments over the past few years to increase her intelligence, health
and ability.</P>

1998: A train derails in Lower Saxony, Germany, killing 98 people.

2000: Republic of China Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen visits the offshore islands
of Tungyin and Matsu, his first visit to the frontline islands since he assumed
the post on May 20.

2001: Chang Jung-kung, director of the Kuomintang's Mainland Affairs Department,
says that the 1989 crackdown on the unarmed pro-democracy students in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square is a major factor which has driven the Chinese communists
toward a more open society.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three kinds of errors to which men are
liable when in the presence of their superiors. First, to speak out when one is
not called upon to speak: that is called being forward. Second, to keep silent
when called upon to speak: that is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak
out without taking into consideration the expression in the eyes of the person
spoken to: that is called blindness."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's peacefulness ranking rises to 37th worldwide</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June 2 (CNA)
06/03/09  12:58:47

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was the world's 37th most peaceful country in 2008 -- up six notches from
the previous year -- despite a general decrease in world peacefulness amid the
global economic recession, according to the 2009 Global Peace Index (GPI)
released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Robin Bew,  chief economist of the London-based  Economist Intelligence Unit
(EIU) that calculated the index for the Institute for Economics and Peace,
attributed Taiwan's "moderate progress" to the country's political stability and
increased instability in other countries.</P>
      <P>The improvement in relations between Taiwan and China is another important
reason, Bew said, adding that it would help raise Taiwan's ranking further if
cross-Taiwan Strait ties continued to warm and military tensions continued to
temper.</P>
      <P>Now in its third year, the index defines peace as "the absence of violence" and
looks at 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators of external and internal
measures of peacefulness.</P>
      <P>The results of the 2009 GPI showed that Taiwan score was dragged down by a less
satisfactory performance in the areas of military capability/sophistication,
relations with neighboring countries, ease of access to weapons of minor
destruction and level of organized conflict (internal).</P>
      <P>Overall, the results revealed that as the global economy headed into recession
in 2008, many of the indicators, such as the likelihood of violent
demonstrations and political instability, increased, while others -- such as
respect for human rights -- decreased.</P>
      <P>One such example was Iceland, which lost its title as the world's most peaceful
country after its economy collapsed.</P>
      <P>New Zealand was rated the world's most peaceful country in 2008, followed by
Denmark and Norway (tied for second) , Iceland and Austria.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top 20 were Sweden, Japan, Canada, Finland, Slovenia, Czech
Republic, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Qatar, Switzerland,
Australia and Chile.</P>
      <P>Iraq was again the world's least peaceful country in 2008, remaining in 144th
place. Afghanistan, Somalia, Israel and Sudan were the next least peaceful,
ranking from 143rd to 140th, respectively.</P>
      <P>Three of the world's major military-diplomatic powers continued to register
relatively low rankings, with China at 74th, the United States at 83rd and
Russia at 136th.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Computex Taipei 2009 is serving as a benchmark of global economic recovery and
as a platform to showcase Taiwan's competitiveness to the world, the executive
vice president of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Under the current global economic challenges, this year's Computex Taipei
provides an opportunity to test the temperature of the global economy and serve
as an indicator for its recovery, said TAITRA's Walter Yeh.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of visitors to Computex Taipei 2009 on its opening day
grew one percent to 7,900 compared to the previous year, Yeh said the increase
isvery positive and inspiringand of great importance given the global economic
dislocations that have occurred.</P>
      <P>Computex Taipei -- Asia's biggest IT exhibition and the world's leading ICT
procurement platform -- opened June 2 and will run through June 6. It is
expected to attract 35,000 international buyers and generate US$20 billion in
business.</P>
      <P>In addition to Computex Taipei, Yeh said Taiwan has many other information and
communication technology (ICT) trade shows that have great potential and
competitive advantages in the international arena.</P>
      <P>They include the upcoming Display Taiwan, scheduled for June 10-12, Photovoltaic
Taiwan 2009 from October 7-9, TAITRONICS 2009 and the Taiwan International RFID
Application Show from October 8-11, and Broadband Taiwan 2009 from October
26-28.</P>
      <P>This is why the TAITRA held an international news conference Wednesday along
with industry association representatives to promote thefive starsof Taiwan's
ICT sector to the world, he added.</P>
      <P>"The recipe for success for Taiwan's trade shows over the years is the fact that
TAITRA and industry associations work closely together,Yeh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Artifacts solicited for museum commemorating Taiwan's spy pilots</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hsinchu City Bureau of Culture Affairs is soliciting artifacts for a museum
scheduled to open at the end of November that will honor the Black Bats
Squadron, a group that flew surveillance missions over China decades ago.</P>
      <P>To enrich its collection, the bureau called a news conference Tuesday to appeal
to former Black Bats crew members around the country to donate memorabilia to
the museum.</P>
      <P>Nine former Black Bats were present at the news conference, with some promising
to donate their collection of records on the squadron to the museum.</P>
      <P>Former pilot Lu Wei-heng, 81, who had just returned to Taiwan from Canada,
recalls that at that time, every one in the squadron shared common ideals.</P>
      <P>"It is a great honor to die for the country, " and "I will be either a martyr if
I die, or a hero if I survive, " were typical sentiments reflecting their
outlooks, Lu recalled.</P>
      <P>The Black Bats Squadron, or the 34th Squadron of the ROC Air Force, refers to a
corps of CIA reconnaissance plane pilots based in Taiwan's northern city of
Hsinchu during the Cold War in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>The squadron was established in 1953 for the purpose of assisting the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in gathering military intelligence about
China's secretive military plans.</P>
      <P>The operation was made possible through the collaboration between the then
Chiang Kai-shek government and Western Enterprises Inc. in Taipei, which was set
up by the CIA. Under the cooperation program, the CIA provided aircraft and
necessary equipment, while Taiwan was responsible to provide the pilots.</P>
      <P>The squadron became known as the Black Bats Squadron because it always entered
Chinese air space at night to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance missions.</P>
      <P>Until the squadron's missions came to an end in December 1967, it had conducted
838 reconnaissance flights over China, losing 15 aircraft and 148 crew members,
or two-thirds of the total, in the process. Only 14 dead bodies were recovered.</P>

    <HEADLINE>World's first WiMAX-service MRT trains available in Taipei</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>WiMAX services have recently been made available on Taipei's MRT, allowing the
public to try out the world's first mobile broadband wireless access network on
a rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>In all, eight trains of the Taipei MRT's Muzha Line were equipped with laptops
with built-in WiMAX modules -- which enable swift access to the Internet -- to
be used by passengers while riding the MRT system, said Lin Yu-hui, a project
manager with the Taipei Computer Association, Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The WiMAX MRT services, in line with this year's theme of "WiMAX on the MOVE" at
Computex Taipei, will be available free of charge for one year from Monday, when
the services were launched, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 23-inch LCD monitor is installed on the front and back wall of each
car of the WiMAX service MRT trains to enable passengers to watch various
programs, including some that feature the star residents of Taipei Zoo -- its
two giant pandas and its Formosan black bears.</P>
      <P>"The passengers will also be able to watch live broadcasts of the 21st Summer
Deaflympics Taipei 2009 after September," Lin added.</P>
      <P>The WiMAX MRT services were made possible only with the full support of the
Taipei City government, the Industrial Development Bureau, and private companies
including Acer and MSI, Lin said.</P>
      <P>WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) , a big broadband
wireless application, processes data at a speed three to four times faster than
ADSL, allowing users to download a 2G film in only 20-30 seconds.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of Computex Taipei 2009 Tuesday, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-
bin said it took the city government half a year to prepare for the WiMAX
services on the Muzha Line.</P>
      <P>"The services marked a giant step forward in infrastructure development efforts
to make Taipei City a new wired city," Hau said.</P>
      <P>"Taipei City will take part in the Expo 2010 Shanghai under the name of Wireless
Broadband Model City," Hau noted.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the opening, Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said a new era of WiMAX
commercial operations will soon arrive.</P>
      <P>WiMAX, netbooks and lightweight energy-saving notebooks appear to be the three
major draws at this year's Computex Taipei, which opened Tuesday in Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Have you 'solar paneled' yet?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/03/09  15:52:20</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>On Orchid Island, the latest greeting between hotel operators is "Have you solar
paneled yet? " This is because more and more inns and hostels on the island have
begun to install cost-saving  and environmentally-friendly solar panel water
heating systems, sparking a trend that environmentalists hope will spread across
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Located off Taiwan's southeast coast in the Pacific Ocean, the island famous for
its aboriginal culture and picturesque scenery now has a higher percentage of
hotels with solar panel hot-water systems than any other area in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>So far, 10 out of the 52 hotels and hostels there have installed solar water
heaters.</P>
      <P>Hoteliers on the remote island never imagined they could help limit greenhouse
gases, or save the planet.</P>
      <P>"We don't have much here, except sunshine and the wind, which are endlessly
available," said Chen Tsung-yue, operator of Yueshiuan Hotel.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of the strong and long durations of sunshine on the island,
Chen was one of the first hotel owners to install a solar hot water system on
his hostel's roof, at a cost of about NT$60,000 (US$2,000). "I recouped the
investment in just one year," he said.</P>
      <P>Others on Orchid Island soon followed in his footsteps, and the trend is also
catching on elsewhere in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Central Taiwan's Nantou County has the greatest number of solar-powered water
heaters in the country and the highest percentage of households with solar water
heaters, mainly because almost all the homes rebuilt after the devastating Sept.
21, 1999 earthquake were equipped with solar water heaters.</P>
      <P>Nationwide, 5 percent of all households have installed the devices, ranking
Taiwan third behind Israel and Cyprus, according to the Bureau of Energy under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Part of the reason for Taiwan's relatively high installation rate is that in
2000 the Bureau of Energy initiated a generous program offering incentives and
subsidies to households to install solar water heaters, and 440,000 homes around
the country have put in the devices since then.</P>
      <P>The 5 percent installation rate in Taiwan is equivalent to a savings of 5
million 20-kilogram containers of liquefied gas that are not consumed, or a
reduction of 370,000 tons of carbon dioxide, according to Bureau chief Yeh Hui-
ching.</P>
      <P>"It is expected that there will be 20 percent coverage of all homes with water-
heating solar panels by 2020, with subsidies rising by 50 percent from this
year," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The subsidy now averages NT$10,800 for a heater capable of generating hot water
for a family of 4-5 persons, or solar collectors of an area of 4.8 square
meters, compared to NT$7,200 since 2000.</P>
      <P>Besides hotels and homes, some businesses in Taiwan are also joining the trend.</P>
      <P>The Fugi Educational Park located in south-central Yunlin County -- known for
its exclusively Buddhist education of youths and its devotion to promoting
organic diets and green life -- has been one of the major users of solar water
heaters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chuang Chao-chin, the head of Fugi's construction engineering task
force, the institution has had 11 solar water heating systems installed so far
since the school's inception in 2003 at a total cost of NT$13.75 million.</P>
      <P>"The hot water has been limitlessly available in dormitories for about 1,000
students, faculty and volunteers, " Chuang said. "Even during peak shower hours
in winter time, there was a sufficient supply of hot water without ever hitting
a snag."</P>
      <P>"The investment in the installation was paid back in three years," a contented
Chuang said.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Energy has encouraged the installation of solar water heaters in
part because of geography.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's latitude -- between 22XN and 25XN -- is ideal for transforming the
sun's rays into electricity and has made solar thermal energy the most widely
used form of renewable energy in the country.</P>
      <P>The solar water heating industry has also matured, with every phase of the
installation, from know-how to equipment and materials, developed and sourced
locally, said K. C. Chang, a professor at National Cheng Kung University in the
southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>But whether solar water heaters can become more popular and widely used in
Taiwan depends on climate conditions, population structure, urbanization,
building types and the status of new construction,  according to Chang,  who is
also the principal investigator of NCKU's Research and Development Foundation,
which has been authorized by the bureau to oversee the application of solar
water heaters in the country.</P>
      <P>Chang and his investigative team found that solar water heating systems are
popular in Taiwan's central and southwestern regions, mainly because sunshine
duration there is longer, and there are many more individual bungalows or
terraced houses with flat roofs in the regions than in northern Taiwan, which
make installation easier.</P>
      <P>Solar water heaters have gained less traction in the north because of the many
high-rise residential buildings and relatively lower sunshine duration.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  government  has not done enough to promote  the application of solar
water heating systems on the island, said Chen Fu-yung, chairman of the Taiwan
Solar Energy Development Association, a nonprofit group of solar water heater
installers and dealers.</P>
      <P>Compared to Israel, in which installation of solar water heaters is mandatory,
Germany, where installations grew at an 84 percent rate in 2008, and Spain,
where the installation rate was up 67 percent last year, Taiwan has lagged far
behind, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that during a national energy conference held in April, officials and
specialists devoted a lot of time to the further expansion of wind power
generation and the development of solar photovoltaic energy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is unrealistic, however, to talk about developing wind power generation at
present with each wind turbine unit having to be imported at a cost of NT$100
million.</P>
      <P>"It would only benefit the foreign suppliers and dealers, " he contended.</P>
      <P>"Why doesn't the government pay greater attention to the solar water heating
system sector, whose know-how is mature and related materials available
domestically thanks to Taiwan's well-developed high-tech  industries.  Also,
solar water heating systems are inexpensive compared with wind and photovoltalic
energy, " Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The administration should live up to its promise to have 140,000 more solar
water heating systems installed nationwide in the next four years, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The installation plan should begin in public facilities, such as schools,
prisons, fire departments, police stations, and military establishments --
places with vast spaces and flat roofs that are ideal for solar panels," he
suggested.</P>
      <P>To bolster the popularity of solar water heaters in northern Taiwan,
particularly in the Taipei metropolitan area, the government will also need to
develop new strategies. In eastern Taiwan, it needs to address the problem of
typhoons, which can destroy the roof-top equipment, Chen added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will hold a meeting June 23 to evaluate all
applications by local cities and counties for mergers or upgrades to special
municipalities next year, and the Executive Yuan is expected to make a final
decision by Aug. 4, Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cities and counties that applied for such changes in status will be invited to
give a 20-minute presentation on their plans, Liao said during a meeting with
Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair and Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Su submitted to Liao a petition signed by Tainan County
residents seeking the minister's support for a merger of Tainan city and country
into a special municipality similar to the metropolises of Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Su said Tainan's application has been considered as least likely to succeed
since President Ma Ying-jeou laid out his campaign vision last year to demarcate
Taiwan into three metropolises and 15 counties.</P>
      <P>However,  he urged  that  the  government  reconsider  its redistricting plan
from a historical and cultural perspective, and pointed out that Tainan, the
ancient cultural capital of Taiwan, has a wealth of cultural heritage and
historical sites.</P>
      <P>Su also warned that political conflict will arise if the government fails to
support the planned merger between Tainan city and county but endorses Taipei
County's application for an upgrade to a special municipality.</P>
      <P>The magistrate further asked Liao to guarantee that the Executive Yuan will
announce its decision on the applications before Aug. 4 so as to avoid an impact
on the three-in-one local elections scheduled for Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>In response, Liao gave the assurance that the announcement will be made before
early August.</P>
      <P>On Hsu's question of whether administrative districts will be granted autonomy
even after merging or upgrading, Liao said that has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recently amended Local Government Act, counties or cities
seeking a status upgrade or a merger had to submit their applications to the MOI
by the end of May.</P>
      <P>The MOI has received applications from Taipei county, Taichung city and county,
Taoyuan county, Changhua county, Kaohsiung city and county, Tainan city and
county, and the counties of Yunlin and Chiayi.</P>
      <P>The applications will be submitted to the Executive Yuan at the end of this
month after an initial MOI review, Liao said.</P>

      <P>Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, a prominent member of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , is scheduled to visit China in late June,
on the heels of Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu's ice-breaking visit to the mainland
last month.</P>
      <P>Hsu has filed applications with the National Immigration Agency for approval for
his China visit, which will mainly be a trip to the southeastern Chinese port
city of Xiamen to attend the opening ceremony of the First Strait Cup Sailing
Boat Championship slated for June 28-29.</P>
      <P>About 30 sailing boats of all sizes from both sides are expected to take part in
the sailing competition, which will start at a port in Xiamen June 28 and end in
Tainan City's Anping Port on June 29.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, in her capacity as president of the World Games 2009 Kaohsiung
Organizing Committee, visited Beijing and Shanghai May 21-24 to promote the 2009
World Games, which will be held in Kaohsiung July 16-26, making her the highest-
ranking incumbent DPP official to have set foot in China.</P>
      <P>Speaking about his forthcoming and first visit to the Chinese mainland, Hsu said
Taiwan and China should engage in normal exchanges under the principles of
dignity and equality.</P>
      <P>"The two sides should grasp this juncture of friendly atmosphere to create peace
across the Taiwan Strait. We should be determined on 'good things, ' but should
refrain from doing things that are not conducive to development of mutual
trust," he said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou recently expressed welcome to Chen Chu's visits to China,
and said he hoped to see increased interaction between the DPP and the Chinese
leadership. He said that such interaction will allow Beijing to more clearly
hear voices from Taiwan other than those of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and is
conducive to the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>If the country intends to reach a consensus on major issues pertaining to the
people's well-being and interests, it should not depend solely on the KMT's
efforts, Ma said. The DPP must also do its share, said Ma.</P>
      <P>In Beijing, the spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, Yang Yi,
labeled Chen Chu's China visit as "irrelevant to politics, " and expressed
welcome to other prominent DPP figures to visit the mainland in the future.</P>
      <P>Yang reiterated that Beijing would "respond favorably" to future visits by DPP
politicians as long as the DPP changes its pro-Taiwan independence stance.</P>

      <P>An octogenarian student opened a solo exhibition of his paintings Wednesday in
the southern county of Tainan to mark his graduation from university.</P>
      <P>The exhibit features more than 100 pieces of work by Shen Chien-yi, 84, and
includes oil paintings, water colors, stereography and Chinese brush
calligraphy.</P>
      <P>The show is being held at Chang Jung Christian University in Tainan County's
Gueiren township to mark Shen's graduation from the school's Department of
Visual Art after four years of studies.</P>
      <P>Shen, who fought in World War II as a career military officer, came to Taiwan
from mainland China more than five decades ago to work as a public functionary.</P>
      <P>He was chief of the Tainan City government's news department before he was
transferred to the Kaohsiung City government where he worked in the secretariat
until his retirement.</P>
      <P>He told the Central News Agency that was fond of painting even as a child. But
he had been living the life of a refugee since he was 10 because of the outbreak
of WWII, and his dreams of becoming a painter or even gaining a college
education were dashed, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Shen said, he never lost his interest in painting and he applied to
study at China Academy of Art in Hangzhou at the age of 73, years after his
retirement.</P>
      <P>He was accepted and began his program at the academy, but was forced to return
in full to Taiwan less than two years later when his health began to decline due
to age and fatigue from the frequent trips across the Taiwan Strait to attend
school.</P>
      <P>Determined not to give up his dream, Shen, at the age of 80, registered four
years ago for classes in water color painting with professor  Tsai  Mau-sung,
director  of Chang  Jung Christian University's Department of Visual Art.</P>
      <P>In 2005, he took the department's entrance exams and began full- time studies
there.</P>
      <P>"Now my dreams have come true, " a gratified Shen said at the opening of his
exhibition.</P>

      <P>The government will encourage local universities  to list foreign language
proficiency  among the graduation  criteria  for  students  so as to strengthen
the competitiveness of the country's labor force, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The measure is one of several strategies put forward by the CEPD to boost the
development of Taiwan's service sector.</P>
      <P>Other steps to be adopted by the government include providing foreign  language
courses for workers in the service sector, especially those in the medical and
travel sectors, the CEPD said in a briefing to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>According to Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Taiwan's business sector is undergoing a
structural change in which services play a crucial role.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the government should support the development of the service sector
by promoting measures that take advantage of Taiwan's culture and human
resources, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the government's objective is to raise the service
sector's contribution to the country's gross domestic product to NT$11 trillion
by 2012.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, the government will promote the export of replicable
services, explore business opportunities in emerging markets such as China, and
seek to internationalize Taiwanese food to boost food exports, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>In 2008, services exported by Taiwan were valued at US$33.59 billion, accounting
for 0.9 percent of the world's total value and making Taiwan the world's 26th-
largest services exporter.</P>
      <P>The ranking, however, marked a significant decline from 2000, when Taiwan was in
18th place.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that in addition to weak export competitiveness, Taiwan's service
sector is facing several other problems, such as insufficient investment in
research, development and innovation, and low productivity.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has devised a new military recruitment
policy under which Taiwan will adopt an all-volunteer military service system
during peace time but will maintain areservist system to be used in time of war,
a senior MND official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Wang Chun-chiang, director of the MND Department of Manpower, made the
announcement at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense
Committee.</P>
      <P>Wang said the MND will reach its goal of having an all-volunteer military force
by the end of 2014.</P>
      <P>Wang and Vice Defense Minister Chang Liang-jen were invited to attend the
committee meeting to give briefings how the ministry will implement the new
system.</P>
      <P>Faced with a variety of legislators' opinions about the system, Chang said the
ministry "will go all-out to reach the goal of building an all-volunteer
military service system."</P>
      <P>Asked how the ministry plans to cover the added expense of an all-volunteer
military, Chang said the annual budget for personnel spending will be raised
from 39 percent of the total national defense budget in 2009 to 45 percent once
the system is fully implemented.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the budget for arms procurement will be cut, he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the ruling Kuomintang reminded the ministry that as it
continues to reduce its intake of conscripts year by year, it will be faced with
the problem that the number of people awaiting deferred conscription will have
reached 92,000 by the end of 2013. According to the existing laws, these people
must perform their national service.</P>
      <P>Asked how the MND will handle the problem, Wang said it is planning to put such
conscripts to work as alternative service draftees and will move to amend the
relevant regulations to allow more people to serve in this capacity.</P>
      <P>According to the MND report, under the all-volunteer system, conscripts after
2014 will still need to undergo military training for four months before being
registered as military reserves, to be called up in the event of war.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Microsoft announced Wednesday in Taipei that its Windows 7 operating system will
be released Oct. 22, bringing to its end-users and business customers what it
called a much easier and more exciting Windows experience.</P>
      <P>Steven Guggenheimer, corporate vice president of the Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) Division at Microsoft Corp. made the announcement in a
keynote speech at Microsoft Forum 2009 during the ongoing Computex Taipei show.</P>
      <P>In addition, details of the Windows 7 upgrade option will be released later this
month, while Windows 7 Release to Manufacturing will be available at the end of
July, Guggenheimer said in the speech, which included a demonstration of Windows
7 features.</P>
      <P>"That date (Oct. 22) was chosen based on conversations with our hardware
partners -- retail partners across the globe. We worked on Windows 7 from
milestone to milestone and Oct. 22 popped out, " Guggenheimer said in a news
conference after the forum.</P>
      <P>As to why he chose to announce the release date at Computex Taipei, Guggenheimer
said it was an obvious choice because Computex is a very important IT show at
the core of the industry and some of Microsoft's best partners are there.</P>
      <P>Asked about the likely penetration rate and sales volume of Windows 7,
Guggenheimer said the company's goal is to let the product speak for itself.</P>
      <P>He declined to disclose the retail price of the new product, saying that it is
an intricate decision that Microsoft makes in conjunction with its partners and
that the price will be announced later.</P>
      <P>According  to Microsoft,  Windows  7 is meant to be more user-centric and to
focus on improved performance. It includes a number of new features, such as
advances in handwriting recognition, support for virtual hard disks, improved
performance on multi-core processors, and the option to pin any program to the
taskbar.</P>
      <P>Guggehheimer, who has just taken over the helm of OEM, was making his second
address at Computex Taipei, which will run until June 6.</P>
      <P>He said that although the economic realities of the past year have created new
challenges for customers, partners and the IT industry, the power of innovation
will continue to benefit consumers, the industry and the economy at large.</P>
      <P>To illustrate the point, Guggenheimer pointed to the evolution of small notebook
PCs, or netbooks, and the ensuing emergence of a new class of consumer Internet
devices.</P>
      <P>Guggenheimer said that the broad adoption of small notebooks shows that they are
answering a market need, especially given the economic situation. It also
reflects that they have evolved quickly from their initial function as basic
Web-surfing tools to become powerful personal computers, he added.</P>
      <P>"Buyers are becoming increasingly cost-conscious and mobile, and laptop sales
are soon expected to outstrip desktop PC sales in developed economies," he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the future trend of the ICT industry, Guggenheimer forecast that
consumer Internet devices, which fall somewhere between smartphones and full-
featured small notebook PCs, will become more and more popular.</P>
      <P>The next generation of smart, connected, service-oriented devices will give
people mobile  access to a rich set of media and information, he added.</P>

      <P>Participants, including Taiwanese athletes who competed in the Olympics, will
wear earplugs when they run in a June 7 race to promote the upcoming Taipei
Deaflympics, according to aDeaflympics executive Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The event, which will be held in Taiwan for the first time, will bring together
thousands of athletes who are hearing impaired to compete in various sports.</P>
      <P>Emile Chih-jen Sheng, CEO of the Taipei Deaflympics Organizing Committee (TDOC)
, said the committee worked with the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee in
designing the Olympic Day Run, which will precede the Deaflympics to encourage
more people to understand and take part in the 2009 Deaflympics, which will be
held in Taipei City from Sept. 5-15.</P>
      <P>Tzeng Wen-hung, a Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee executive, said the race is
an international movement in celebration of the creation of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) and has been held annually for more than 20 years by IOC
members around the world.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,341 runners, including more than 20 people with hearing
disabilities and 10 visually impaired people, will vie for medals in two
groups-- the 4 km race and 8 km race.</P>
      <P>They will each receive a pair of earplugs from the organizer on the day of the
race, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>TDOC CEO Sheng said runners are invited to experience the silence in movement to
understand the feelings and difficulties of hearing impaired athletes in the
Deaflympics, which is limited to those who have a hearing loss of at least 55
decibels in the better ear.</P>
      <P>The race will come after the release of Deaflympics' theme song in May, Sheng
said.</P>
      <P>Many other promotional activities will also be staged after the road race,
including a grand opening of the Deaflympics main stadium on July 23 and an
invitational track and field game from July 24-25.</P>
      <P>There will also be a series of large-scale performances to drum up the 21st
Summer Deaflympics Taipei 2009, which is expected to draw 4,000 players from 81
countries to compete in 19 types of sports.</P>
      <P>The performances include Taiwanese operas and shows by aboriginal singers, the
world-famous creative organization Blue Man Group, and a folk music and dance
troupe from China's Yunnan Province, Sheng said.</P>

      <P>A dozen medical students again called on the government Wednesday to address
what they said were discrepancies in the requirements for Taiwanese medical
school graduates to practice their profession in their home country.</P>
      <P>The call came on the heels of a massive protest by medical students, which is
rare in Taiwan, on the weekend.</P>
      <P>The approximately 1,000 local medical students who took to the streets in Taipei
Sunday said the process whereby Taiwanese graduates of Polish medical schools
could begin to practice in Taiwan was "simple" and "unfair" compared to the
requirements that apply to graduates of local schools.</P>
      <P>In response, an Executive Yuan official said Monday that the Cabinet "has heard
the voice of the public" and will discuss a draft revision of the physician act
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The draft bill seeks to introduce a requirement for Taiwan nationals who
graduate from foreign medical schools to obtain accreditation of their academic
qualifications before they could be allowed to sit the state medical doctor
examination in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the bill is passed, they will also be required to serve internships at local
hospitals for a certain period of time and pass screening process before being
allowed to take the state exam, an official said.</P>
      <P>Under the current act, Taiwan students who graduate from medical schools in the
United States, Japan, the European Union, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New
Zealand, Singapore or Hong Kong are not required to obtain accreditation of
their academic credentials or serve internships at Taiwan hospitals before
taking the state medical examination.</P>
      <P>However, the Federation of Medical Students in Taiwan has been demanding a
revision of the act, saying that Taiwanese graduates of foreign medical schools
should be subject to the same requirements as those who studied in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The members of the federation noted that in order to enter medical schools,
local applicants have to pass rigorous exams, and that only about 700 of the
100,000 senior high school students who took the entrance exams last year were
admitted to medical schools in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the threshold for entry to medical schools in Poland and
elsewhere in Europe is lower and the tuition less, they said, noting that local
recruiters have been arranging for relatively large numbers Taiwanese senior
high school students to enter such institutions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Group opposes plan to build tobacco plant in Miaoli township</HEADLINE>

(BY Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-profit, anti-smoking John Tung Foundation voiced its objection Wednesday
to a foreign company's plan to build a tobacco plant in northern Taiwan's Miaoli
County, and called for a central government investigation of the issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, John Tung Foundation CEO Yao Shi-yuan harshly
criticized the plan by the Imperial Tobacco Company Ltd. to build a plant in
Miaoli's Chunan township, and criticized the local government for allowing the
company to do so despite strong public disapproval.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli county government announced recently that it has approved a project
submitted by the Britain-based Imperial Tobacco to erect a plant at the Kuanyuan
technology park in Chunan.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the tobacco plant would be the company's first in Southeast
Asia and will serve as a base from which to explore other markets in the region.</P>
      <P>Yao said that although the tobacco plant was projected to create some 250 job
opportunities in Miaoli, "it would not be worthwhile compared to the possible
hazards."</P>
      <P>Allowing the tobacco plant would be tantamount to opening the door to a
dangerous foe, Yao warned. He urged the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog
body, to investigate the planned project, given that it is "against
international norms and could seriously tarnish Taiwan's international image."</P>
      <P>In response, Blanchi Cheng, a board member of the Tobacco Institute of the
Republic of China, said that Yao's arguments did not reflect the whole truth.</P>
      <P>The project is a legal investment that could also help to boost local economic
development, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>However, a woman surnamed Lin who lives in Dali City in central Taiwan's
Taichung County expressed support for Yao's call.</P>
      <P>"A tobacco plant would not benefit the local community. Instead, it might damage
the health of the local residents, " she said, pointing a finger at a cigarette
factory run by the state-run Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. in her hometown.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The accumulated turnover of the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP) in March and
April reached NT$65.31 billion (US$2 billion) -- a growth of 46.41 percent
compared with the January-February figure, the park administration said in a
statement Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The March-April turnover, however, posted a drop of 37.18 percent from the same
period in 2008, the STSP administration said.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the decline was the smallest for the last six months, which was a
sign that the local recession has bottomed out, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The accumulated turnover of the science park, which houses nearly 160 high-tech
businesses, in the first four months of the year stood at NT$109.93 billion,
which was a 46.07 percent decline from the same period last year, according to
the statement.</P>
      <P>The STSP is comprised of two separate parks -- the Tainan Science Park and the
Kaohsiung Science Park. The industries operating in the parks include integrated
circuits, optoelectronics, biotechnology, telecommunications, precision
machinery, as well as computer and peripherals.</P>
      <P>The STSP administration said that the optoelectronics industry generated a
turnover of NT$44.33 billion in the March-April period, recording the largest
two-month growth among all the business sectors in the park.</P>
      <P>The STSP administration attributed the growth to increasing demand from China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A bird watcher urged bird lovers Wednesday to seize the opportunity to watch the
beautiful fairy pittas and their young, which will leave Taiwan soon on their
annual migration route.</P>
      <P>Lai Wen-ho said he has been looking forward for nearly a month to seeing the
young birds leaving their nests with their parents and that "the time has
finally come."</P>
      <P>Lai said that he had been waiting quietly in some low bushes near the birds'
habitat since early Wednesday morning to take photographs of them.</P>
      <P>Taitung, with its wide expanses of lush greenery, has been attractive to the
birds, which migrate every year between March and June to Taiwan to breed and
leave again after June, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the birds usually chose damp bushes that are free of pesticides
and other pollutants as their breeding ground.</P>
      <P>The birds migrate not to escape harsh winters, but rather to take advantage of
the long spring and summer days and to feed on the many insects in the higher
latitudes, Lai said.</P>
      <P>This bird species, with an estimated population of 2,500 to 10,000, is
classified as "vulnerable" by BirdLife International. This infers that the
population is rapidly declining due to deforestation in its breeding areas,
principally for agriculture and logging purposes. The problem is compounded by
trappers who catch the birds to sell them in the pet industry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Raymond Burghardt said
Tuesday at a welcome dinner for President Ma Ying-jeou that the bright sunshine
in Seattle that day symbolized the good relations between Taiwan and the United
States.</P>
      <P>The top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic
ties made the remarks at a dinner with Taiwanese expatriates to welcome
President Ma, who arrived in Seattle earlier in the day for an overnight transit
stop en route home after a three-country Central American diplomatic tour.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said in his opening remarks that Seattle has a reputation for frequent
rain and that it was rainy during his two previous visits to the city. However,
on his third visit Tuesday, it was sunny in Seattle,  which was a reflection of
Taiwan-U.S. relations, he added.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a large delegation, Ma arrived in Seattle Tuesday
evening from El Salvador where he attended the inaugural of new Salvadoran
President Mauricio Funes.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of Taiwanese expatriates turned out to greet Ma at the hotel where he
was staying.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his arrival, Ma met separately with Burghardt and Seattle Mayor
Greg Nickel for wide-ranging talks. He also had telephone conversations with
Washington State Governor Christine Gregoire and several U.S. congressmen,
including Lincoln Diaz-Balart, co-chair of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus.</P>
      <P>Ma was quoted as having assured the American politicians that progress in
relations across the Taiwan Strait will have a positive impact on Taiwan-U.S.
ties.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hopes that U.S. congressional members will support his
proposal that the U.S. grant visa-free treatment for Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>Ma,  who also visited  Belize  and Guatemala  during  his just-concluded Central
America tour, is scheduled to return to Taiwan Thursday evening.</P>

      <P>An octogenarian student opened a solo exhibition of his paintings Wednesday in
the southern county of Tainan to mark his graduation from university.</P>
      <P>The exhibit features more than 100 pieces of work by Shen Chien-yi, 84, and
includes oil paintings, water colors, stereography and Chinese brush
calligraphy.</P>
      <P>The show is being held at Chang Jung Christian University in Tainan County's
Gueiren township to mark Shen's graduation from the school's Department of
Visual Art after four years of studies.</P>
      <P>Shen, who fought in World War II as a career military officer, came to Taiwan
from mainland China more than five decades ago to work as a public functionary.</P>
      <P>He was chief of the Tainan City government's news department before he was
transferred to the Kaohsiung City government where he worked in the secretariat
until his retirement.</P>
      <P>He told the Central News Agency that was fond of painting even as a child. But
he had been living the life of a refugee since he was 10 because of the outbreak
of WWII, and his dreams of becoming a painter or even gaining a college
education were dashed, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Shen said, he never lost his interest in painting and he applied to
study at China Academy of Art in Hangzhou at the age of 73, years after his
retirement.</P>
      <P>He was accepted and began his program at the academy, but was forced to return
in full to Taiwan less than two years later when his health began to decline due
to age and fatigue from the frequent trips across the Taiwan Strait to attend
school.</P>
      <P>Determined not to give up his dream, Shen, at the age of 80, registered four
years ago for classes in water color painting with professor  Tsai  Mau-sung,
director  of Chang  Jung Christian University's Department of Visual Art.</P>
      <P>In 2005, he took the department's entrance exams and began full- time studies
there.</P>
      <P>"Now my dreams have come true, " a gratified Shen said at the opening of his
exhibition.</P>

      <P>The government will encourage local universities  to list foreign language
proficiency  among the graduation  criteria  for  students  so as to strengthen
the competitiveness of the country's labor force, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The measure is one of several strategies put forward by the CEPD to boost the
development of Taiwan's service sector.</P>
      <P>Other steps to be adopted by the government include providing foreign  language
courses for workers in the service sector, especially those in the medical and
travel sectors, the CEPD said in a briefing to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>According to Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Taiwan's business sector is undergoing a
structural change in which services play a crucial role.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the government should support the development of the service sector
by promoting measures that take advantage of Taiwan's culture and human
resources, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the government's objective is to raise the service
sector's contribution to the country's gross domestic product to NT$11 trillion
by 2012.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, the government will promote the export of replicable
services, explore business opportunities in emerging markets such as China, and
seek to internationalize Taiwanese food to boost food exports, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>In 2008, services exported by Taiwan were valued at US$33.59 billion, accounting
for 0.9 percent of the world's total value and making Taiwan the world's 26th-
largest services exporter.</P>
      <P>The ranking, however, marked a significant decline from 2000, when Taiwan was in
18th place.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that in addition to weak export competitiveness, Taiwan's service
sector is facing several other problems, such as insufficient investment in
research, development and innovation, and low productivity.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has devised a new military recruitment
policy under which Taiwan will adopt an all-volunteer military service system
during peace time but will maintain areservist system to be used in time of war,
a senior MND official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Wang Chun-chiang, director of the MND Department of Manpower, made the
announcement at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense
Committee.</P>
      <P>Wang said the MND will reach its goal of having an all-volunteer military force
by the end of 2014.</P>
      <P>Wang and Vice Defense Minister Chang Liang-jen were invited to attend the
committee meeting to give briefings how the ministry will implement the new
system.</P>
      <P>Faced with a variety of legislators' opinions about the system, Chang said the
ministry "will go all-out to reach the goal of building an all-volunteer
military service system."</P>
      <P>Asked how the ministry plans to cover the added expense of an all-volunteer
military, Chang said the annual budget for personnel spending will be raised
from 39 percent of the total national defense budget in 2009 to 45 percent once
the system is fully implemented.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the budget for arms procurement will be cut, he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the ruling Kuomintang reminded the ministry that as it
continues to reduce its intake of conscripts year by year, it will be faced with
the problem that the number of people awaiting deferred conscription will have
reached 92,000 by the end of 2013. According to the existing laws, these people
must perform their national service.</P>
      <P>Asked how the MND will handle the problem, Wang said it is planning to put such
conscripts to work as alternative service draftees and will move to amend the
relevant regulations to allow more people to serve in this capacity.</P>
      <P>According to the MND report, under the all-volunteer system, conscripts after
2014 will still need to undergo military training for four months before being
registered as military reserves, to be called up in the event of war.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Microsoft to launch Windows 7 Oct. 22</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Microsoft announced Wednesday in Taipei that its Windows 7 operating system will
be released Oct. 22, bringing to its end-users and business customers what it
called a much easier and more exciting Windows experience.</P>
      <P>Steven Guggenheimer, corporate vice president of the Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) Division at Microsoft Corp. made the announcement in a
keynote speech at Microsoft Forum 2009 during the ongoing Computex Taipei show.</P>
      <P>In addition, details of the Windows 7 upgrade option will be released later this
month, while Windows 7 Release to Manufacturing will be available at the end of
July, Guggenheimer said in the speech, which included a demonstration of Windows
7 features.</P>
      <P>"That date (Oct. 22) was chosen based on conversations with our hardware
partners -- retail partners across the globe. We worked on Windows 7 from
milestone to milestone and Oct. 22 popped out, " Guggenheimer said in a news
conference after the forum.</P>
      <P>As to why he chose to announce the release date at Computex Taipei, Guggenheimer
said it was an obvious choice because Computex is a very important IT show at
the core of the industry and some of Microsoft's best partners are there.</P>
      <P>Asked about the likely penetration rate and sales volume of Windows 7,
Guggenheimer said the company's goal is to let the product speak for itself.</P>
      <P>He declined to disclose the retail price of the new product, saying that it is
an intricate decision that Microsoft makes in conjunction with its partners and
that the price will be announced later.</P>
      <P>According  to Microsoft,  Windows  7 is meant to be more user-centric and to
focus on improved performance. It includes a number of new features, such as
advances in handwriting recognition, support for virtual hard disks, improved
performance on multi-core processors, and the option to pin any program to the
taskbar.</P>
      <P>Guggehheimer, who has just taken over the helm of OEM, was making his second
address at Computex Taipei, which will run until June 6.</P>
      <P>He said that although the economic realities of the past year have created new
challenges for customers, partners and the IT industry, the power of innovation
will continue to benefit consumers, the industry and the economy at large.</P>
      <P>To illustrate the point, Guggenheimer pointed to the evolution of small notebook
PCs, or netbooks, and the ensuing emergence of a new class of consumer Internet
devices.</P>
      <P>Guggenheimer said that the broad adoption of small notebooks shows that they are
answering a market need, especially given the economic situation. It also
reflects that they have evolved quickly from their initial function as basic
Web-surfing tools to become powerful personal computers, he added.</P>
      <P>"Buyers are becoming increasingly cost-conscious and mobile, and laptop sales
are soon expected to outstrip desktop PC sales in developed economies," he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the future trend of the ICT industry, Guggenheimer forecast that
consumer Internet devices, which fall somewhere between smartphones and full-
featured small notebook PCs, will become more and more popular.</P>
      <P>The next generation of smart, connected, service-oriented devices will give
people mobile  access to a rich set of media and information, he added.</P>

      <P>Participants, including Taiwanese athletes who competed in the Olympics, will
wear earplugs when they run in a June 7 race to promote the upcoming Taipei
Deaflympics, according to aDeaflympics executive Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The event, which will be held in Taiwan for the first time, will bring together
thousands of athletes who are hearing impaired to compete in various sports.</P>
      <P>Emile Chih-jen Sheng, CEO of the Taipei Deaflympics Organizing Committee (TDOC)
, said the committee worked with the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee in
designing the Olympic Day Run, which will precede the Deaflympics to encourage
more people to understand and take part in the 2009 Deaflympics, which will be
held in Taipei City from Sept. 5-15.</P>
      <P>Tzeng Wen-hung, a Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee executive, said the race is
an international movement in celebration of the creation of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) and has been held annually for more than 20 years by IOC
members around the world.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,341 runners, including more than 20 people with hearing
disabilities and 10 visually impaired people, will vie for medals in two
groups-- the 4 km race and 8 km race.</P>
      <P>They will each receive a pair of earplugs from the organizer on the day of the
race, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>TDOC CEO Sheng said runners are invited to experience the silence in movement to
understand the feelings and difficulties of hearing impaired athletes in the
Deaflympics, which is limited to those who have a hearing loss of at least 55
decibels in the better ear.</P>
      <P>The race will come after the release of Deaflympics' theme song in May, Sheng
said.</P>
      <P>Many other promotional activities will also be staged after the road race,
including a grand opening of the Deaflympics main stadium on July 23 and an

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet to discuss revision of physician act</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A dozen medical students again called on the government Wednesday to address
what they said were discrepancies in the requirements for Taiwanese medical
school graduates to practice their profession in their home country.</P>
      <P>The call came on the heels of a massive protest by medical students, which is
rare in Taiwan, on the weekend.</P>
      <P>The approximately 1,000 local medical students who took to the streets in Taipei
Sunday said the process whereby Taiwanese graduates of Polish medical schools
could begin to practice in Taiwan was "simple" and "unfair" compared to the
requirements that apply to graduates of local schools.</P>
      <P>In response, an Executive Yuan official said Monday that the Cabinet "has heard
the voice of the public" and will discuss a draft revision of the physician act
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The draft bill seeks to introduce a requirement for Taiwan nationals who
graduate from foreign medical schools to obtain accreditation of their academic
qualifications before they could be allowed to sit the state medical doctor
examination in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the bill is passed, they will also be required to serve internships at local
hospitals for a certain period of time and pass screening process before being
allowed to take the state exam, an official said.</P>
      <P>Under the current act, Taiwan students who graduate from medical schools in the
United States, Japan, the European Union, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New
Zealand, Singapore or Hong Kong are not required to obtain accreditation of
their academic credentials or serve internships at Taiwan hospitals before
taking the state medical examination.</P>
      <P>However, the Federation of Medical Students in Taiwan has been demanding a
revision of the act, saying that Taiwanese graduates of foreign medical schools
should be subject to the same requirements as those who studied in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The members of the federation noted that in order to enter medical schools,
local applicants have to pass rigorous exams, and that only about 700 of the
100,000 senior high school students who took the entrance exams last year were
admitted to medical schools in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the threshold for entry to medical schools in Poland and
elsewhere in Europe is lower and the tuition less, they said, noting that local
recruiters have been arranging for relatively large numbers Taiwanese senior
high school students to enter such institutions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Group opposes plan to build tobacco plant in Miaoli township</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-profit, anti-smoking John Tung Foundation voiced its objection Wednesday
to a foreign company's plan to build a tobacco plant in northern Taiwan's Miaoli
County, and called for a central government investigation of the issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, John Tung Foundation CEO Yao Shi-yuan harshly
criticized the plan by the Imperial Tobacco Company Ltd. to build a plant in
Miaoli's Chunan township, and criticized the local government for allowing the
company to do so despite strong public disapproval.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli county government announced recently that it has approved a project
submitted by the Britain-based Imperial Tobacco to erect a plant at the Kuanyuan
technology park in Chunan.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the tobacco plant would be the company's first in Southeast
Asia and will serve as a base from which to explore other markets in the region.</P>
      <P>Yao said that although the tobacco plant was projected to create some 250 job
opportunities in Miaoli, "it would not be worthwhile compared to the possible
hazards."</P>
      <P>Allowing the tobacco plant would be tantamount to opening the door to a
dangerous foe, Yao warned. He urged the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog
body, to investigate the planned project, given that it is "against
international norms and could seriously tarnish Taiwan's international image."</P>
      <P>In response, Blanchi Cheng, a board member of the Tobacco Institute of the
Republic of China, said that Yao's arguments did not reflect the whole truth.</P>
      <P>The project is a legal investment that could also help to boost local economic
development, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>However, a woman surnamed Lin who lives in Dali City in central Taiwan's
Taichung County expressed support for Yao's call.</P>
      <P>"A tobacco plant would not benefit the local community. Instead, it might damage
the health of the local residents, " she said, pointing a finger at a cigarette
factory run by the state-run Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. in her hometown.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The accumulated turnover of the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP) in March and
April reached NT$65.31 billion (US$2 billion) -- a growth of 46.41 percent
compared with the January-February figure, the park administration said in a
statement Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The March-April turnover, however, posted a drop of 37.18 percent from the same
period in 2008, the STSP administration said.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the decline was the smallest for the last six months, which was a
sign that the local recession has bottomed out, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The accumulated turnover of the science park, which houses nearly 160 high-tech
businesses, in the first four months of the year stood at NT$109.93 billion,
which was a 46.07 percent decline from the same period last year, according to
the statement.</P>
      <P>The STSP is comprised of two separate parks -- the Tainan Science Park and the
Kaohsiung Science Park. The industries operating in the parks include integrated
circuits, optoelectronics, biotechnology, telecommunications, precision
machinery, as well as computer and peripherals.</P>
      <P>The STSP administration said that the optoelectronics industry generated a
turnover of NT$44.33 billion in the March-April period, recording the largest
two-month growth among all the business sectors in the park.</P>
      <P>The STSP administration attributed the growth to increasing demand from China.</P>

      <P>A bird watcher urged bird lovers Wednesday to seize the opportunity to watch the
beautiful fairy pittas and their young, which will leave Taiwan soon on their
annual migration route.</P>
      <P>Lai Wen-ho said he has been looking forward for nearly a month to seeing the
young birds leaving their nests with their parents and that "the time has
finally come."</P>
      <P>Lai said that he had been waiting quietly in some low bushes near the birds'
habitat since early Wednesday morning to take photographs of them.</P>
      <P>Taitung, with its wide expanses of lush greenery, has been attractive to the
birds, which migrate every year between March and June to Taiwan to breed and
leave again after June, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the birds usually chose damp bushes that are free of pesticides
and other pollutants as their breeding ground.</P>
      <P>The birds migrate not to escape harsh winters, but rather to take advantage of
the long spring and summer days and to feed on the many insects in the higher
latitudes, Lai said.</P>
      <P>This bird species, with an estimated population of 2,500 to 10,000, is
classified as "vulnerable" by BirdLife International. This infers that the
population is rapidly declining due to deforestation in its breeding areas,
principally for agriculture and logging purposes. The problem is compounded by
trappers who catch the birds to sell them in the pet industry.</P>

      <P>Chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Raymond Burghardt said
Tuesday at a welcome dinner for President Ma Ying-jeou that the bright sunshine

      <P>The top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic

President Ma, who arrived in Seattle earlier in the day for an overnight transit

Washington State Governor Christine Gregoire and several U.S. congressmen,

1944: Rome is liberated by the Allies with U.S. Gen. Mark Clark leading the way
into the city.

1954: Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek appoints Yen Chia-kan governor

    <HEADLINE>Check-in loophole lets woman into secure airport areas for 40 hours</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A check-in loophole at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport allowed a female
Canadian citizen of Chinese descent to breach security and enter off-limits
areas of the terminal for more than 40 hours earlier this week, the Aviation
Police Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The woman, identified only by her surname Chen, came to Taiwan late last month
on a backpacking trip, but was deported Tuesday evening via a Hong Kong-bound
flight after she was found to have used someone else's boarding pass to enter a
controlled area the previous day.</P>
      <P>"The Canadian passport holder had apparently  violated our immigration law,"
said an aviation police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>According to the officer, initial investigations found that Chen was scheduled
to depart Taiwan June 16, but went to the airport June 1 and managed to secure a
boarding pass under someone else's name at a self-service check-in kiosk
installed by an air carrier at the airport.</P>
      <P>She then entered a controlled area and strolled around there, then later in the
day checked into the airport's transit hotel for an overnight stay.</P>
      <P>Chen was not located until after the air carrier discovered that she had not
boarded the plane and reported the case to the aviation police.</P>
      <P>Acting on the report, aviation police officers launched a large-scale search of
the airport terminal and finally located her.</P>
      <P>Chen was asked to explain how she had managed to acquire a boarding pass and
proceed past the immigration counter. From her account of her actions, aviation
police authorities learned of a loophole in the air carrier's self-service
online check-in system.</P>
      <P>According to the police officer, the automated system mistakenly Chen a boarding
pass in the name of a passenger whose surname was the same as hers and who was
to have taken the same flight as her.</P>
      <P>As the carrier's self-service check-in system was not linked to its traditional
check-in counter, two boarding passes were issued in the same passenger's name.</P>
      <P>It was not clear why the woman moved up her scheduled departure date from June
16 to June 1 or why she entered the off-limits area after securing a boarding
pass bearing someone else's name, the police officer said.</P>
      <P>As to why she was able to remain in a controlled area for over 40 hours, the
officer said most likely the immigration officers did not carefully check
whether the name on the boarding pass was exactly the same as that of the
passport holder.</P>
      <P>According to the police officer, the self-service check-in systems are usually
developed by the air carriers themselves. At the moment, Taiwan's China
Airlines, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways and U.S.-based United Airlines
have such kiosks at the airport to allow e-ticket passengers bound for visa-free
destinations to bypass the check-in counters and obtain a boarding pass in as
little as 30 seconds.</P>
      <P>Major local airlines associations have been informed of the incident, the
officer said, adding that the Aviation Police Office has suggested that air
carriers take steps to plug any possible loopholes in their online and self-
service check-in systems.</P>
      <P>Airport immigration officials also said they will tighten checks from now on to
ensure that the names on boarding passes match those on the passports presented
by passengers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-Japan working holiday program draws flood of applications</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
06/04/09  13:19:54
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that applications have been
flooding in for a reciprocal working holiday program between Taiwan and Japan
that came into effect June 1.</P>
      <P>Peter Tsai, secretary-general of the MOFA's Association of East Asian Relations,
said at a regular press briefing that the Taipei-based Interchange Association,
which represents Japanese interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties, received some 700 applications in the first three days since
the program started.</P>
      <P>The Japanese agency is expecting another 400-500 applications before it fills
the first 1,000 openings at the end of the first phase of the process June 5, he
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan are each offering 2,000 places in the first year of the program
and will increase the number over the next few years depending on the popularity
of the program.</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association  has 1,000 slots for Taiwanese applicants in each of
the periods June 1-5 and Nov. 2-6, while Taiwan's representative offices in
Japan are accepting applications from Japanese youth year round.</P>
      <P>"I'm glad to see that so many young people are interested in taking this
opportunity to go to Japan and to fulfill their dreams, using their own funds,"
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"I would like to remind them be on good behavior and pay attention to their
actions while in Japan because that would be the best basis on which to ask
Japan for more openings next year, " he added.</P>
      <P>Under the program that opened June 1, Taiwanese aged 18-30 can apply to the
Interchange Association for a working holiday visa that will allow them to work
on a short-term basis while visiting Japan. The visas are valid for one year.</P>
      <P>Japan was the third country to sign a working holiday agreement with Taiwan,
with the other two being Australia and New Zealand in 2004.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, despite the flood of applications in Taiwan for the working holiday
visas, the country's representative offices in Tokyo, Yokohama, Fukuoka, Osaka,
Okinawa in Japan received a total of only five applications during the first
three days, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>However, the Foreign Ministry did not expect that there would many applications
initially from Japan, as that country follows a different academic year, he
added. Most Japanese students are likely still too busy with school work to be
making any travel plans, as the first semester of the academic year started
April 1, he said.</P>
      <P>Also, Japanese students have the option of applying anytime during the year,
while Taiwanese applicants have to meet the deadlines within the two designated
periods, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai encouraged Japanese students to apply for the working holiday program,
saying that many local universities, social groups, Japanese language schools
and companies in Taiwan have all expressed interest in offering them jobs.</P>
      <P>Asked when Taiwan's new representative office in Sapporo will officially begin
operation, Tsai said that the ministry is working very hard toward the scheduled
opening this summer, but it will depend on the administrative procedures.</P>
      <P>As to whether former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to visit
Taiwan this year, Tsai said that as much as the MOFA wants Abe to visit, his
trip will depend on the date for the election of Japan's House of
Representatives, which might fall in July or August.</P>
      <P>If Abe makes the visit, he will be the fourth former Japanese prime minister to
do so, with the other three being Nobusuke Kishi, Takeo Fukuda and Yoshiro Mori.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOF to study feasibility of auctioning unclaimed shopping vouchers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
06/04/09  14:06:14
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Thursday it will consider whether to auction
the unclaimed shopping vouchers that were issued by the government earlier this
year to stimulate domestic spending.</P>
      <P>Hwang Ding-fang, director-general of the MOF's National Treasury Agency, made
the remarks in a question-and-answer session at a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Shiow-yen of the ruling Kuomintang asked what the government is
planning to do with the unclaimed shopping vouchers, noting that when the
collection date expired at the end of April there were still around 130,000 sets
of unclaimed vouchers.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the appropriated sum of NT$500 million for these shopping vouchers
will be returned to the national treasury, while the vouchers themselves will be
destroyed in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>However, Lu mentioned the suggestion raised by some people that the vouchers
should be auctioned because it would be "a pity" to destroy them, and pointed
out that it had cost Central Engraving and Printing Plant around NT$10 to print
each set.</P>
      <P>Lu said this would also save the cost of destroying the vouchers, and the
proceeds of the auction could be paid into the national coffers or used to take
care of the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>Hwang responded that the suggestion was a very "creative" one, although "it
lacked a legal basis."</P>
      <P>He promised to study the feasibility of the suggestion in collaboration with the
Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The NT$85.7 billion consumption voucher program was one of the measures the
government initiated to prop up the sagging economy, and many businesses
launched special promotions to encourage consumers to spend the vouchers at
their stores.</P>
      <P>All Taiwanese citizens -- with the exception of those living abroad without
identity cards, household registration or residency rights -- and their foreign
spouses were eligible to each receive NT$3,600 in vouchers.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, the vouchers must be exchanged for goods or services by
Sept. 30, 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President urges China to face up to Tiananmen massacre history</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on China Thursday to face up to the history of the
Tiananmen Square massacre, in a written statement issued to mark the 20th
anniversary of the tragedy.</P>
      <P>The military crackdown took place June 4, 1989 following months of pro-democracy
demonstrations in and near Tiananmen Square in Beijing.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear how many people were actually killed or injured, but some
estimates put the fatalities at hundreds and others at thousands. The figure
published by the Chinese government was 241 dead, including soldiers, and 7,000
wounded.</P>
      <P>Ma said that while violent conflicts between governments and civilians were not
uncommon in the history of China and other countries, the hatred and fear that
result from such conflicts do not automatically fade with time.</P>
      <P>"In any such conflict, it is the government that exercises public authority and
therefore bears responsibility for critically examining its actions," Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, it is essential to face up honestly to the history of
unfortunate events and deal with the bereaved families with sympathy in order to
prevent a repetition of similar tragedies.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the efforts made by Taiwan over the past two decades to redress
the miscarriage of justice in the 228 incident of 1947 and during a subsequent
38-year period of martial law hold positive lessons for not only Taiwan but also
other countries around the world, the president said.</P>
      <P>He noted that in the last 10 years, China has been paying greater attention to
human rights than before.</P>
      <P>Beijing's signing of the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in
1988, its ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights in 2001, and its publication of the national human rights action
plan in April this year all demonstrate that Beijing is now more willing to
directly address the issue, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said such changes, which coincide with Taiwan's transformation from
authoritarianism  to a full-fledged  democracy,  are very gratifying.</P>
      <P>According to Ma,  with relations between Taiwan and China beginning to warm
following 60 years of military conflicts and political confrontation, the two
sides should end their arms race and diplomatic contention and instead compete
to improve their respective rules of law and human rights records to create a
free and democratic future for generations yet to come.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a row over a British company's plans to build a tobacco plant in a Miaoli
township, Taiwan's Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Thursday that his agency
is basically opposed to the project.</P>
      <P>Yeh, minister of the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) , made the remarks
while fielding questions on the issue from lawmakers at a legislative committee
meeting.</P>
      <P>He said although the DOH is not the agency in charge of the matter, in principle
it is opposed to the tobacco plant construction plan because it goes counter to
global anti-smoking trends.</P>
      <P>The negative complications, such as public health and pollution problems, could
outweigh the plant's job creation benefits, the minister said.</P>
      <P>The non-profit, anti-smoking John Tung Foundation voiced its objection a day
earlier to the plan by the Britain-based Imperial Tobacco Company Ltd. to build
a tobacco plant in northern Taiwan Miaoli County's Chunan township,</P>
      <P>The foundation criticized the local government for allowing the company to do so
despite strong public disapproval and called for the watchdog arm of the
government, the Control Yuan, to conduct an investigation of the issue.</P>
      <P>"The project is against international norms and could seriously tarnish Taiwan's
international image," a foundation spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli county government announced recently that it has approved a project
submitted by Imperial Tobacco to erect a plant at the Kuanyuan technology park
in Chunan.</P>
      <P>Blanchi Cheng, a board member of the Tobacco Institute of the Republic of China,
argued Wednesday that as a legal investment, the plan could also help to boost
local economic development.</P>
      <P>The tobacco plant would be the company's first in Southeast Asia and would serve
as a base from which to explore other markets in the region.</P>
      <P>The tobacco plant is reportedly projected to create some 250 job opportunities
in Miaoli.</P>

      <P>Leading Tiananmen political dissident Wu'er Kaixi, who tried in vain to enter
Macau in hopes of going to China to see his aging parents, said after he was
forced to return to Taiwan Thursday that his attempts to go home will not cease.</P>
      <P>Wu'er Kaixi, now Taiwan citizen, said upon arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport around 3 p.m. that he had been detained at the Macau
airport since Wednesday evening when immigration officials refused to let him
enter.</P>
      <P>He spent the night at the Macau customs office and was put aboard a flight for
Taiwan around noon Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu'er Kaixi, one of the most well-known leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy
student movement in Beijing and No. 2 on China's most wanted list of student
leaders after its bloody crackdown against demonstrators on June 4, 1989, said
that since he is a fugitive to Beijing, he chose Wednesday to turn himself in at
China's liaison office in Macau.</P>
      <P>But he was rejected by Chinese-ruled Macau, a former Portuguese colony which
returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999.</P>
      <P>"Is China a 'big country' with confidence  by ousting me irrationally when I
tried to turn myself in? " Wu'er Kaixi asked Beijing when he arrived at Taoyuan
airport and was interviewed by reporters.</P>
      <P>He asked President Ma Ying-jeou, who has adopted a China-friendly policy since
taking office a year ago: "Is now the time for him, as president of the Republic
of China, to speak favorably for China?"</P>
      <P>He also asked the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to take advantage of the dialogue
platform it has with the Communist Party of China (CPC) and to do him a favor by
asking Beijing to let him go home.</P>
      <P>Noting that he had not returned to Beijing and seen his family for 20 years, he
said "my homecoming effort will not cease as long as I live."</P>
      <P>Wu'er Kaixi, who fled to the United States after the 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, has been living in Taiwan for years,

      <P>Rice prices will remain stable despite damage to the crop's spring harvest in
eastern Taiwan, said an official at the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Yu Sheng-feng, deputy director-general of the COA's Agriculture and
Food Agency, only about 39 percent of the crop in about 1,590 hectares of rice
paddies in the country's eastern regions was affected by the low temperatures in
early April.</P>
      <P>This means that while about 620 hectares of rice paddies had no harvest, there
has been no dent in the country's overall rice production or prices, Yu said. A
total of 154,000 hectares of farm lands across the country were devoted to rice
cultivation this spring, he added.</P>
      <P>Rice grown in eastern Taiwan enjoys widespread popularity among consumers
because of its high quality.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen was planning to lead a group
of local rice farmers to protest in front of the COA to ask for higher
government subsidies in compensation for the losses they suffered because they

    <HEADLINE>Broad dialogue on China relations needed in Taiwan: AIT director</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
06/04/09  17:25:23
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The top U.S. envoy to Taiwan said Thursday that it is important for Taiwan to
have internal broad-based dialogue that would be as close as possible to
consensus, as relations between Taipei and Beijing move into more difficult
stages.</P>
      <P>"The democracy which we celebrate today in Taiwan is an important tool and force
for managing this very difficult process, " said Stephen Young, director of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), at a farewell luncheon hosted by the
American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Young is scheduled to leave office later this year.</P>
      <P>According to Young, while Taiwan and China have "spoken in fairly similar terms"
over the past year and made significant process on improving bilateral economic
and trade relations, it will take a long time for the two sides to deal with
issues that involve Taiwan's international space and political and security
difficulties.</P>
      <P>"Sort of like those computer games that our kids play and maybe some of us play,
where if you do well in the first stage, it gets harder as you go up to another
stage," Young said, adding that the Ma Ying-jeou administration understands
that.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan-China relations face many challenges ahead, Young
said, they have gotten off to a good start and the outlook is optimistic.</P>
      <P>Since it took office last May, the Ma administration has been exploring ways to
enhance cooperation and reduce tensions with China through the acceleration of
cross-Taiwan Strait economic exchanges, including direct air, sea and postal
links.</P>
      <P>As to U.S.-Taiwan relations, Young said bilateral cooperation is good at all
levels because there is a dynamism that is based on the U.S. and Taiwan's
constant search for new approaches to advance their mutual interests.</P>
      <P>In an oblique reference to Taiwan's partial ban on U.S. beef imports, Young said
that if Taiwan works to achieve progress on some of the bilateral agricultural
issues, this might lead to visits by more senior level U.S. officials to the
country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not had any high level visits by Washington officials over the past
few years.</P>
      <P>However, Young said he is not distressed by the cooperation channels that exist
between Taiwan and the U.S., given the informal nature of the bilateral
relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet passes amendment to Physician Act</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
06/04/09  17:49:44
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed an amendment to the Physician Act Thursday in a bid to
require Taiwanese students who have obtained medical education in foreign
countries to pass qualification tests and internships first before being allowed
to take part in the licensing examination.</P>
      <P>The amended draft bill will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for screening.</P>
      <P>The main revision of the law stipulates that Taiwanese students who study in
medical schools overseas and who want to return to Taiwan to take part in the
state licensing examination must first pass qualification tests by the Ministry
of Education and complete successfully a certain period of internship at medical
institutions designated by the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Currently, the act allows Taiwanese students who have attended medical schools
in several countries, including the United States, Japan, Europe, Canada,
Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, to skip qualification tests before taking
part in national licensing examinations.</P>
      <P>But the DOH said that the number of Taiwanese students who have studied in
foreign medical schools and returned to Taiwan to take part in licensing exams
have increased yearly.</P>
      <P>"Given the differences in the education systems and medical care standards of
various regions and countries, the waiving of the qualification tests is no
longer appropriate, " a DOH official said recently, adding that it could even
disrupt the local medical service environment.</P>
      <P>The DOH had therefore proposed the draft amendment that passed the Cabinet
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet's move came on the heels of a large demonstration by local medical
students over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Tens of hundreds of medical students took to the streets Sunday to demand that
the government revise the law to address the problem that the standard of
medical schools in foreign countries may vary from one to another.</P>
      <P>They asked that Taiwanese students who graduate from foreign medical schools
should have their credentials accredited and that they complete their
internships before being allowed to join the licence examination.</P>
      <P>They were especially dissatisfied with those students who have studied in
medical schools in Poland, saying that in recent years local agents have made
big profits by recruiting Taiwan's senior high school students to study in the
East European country, where the tuition is cheaper and the entrance threshold
is lower.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics given by the Federation of Medical Students in
Taiwan, of the estimated 100,000 senior high school students who took part in
the college entrance examination last year, only around 700, or 0.7 percent,
could get into the medical schools here.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, a physician is a lucrative and respected profession.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's  overall  performance  in environmental protection was scored at 58.85
points by the public, with  the field  of resources  recycling  receiving  the
most satisfaction, according to results of a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nearly half -  48.6 percent -  of the respondents  think environmental ecology
protection is more important than economic development, while some 26.2 percent
believe the opposite, according to the survey conducted by the Taiwan Public
Opinion Studies Association via telephone May 22-24.</P>
      <P>Respondents of the survey also listed air quality, water quality, and soil and
water conservation as the country's priorities.</P>
      <P>Survey respondents gave Taiwan 61.29 points on environmental quality and 65.09
points on diversity of environmental resources, with the full score being 100
points.</P>
      <P>In addition to public opinion on the government's performance in environmental
protection, the survey also includes 14 questions to test the public's level of
environmental awareness, covering fields of knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and
practices. The average score of the test is 62.5 points.</P>
      <P>About 82 percent respondents  have correct knowledge about discourse of
environmental protection and up to 78.9 percent are aware of the government's
promotion in full-scale prohibition against using disposable utensils.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows over 90 percent of respondents think the government should
increase expenditures in environmental protection; over 80 percent said 10
percent of the budget of public constructions should be used in greening
efforts.</P>
      <P>As for practices, the survey shows 51 percent of the respondents learn about
environmental protection through information and 30 percent take part in related
activities at least once week. About 80 percent of respondents said they are
willing to cooperate in related policies.</P>
      <P>The survey results were released two days before the World Environment Day,
which was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 to promote
global awareness of the need to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>The survey collected 1,072 valid samples, and had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percent and a confidence level of 95 percent.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's democratic achievements can serve as good example for China, especially
at a time when the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protest is being
marked, the top U.S. envoy to Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Young, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , said at a
farewell luncheon for him hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce that while
the world is commemorating the Tiananmen Square tragedy, it is important to
emphasize Taiwan's democratic progress in the past two decades.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has come an incredible distance in the last 20 years in building a
vibrant young democracy and I think, as (former U.S.) President Bush said, is a
beacon of hope for your neighbors around Asia and the world," Young said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democratic achievements are also good example for China, which is not
celebrating today with the rest of the world, he added.</P>
      <P>China's People's Liberation Army moved against protesters June 4, 1989 following
months of pro-democracy demonstrations in and near Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear how many people were actually killed or injured, but some
estimates put the fatalities at hundreds and others at thousands. The figure
published by the Chinese government was 241 dead, including soldiers, and 7,000
wounded.</P>
      <P>To mark the 20th anniversary of the violent suppression of the demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square by Chinese authorities, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
on June 3 released a statement calling on China to reflect on the incident and
grow from it.</P>
      <P>"China can honor the memory of that day by moving to give the rule of law,
protection of internationally recognized human rights, and democratic
development the same priority as it has given to economic reform," Clinton said.</P>
      <P>She urged that China openly examine "the darker events of its past" and give a
public accounting of "those killed, detained or missing, both to learn and to
heal."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hepatitis B screening of migrant workers should continue: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
06/04/09  18:52:50
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Thursday that Taiwan
should retain its policy of screening new migrant workers for hepatitis B, given
that most of them work in close contact with their employers.</P>
      <P>Yeh was referring to a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
to revoke the policy of testing migrant workers for hepatitis B upon their
arrival in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a committee meeting in the Legislative Yuan, Yeh said the long
existing regulation should be maintained, as it would help to prevent
transmission of the liver disease from migrant workers -- over half of whom are
caregivers -- to the wider population.</P>
      <P>The tests would also help to monitor the health of foreign workers, he added.</P>
      <P>"I will seek to further understand the CDC's decision and will make an
announcement on the matter in two weeks time, "Yeh said, in response to a
question by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Hou Tsai-feng.</P>
      <P>Around 170,000 of the 300,000 foreign workers in Taiwan are caregivers who come
into close contact with their Taiwan employers and families, Hou said.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis B screening of foreign workers upon entry to the country would help
prevent transmission of the disease, if workers test positive, she added.</P>
      <P>Describing the CDC's recent decision as debatable, she said the cancellation of
hepatitis B testing of new migrant workers would put the country's citizens at
risk of contracting the disease.</P>
      <P>Also fielding questions at the legislative session, CDC Deputy Director-General
Chou Chih-hao said the center decided to revoke the screening regulation based
on the consideration that the disease could only be transmitted via blood or
body fluids.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, hepatitis B is usually transmitted only by means of blood
transfusions, sexual intercourse, or the sharing of hypodermic needles, Chou
said, adding that it can also be passed directly from mother to newborn.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported two more cases of swine flu Thursday,
bringing to 16 the total number of influenza A(H1N1) infections recorded in the
country.</P>
      <P>The two infections, confirmed late Wednesday, were both imported cases involving
Taiwanese citizens who returned recently from New York, said Central Epidemics
Command Center (CECC) spokesman Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>Shih said of the 16 cases recorded so far, all were mild infections, and only
one was indigenous.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of the cases were Taiwanese students studying in the United
States, Shih predicted that the number of influenza A (HIN1) infections in
Taiwan will continue to increase in the coming months as more students return
home for the summer vacation.</P>
      <P>One of the new cases was a 25-year-old graduate student of a university in New
York City who returned to Taiwan May 29 via Hong Kong, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>The man came down with a fever and cough June 1 and sought medical treatment
after calling the Centers for Disease Control's 1922 hotline.</P>
      <P>The patient wore a mask throughout his journey from the United States to Taiwan
and stayed home most of the time after he landed, the CECC said, adding that the
patient's fever dropped after he was treated.</P>
      <P>Family members who had had close contact with him were given preventive
medication and asked to monitor their own health, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>As the patient did not begin to experience flu symptoms until 48 hours after his
arrival, the other passengers on the flight to Taiwan have not been listed as
being at risk, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>The other case was a 24-year-old businessman based in New York City who returned
to Taiwan June 1 via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The patient developed muscle pains and a fever May 31 and he sought treatment
June 2 after his return to Taiwan, as the symptoms persisted, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>The CECC said the 55 passengers who shared the flight with him from Hong Kong to
Taiwan are being traced.</P>
      <P>On the New York to Hong Kong leg of the trip, the man took Cathay Pacific flight
CX841 on May 31 and was assigned to seat number 32H. The passengers who sat next
to him, and those three rows in front of and behind him are urged to contact
health authorities immediately, as they are considered at high risk of being
infected, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, 66 countries had officially reported 19,273 cases of influenza
A(H1N1) infection, including 117 deaths, according to the World Health
Organization.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese businessman instructed Taiwanese craftswomen in making rice straw
crafts in southern Taiwan Thursday, in an effort to prepare them for producing
such products to export to Japan at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Sake Miyamura, who is in charge of a Japanese company selling decorative items,
spent Thursday at an elementary school in Tainan County's Houbi township
teaching a group of women to make traditional Japanese crafts with rice straw.</P>
      <P>Houbi township is known for making crafts with rush grass. It developed the
skill of making artifacts with rice stems in recent years.</P>
      <P>Miyamura said Japanese people consume a lot of straw-woven crafts for use by
both households and shrines during New Year holidays. New straw-woven products
are bought to replace the old ones every year, so the consumption amount in
Japan is huge, Miyamura added.</P>
      <P>He said although many Japanese business people imported crafts of rush grass
from China, he prefers selling products made of rice straw because rice stems
better represent Japan's traditional spirit.</P>
      <P>According to Miyamura, few people in Japan can make straw-woven products and the
labor cost is relatively expensive in his country.</P>
      <P>With the help of a Taiwan-Japan exchange association in Tainan County, Miyamura
has visited the county three times this year to learn about cooperation
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Those who learned from Miyamura's instructions Thursday were senior craftswomen
with excellent skills in making artifacts for local markets.</P>
      <P>But they learned that it was not easy to make even a basic braided knot of about
50 cm, one of four ornaments they practiced making Thursday, because making
Japanese artifacts requires strict standards.</P>
      <P>Miyamura said his company will need 10,000 braided knots, and he expressed the
hope that these craftswomen will improve their skills soon so he will be able to
buy rice straw products from Taiwan at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Miyamura arrived in Taiwan Monday, and will return to Ishikawa Prefecture, where
his company is based, Friday.</P>

      <P>Normal water supply for household, agriculture irrigation and industrial use in
Taiwan's northern, central and southern regions is expected to last until late
July, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The government has readied itself for the worst scenario in case of a dry spree
should seasonal plum rain not come, " Su said. "In the worst case scenario,
water for irrigation purposes would be stopped and water for industrial use
limited."</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks following the weekly Cabinet meeting presided over by
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who was briefed by officials from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) about nationwide water supply situations at a time when
a possible water shortage was looming.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, water supply in these regions is expected to remain
stable as of the end of July despite the fact that rainfalls in May averaged
lower than levels recorded in past years.</P>
      <P>As new wet fronts are approaching and if rain pours in the coming days, normal
water supply is likely to be in place through August, MOEA officials added.</P>
      <P>Liu instructed that the Central Emergency Operation Center, a unit set up under
the Executive Yuan to handle natural disasters which was originally to be
dismissed, should keep on operating, citing his grave concern over the
approaching typhoon season.</P>
      <P>The premier also demanded the center review its operations more intensively and
more frequently.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Shihmen Reservoir in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, has taken
in more water thanks to approaching fronts. It has seen the level of its water
conservation increase to 223.1 meters as of noon, providing a temporary relief
to neighboring counties longing for rain.</P>
      <P>It had rained 30 millimeters in the reservoir's water catchment area Thursday
morning. Officials of the MOEA's water resources agency said more rain will fall
in the area in the days ahead.</P>
      <P>However, officials warned that the possibility of a water shortage remains for
southern Taiwan as it has not rained much over the past day.</P>
      <P>According to Central Weather Bureau forecast, the current plum rain fronts will
bring more rain in northern and central Taiwan Thursday and Friday. The fronts
would move toward the south from Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>If no sufficient rain falls in the coming period from August to October, a
serious water shortage might surge in southern Taiwan's Chiayi and Tainan
counties -- an important rice and fruit producing area, warned officials of
local farmers' associations.</P>

      <P>Eight foreign wives of Taiwanese men in southern Chiayi County jointly opened a
take-out restaurant Thursday, and had their wares touted by Chiayi Magistrate
Chen Ming-wen.</P>
      <P>The eight women -- from Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and China -- opened the
restaurant to sell mainly boxed lunches and meals of typical Southeast  Asian
fare and set up their business with assistance from the county government's
Department of Social Affairs.</P>
      <P>To celebrate the restaurant's grand opening, the women staged a catwalk show in
which they displayed the traditional national costumes of their respective
countries.</P>
      <P>They also introduced various ingredients used in preparing some traditional
Southeast Asian foods, including lemongrass, coconut milk and prahoc --
fermented fish paste that is unique to Cambodian cuisine.</P>
      <P>After the show, they offered 50 boxed lunches to their neighbors at a
complimentary price of NT$1 per box, touted by Chen. The lunchboxes sold out
within minutes.</P>
      <P>Chen said the take-out restaurant represents a new partnership between the local
government and the county's "new residents."</P>
      <P>He noted that there are about 13,000 foreign spouses in Chiayi County, making
the county the third-largest administrative area in Taiwan in terms of the
number of foreign spouses living there.</P>
      <P>To improve services to these foreign spouses, he went on, the county government
has since 2006 operated a foreign spouse service center, providing various kinds
of help and advice.</P>
      <P>He added that over the past four years, the county government has helped 1,351

    <TEXT>
      <P>A project to repair the famous alpine railway in the Alishan Forest Recreation
Park in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County will be completed by the end of October,
the Forestry Bureau's Chiayi office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Forestry District Office made the remarks amid reports that Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan was extremely angry at the long delay in repairing the historic
narrow gauge railway in one of Taiwan's most popular tourist spots, which offers
views of spectacular sunrises, ancient trees and mountain scenery.</P>
      <P>Liu was quoted as having said at a meeting with officials in charge of transport
and tourist service affairs Wednesday that the procrastination over the railway
repair project is "intolerable and unacceptable"  and that the delay has
seriously tarnished the government's image.</P>
      <P>The Chan Nao Liao section at the 23.5 kilometer mark of the 71.4 km railway has
been closed since last October due to a series of natural calamities, including
typhoons and torrential rain. Nearly 70 meters of the railway's road base has
collapsed into a ravine, leaving a section of the railway hanging in midair.</P>
      <P>As a result, passengers at present have to disembark from the train at Chan Nao
Liao Station and carry their luggage up a 500-meter mountain trail before
getting on another train at the other end of the damaged section.</P>
      <P>This has drawn vociferous complaints from tourists over the past few months,
with not only local travelers but also tourists from China and other countries
voiced disappointment over the service.</P>
      <P>"It is outrageous that this world-class alpine railway suffers such a world-
class inconvenience, " Liu said at Wednesday's meeting. "At this critical
juncture of promoting our tourism industry, we cannot sit idly by any longer."</P>
      <P>Liu reportedly has ordered Minister-without-Portfolio Ovid Tzeng to coordinate a
quick solution to the issue.</P>
      <P>The Alishan railway, one of just three remaining alpine railways in the world,
is managed by the Forestry  Bureau under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture. The premier has expressed hope that the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications will take over the management of
the railway and that the Forest Bureau will be responsible only for the
railway's soil and water conservation and flood-prevention work.</P>
      <P>The railway has been operated by the Hungtu Alishan International Development
Co. -- a private firm -- under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project since June
19, 2008, and Liu was also quoted as having demanded a review of the propriety
of such an arrangement.</P>
      <P>Yang Hung-chih, a department chief at the Chiayi Forestry District Office, said
the delay in repairing the railway is mainly a result of Hungtu's unwillingness
to assume a 20 percent share of the cost needed for the repair project.</P>
      <P>Under the BOT contract, Hungtu is required to pay for a 20 percent share of the
cost of repairs of damage caused by natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Hungtu previously insisted that last October's disruption was not caused by
natural disasters but rather by flawed soil conservation caused by the Forestry
Bureau's negligence.</P>
      <P>The bureau then commissioned a professional engineering company to conduct a
thorough investigation to determine the cause of the disruption.</P>
      <P>The final investigative report, released Wednesday, concludes that the
disruption was caused by typhoons and torrential downpours in the region last
year and not by Forestry Bureau negligence.</P>
      <P>With Hungtu finally having agreed to pay its 20 percent share of the repair
costs, Yang said the project will proceed immediately and will be completed by
the end of October.</P>

musicians and other artists, Ma returned to Taipei after visiting three of the
country's diplomatic allies in the region -- Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Speaking  upon his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Ma said he
took the three-country trip as a litmus test of his diplomatic policy,  which is
characterized  by pragmatism, flexibility and a diplomatic truce with China.</P>
      <P>"The fruitful results of the tour indicate that our `modus vivendi' diplomatic
strategy is effective and productive, " Ma said confidently.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, he went on, cross-Taiwan Strait relations have turned from
confrontational to reconciliatory, with bilateral exchanges expanding and
becoming increasingly open.</P>
      <P>As a result, Ma said, the two sides of the strait no longer engage in the
diplomatic tug of war that characterized the diplomatic status in previous
administrations. "We can now pursue our diplomatic goals in a normal, reasonable
and dignified way on a reciprocal basis," he added.</P>
      <P>During his visit to El Salvador, Ma attended the inauguration of new Salvadoran
President Mauricio Funes and obtained his commitment to continue promoting
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>During his visits to Belize and Guatemala, Ma also exchanged views with their
top leaders and reaffirmed their determination to continue expanding cooperation
in various fields.</P>
      <P>On his way to and from Central America, Ma made transit stops in Los Angeles and
Seattle, respectively, during which he met with several American congressmen and
politicians for wide-ranging talks. He also had phone conversations with several
key U.S. political figures to seek their continued support for Taiwan's cause.</P>
      <P>Shortly after their return, Ma and first lady Chow Mei-ching paid a visit to
Vice President Vincent Siew at the latter's home. Siew was discharged from the
hospital the previous day following surgery to remove two malignant tumors from
his lungs. He returned to work Thursday, having made a full recovery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Afghan doctors amazed by Chang Gung surgeons' skills</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Afghan surgeon suffering from a serious tongue tumor that British and Indian
doctors dared not touch recently had it removed in Taiwan, thanks to great skill
and extraordinary courage demonstrated by doctors at Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital.</P>
      <P>Abdul Hadi Mateen, 58, underwent successful surgery to have tongue vascular
anomalies or venous malformations  removed and treated, the hospital announced
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Before the two-stage procedure -- performed by a Chang Gung team led by Dr.
Chang Cheng-jen April 27 and May 18 -- Mateen suffered acute pain in the mouth
and could hardly close his mouth because of the vascular anomalies, which looked
like a cluster of rotten strawberries.</P>
      <P>"Now I have a normal mouth and clear throat and bronchus. My life-long pain is
gone," a moved Mateen said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Mateen was accompanied by his son, Abdul Karim Mateen, 30, who is a physician.
The junior Mateen described their feelings before coming to Taiwan as "hopeless,
" and the surgical team's performance as "amazing" and "extraordinary."</P>
      <P>Karim said his father had traveled to the United Kingdom and India many times
and was told by all the doctors they consulted there that surgery would be fatal
and that no-one would dare to perform it, as the tumor was deeply embedded and
expanded from the tongue down to the oropharynx and bronchus.</P>
      <P>In great despair and hopelessness, Karim said, he sought help on the Internet,
where he read a report by Chang on treating tongue vascular anomalies with
lasers. He then wrote Chang and arranged to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Diagnosing Mateen's tongue -- which was three times larger than normal -- Chang
knew through his rich clinical experience that the patient would constantly
suffer bleeding from his tongue during day time and breathlessness and choking
while he was sleeping.</P>
      <P>Chang -- who has treated 1,000-odd venous malformation patients, 20 of which
were tongue vascular anomaly cases -- decided to try a complicated technique
known as intralesional photocoagulation on Mateen.</P>
      <P>"The two parts of the surgical procedure were daunting challenges that could not
have been carried out by a single surgeon, " Chang said at the news conference.</P>
      <P>"Rebuilding a respiratory tract was also a critical step of the surgery," he
said.</P>
      <P>He said that during the operations, he realized why the U.K. and Indian surgeons
would not do it -- cutting the tumor was deemed simply too dangerous, as massive
bleeding would occur as the anomalies were deeply entwined with blood vessels.</P>
      <P>"It took us four hours to remove the tumor system, a surgery that usually would
take only about half an hour," he said.</P>
      <P>The Mateens offered their gratitude to the Chang Gung surgeons, reiterating
that the operation  was successful  beyond  their imaginations.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan and Afghanistan maintain no formal diplomatic relations, it took
the Mateens months to prepare their travel documents before coming to Taiwan
April 23.</P>
      <P>So far, Mateen has paid medical bills to the tune of NT$550,000 (US$17,200) -- a
little more expensive than similar surgery in India but much cheaper than in the
U.K.</P>
      <P>Karim said that after his father is discharged from Chang Gung, they would like
to try some "city tours" around Taiwan before heading home.</P>
      <P>The success of the case is likely to give a boost to the government's  recent
promotion of medical tourism as means of attracting visitors to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's  overall  performance  in environmental protection was scored at 58.85
points by the public, with  the field  of resources  recycling  receiving  the
most satisfaction, according to results of a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nearly half -  48.6 percent -  of the respondents  think environmental ecology
protection is more important than economic development, while some 26.2 percent
believe the opposite, according to the survey conducted by the Taiwan Public
Opinion Studies Association via telephone May 22-24.</P>
      <P>Respondents of the survey also listed air quality, water quality, and soil and
water conservation as the country's priorities.</P>
      <P>Survey respondents gave Taiwan 61.29 points on environmental quality and 65.09
points on diversity of environmental resources, with the full score being 100
points.</P>
      <P>In addition to public opinion on the government's performance in environmental
protection, the survey also includes 14 questions to test the public's level of
environmental awareness, covering fields of knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and
practices. The average score of the test is 62.5 points.</P>
      <P>About 82 percent respondents  have correct knowledge about discourse of
environmental protection and up to 78.9 percent are aware of the government's
promotion in full-scale prohibition against using disposable utensils.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows over 90 percent of respondents think the government should
increase expenditures in environmental protection; over 80 percent said 10
percent of the budget of public constructions should be used in greening
efforts.</P>
      <P>As for practices, the survey shows 51 percent of the respondents learn about
environmental protection through information and 30 percent take part in related
activities at least once week. About 80 percent of respondents said they are
willing to cooperate in related policies.</P>
      <P>The survey results were released two days before the World Environment Day,
which was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 to promote
global awareness of the need to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>The survey collected 1,072 valid samples, and had a margin of error of plus or

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's democratic achievements can serve as good example for China, especially
at a time when the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protest is being
marked, the top U.S. envoy to Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Young, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , said at a
farewell luncheon for him hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce that while
the world is commemorating the Tiananmen Square tragedy, it is important to
emphasize Taiwan's democratic progress in the past two decades.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has come an incredible distance in the last 20 years in building a
vibrant young democracy and I think, as (former U.S.) President Bush said, is a
beacon of hope for your neighbors around Asia and the world," Young said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democratic achievements are also good example for China, which is not
celebrating today with the rest of the world, he added.</P>
      <P>China's People's Liberation Army moved against protesters June 4, 1989 following
months of pro-democracy demonstrations in and near Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear how many people were actually killed or injured, but some
estimates put the fatalities at hundreds and others at thousands. The figure
published by the Chinese government was 241 dead, including soldiers, and 7,000
wounded.</P>
      <P>To mark the 20th anniversary of the violent suppression of the demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square by Chinese authorities, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
on June 3 released a statement calling on China to reflect on the incident and
grow from it.</P>
      <P>"China can honor the memory of that day by moving to give the rule of law,
protection of internationally recognized human rights, and democratic
development the same priority as it has given to economic reform," Clinton said.</P>
      <P>She urged that China openly examine "the darker events of its past" and give a
public accounting of "those killed, detained or missing, both to learn and to
heal."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hepatitis B screening of migrant workers should continue: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
06/04/09  18:52:50
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Thursday that Taiwan
should retain its policy of screening new migrant workers for hepatitis B, given
that most of them work in close contact with their employers.</P>
      <P>Yeh was referring to a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
to revoke the policy of testing migrant workers for hepatitis B upon their
arrival in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a committee meeting in the Legislative Yuan, Yeh said the long
existing regulation should be maintained, as it would help to prevent
transmission of the liver disease from migrant workers -- over half of whom are
caregivers -- to the wider population.</P>
      <P>The tests would also help to monitor the health of foreign workers, he added.</P>
      <P>"I will seek to further understand the CDC's decision and will make an
announcement on the matter in two weeks time, "Yeh said, in response to a
question by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Hou Tsai-feng.</P>
      <P>Around 170,000 of the 300,000 foreign workers in Taiwan are caregivers who come
into close contact with their Taiwan employers and families, Hou said.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis B screening of foreign workers upon entry to the country would help
prevent transmission of the disease, if workers test positive, she added.</P>
      <P>Describing the CDC's recent decision as debatable, she said the cancellation of
hepatitis B testing of new migrant workers would put the country's citizens at
risk of contracting the disease.</P>
      <P>Also fielding questions at the legislative session, CDC Deputy Director-General
Chou Chih-hao said the center decided to revoke the screening regulation based
on the consideration that the disease could only be transmitted via blood or
body fluids.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, hepatitis B is usually transmitted only by means of blood
transfusions, sexual intercourse, or the sharing of hypodermic needles, Chou
said, adding that it can also be passed directly from mother to newborn.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported two more cases of swine flu Thursday,
bringing to 16 the total number of influenza A(H1N1) infections recorded in the
country.</P>
      <P>The two infections, confirmed late Wednesday, were both imported cases involving
Taiwanese citizens who returned recently from New York, said Central Epidemics
Command Center (CECC) spokesman Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>Shih said of the 16 cases recorded so far, all were mild infections, and only
one was indigenous.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of the cases were Taiwanese students studying in the United
States, Shih predicted that the number of influenza A (HIN1) infections in
Taiwan will continue to increase in the coming months as more students return
home for the summer vacation.</P>
      <P>One of the new cases was a 25-year-old graduate student of a university in New
York City who returned to Taiwan May 29 via Hong Kong, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>The man came down with a fever and cough June 1 and sought medical treatment
after calling the Centers for Disease Control's 1922 hotline.</P>
      <P>The patient wore a mask throughout his journey from the United States to Taiwan
and stayed home most of the time after he landed, the CECC said, adding that the
patient's fever dropped after he was treated.</P>
      <P>Family members who had had close contact with him were given preventive
medication and asked to monitor their own health, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>As the patient did not begin to experience flu symptoms until 48 hours after his
arrival, the other passengers on the flight to Taiwan have not been listed as
being at risk, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>The other case was a 24-year-old businessman based in New York City who returned
to Taiwan June 1 via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The patient developed muscle pains and a fever May 31 and he sought treatment
June 2 after his return to Taiwan, as the symptoms persisted, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>The CECC said the 55 passengers who shared the flight with him from Hong Kong to
Taiwan are being traced.</P>
      <P>On the New York to Hong Kong leg of the trip, the man took Cathay Pacific flight
CX841 on May 31 and was assigned to seat number 32H. The passengers who sat next
to him, and those three rows in front of and behind him are urged to contact
health authorities immediately, as they are considered at high risk of being
infected, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, 66 countries had officially reported 19,273 cases of influenza
A(H1N1) infection, including 117 deaths, according to the World Health
Organization.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese businessman instructed Taiwanese craftswomen in making rice straw
crafts in southern Taiwan Thursday, in an effort to prepare them for producing
such products to export to Japan at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Sake Miyamura, who is in charge of a Japanese company selling decorative items,
spent Thursday at an elementary school in Tainan County's Houbi township
teaching a group of women to make traditional Japanese crafts with rice straw.</P>
      <P>Houbi township is known for making crafts with rush grass. It developed the
skill of making artifacts with rice stems in recent years.</P>
      <P>Miyamura said Japanese people consume a lot of straw-woven crafts for use by
both households and shrines during New Year holidays. New straw-woven products
are bought to replace the old ones every year, so the consumption amount in
Japan is huge, Miyamura added.</P>
      <P>He said although many Japanese business people imported crafts of rush grass
from China, he prefers selling products made of rice straw because rice stems
better represent Japan's traditional spirit.</P>
      <P>According to Miyamura, few people in Japan can make straw-woven products and the
labor cost is relatively expensive in his country.</P>
      <P>With the help of a Taiwan-Japan exchange association in Tainan County, Miyamura
has visited the county three times this year to learn about cooperation
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Those who learned from Miyamura's instructions Thursday were senior craftswomen
with excellent skills in making artifacts for local markets.</P>
      <P>But they learned that it was not easy to make even a basic braided knot of about
50 cm, one of four ornaments they practiced making Thursday, because making
Japanese artifacts requires strict standards.</P>
      <P>Miyamura said his company will need 10,000 braided knots, and he expressed the
hope that these craftswomen will improve their skills soon so he will be able to
buy rice straw products from Taiwan at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Miyamura arrived in Taiwan Monday, and will return to Ishikawa Prefecture, where
his company is based, Friday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Normal water supply for household, agriculture irrigation and industrial use in
Taiwan's northern, central and southern regions is expected to last until late
July, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The government has readied itself for the worst scenario in case of a dry spree
should seasonal plum rain not come, " Su said. "In the worst case scenario,
water for irrigation purposes would be stopped and water for industrial use
limited."</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks following the weekly Cabinet meeting presided over by
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who was briefed by officials from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) about nationwide water supply situations at a time when
a possible water shortage was looming.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, water supply in these regions is expected to remain
stable as of the end of July despite the fact that rainfalls in May averaged
lower than levels recorded in past years.</P>
      <P>As new wet fronts are approaching and if rain pours in the coming days, normal
water supply is likely to be in place through August, MOEA officials added.</P>
      <P>Liu instructed that the Central Emergency Operation Center, a unit set up under
the Executive Yuan to handle natural disasters which was originally to be
dismissed, should keep on operating, citing his grave concern over the
approaching typhoon season.</P>
      <P>The premier also demanded the center review its operations more intensively and
more frequently.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Shihmen Reservoir in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, has taken
in more water thanks to approaching fronts. It has seen the level of its water
conservation increase to 223.1 meters as of noon, providing a temporary relief
to neighboring counties longing for rain.</P>
      <P>It had rained 30 millimeters in the reservoir's water catchment area Thursday
morning. Officials of the MOEA's water resources agency said more rain will fall
in the area in the days ahead.</P>
      <P>However, officials warned that the possibility of a water shortage remains for
southern Taiwan as it has not rained much over the past day.</P>
      <P>According to Central Weather Bureau forecast, the current plum rain fronts will
bring more rain in northern and central Taiwan Thursday and Friday. The fronts
would move toward the south from Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>If no sufficient rain falls in the coming period from August to October, a
serious water shortage might surge in southern Taiwan's Chiayi and Tainan
counties -- an important rice and fruit producing area, warned officials of
local farmers' associations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight foreign wives of Taiwanese men in southern Chiayi County jointly opened a
take-out restaurant Thursday, and had their wares touted by Chiayi Magistrate
Chen Ming-wen.</P>
      <P>The eight women -- from Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and China -- opened the
restaurant to sell mainly boxed lunches and meals of typical Southeast  Asian
fare and set up their business with assistance from the county government's
Department of Social Affairs.</P>
      <P>To celebrate the restaurant's grand opening, the women staged a catwalk show in
which they displayed the traditional national costumes of their respective
countries.</P>
      <P>They also introduced various ingredients used in preparing some traditional
Southeast Asian foods, including lemongrass, coconut milk and prahoc --
fermented fish paste that is unique to Cambodian cuisine.</P>
      <P>After the show, they offered 50 boxed lunches to their neighbors at a
complimentary price of NT$1 per box, touted by Chen. The lunchboxes sold out
within minutes.</P>
      <P>Chen said the take-out restaurant represents a new partnership between the local
government and the county's "new residents."</P>
      <P>He noted that there are about 13,000 foreign spouses in Chiayi County, making
the county the third-largest administrative area in Taiwan in terms of the
number of foreign spouses living there.</P>
      <P>To improve services to these foreign spouses, he went on, the county government

    <HEADLINE>Alishan railway to be repaired by October: Forestry Bureau</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A project to repair the famous alpine railway in the Alishan Forest Recreation
Park in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County will be completed by the end of October,
the Forestry Bureau's Chiayi office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Forestry District Office made the remarks amid reports that Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan was extremely angry at the long delay in repairing the historic
narrow gauge railway in one of Taiwan's most popular tourist spots, which offers
views of spectacular sunrises, ancient trees and mountain scenery.</P>
      <P>Liu was quoted as having said at a meeting with officials in charge of transport
and tourist service affairs Wednesday that the procrastination over the railway
repair project is "intolerable and unacceptable"  and that the delay has
seriously tarnished the government's image.</P>
      <P>The Chan Nao Liao section at the 23.5 kilometer mark of the 71.4 km railway has
been closed since last October due to a series of natural calamities, including
typhoons and torrential rain. Nearly 70 meters of the railway's road base has
collapsed into a ravine, leaving a section of the railway hanging in midair.</P>
      <P>As a result, passengers at present have to disembark from the train at Chan Nao
Liao Station and carry their luggage up a 500-meter mountain trail before
getting on another train at the other end of the damaged section.</P>
      <P>This has drawn vociferous complaints from tourists over the past few months,
with not only local travelers but also tourists from China and other countries
voiced disappointment over the service.</P>
      <P>"It is outrageous that this world-class alpine railway suffers such a world-
class inconvenience, " Liu said at Wednesday's meeting. "At this critical
juncture of promoting our tourism industry, we cannot sit idly by any longer."</P>
      <P>Liu reportedly has ordered Minister-without-Portfolio Ovid Tzeng to coordinate a
quick solution to the issue.</P>
      <P>The Alishan railway, one of just three remaining alpine railways in the world,
is managed by the Forestry  Bureau under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture. The premier has expressed hope that the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications will take over the management of
the railway and that the Forest Bureau will be responsible only for the
railway's soil and water conservation and flood-prevention work.</P>
      <P>The railway has been operated by the Hungtu Alishan International Development
Co. -- a private firm -- under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project since June
19, 2008, and Liu was also quoted as having demanded a review of the propriety
of such an arrangement.</P>
      <P>Yang Hung-chih, a department chief at the Chiayi Forestry District Office, said
the delay in repairing the railway is mainly a result of Hungtu's unwillingness
to assume a 20 percent share of the cost needed for the repair project.</P>
      <P>Under the BOT contract, Hungtu is required to pay for a 20 percent share of the
cost of repairs of damage caused by natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Hungtu previously insisted that last October's disruption was not caused by
natural disasters but rather by flawed soil conservation caused by the Forestry
Bureau's negligence.</P>
      <P>The bureau then commissioned a professional engineering company to conduct a
thorough investigation to determine the cause of the disruption.</P>
      <P>The final investigative report, released Wednesday, concludes that the
disruption was caused by typhoons and torrential downpours in the region last
year and not by Forestry Bureau negligence.</P>
      <P>With Hungtu finally having agreed to pay its 20 percent share of the repair
costs, Yang said the project will proceed immediately and will be completed by
the end of October.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday upon arrival home after his just-concluded
Central America diplomatic tour that the trip was very productive and proves the
success of his pragmatic diplomatic policy.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a large delegation  composed of officials, lawmakers,
musicians and other artists, Ma returned to Taipei after visiting three of the
country's diplomatic allies in the region -- Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Speaking  upon his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Ma said he
took the three-country trip as a litmus test of his diplomatic policy,  which is
characterized  by pragmatism, flexibility and a diplomatic truce with China.</P>
      <P>"The fruitful results of the tour indicate that our `modus vivendi' diplomatic
strategy is effective and productive, " Ma said confidently.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, he went on, cross-Taiwan Strait relations have turned from
confrontational to reconciliatory, with bilateral exchanges expanding and
becoming increasingly open.</P>
      <P>As a result, Ma said, the two sides of the strait no longer engage in the
diplomatic tug of war that characterized the diplomatic status in previous
administrations. "We can now pursue our diplomatic goals in a normal, reasonable
and dignified way on a reciprocal basis," he added.</P>
      <P>During his visit to El Salvador, Ma attended the inauguration of new Salvadoran
President Mauricio Funes and obtained his commitment to continue promoting
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>During his visits to Belize and Guatemala, Ma also exchanged views with their
top leaders and reaffirmed their determination to continue expanding cooperation
in various fields.</P>
      <P>On his way to and from Central America, Ma made transit stops in Los Angeles and
Seattle, respectively, during which he met with several American congressmen and
politicians for wide-ranging talks. He also had phone conversations with several
key U.S. political figures to seek their continued support for Taiwan's cause.</P>
      <P>Shortly after their return, Ma and first lady Chow Mei-ching paid a visit to
Vice President Vincent Siew at the latter's home. Siew was discharged from the
hospital the previous day following surgery to remove two malignant tumors from
his lungs. He returned to work Thursday, having made a full recovery.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An Afghan surgeon suffering from a serious tongue tumor that British and Indian
doctors dared not touch recently had it removed in Taiwan, thanks to great skill
and extraordinary courage demonstrated by doctors at Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital.</P>
      <P>Abdul Hadi Mateen, 58, underwent successful surgery to have tongue vascular
anomalies or venous malformations  removed and treated, the hospital announced
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Before the two-stage procedure -- performed by a Chang Gung team led by Dr.
Chang Cheng-jen April 27 and May 18 -- Mateen suffered acute pain in the mouth
and could hardly close his mouth because of the vascular anomalies, which looked
like a cluster of rotten strawberries.</P>
      <P>"Now I have a normal mouth and clear throat and bronchus. My life-long pain is
gone," a moved Mateen said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Mateen was accompanied by his son, Abdul Karim Mateen, 30, who is a physician.
The junior Mateen described their feelings before coming to Taiwan as "hopeless,
" and the surgical team's performance as "amazing" and "extraordinary."</P>
      <P>Karim said his father had traveled to the United Kingdom and India many times
and was told by all the doctors they consulted there that surgery would be fatal
and that no-one would dare to perform it, as the tumor was deeply embedded and
expanded from the tongue down to the oropharynx and bronchus.</P>
      <P>In great despair and hopelessness, Karim said, he sought help on the Internet,
where he read a report by Chang on treating tongue vascular anomalies with
lasers. He then wrote Chang and arranged to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Diagnosing Mateen's tongue -- which was three times larger than normal -- Chang
knew through his rich clinical experience that the patient would constantly
suffer bleeding from his tongue during day time and breathlessness and choking
while he was sleeping.</P>
      <P>Chang -- who has treated 1,000-odd venous malformation patients, 20 of which
were tongue vascular anomaly cases -- decided to try a complicated technique
known as intralesional photocoagulation on Mateen.</P>
      <P>"The two parts of the surgical procedure were daunting challenges that could not
have been carried out by a single surgeon, " Chang said at the news conference.</P>
      <P>"Rebuilding a respiratory tract was also a critical step of the surgery," he
said.</P>
      <P>He said that during the operations, he realized why the U.K. and Indian surgeons
would not do it -- cutting the tumor was deemed simply too dangerous, as massive
bleeding would occur as the anomalies were deeply entwined with blood vessels.</P>
      <P>"It took us four hours to remove the tumor system, a surgery that usually would
take only about half an hour," he said.</P>
      <P>The Mateens offered their gratitude to the Chang Gung surgeons, reiterating
that the operation  was successful  beyond  their imaginations.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan and Afghanistan maintain no formal diplomatic relations, it took
the Mateens months to prepare their travel documents before coming to Taiwan
April 23.</P>
      <P>So far, Mateen has paid medical bills to the tune of NT$550,000 (US$17,200) -- a
little more expensive than similar surgery in India but much cheaper than in the
U.K.</P>
      <P>Karim said that after his father is discharged from Chang Gung, they would like
to try some "city tours" around Taiwan before heading home.</P>
      <P>The success of the case is likely to give a boost to the government's  recent
promotion of medical tourism as means of attracting visitors to Taiwan.</P>

1723:  Adam  Smith,  the  Scottish political economist and philosopher, is born.
His "Wealth of Nations" was the foundation of classical free-market economic
theory.

1883: British economist John Maynard Keynes is born. He proposed that high
unemployment, being a result of insufficient consumer spending, could be
relieved by government-sponsored programs.

1926: Chiang Kai-shek becomes commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary
Forces in China.

1945: The supreme commanders from the United States, Great Britain, France, and
the Soviet Union sign a statement in Berlin that divides Germany into four
occupation zones under their respective controls.

1947: An Outer Mongolian cavalry battalion, aided by planes with Soviet
insignia, attack Chinese troops at Peitashan in eastern Sinkiang.

1947: U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall announces his plan to help Europe
recover financially from the effects of World War II.

1963: King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand arrive in the
Republic of China for a state visit.

1967: The Six-Day War, which lasts for 132 hours and 30 minutes, breaks out
between Israel and the neighboring countries of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.

1968:  Five years after the assassination of his brother, President John
Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy is shot in the head and shoulder and dies at the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He was 42.

1972: The ROC severs diplomatic relations with Greece.

1976: A joint communique pledging close cooperation between Lesotho and the ROC

Guatemala, arrives in Taipei for a week-long visit.

1988: Kay Cottee sails into Sydney harbor, becoming the first woman to sail
nonstop around the world alone.

1989: The Solidarity party defeats the communists in the first free Polish
elections since World War I.

1989: U.S. President George Bush suspends government sales and private military
exports to mainland China to protest the Chinese army's crackdown on student
demonstrations in Beijing.

1996: President Lee Teng-hui appoints Vice President Lien Chan to serve
concurrently as ROC premier. The Cabinet is reshuffled three days later.

1999: Yugoslav and NATO officers meet in Macedonia to discuss the withdrawal of
Serb forces from Kosovo.

2000: Former ROC Premier Vincent Siew turns down an offer of a job as a senior
adviser to President Chen Shui-bian.

2001: Chen Poh-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, says that in addition to financial aid, the Republic of China is to
offer economic advice to its allies in the same way the United States helped the
island some 50 years ago.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a wise and good man
holds in awe. He holds in awe the Laws of God, persons in authority, and the
words of wisdom of holy men. A fool, on the other hand, does not know that there
are Laws of God; he, therefore, has no reverence for them; he is disrespectful
to persons in authority, and condemns the words of wisdom of holy men."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung mayor opposes expansion of coal-fired generators</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu expressed vehement opposition Friday to plans by Taiwan
Power Co. (Taipower) to expand its existing coal-fired generators in her city,
saying she does not want the country's major electricity supplier to further
pollute the southern port city.</P>
      <P>"Kaohsiung City will absolutely not accept Taipower's coal-fired generator
expansion  plan,  which is under screening  by the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration and pending approval," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Taipower is engaging in technical maneuvers to expand its coal-fired
electricity generation at its Dalin plant in the name of renewing its
facilities, " Chen went on.</P>
      <P>According  to officials  from the Kaohsiung Department  of Environmental
Protection, Taipower is planning to remodel the Nos. 1-5 generators at the Dalin
plant into four coal-fired generators, which will substantially increase its
power generation capacity, while retaining the No. 6 generator, which is a
liquefied natural gas (LNG)-fired model.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipower is aiming to generate a much greater volume of electricity
to serve the north of the country rather than the south, Chen said Kaohsiung
City should not be a victim of Taipower's business maneuvers.</P>
      <P>If the Taipower expansion plan is approved, she continued, Kaohsiung City's
carbon dioxide emissions will be greatly increased.</P>
      <P>"These extra emissions would only be evened out if the entire city were to stop
driving cars and motorbikes for four consecutive years, " she claimed.</P>
      <P>It is unfair of Taipower to operate the much cleaner LNG-fired generators in
other cities and counties around the country while seeking to expand coal-fired
generation in Kaohsiung, she argued.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted in 2005 by the Kaohsiung Department of
Environmental Protection, the carbon dioxide emissions of the Dalin plant
totaled 6.89 million tons per year.</P>
      <P>"The emissions would shoot up to 17.69 million tons per year if the expansion
plan is approved and carried out, " department officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will not open fully to Chinese advertising: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not fully open local media for Chinese advertising and will
in particular maintain its ban on real estate and investment advertisements,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman Liu Te-hsun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the comments after a legislative committee deferred the screening  of
amendments  to  regulations  governing  Chinese advertisements for products and
services on the local market due to a boycott by opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislators, who said permitting such Chinese ads will
enable China to manipulate Taiwanese media.</P>
      <P>If passed, the amendments will allow Chinese firms to advertise products and
services in Taiwanese media without requiring permission from Taiwan's
government.</P>
      <P>Liu said that MAC has convened at least two supra-ministerial meetings and an
initial resolution has been reached that includes the proviso that Chinese
product commercials will only be allowed in Taiwanese media if the products
being advertised are actually sold in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This means that property ads and investment-soliciting ads by China's central
and local governments, as well as ads promoting images of Chinese enterprises
and ads for China's official or semi-official activities, are not permitted,
according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu also claimed that there is "no necessity" for the 8,000 items of Chinese
products currently allowed to be sold in Taiwan to be advertised because they
already have clear and distinctive product positioning.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, there is a need for Chinese firms to advertise  their
products and services that are currently not available in Taiwan and are seeking
a clear brand image following increasingly frequent exchanges between Taiwan and
China, such as law firms, product patent rights, intellectual property rights,
and corporate image. He added that there is still room for discussion on whether
these types of ads should be allowed.</P>
      <P>At present,  Chinese advertisers must obtain permission to advertise in
Taiwanese media, according to Article 34 of the Statute Governing Relations
Between Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>However, until the statute is amended, the government will continue to impose
fines on media outlets that carry such illegal ads, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, the Ministry of the Interior has issued 20 fines to local media
outlets for illegally running real estate advertisements placed by Chinese
firms, including one each to the Taipei-based China Times and the Commercial
Times in May, according to statistics.</P>

      <P>The members of a Chinese purchase delegation that made a May 31-June 5 visit to
Taiwan are expected to place orders worth more than US$2.2 billion, the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>More than 40 Chinese companies took part in the mission organized by China's
Association of Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits (AETATS) , an
organization set up by China's Ministry of Commerce to handle cross-Taiwan
Strait trade deals and promote commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>Most of the participants have won bids to provide products under China's latest
economic stimulus measures that encourage  home appliance purchases by rural
consumers.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang, the buyers had one-on-one sessions
with more than 300 Taiwanese suppliers, mainly focusing on home appliances and
consumer electronics  such as television sets and computers.</P>
      <P>The buyers are likely to place orders worth US$827 million by the end of July,
while more orders worth a total of US$1.4 billion are expected over the coming
year, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TAITRA officials said two more purchase delegations organized by the
AETATS are scheduled to arrive in Taiwan between late June and July, with the
products targeted including daily necessities, processed food, plastics,

      <P>The daughter of former President Chen Shui-bian,  Chen Hsing-yu, was listed
Friday as an individual requiring to give exit-entrance notification should she
wish to leave the country, according to the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu was indicted Wednesday for giving false testimony during
investigations into the ex-first family's alleged corruption and money
laundering over the past two years and was listed as a person whose movements in
relation to attempted overseas travel should be monitored by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>She was the final member of the scandal-embroiled ex-first family to be indicted
on corruption and money laundering charges. All 14 of the other people in the
family, including former President Chen Shui-bian,  his wife Wu Shu-jen,  their
son Chen Chih-chung, daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and son-in-law Chao Chien-
ming, have been indicted since 2006.</P>
      <P>Also indicted Wednesday in same case was Taipei 101 former Chairwoman Diana
Chen, for giving false testimony.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, she lied about having delivered a check for NT$10
million under the name of a friend, Chen Chin-wen, to Wu Shu-jen's brother Wu
Jin-mao in 2004, denying that she made any such delivery.</P>
      <P>After being transferred into several overseas bank accounts, the money
eventually ended up in a Swiss bank account owned jointly by Chen Shui-bian's
son Chen Chih-chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-jen was first indicted Nov. 3,  2006 for claiming reimbursements
totalling NT$14.8 million from her husband's special state affairs funds using
invoices she took from other people.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian was not indicted at that time because he was protected by
presidential immunity, but as soon as he left office in May 2008, he was charged
along with his wife and 13 former aides, officials and family members for taking
a total of NT$490 million in bribes during his eight years in office.</P>
      <P>The money came to light thanks to an international anti-money laundering group
that alerted Taiwanese authorities to the ex-first family's overseas bank
accounts in 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent rains in southern Taiwan have increased the water supply in Tsengwen
Reservoir in Tainan County, ensuring that the water supply in the region will
remain stable until at least late July.</P>
      <P>Heavy precipitation on Thursday pushed the reservoir's water level to 194.48
meters and boosted the amount of stored water by 3 percent to 140 million cubic
meters, Chiu Chi-fang, director of the Tsengwen Reservoir Administration Center,
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Though the Tsengwen Reservoir supplies some water to households and factories in
the area, its main purpose is to meet the irrigation needs of local farms.</P>
      <P>Because of Thursday's rainfall, water needed for the second planting of rice in
the Tainan and neighboring Chiayi areas, to start June 16, has been secured,
Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Thursday's rains also provided much needed relief to other parts of the country.
More than 200 millimeters of rain accumulated in northern and central Taiwan,
and Hualien County on the island's east coast.</P>
      <P>The rainfall especially benefited Shihmen and Feitsui reservoirs, northern
Taiwan's two main reservoirs.</P>
      <P>The Shihmen Reservoir's water level rose to 223.1 meters as of Thursday noon,
providing at least temporary relief to neighboring counties that have recently
battled water shortages.</P>
      <P>As wet fronts are moving toward southern Taiwan, more showers are expected there
over the weekend, the Central Weather Bureau forecast.</P>
      <P>If southern Taiwan experiences heavy rains in the coming days, the region's
water supply is likely to be stable through August, Ministry of Economic Affairs
officials said.</P>
      <P>They warned, however, that the possibility of a water shortage in the region
after July remains.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Thursday following the weekly Cabinet
meeting that "the government has readied itself for the worst case scenario if
seasonal plum rains do not show up."</P>
      <P>"In the worst case scenario, water for irrigation purposes would be stopped and
water for industrial use would be restricted, " he said.</P>
      <P>Inadequate rainfall between August and October could result in a serious water
shortage in southern Taiwan's Chiayi and Tainan counties -- important vegetable
and fruit producing areas -- warned local farmers' associations.</P>

      <P>A physically  challenged  American psychotherapist was presented with the 2009
Fervent Global Love of Lives Medal in Taiwan Thursday, in honor of his
contribution in encouraging people to cherish and respect life.</P>
      <P>Daniel Gottlieb, a psychologist and family therapist in New Jersey, received the
award along with other 11 winners. The medal has been awarded annually since
being established in 1998 by the Taiwan-based Chou Ta-Kuan Cultural and
Education Foundation.</P>
      <P>Gottlieb was paralyzed below the neck in a traffic accident 30 years ago while
out looking for a gift for his wife for their 10th wedding anniversary. He was
33 at the time.</P>
      <P>Full of remorse and unable to accept his condition after the accident, Gottlieb
suffered further blows when his wife divorced him and his parents and sister
died within the next five years, leaving him no reason to stay alive.</P>
      <P>While he was lying in an intensive care unit one night and wishing he would not
have to wake up after shutting his eyes, a nurse in grief asked him whether he
would counsel her on dealing with the pain and grief she felt after losing a
loved one.</P>
      <P>Gottlieb listened and helped alleviate her pain, making him realize that he
still had the ability to help people and spread love. After that, he resumed his
professional practice.</P>
      <P>Gottlieb said that although the traffic accident took away the use of his body,
he still had the ability to alleviate other's pain as a psychologist.</P>
      <P>"Books only taught me psychology superficially. The accident that disabled my
limbs taught me to sit quietly and open my heart and listen to the world," he
said.</P>
      <P>Gottlieb also hosts a radio show on Philadelphia's National Public Radio station
and has also written a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer for 10 years.</P>
      <P>He has also written a number of books on psychotherapy, including "Voices of
Conflict: Voices of Healing, " which is a compilation of some  of his columns
and observations  from his professional experience.</P>
      <P>Another of his works, "Letters to Sam, " which has sold 2 million copies in
America, was written for his autistic grandson Sam. Gottlieb donated the book's
royalties to organizations that treat autism and deal with other children's
health issues.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) will begin selling folding bicycles on
June 9 to mark its 122nd anniversary and promote the government's policy of
carbon dioxide emission reduction.</P>
      <P>The electric and non-motorized folding bicycles were introduced at an event
Friday that presented a wide array of memorabilia in commemoration of the 122nd
anniversary of the opening of Taiwan's first rail line.</P>
      <P>The electric folding bicycles, the world's first of their kind, are manufactured
by a company in southern Taiwan and can be easily folded in one second by
pressing  a button,  said a company representative.</P>
      <P>The electric folding bikes come in two sizes --12 inches and 16 inches -- that
weigh 21 kilograms and 23 kilograms and carry price tags of NT$19,800
(US$607.36) and NT$26,800, respectively.</P>
      <P>Consumers can apply for a subsidy of NT$3,000 when buying one of the eco-
friendly bikes, the representative said.</P>
      <P>Once folded, the bike can be rolled on its wheels like luggage. The bike's
battery can last 30-40 kilometers per charge and requires about two hours of
recharging, he added.</P>
      <P>As for non-electric folding bikes, there are three different sizes -- 12 inches,
16 inches and 20 inches -- which sell for NT$5,980, NT$8,800, and NT$9,800,
respectively. The 12-inch model weighs 12 kg, while the 16-inch and 20-inch
bikes weigh 23 kg, according to the company representative.</P>
      <P>The bikes can be ordered at train stations around Taiwan from June 9-14. About
40 types of souvenirs will also go on sale as part of the anniversary sale,
including oval shaped stainless lunch boxes, commemorative coins, commemorative
stamps, TRA antique glass cups, specially designed lunch boxes, train models and
i-cash cards.</P>
      <P>The bicycles and some of the memorabilia can also be ordered at participating
7-Eleven convenience stores until July 15.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet has asked Taiwan Water Corp. to come up with an incentive program
that will reduce water consumption, but Taiwan Water's chairman warned that the
idea would deepen the company's losses.</P>
      <P>Water Resources Agency Director Chen Shen-hsien said Premier Liu Chao-hsiuan has
asked the water company to devise discounts that will encourage water
conservation, possibly mirroring those offered by Taiwan's power utility to
reduce electricity consumption.</P>
      <P>The government wants Taiwan Water to submit a plan within one month and have it
finalized by October so that it can be implemented starting in November, when
the dry season begins, he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to household tap water users, heavy commercial consumers of water
will also be offered incentives, including cash rewards, if they succeed in
saving water, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Water Corp. Chairman Liao Tsung-sheng reacted negatively to the proposed
plan, however. He said the company was already suffering financial woes even
before industrial water consumption declined by 20 percent in the first five
months of this year as a result of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan Water Corp. will suffer a further shortfall of an estimated NT$1.02
billion in revenues a year if new water-saving incentives are put in place," he
warned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County, a Taiwan-held outlying island group with a population of around
84,000 that lies off the coast of China's Fujian province, may boast the best
welfare benefits of any of Taiwan's cities and counties.</P>
      <P>The list of benefits is long and one that residents in other parts of the
country may envy.</P>
      <P>For a start, Kinmen residents over 65 years old receive a monthly stipend of at
least NT$3,000 per month, the same amount given to stay-at-home mothers every
month.</P>
      <P>Students from kindergarten through junior high school get free lunches at
schools, and they also don't pay for tuition and miscellaneous fees.</P>
      <P>Then there is free public transportation on buses or boats. Families receive
subsidies from the county government for having a child, and cervical cancer
vaccinations given to female students in senior high or vocation schools are
also paid for by the county.</P>
      <P>A series of new benefits for students was added this year. Students from
kindergarten though junior high school now get free fresh milk, and local high
school or college students receive education and transportation subsidies.</P>
      <P>College students can receive up to NT$10,000 in subsidies and NT$4,000 in
transportation vouchers during a school year.</P>
      <P>Even students from Taiwan proper who study in Kinmen schools are covered by the
generous benefits.</P>
      <P>These many benefits are financed by the success of Kinmen Kaoliang Corp., which
is widely known for its strong liquor made of fermented sorghum that has long
served as the county's cash cow.</P>
      <P>Controlled by the county government, the company posted sales of NT$12.2 billion
in 2008, the highest since its inception in 1953 and 8.04 percent higher than in
2007. Pre-tax profit was NT$4.78 billion, also a new record.</P>
      <P>Although the company increased its production capacity to 24.71 million liters
last year, it still has been unable to keep pace with growing demand, but that
has not stopped the county from making the liquor part of its package of
benefits.</P>
      <P>For years, it has sold kaoliang at a discount during Chinese New Year, the
Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival, and because of the good
quality of the liquor, residents can easily earn themselves a"red envelope" of
between NT$2,000 and NT$3,000 by reselling it.</P>
      <P>A liquor voucher  plan was also introduced  this year to commemorate the 60th
anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou, a battle fought over Kinmen in the
Taiwan Strait during the Chinese Civil War in 1949.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, each Kinmen resident is being presented by Kinmen Kaoliang
Liquor Inc., with vouchers worth NT$3,600 on Tomb Sweeping Day, the Dragon Boat
Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, which can be used to buy the
company's products at local retail outlets.</P>
      <P>With these many benefits, it may not be surprising then that Kinmen County
recorded the fastest population growth of any city or county, with its current
population far outpacing the 76,491 people living there in 2006.</P>

      <P>Taipei City's Department of Environmental Protection marked World Environment
Day Friday by opening an exhibition that showcased creative ways to turn
recycled flags and banners into beautiful garments and home decorations.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes trash can become gold simply by using your creativity, which is also
the spirit of this exhibition, " said Deputy Mayor Lin Chien-yuan at a news
conference co-hosted by the Recycle Creative Association.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is meaningful to celebrate the day by educating the public on
recycling resources and making something useful out of them because
environmental protection should start at the community level and among the
younger generation, he added.</P>
      <P>Lian Yuan-lin, chairwomen of the Recycle Creative Association, said on the same
occasion that it is important to think about how things can be reused before
casting them away.</P>
      <P>You can actually find aesthetics in discarded materials, which can become new
resources if you put them in the right place, " she said.</P>
      <P>Lian designed six garments made of election flags and advertising banners that
were modeled at the press conference by six female Taipei City councilors -- Lin
Yi-hua, Hsu Shu-hwa, Wu Si-yao, Wang Hung-wei, Wang Chih-ping and Chieh Mei-sha.</P>
      <P>According to Lian, each election produces tens of thousands of tons of cloth
flags, and they are a good material not only for clothes but also for shopping
bags and other products.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will run through June 8, features booths teaching citizens
to turn recycled materials such as compact discs, tin cans and banners into
decorative items that can add a touch of style to their homes.</P>
      <P>Established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 to mark the opening
of the Stockholm  Conference  on the Human Environment, World Environment Day is
celebrated annually on June 5 to stimulate worldwide awareness of the
environment and enhance attention and action.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a record high of US$312.64 billion at the
end of May, an increase of US$7.983 billion over the April figure, the country's
central bank reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The central bank said the increase was mainly due to growing returns on its
investments.</P>
      <P>The appreciation of the euro, the British pound and other major currencies
against the U.S. dollar also contributed to the increase as foreign exchange
reserves denominated in these currencies were worth more in U.S. dollar terms,
according to the bank.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves rank fourth in the world, trailing only China
(US$1.95 trillion as of the end of March, the latest figure available) , Japan
(US$983.2 billion as of the end of April), and Russia (US$353.8 billion as of
May).</P>
      <P>India, with US$250.2 billion in foreign exchange reserves as of May 22, and
South Korea, with US$225.8 billion in reserves, followed behind Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's wholesale price index (WPI) fell 13.45 percent in May from a
year ago to 99.59, the biggest single-month contraction ever.</P>
      <P>The sharp decline resulted mainly from lower international prices for
agricultural commodities and industrial raw materials compared to the same
period last year, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.08 percent in May compared to a year
earlier but rose 0.42 percent month-on-month, according to the DGBAS.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Nongovernmental Hospitals and Clinics Association (NHCA) signed a
contract with a Chinese medical care management consultant company Friday in
hopes that the company will promote Taiwan's medical services in China and help
lure Chinese patients to the island for treatment.</P>
      <P>The cooperation with the Guardian Healthcare Co. Ltd.,  a subsidiary company of
the Beijing-based Harvest Medical Investment and Operation Group, was built to
promote medical exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, said Wu
Yen-ming, the chief executive of the NHCA's Taiwan Task Force for Medical
Travel.</P>
      <P>Under the cooperation program, Guardian Healthcare will help publicize Taiwanese
medical clinics and hospitals on the mainland and refer Chinese patients to
Taiwan for medical treatment, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>According to the association, Guardian Healthcare serves mainly Chinese people
and Taiwanese business people operating in China with health care management and
patient referral services. The association has been contracted by Taiwan's
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) to carry out its medical services
globalisation project, aimed at promoting Taiwan's medical treatment services in
the international market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is eager to develop medical tourism, much as Singapore and Thailand have
done, by offering its relatively cheaper medical care to people in developed
countries and quality services to well-off people in developing countries who
cannot find the level of expertise in their own country.</P>
      <P>Wu from the association said they have decided to focus on China as the major
source of clients for Taiwanese medical services. However, there are barriers
blocking mainlanders from coming to Taiwan for medical care, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened the doors on Aug. 1, 2007 for Chinese people to come to the island
to receive medical treatment, but only allow those who  need  living  donor
organ  transplants,  maxillofacial reconstruction,  artificial insemination,
joint replacement, and cardiovascular invasive treatment.</P>
      <P>Local hospital operators said China is supposed to be the closest market for
Taiwan's medical treatment services after the two sides launched first-ever
regular direct transport services.</P>
      <P>They said the government  should lift current restrictions prohibiting a larger
number of Chinese to come to Taiwan for treatment.</P>
      <P>Statistics show the current number of Chinese patients coming to Taiwan for
medical care is small.</P>
      <P>According to Department of Health statistics, the number of Chinese patients who
applied for permission from the Mainland Affairs Council to come to Taiwan for
medical treatment has never surpassed 100 a year since the second half of 2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An indigenous children's choir from the southern county of Pingtung is scheduled
to depart Sunday for Europe, where they will present ancient songs of the Paiwan
tribe to their audience.</P>
      <P>The tour, which will take the team to Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Germany,
is organized with the co-sponsorship of the Teco Technology Foundation.  It will
mark the first overseas performance by the 20-member choir from the Tai Wu
Elementary School, said school principal Jean Yen-hui.</P>
      <P>Jean said all the songs to be sung by the choir are traditional tunes passed
down from generation to generation within the Paiwan tribe. The younger
generation in the tribe are becoming increasingly unfamiliar with the songs due
to a cultural crisis experienced by all indigenous tribes in Taiwan, Jean said.</P>
      <P>Due to previous periods of oppression  of aborigines  and continuing pressures
to assimilate into mainstream society, fewer young aborigines in Taiwan can
speak their native language or sing their tribe's songs.</P>
      <P>The songs were taught to students after the school recorded the singing
demonstrated by Paiwan elders, Jean said.</P>
      <P>According to Camake Valaule, a school teacher who serves as the choir's
instructor, such faithfulness to tradition has distinguished the choir from
others.</P>
      <P>The choir's cause "to sing one's own songs" obtained the support of many, and
eventually won it the rare opportunity to perform in Europe, Camake said.</P>
      <P>Although the choir was not officially established until 2006, the singing by
children from the small, mountainous school of less than 50 students won fame as
early as 2003 when one of them obtained the first prize in a national indigenous
singing contest.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, the school's singing group has received numerous
invitations to perform in various areas around the country, and their songs have
also been included in some music recordings.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the Teco Technology Foundation, the choir has since 2007
received NT$200,000 (US$6,154) per year in corporate sponsorships, which helps
relieve its financial difficulty, Jean said.</P>

      <P>The annual Asian Canoe Polo Championship will take place in Hualien County in
eastern Taiwan from June 12-14, with Taiwan's men determined to grab their
fourth consecutive title, the event organizer said Friday.</P>
      <P>Canoe polo is a competitive ball sport played by two teams, each with five
players in their own kayaks on a defined water area.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Chih-man, secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei Canoe
Association, Taiwan will compete with teams from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Malaysia, and Iran in men's women's and under-21 categories.</P>
      <P>Japan and Iran are expected to provide the toughest competition to Taiwan, which
holds ambitions of winning the three titles up for grabs, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  teams trained  in Germany  earlier this year in preparation for the
Asian championships and the World Games, which will take place in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung in July. Canoe polo is one of the more than 30 events on
the World Games schedule.</P>
      <P>The sport has elements of polo, basketball, handball, soccer, and canoeing, but
has relatively flexible standards when it comes to physical contact, making the
sport fun to watch, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The canoe polo event drew more than 20,000 spectators at the previous World
Games held in Duisburg, Germany, four years ago, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>The Swiss-based International Canoe Federation, which is the umbrella
organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide, has sent staff
members to Asia and Africa to promote canoe polo, which is most popular in
Europe, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The Hualien County government estimated that the event, which will host 400
people,  including athletes, coaches, and their families, is expected to inject
about NT$10 million into the county's economy,</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of rice farmers from eastern Taiwan's Hualien and Taitung counties
protested Friday in front of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture's (COA)
office, demanding it pay more subsidies for the damage done to their crops by
cold weather.</P>
      <P>Angry farmers, led by Kuomintang Legislator Fu Kun-chi, almost pulled down the
COA's gate while demanding to meet with COA Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung over the
issue.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-teh, director-general of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency, met the
farmers on behalf of the chairman, who was away to observe a military exercise.</P>
      <P>Fu said the spring harvest in more than 2,000 hectares of rice paddies in
Hualien County was hit hard by low temperatures in early April, and asked that
the COA subsidize NT$16,000 (US$490) to farmers for each hectare of farmland
that had no harvest to help offset their losses.</P>
      <P>The subsidy is twice the level that the COA plans to give to the farmers. If
farmers are not planning to reap their crop even it is not fully destroyed, they
will get an additional NT$12,000 in subsidy for each hectare of land.
Altogether, farmers can get NT$20,000 in compensation for each hectare of
fruitless paddy.</P>
      <P>Hualien and Taitung farmers are extremely dissatisfied with the COA's offers,
which they said are much lower than their production costs and will leave them
penniless.</P>
      <P>A farmer surnamed Huang said he earned only NT$20,000 in the spring harvest
after deducting production costs.</P>
      <P>"I was not even able to pay my children's school tuition with what I gained,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen, leading a dozen
Taitung farmers, met COA Deputy Minister Huang Yu-tsai over the same issue.
Kuang argued that the COA should pay NT$45,000 per hectare in compensation to
the affected farmers.</P>
      <P>Huang promised to give the farmers' a response by next Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite damage to the crops' spring harvest in eastern Taiwan, COA officials
said Thursday that rice prices will remain stable, because the damaged crops'
impact on the country's overall rice production is limited.</P>
      <P>Rice grown in eastern Taiwan enjoys widespread popularity among consumers
because of its high quality.</P>

      <P>The economic recession has triggered changes in office workers' lifestyles by
forcing them to reduce their late-night  social  activities,  a survey targeting
young and middle-aged workers has found.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Havo Preventive  Medicine Institute to
understand changes in lifestyles among local office workers over the past six
months.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, released Thursday, found that office workers have
been more willing to participate in family activities and live a relatively
healthier lifestyle since the recession hit, but they also continue to show
disdain for exercise.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that a growing number of people are choosing to stay at
home after work. Some 40 percent of respondents said they are spending more time
at home, mostly to surf the Internet and sleep, while neglecting to exercise.</P>
      <P>As for changes in eating habits in Taiwan, 20 percent to 30 percent of
respondents say they eat more fruits and vegetables, eat out less and cook more
at home.</P>
      <P>One-quarter  of respondents said they are cutting back on unhealthy behavior,
such as staying up late or going out. One in eight respondents who normally
drink said they are drinking less and one in 15 smokers said they are smoking
less, the survey found.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted from April 15 to May 15. The male-female ratio was
40/60 and the average age of respondents was 36.7. The survey received 865 valid

      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong have agreed to set up quasi-official organizations that
will represent them in bilateral talks on economic and cultural issues and
possibly lead to meetings between top officials from their two governments.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng and visiting Hong
Kong Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Stephen Lam Sui-lung
jointly made the announcement at a press conference held following their talks
in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Fu said the two parties agreed that Taiwan will act to
establish a Taiwan-Hong Kong economic and cultural cooperation promotion
committee while Hong Kong will open a Hong Kong-Taiwan trade cooperation
commission under its Trade Development Council.</P>
      <P>The planned organizations  will focus on promoting  trade, investment, travel
and cultural exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong, he said.</P>
      <P>Fu further noted that high-ranking officials from Taiwan and Hong Kong will also
participate in activities organized by the two new organizations to strengthen
normal interactions between the Taiwan and Hong Kong governments.</P>
      <P>Such interaction was not possible until relations between Taiwan and China
improved after Ma Ying-jeou became Taiwan's president in May 2008, Fu said.</P>
      <P>Lam said the planned institutes are expected to be established in the short term
and hold their first meeting soon after.</P>
      <P>As to what rank of official will attend the future meetings under the new
cooperation platform, both Fu and Lam said the issue still needs to be
discussed, but Fu said "the official level will be lifted higher gradually."</P>
      <P>Asked about when Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tseng, who has previously
expressed interest in visiting Taiwan, will come here, Lam replied that he
believes the planned organizations will help create an environment enabling the
head of Hong Kong's government to visit Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>Lam arrived in Taiwan Thursday for the talks with Fu at the MAC's invitation.
His arrival marks the first official visit to Taiwan by a policy-making-level
official of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A World Trade Organization committee has agreed to a request by Taiwan to extend
by one month until July 9 the submission of its instrument of accession to the
WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), a Ministry of Economic Affairs
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Economics Vice Minister John Deng said Taiwan requested the extension for
"administrative" reasons, mainly involving a scheduling snafu.</P>
      <P>The WTO Committee on Government Procurement formally approved Taiwan's
application to enter the GPA on Dec. 9, 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was required to send its instrument of accession to the WTO Secretariat
within six months to complete  the accession procedure. The agreement then
enters into force on the 30th day following the date of its accession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Legislative Yuan endorsed the decision to admit Taiwan into the GPA on
May 15. According to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official, there was
then a two-week waiting period for the legislature to express dissent before
President Ma Ying-jeou could sign the instrument of accession as required.</P>
      <P>Because the two-week period had not expired by the time Ma departed on a trip to
Central America, the government asked for an extension, the MOFA official said.</P>
      <P>The GPA was adopted by the WTO in 1981 with the purpose of opening up as much
government procurement as possible to international competition.</P>
      <P>It was designed to make laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding
government procurement more transparent and to ensure they do not protect
domestic products or suppliers, or discriminate against foreign products or
suppliers.</P>
      <P>There are currently 40 members of the GPA, most of them developed countries.</P>
      <P>Following the accession, Taiwan's government procurement market will be open to
other GPA members, and vice versa, based on the principles of reciprocity and
national treatment.</P>
      <P>The WTO Secretariat estimates the government procurement market in GPA signatory
countries totals US$5.55 trillion per year, which will now be open to Taiwanese
companies.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that his administration has not relaxed
efforts to strengthen the military's arsenal and combat preparedness despite its

      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with a delegation of overseas offspring of
cadets of the now-defunct Whampoa Military Academy. The academy, based in
southern China's Guangzhou, officially opening in 1924 and served as the
training ground for the Kuomintang's most prestigious commanders until it lost

the computerized war games to test coordination between the military and the

External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>More than 40 Chinese companies took part in the mission organized by China's
Association of Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits (AETATS) , an
organization set up by China's Ministry of Commerce to handle cross-Taiwan
Strait trade deals and promote commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>Most of the participants have won bids to provide products under China's latest
economic stimulus measures that encourage  home appliance purchases by rural
consumers.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang, the buyers had one-on-one sessions
with more than 300 Taiwanese suppliers, mainly focusing on home appliances and
consumer electronics  such as television sets and computers.</P>
      <P>The buyers are likely to place orders worth US$827 million by the end of July,
while more orders worth a total of US$1.4 billion are expected over the coming
year, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TAITRA officials said two more purchase delegations organized by the
AETATS are scheduled to arrive in Taiwan between late June and July, with the
products targeted including daily necessities, processed food, plastics,
petrochemicals, machinery equipment and electronics.</P>

      <P>The daughter of former President Chen Shui-bian,  Chen Hsing-yu, was listed
Friday as an individual requiring to give exit-entrance notification should she
wish to leave the country, according to the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu was indicted Wednesday for giving false testimony during
investigations into the ex-first family's alleged corruption and money
laundering over the past two years and was listed as a person whose movements in
relation to attempted overseas travel should be monitored by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>She was the final member of the scandal-embroiled ex-first family to be indicted
on corruption and money laundering charges. All 14 of the other people in the
family, including former President Chen Shui-bian,  his wife Wu Shu-jen,  their
son Chen Chih-chung, daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and son-in-law Chao Chien-
ming, have been indicted since 2006.</P>
      <P>Also indicted Wednesday in same case was Taipei 101 former Chairwoman Diana
Chen, for giving false testimony.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, she lied about having delivered a check for NT$10
million under the name of a friend, Chen Chin-wen, to Wu Shu-jen's brother Wu
Jin-mao in 2004, denying that she made any such delivery.</P>
      <P>After being transferred into several overseas bank accounts, the money
eventually ended up in a Swiss bank account owned jointly by Chen Shui-bian's
son Chen Chih-chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-jen was first indicted Nov. 3,  2006 for claiming reimbursements
totalling NT$14.8 million from her husband's special state affairs funds using
invoices she took from other people.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian was not indicted at that time because he was protected by
presidential immunity, but as soon as he left office in May 2008, he was charged
along with his wife and 13 former aides, officials and family members for taking
a total of NT$490 million in bribes during his eight years in office.</P>
      <P>The money came to light thanks to an international anti-money laundering group
that alerted Taiwanese authorities to the ex-first family's overseas bank
accounts in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Water supply in southern Taiwan stable until late July</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent rains in southern Taiwan have increased the water supply in Tsengwen
Reservoir in Tainan County, ensuring that the water supply in the region will
remain stable until at least late July.</P>
      <P>Heavy precipitation on Thursday pushed the reservoir's water level to 194.48
meters and boosted the amount of stored water by 3 percent to 140 million cubic
meters, Chiu Chi-fang, director of the Tsengwen Reservoir Administration Center,
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Though the Tsengwen Reservoir supplies some water to households and factories in
the area, its main purpose is to meet the irrigation needs of local farms.</P>
      <P>Because of Thursday's rainfall, water needed for the second planting of rice in
the Tainan and neighboring Chiayi areas, to start June 16, has been secured,
Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Thursday's rains also provided much needed relief to other parts of the country.
More than 200 millimeters of rain accumulated in northern and central Taiwan,
and Hualien County on the island's east coast.</P>
      <P>The rainfall especially benefited Shihmen and Feitsui reservoirs, northern
Taiwan's two main reservoirs.</P>
      <P>The Shihmen Reservoir's water level rose to 223.1 meters as of Thursday noon,
providing at least temporary relief to neighboring counties that have recently
battled water shortages.</P>
      <P>As wet fronts are moving toward southern Taiwan, more showers are expected there
over the weekend, the Central Weather Bureau forecast.</P>
      <P>If southern Taiwan experiences heavy rains in the coming days, the region's
water supply is likely to be stable through August, Ministry of Economic Affairs
officials said.</P>
      <P>They warned, however, that the possibility of a water shortage in the region
after July remains.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Thursday following the weekly Cabinet
meeting that "the government has readied itself for the worst case scenario if
seasonal plum rains do not show up."</P>
      <P>"In the worst case scenario, water for irrigation purposes would be stopped and
water for industrial use would be restricted, " he said.</P>
      <P>Inadequate rainfall between August and October could result in a serious water
shortage in southern Taiwan's Chiayi and Tainan counties -- important vegetable
and fruit producing areas -- warned local farmers' associations.</P>

      <P>A physically  challenged  American psychotherapist was presented with the 2009
Fervent Global Love of Lives Medal in Taiwan Thursday, in honor of his
contribution in encouraging people to cherish and respect life.</P>
      <P>Daniel Gottlieb, a psychologist and family therapist in New Jersey, received the
award along with other 11 winners. The medal has been awarded annually since
being established in 1998 by the Taiwan-based Chou Ta-Kuan Cultural and
Education Foundation.</P>
      <P>Gottlieb was paralyzed below the neck in a traffic accident 30 years ago while
out looking for a gift for his wife for their 10th wedding anniversary. He was
33 at the time.</P>
      <P>Full of remorse and unable to accept his condition after the accident, Gottlieb
suffered further blows when his wife divorced him and his parents and sister
died within the next five years, leaving him no reason to stay alive.</P>
      <P>While he was lying in an intensive care unit one night and wishing he would not
have to wake up after shutting his eyes, a nurse in grief asked him whether he
would counsel her on dealing with the pain and grief she felt after losing a
loved one.</P>
      <P>Gottlieb listened and helped alleviate her pain, making him realize that he
still had the ability to help people and spread love. After that, he resumed his
professional practice.</P>
      <P>Gottlieb said that although the traffic accident took away the use of his body,
he still had the ability to alleviate other's pain as a psychologist.</P>
      <P>"Books only taught me psychology superficially. The accident that disabled my
limbs taught me to sit quietly and open my heart and listen to the world," he
said.</P>
      <P>Gottlieb also hosts a radio show on Philadelphia's National Public Radio station
and has also written a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer for 10 years.</P>
      <P>He has also written a number of books on psychotherapy, including "Voices of
Conflict: Voices of Healing, " which is a compilation of some  of his columns
and observations  from his professional experience.</P>
      <P>Another of his works, "Letters to Sam, " which has sold 2 million copies in
America, was written for his autistic grandson Sam. Gottlieb donated the book's
royalties to organizations that treat autism and deal with other children's
health issues.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) will begin selling folding bicycles on
June 9 to mark its 122nd anniversary and promote the government's policy of
carbon dioxide emission reduction.</P>
      <P>The electric and non-motorized folding bicycles were introduced at an event
Friday that presented a wide array of memorabilia in commemoration of the 122nd
anniversary of the opening of Taiwan's first rail line.</P>
      <P>The electric folding bicycles, the world's first of their kind, are manufactured
by a company in southern Taiwan and can be easily folded in one second by
pressing  a button,  said a company representative.</P>
      <P>The electric folding bikes come in two sizes --12 inches and 16 inches -- that
weigh 21 kilograms and 23 kilograms and carry price tags of NT$19,800
(US$607.36) and NT$26,800, respectively.</P>
      <P>Consumers can apply for a subsidy of NT$3,000 when buying one of the eco-
friendly bikes, the representative said.</P>
      <P>Once folded, the bike can be rolled on its wheels like luggage. The bike's
battery can last 30-40 kilometers per charge and requires about two hours of
recharging, he added.</P>
      <P>As for non-electric folding bikes, there are three different sizes -- 12 inches,
16 inches and 20 inches -- which sell for NT$5,980, NT$8,800, and NT$9,800,
respectively. The 12-inch model weighs 12 kg, while the 16-inch and 20-inch
bikes weigh 23 kg, according to the company representative.</P>
      <P>The bikes can be ordered at train stations around Taiwan from June 9-14. About
40 types of souvenirs will also go on sale as part of the anniversary sale,
including oval shaped stainless lunch boxes, commemorative coins, commemorative
stamps, TRA antique glass cups, specially designed lunch boxes, train models and
i-cash cards.</P>
      <P>The bicycles and some of the memorabilia can also be ordered at participating
7-Eleven convenience stores until July 15.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has asked Taiwan Water Corp. to come up with an incentive program
that will reduce water consumption, but Taiwan Water's chairman warned that the
idea would deepen the company's losses.</P>
      <P>Water Resources Agency Director Chen Shen-hsien said Premier Liu Chao-hsiuan has
asked the water company to devise discounts that will encourage water
conservation, possibly mirroring those offered by Taiwan's power utility to
reduce electricity consumption.</P>
      <P>The government wants Taiwan Water to submit a plan within one month and have it
finalized by October so that it can be implemented starting in November, when
the dry season begins, he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to household tap water users, heavy commercial consumers of water
will also be offered incentives, including cash rewards, if they succeed in
saving water, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Water Corp. Chairman Liao Tsung-sheng reacted negatively to the proposed
plan, however. He said the company was already suffering financial woes even
before industrial water consumption declined by 20 percent in the first five
months of this year as a result of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan Water Corp. will suffer a further shortfall of an estimated NT$1.02
billion in revenues a year if new water-saving incentives are put in place," he
warned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County, a Taiwan-held outlying island group with a population of around
84,000 that lies off the coast of China's Fujian province, may boast the best
welfare benefits of any of Taiwan's cities and counties.</P>
      <P>The list of benefits is long and one that residents in other parts of the
country may envy.</P>
      <P>For a start, Kinmen residents over 65 years old receive a monthly stipend of at
least NT$3,000 per month, the same amount given to stay-at-home mothers every
month.</P>
      <P>Students from kindergarten through junior high school get free lunches at
schools, and they also don't pay for tuition and miscellaneous fees.</P>
      <P>Then there is free public transportation on buses or boats. Families receive
subsidies from the county government for having a child, and cervical cancer
vaccinations given to female students in senior high or vocation schools are
also paid for by the county.</P>
      <P>A series of new benefits for students was added this year. Students from
kindergarten though junior high school now get free fresh milk, and local high
school or college students receive education and transportation subsidies.</P>
      <P>College students can receive up to NT$10,000 in subsidies and NT$4,000 in
transportation vouchers during a school year.</P>
      <P>Even students from Taiwan proper who study in Kinmen schools are covered by the
generous benefits.</P>
      <P>These many benefits are financed by the success of Kinmen Kaoliang Corp., which
is widely known for its strong liquor made of fermented sorghum that has long
served as the county's cash cow.</P>
      <P>Controlled by the county government, the company posted sales of NT$12.2 billion
in 2008, the highest since its inception in 1953 and 8.04 percent higher than in
2007. Pre-tax profit was NT$4.78 billion, also a new record.</P>
      <P>Although the company increased its production capacity to 24.71 million liters
last year, it still has been unable to keep pace with growing demand, but that
has not stopped the county from making the liquor part of its package of
benefits.</P>
      <P>For years, it has sold kaoliang at a discount during Chinese New Year, the
Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival, and because of the good
quality of the liquor, residents can easily earn themselves a"red envelope" of
between NT$2,000 and NT$3,000 by reselling it.</P>
      <P>A liquor voucher  plan was also introduced  this year to commemorate the 60th
anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou, a battle fought over Kinmen in the
Taiwan Strait during the Chinese Civil War in 1949.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, each Kinmen resident is being presented by Kinmen Kaoliang
Liquor Inc., with vouchers worth NT$3,600 on Tomb Sweeping Day, the Dragon Boat
Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, which can be used to buy the
company's products at local retail outlets.</P>
      <P>With these many benefits, it may not be surprising then that Kinmen County
recorded the fastest population growth of any city or county, with its current
population far outpacing the 76,491 people living there in 2006.</P>

      <P>Taipei City's Department of Environmental Protection marked World Environment
Day Friday by opening an exhibition that showcased creative ways to turn
recycled flags and banners into beautiful garments and home decorations.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes trash can become gold simply by using your creativity, which is also
the spirit of this exhibition, " said Deputy Mayor Lin Chien-yuan at a news
conference co-hosted by the Recycle Creative Association.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is meaningful to celebrate the day by educating the public on
recycling resources and making something useful out of them because
environmental protection should start at the community level and among the
younger generation, he added.</P>
      <P>Lian Yuan-lin, chairwomen of the Recycle Creative Association, said on the same
occasion that it is important to think about how things can be reused before
casting them away.</P>
      <P>You can actually find aesthetics in discarded materials, which can become new
resources if you put them in the right place, " she said.</P>
      <P>Lian designed six garments made of election flags and advertising banners that
were modeled at the press conference by six female Taipei City councilors -- Lin

      <P>According to Lian, each election produces tens of thousands of tons of cloth
flags, and they are a good material not only for clothes but also for shopping
bags and other products.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will run through June 8, features booths teaching citizens

      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a record high of US$312.64 billion at the
end of May, an increase of US$7.983 billion over the April figure, the country's
central bank reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The central bank said the increase was mainly due to growing returns on its
investments.</P>
      <P>The appreciation of the euro, the British pound and other major currencies
against the U.S. dollar also contributed to the increase as foreign exchange
reserves denominated in these currencies were worth more in U.S. dollar terms,
according to the bank.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves rank fourth in the world, trailing only China
(US$1.95 trillion as of the end of March, the latest figure available) , Japan
(US$983.2 billion as of the end of April), and Russia (US$353.8 billion as of
May).</P>
      <P>India, with US$250.2 billion in foreign exchange reserves as of May 22, and
South Korea, with US$225.8 billion in reserves, followed behind Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's wholesale price index (WPI) fell 13.45 percent in May from a
year ago to 99.59, the biggest single-month contraction ever.</P>
      <P>The sharp decline resulted mainly from lower international prices for
agricultural commodities and industrial raw materials compared to the same
period last year, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.08 percent in May compared to a year
earlier but rose 0.42 percent month-on-month, according to the DGBAS.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Nongovernmental Hospitals and Clinics Association (NHCA) signed a
contract with a Chinese medical care management consultant company Friday in
hopes that the company will promote Taiwan's medical services in China and help
lure Chinese patients to the island for treatment.</P>
      <P>The cooperation with the Guardian Healthcare Co. Ltd.,  a subsidiary company of
the Beijing-based Harvest Medical Investment and Operation Group, was built to
promote medical exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, said Wu
Yen-ming, the chief executive of the NHCA's Taiwan Task Force for Medical
Travel.</P>
      <P>Under the cooperation program, Guardian Healthcare will help publicize Taiwanese
medical clinics and hospitals on the mainland and refer Chinese patients to
Taiwan for medical treatment, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>According to the association, Guardian Healthcare serves mainly Chinese people
and Taiwanese business people operating in China with health care management and
patient referral services. The association has been contracted by Taiwan's
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) to carry out its medical services
globalisation project, aimed at promoting Taiwan's medical treatment services in
the international market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is eager to develop medical tourism, much as Singapore and Thailand have
done, by offering its relatively cheaper medical care to people in developed
countries and quality services to well-off people in developing countries who
cannot find the level of expertise in their own country.</P>
      <P>Wu from the association said they have decided to focus on China as the major
source of clients for Taiwanese medical services. However, there are barriers
blocking mainlanders from coming to Taiwan for medical care, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened the doors on Aug. 1, 2007 for Chinese people to come to the island
to receive medical treatment, but only allow those who  need  living  donor
organ  transplants,  maxillofacial reconstruction,  artificial insemination,
joint replacement, and cardiovascular invasive treatment.</P>
      <P>Local hospital operators said China is supposed to be the closest market for
Taiwan's medical treatment services after the two sides launched first-ever
regular direct transport services.</P>
      <P>They said the government  should lift current restrictions prohibiting a larger
number of Chinese to come to Taiwan for treatment.</P>
      <P>Statistics show the current number of Chinese patients coming to Taiwan for

    <HEADLINE>Indigenous children's choir from Pingtung to perform in Europe</HEADLINE>

      <P>An indigenous children's choir from the southern county of Pingtung is scheduled
to depart Sunday for Europe, where they will present ancient songs of the Paiwan
tribe to their audience.</P>
      <P>The tour, which will take the team to Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Germany,
is organized with the co-sponsorship of the Teco Technology Foundation.  It will
mark the first overseas performance by the 20-member choir from the Tai Wu
Elementary School, said school principal Jean Yen-hui.</P>
      <P>Jean said all the songs to be sung by the choir are traditional tunes passed
down from generation to generation within the Paiwan tribe. The younger
generation in the tribe are becoming increasingly unfamiliar with the songs due
to a cultural crisis experienced by all indigenous tribes in Taiwan, Jean said.</P>
      <P>Due to previous periods of oppression  of aborigines  and continuing pressures
to assimilate into mainstream society, fewer young aborigines in Taiwan can
speak their native language or sing their tribe's songs.</P>
      <P>The songs were taught to students after the school recorded the singing
demonstrated by Paiwan elders, Jean said.</P>
      <P>According to Camake Valaule, a school teacher who serves as the choir's
instructor, such faithfulness to tradition has distinguished the choir from
others.</P>
      <P>The choir's cause "to sing one's own songs" obtained the support of many, and
eventually won it the rare opportunity to perform in Europe, Camake said.</P>
      <P>Although the choir was not officially established until 2006, the singing by
children from the small, mountainous school of less than 50 students won fame as
early as 2003 when one of them obtained the first prize in a national indigenous
singing contest.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, the school's singing group has received numerous
invitations to perform in various areas around the country, and their songs have
also been included in some music recordings.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the Teco Technology Foundation, the choir has since 2007
received NT$200,000 (US$6,154) per year in corporate sponsorships, which helps
relieve its financial difficulty, Jean said.</P>

      <P>The annual Asian Canoe Polo Championship will take place in Hualien County in
eastern Taiwan from June 12-14, with Taiwan's men determined to grab their
fourth consecutive title, the event organizer said Friday.</P>
      <P>Canoe polo is a competitive ball sport played by two teams, each with five
players in their own kayaks on a defined water area.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Chih-man, secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei Canoe
Association, Taiwan will compete with teams from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Malaysia, and Iran in men's women's and under-21 categories.</P>
      <P>Japan and Iran are expected to provide the toughest competition to Taiwan, which
holds ambitions of winning the three titles up for grabs, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  teams trained  in Germany  earlier this year in preparation for the
Asian championships and the World Games, which will take place in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung in July. Canoe polo is one of the more than 30 events on
the World Games schedule.</P>
      <P>The sport has elements of polo, basketball, handball, soccer, and canoeing, but
has relatively flexible standards when it comes to physical contact, making the
sport fun to watch, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The canoe polo event drew more than 20,000 spectators at the previous World
Games held in Duisburg, Germany, four years ago, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>The Swiss-based International Canoe Federation, which is the umbrella
organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide, has sent staff
members to Asia and Africa to promote canoe polo, which is most popular in
Europe, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The Hualien County government estimated that the event, which will host 400
people,  including athletes, coaches, and their families, is expected to inject
about NT$10 million into the county's economy,</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of rice farmers from eastern Taiwan's Hualien and Taitung counties
protested Friday in front of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture's (COA)
office, demanding it pay more subsidies for the damage done to their crops by
cold weather.</P>
      <P>Angry farmers, led by Kuomintang Legislator Fu Kun-chi, almost pulled down the
COA's gate while demanding to meet with COA Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung over the
issue.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-teh, director-general of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency, met the
farmers on behalf of the chairman, who was away to observe a military exercise.</P>
      <P>Fu said the spring harvest in more than 2,000 hectares of rice paddies in
Hualien County was hit hard by low temperatures in early April, and asked that
the COA subsidize NT$16,000 (US$490) to farmers for each hectare of farmland
that had no harvest to help offset their losses.</P>
      <P>The subsidy is twice the level that the COA plans to give to the farmers. If
farmers are not planning to reap their crop even it is not fully destroyed, they
will get an additional NT$12,000 in subsidy for each hectare of land.
Altogether, farmers can get NT$20,000 in compensation for each hectare of
fruitless paddy.</P>
      <P>Hualien and Taitung farmers are extremely dissatisfied with the COA's offers,
which they said are much lower than their production costs and will leave them
penniless.</P>
      <P>A farmer surnamed Huang said he earned only NT$20,000 in the spring harvest
after deducting production costs.</P>
      <P>"I was not even able to pay my children's school tuition with what I gained,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen, leading a dozen
Taitung farmers, met COA Deputy Minister Huang Yu-tsai over the same issue.
Kuang argued that the COA should pay NT$45,000 per hectare in compensation to
the affected farmers.</P>
      <P>Huang promised to give the farmers' a response by next Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite damage to the crops' spring harvest in eastern Taiwan, COA officials
said Thursday that rice prices will remain stable, because the damaged crops'
impact on the country's overall rice production is limited.</P>
      <P>Rice grown in eastern Taiwan enjoys widespread popularity among consumers
because of its high quality.</P>

      <P>The economic recession has triggered changes in office workers' lifestyles by
forcing them to reduce their late-night  social  activities,  a survey targeting
young and middle-aged workers has found.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Havo Preventive  Medicine Institute to
understand changes in lifestyles among local office workers over the past six
months.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, released Thursday, found that office workers have
been more willing to participate in family activities and live a relatively
healthier lifestyle since the recession hit, but they also continue to show
disdain for exercise.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that a growing number of people are choosing to stay at
home after work. Some 40 percent of respondents said they are spending more time
at home, mostly to surf the Internet and sleep, while neglecting to exercise.</P>
      <P>As for changes in eating habits in Taiwan, 20 percent to 30 percent of
respondents say they eat more fruits and vegetables, eat out less and cook more
at home.</P>
      <P>One-quarter  of respondents said they are cutting back on unhealthy behavior,
such as staying up late or going out. One in eight respondents who normally
drink said they are drinking less and one in 15 smokers said they are smoking
less, the survey found.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted from April 15 to May 15. The male-female ratio was
40/60 and the average age of respondents was 36.7. The survey received 865 valid

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong have agreed to set up quasi-official organizations that
will represent them in bilateral talks on economic and cultural issues and
possibly lead to meetings between top officials from their two governments.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng and visiting Hong
Kong Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Stephen Lam Sui-lung
jointly made the announcement at a press conference held following their talks
in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Fu said the two parties agreed that Taiwan will act to
establish a Taiwan-Hong Kong economic and cultural cooperation promotion
committee while Hong Kong will open a Hong Kong-Taiwan trade cooperation
commission under its Trade Development Council.</P>
      <P>The planned organizations  will focus on promoting  trade, investment, travel
and cultural exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong, he said.</P>
      <P>Fu further noted that high-ranking officials from Taiwan and Hong Kong will also
participate in activities organized by the two new organizations to strengthen
normal interactions between the Taiwan and Hong Kong governments.</P>
      <P>Such interaction was not possible until relations between Taiwan and China
improved after Ma Ying-jeou became Taiwan's president in May 2008, Fu said.</P>
      <P>Lam said the planned institutes are expected to be established in the short term
and hold their first meeting soon after.</P>
      <P>As to what rank of official will attend the future meetings under the new
cooperation platform, both Fu and Lam said the issue still needs to be
discussed, but Fu said "the official level will be lifted higher gradually."</P>
      <P>Asked about when Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tseng, who has previously
expressed interest in visiting Taiwan, will come here, Lam replied that he
believes the planned organizations will help create an environment enabling the
head of Hong Kong's government to visit Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>Lam arrived in Taiwan Thursday for the talks with Fu at the MAC's invitation.
His arrival marks the first official visit to Taiwan by a policy-making-level
official of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A World Trade Organization committee has agreed to a request by Taiwan to extend
by one month until July 9 the submission of its instrument of accession to the
WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), a Ministry of Economic Affairs
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Economics Vice Minister John Deng said Taiwan requested the extension for
"administrative" reasons, mainly involving a scheduling snafu.</P>
      <P>The WTO Committee on Government Procurement formally approved Taiwan's
application to enter the GPA on Dec. 9, 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was required to send its instrument of accession to the WTO Secretariat
within six months to complete  the accession procedure. The agreement then
enters into force on the 30th day following the date of its accession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Legislative Yuan endorsed the decision to admit Taiwan into the GPA on
May 15. According to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official, there was
then a two-week waiting period for the legislature to express dissent before
President Ma Ying-jeou could sign the instrument of accession as required.</P>
      <P>Because the two-week period had not expired by the time Ma departed on a trip to
Central America, the government asked for an extension, the MOFA official said.</P>
      <P>The GPA was adopted by the WTO in 1981 with the purpose of opening up as much
government procurement as possible to international competition.</P>
      <P>It was designed to make laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding
government procurement more transparent and to ensure they do not protect
domestic products or suppliers, or discriminate against foreign products or
suppliers.</P>
      <P>There are currently 40 members of the GPA, most of them developed countries.</P>
      <P>Following the accession, Taiwan's government procurement market will be open to
other GPA members, and vice versa, based on the principles of reciprocity and
national treatment.</P>
      <P>The WTO Secretariat estimates the government procurement market in GPA signatory
countries totals US$5.55 trillion per year, which will now be open to Taiwanese
companies.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that his administration has not relaxed
efforts to strengthen the military's arsenal and combat preparedness despite its
progress in improving relations with China.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with a delegation of overseas offspring of
cadets of the now-defunct Whampoa Military Academy. The academy, based in
southern China's Guangzhou, officially opening in 1924 and served as the
training ground for the Kuomintang's most prestigious commanders until it lost
the Chinese civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Ma, who just returned to Taipei the previous day after a three-leg Central
America diplomatic tour, told his guests that he got up at 4 a.m. Friday to
participate in a virtual military exercise simulating an attempted invasion of
Taiwan by China.</P>
      <P>In addition to military personnel, senior government officials also took part in
the computerized war games to test coordination between the military and the
executive branch.</P>
      <P>Ma said the war games were part of Taiwan's efforts to beef up its defense
capabilities and combat preparedness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO extends deadline for Taiwan to submit GPA document</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A World Trade Organization committee has agreed to a request by Taiwan to extend
by one month until July 9 the submission of its instrument of accession to the
WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), a Ministry of Economic Affairs
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Economics Vice Minister John Deng said Taiwan requested the extension for
"administrative" reasons, mainly involving a scheduling snafu.</P>
      <P>The WTO Committee on Government Procurement formally approved Taiwan's
application to enter the GPA on Dec. 9, 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was required to send its instrument of accession to the WTO Secretariat
within six months to complete  the accession procedure. The agreement then
enters into force on the 30th day following the date of its accession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Legislative Yuan endorsed the decision to admit Taiwan into the GPA on
May 15. According to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official, there was
then a two-week waiting period for the legislature to express dissent before
President Ma Ying-jeou could sign the instrument of accession as required.</P>
      <P>Because the two-week period had not expired by the time Ma departed on a trip to
Central America, the government asked for an extension, the MOFA official said.</P>
      <P>The GPA was adopted by the WTO in 1981 with the purpose of opening up as much
government procurement as possible to international competition.</P>
      <P>It was designed to make laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding
government procurement more transparent and to ensure they do not protect
domestic products or suppliers, or discriminate against foreign products or
suppliers.</P>
      <P>There are currently 40 members of the GPA, most of them developed countries.</P>
      <P>Following the accession, Taiwan's government procurement market will be open to
other GPA members, and vice versa, based on the principles of reciprocity and
national treatment.</P>
      <P>The WTO Secretariat estimates the government procurement market in GPA signatory
countries totals US$5.55 trillion per year, which will now be open to Taiwanese
companies.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will evaluate whether to allow
semiconductor manufacturers to move their 12-inch wafer fabs to China during a
review in July of existing restrictions on China-bound investment by Taiwanese
businesses, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Woody Duh, head of the ministry's Industrial Development Bureau,
the government will comply with the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for
Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>The multilateral arrangement was established in 1996 to ensure that transfers of
these items do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military
capabilities that undermine regional and international security and stability.</P>
      <P>The arrangement does not restrict the export of 0.18-micron chipmaking
technology but require participating states to decide on a case-by-case basis
whether to allow the export of technologies using processes smaller than
0.18-microns.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far allowed chipmakers to produce only 8-inch or smaller
semiconductor wafers and to use 0.18-micron or larger processes in China.</P>
      <P>Currently, 0.13-micron or smaller processes are mainly used by 12-inch wafer
fabs.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported Saturday Taiwan's first imported
case of valley fever for the year, which involved a Taiwanese citizen returning
recently from the United States, where the disease is endemic.</P>
      <P>This was the third valley fever case ever recorded in Taiwan. The previous two
cases, also imported, were recorded in 2005 and 1991, respectively, according to
a statement issued by the CDC.</P>
      <P>The latest case was a 30-year-old woman who was in the United States between
July 1, 2008 and May 1, 2009. The infection was diagnosed June 3 through blood
tests, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>Valley fever is caused by Coccidioides immitis, a fungus commonly found in the
soil of desert regions in the United States, Mexico, and Central and South
America, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>People can be infected after inhaling the fungus spores in the air. The disease
is not spread from person to person.</P>
      <P>While many infected persons display no symptoms, some may develop fever, cough,
chills, night sweats, headache, joint aches, chest pain, and a red spotty rash.</P>

      <P>Hordes of people descended upon the 2009 Taichung Summer Travel Fair Saturday,
looking for bargains among a wide variety of discounted tour packages.</P>
      <P>By the time the World Trade Center Taichung opened its doors for the show
Saturday morning, a long line of people extending all the way to a nearby road
had built up, causing serious traffic congestion in the surrounding
neighborhood.</P>
      <P>Many visitors said they were looking for an interesting but inexpensive tour
package suitable for a summer vacation for the whole family.</P>
      <P>Huang Lin-huei, a project manager of Taichung-based Bosstar International Co.
Ltd. -- the fair's organizer -- said that most of the travel agencies
participating in the three-day fair that opened Friday are offering discounted
domestic and overseas tour packages to attract buyers.</P>
      <P>For example, Huang said, a seven-day tour to Thailand and Hong Kong is being
offered for NT$18,000 (US$550) per adult, with children enjoying a further
reduction of NT$4,000 per person.</P>
      <P>As to local tours, "paying the same price for a bed and breakfast as in the
past, you can now not only have the bed and breakfast, but also a free afternoon
tea, a visit to a hot spring and extra tour guide services, " said Huang. "The
packages really offer big incentives."</P>
      <P>Affected by the global outbreak of a new strain of swine flu, known formally as
influenza A (H1N1) , the overseas travel market declined by 30 percent in May
but the domestic market grew by between 10 percent and 20 percent, Huang said,
noting that there are now signs showing that overseas travel is slowly
recovering.</P>
      <P>More than 150 local and foreign travel business operators, including Star
Cruises, have set up 250 booths at the annual travel fair in the central Taiwan
city.</P>
      <P>They are promoting services ranging from stays at hot spring hotels or upscale
business hostels and rural tour packages to leisure-oriented and bicycle-related
treks and overseas honeymoon packages, according to Bosstar.</P>

      <P>Computex Taipei 2009 attracted more visitors and generated more new business
than last year's show despite adverse market conditions and the global swine flu
outbreak, a sign that the global economy may be on the rebound, show organizers
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"This year's Computex Taipei was in the global limelight with international
coverage from the British Broadcasting Corporation, the New York Times,
Bloomberg and NHK. It also served as an important benchmark of global economic
recovery, " said Walter Yeh, executive vice president of the semi-official trade
promotion body Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>"It demonstrated that new business opportunities lie in new innovative products,
" added Yeh, speaking at the show's final-day press  conference  to close  the
world's  leading  information communication technology (ICT) show.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, this year's Computex Taipei, which hosted 1,712 exhibitors
occupying 4,498 booths, received 32,178 international buyers from 214 countries
and territories, an increase of 1 percent compared to the previous year and
generated US$20 billion in business.</P>
      <P>TAITRA arranged more than 2,000 one-on-one procurement meetings attended by 256
overseas companies from 42 countries, which generated US$100 million in on-site
business on their own and created US$700 million in follow-up business.</P>
      <P>The show also attracted more than 100,000 international and local visitors
during its first four days June 2-5, an increase of 5 percent over last year's
number, he said.</P>
      <P>The United States, Japan, Hong Kong, China and South Korea were the top five
countries represented by international buyers, with Australia a new addition to
the top 10 this year, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Chang Li, deputy secretary-general of the show's co-organizer, the Taipei
Computer Association, attributed Computex Taipei's success to its evolving
status as a multi-industry info-hub and platform for companies to launch new
products.</P>
      <P>"International buyers want new products with innovative features, but with a
reasonal price tag, and Taiwanese companies always manage to achieve that, "
Chang said. "I believe next year Computex will see bigger growth, as more
Chinese companies and overseas companies return to the show after the global
economy recovers."</P>
      <P>The show annually previews the coming year's hottest trends, and this  year's
Computex  was  about  netbooks,  green-tech  and self-branding, according to
TAITRA.</P>
      <P>Buyers included big names such as Siemens and Alcatel-Lucent from Germany, Best
Buy and Future Shop from Canada, Esprinet from Italy and Ryoden from Japan,
TAITRA said, adding that most of them showed great interest in notebooks,
netbooks, GPS devices, and LCD monitors.</P>
      <P>Noting that Computex Taipei will celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2010, Yeh
said the show has transformed itself into not only the world's leading ICT
procurement platform, but also a perfect world stage for launching new products
and technology.</P>

      <P>More than 65 percent of businesses have plans to recruit fresh graduates this
year, about the same as last year when the job market was stronger, according to
the results of a survey released Saturday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>Of all the new jobs being offered by these businesses, 17.68 percent will go to
fresh graduates, the survey conducted by 1111 Job Bank showed.</P>
      <P>The largest portion -- 38.89 percent -- of the positions are in the areas of
customer service,  sales and trade. Operational, technical and maintenance
positions account for 9.26 percent, and administrative positions account for
6.48 percent.</P>
      <P>Although the percentage  of companies looking to hire new graduates remained
about the same, the weak economy is being reflected in the average starting
monthly salary being offered to fresh graduates, which at NT$24,133 (US$743) is
NT$2,010 lower than last year.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 91.67 percent of this year's graduates are bracing for a
long job search period in light of the constricted employment market as a result
of the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Among respondents who have not found a job, 77.04 percent began to prepare their
resumes before graduation.</P>
      <P>Considerations in seeking jobs mentioned by graduates include the duties of the
positions offered, whether the positions meet their expertise and interest, the
work environment and the pay offered.</P>
      <P>The pay expectations of this year's graduates have also been tempered by
Taiwan's floundering economy. Respondents said they are expecting a starting
salary of NT$22,599 on average, a decrease of NT$3,349 from last year.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between May 22 and June 4 among 1,356 students set to
graduate from colleges or universities this summer. It had a margin of error of

      <P>The Taipei-based Malaysian Friendship and Trade Centre held a reception Saturday
to celebrate the 46th birthday of Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin, the 13th Yang di-

      <P>The Malaysian king's birthday is a public holiday in the country and all
missions abroad hold receptions to celebrate the day.</P>
      <P>Dato' Abdullah Mohd Salleh, top Malaysian envoy to Taiwan, led a prayer in Malay
to wish the king good health at the function, which was attended by Malaysian
expatriates and businessmen in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mizan, who is the 16th Sultan of the state of Terengganu, became king of
Malaysia on Dec. 13, 2006 following a five-year rotational constitutional
monarchy system practiced among nine Malay rulers.</P>
      <P>Ascending to the throne at the age of 44, he is the second youngest Yang di-
Pertuan Agong since the office was established in 1957.</P>
      <P>Abdullah also touched on bilateral relations during the occasion, saying that
Taiwan and Malaysia enjoy a good relationship in trade, investment and tourism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Malaysia's ninth biggest trading partner, Abdullah said, and 10,000
Malaysians are living in Taiwan, of which 3,800 are students.</P>
      <P>Some 170,000 tourists from Taiwan visited Malaysia in 2008, a slight decrease
from the 200,000 who visited in 2007 because of the economic downturn, but
Abdullah expected the number to rebound in 2009.</P>
      <P>Bilateral relations will be further strengthened with two more direct flights
scheduled to be launched between Taiwan and Malaysia on July 1 and July 2 by Air

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued yellow travel alerts Saturday for
Ukraine, Malaysia, French Polynesia and Trinidad &amp; Tobago over new confirmed
cases of swine flu in those countries.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a statement that in issuing the alert, it is advising
citizens traveling to those countries to take health precautions.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ministry retracted its yellow travel advisory for Hungary,
given that no new cases of the swine flu have emerged recently in the country,
it added.</P>
      <P>A yellow alert, the lowest level of a three-color travel advisory scale, serves
as a reminder for travelers to exercise caution. An orange travel alert advises
travelers to postpone their trips, while a red alert warns travelers not to
enter the area in question under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>On June 1, the ministry adjusted its travel advisory from orange to yellow for
Mexico -- the source of the worldwide outbreak of swine flu, known officially as
influenza A (H1N1).</P>
      <P>Taiwan has issued yellow alerts for 67 countries and areas that have reported
swine flu cases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan meanwhile confirmed two more cases of swine flu Thursday, bringing to 16
the total number of influenza A (H1N1) infections recorded in the country, with

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to shut down five overseas offices</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government will close down five underutilized overseas offices in the coming
months, in an effort to put the country's diplomatic resources to better use,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously announced that offices in
Venezuela, Bolivia and Bangladesh would be shut down, but Ou added the
consulate-general in Colon, Panama, and the liaison office in Johannesburg,
South Africa to the list Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has 121 offices around the world, a number that Ou admitted was
too high in light of the country's small size.</P>
      <P>Among the many reasons to shut down the selected offices are the unfriendly
attitude of the concerned countries toward Taiwan or the existence of more than
one office within close proximity, Ou said.</P>
      <P>For example, although the Bangladesh representative office has been open for
four years, the Bangladesh government remains unwilling to have any contact with
Taiwanese officials and refuses to allow the office to operate visa services,
according to Ou.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Johannesburg office, it is only about a 10-minute drive from
Taiwan's main South African mission located in Pretoria, the minister said.</P>
      <P>A similar situation exists between the Colon consulate-general and the country's
embassy in Panama, he added.</P>
      <P>Ou stressed that the measures are aimed at ensuring an efficient use of
diplomatic resources and do not mean that Taiwan does not value relations with
the concerned countries.</P>

      <P>Eighty-four-year-old Shen Chien-yi was honored in a special way at the
commencement ceremony of Chang Jung Christian University in southern Taiwan's
Tainan County Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shen had his feet washed by the school's President Chen Chin-seng while other 23
students had their feet washed by other faculty members. Having school faculty
wash the feet of selected students is a traditional ritual of the school to
underscore the value of service with a humble spirit.</P>
      <P>The 24 students were selected because of their special attributes, either for
excellent performance or an enthusiasm in serving others.</P>
      <P>Shen was chosen because he has shown a passion for learning and has not missed a
class during his four years of college, making him a shining example of "life-
long learning," the school said.</P>
      <P>Shen held a personal exhibition earlier this week to mark his commencement,
featuring more than 100 works of art that included oil paintings, watercolors,
stereography and Chinese brush calligraphy.</P>
      <P>Shen presented one of his creative works -- "Watching Quietly" -- to the
university during the ceremony.</P>
      <P>He also donated a check of NT$100,000 to the school to be used to fund
scholarships and urged his peers-- six decades younger than him -- to "seize
their prime days in a lifetime and learn with zest every day."</P>
      <P>Shen has been fond of painting since his childhood, but born in a tumultuous era
in China, he was not been able to receive a formal fine arts education.</P>
      <P>Shen, who fought in World War II as a career military officer, came to Taiwan
from China more than five decades ago to work as a public functionary.</P>
      <P>He was chief of the Tainan City government's news department before he was
transferred to the Kaohsiung City government where he worked in the secretariat
until his retirement.</P>
      <P>Shen applied to study at China Academy of Art in Hangzhou at the age of 73,
years after his retirement.</P>
      <P>He was accepted and began his program at the academy, but was forced to return
to Taiwan less than two years later when his health began to decline due to age
and fatigue from the frequent trips across the Taiwan Strait to attend school.</P>
      <P>Determined not to give up his dream, Shen, at the age of 80, registered four
years ago for classes in watercolor painting with professor  Tsai  Mau-sung,
director  of Chang  Jung Christian University's Department of Visual Art.</P>
      <P>In 2005, he took the department's entrance exams and began full- time studies
there.</P>

      <P>Local parents spent more on vaccinating their children last year than in 2007,
countering fears that the opposite would be true during the economic downturn,
the results of an online survey released Saturday show.</P>
      <P>The survey was jointly conducted by the Taiwan Immunization Vision and Strategy
(TIVS) alliance and the Chinese-language Baby &amp; Mother monthly magazine
between April 30 and May 25 among parents with children aged under 5.</P>
      <P>It found that 67.7 percent of respondents thought the recession would shake the
willingness of parents in Taiwan to pay for vaccines for their children.</P>
      <P>But, in fact, the percentage of parents who paid for inoculations for their
babies and toddlers stood at 92.9 percent in the May survey, 6.2 percentage
points higher than the previous poll conducted in October 2007.</P>
      <P>The survey also found the amount of money spent on out-of-pocket vaccines
increased to average NT$13,203 (US$403) per family a year, higher than the
NT$10,843 shown in the 2007 survey, TIVS said.</P>
      <P>At present, the government covers infant vaccines for Hepatitis B, influenza,
the measles, and varicella, among others.</P>
      <P>But parents have to pay for Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, hepatitis A
vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine, along with a number of new combination
vaccines that inoculate infants against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and
hepatitis B with one shot.</P>
      <P>The alliance said the results show a growing number of parents have come to
realize the importance of vaccines to their children's health.</P>
      <P>Although  many parents  are paying for inoculations,  TIVS Secretary-General Lee
Ping-ing urged the government to make it a priority to cover the cost of more
vaccines for infants and toddlers.</P>
      <P>Just over 90 percent of survey respondents said the government covers the cost
of too few vaccines at present to maintain their children's health.</P>
      <P>That was 8 percent more than in the previous survey, an indication of the
growing dismay over the government's existing inoculation policy because of the
added vaccine costs parents are now forced to pay out-of-pocket, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The policy is especially unfair to families that cannot afford to foot the cost
of vaccines because of the recession, he noted.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,017 valid samples were collected for the survey, and 93 percent of
the respondents were women, TIVS said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President proposes WiMAX ambulance project</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
06/06/09  20:52:21
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday he looks forward to the introduction of
WiMAX technology in ambulance service systems to upgrade the quality and
efficiency of first aid operations.</P>
      <P>Ma brought up the idea while attending a news conference at the Taipei World
Trade Center to mark the inauguration  of WiMAX commercial operations earlier
this week.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago, Ma recalled, during his tenure as mayor of Taipei, he took the
lead in offering free e-mail addresses to 250,000 city residents as part of his
efforts to promote e-government. At the time, neither hotmail nor yahoo had done
so.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma said, the city government under his leadership began a Wifly
project that covers the whole city acreage of 130 square kilometers and enables
all of its 2.3 million residents easy access to the Internet service.</P>
      <P>However, Wifly signals are unreceivable on vehicles traveling faster than 30
kilometers per hour. The inauguration of WiMax commercial operations will offer
much better wireless Internet connections, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"I'm hopeful that the WiMAX technology can be introduced into ambulance service
systems to enable firefighters and nurses aboard ambulances to connect with
medical doctors at major hospitals around the city through WiMax, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Once such mobile broadband wireless access network becomes available on
ambulances, our emergency medical operations will be far more efficient."</P>
      <P>Before attending the news conference, Ma took a ride on the Taipei mass rapid
transit (MRT) system's Muzha line to try out swift access to the Internet on a
laptop with built-in WiMAX modules.</P>
      <P>WiMAX services became available on eight trains of the Taipei MRT's Muzha line
earlier this month to allow passengers to try out the world's first mobile
broadband wireless access network.</P>
      <P>"The experience was amazing and thrilling, " Ma said, adding that he felt
gratified to be able to get quick and easy access to the Internet abaord an MRT
train. On the train ride, Ma received e-mails on a laptop.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has invested NT$37 billion in an ambitious project
aimed at building Taiwan into a country that features mobility and digitization,
Ma said WiMAX service will play a key role in accomplishing this lofty goal.</P>
      <P>"With the launch of WiMAX service on the MRT system, I'm convinced that wireless
broadband communications services will be even widely used when easy access to
the Internet on all moblie vehicles are available," he added.</P>
      <P>WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) , a big broadband
wireless application, processes data at a speed three to four times faster than
ADSL, allowing users to download a 2G film in only 20-30 seconds.</P>

      <P>Taipei City has decided to reinforce measures to crack down on the use of
graffiti to deface public property and keep the city clean, officials of the
city Department of Environmental Protection said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Those who are found arbitrarily defacing public property will be faced with a
fine of up to NT$6,000 (US$183), the officials said.</P>
      <P>The city decided to crack down on the practice because it has had trouble
cleaning graffiti done with unwashable markers or spray paint and has had to pay
considerable sums to get it off the city's walls and other venues.</P>
      <P>The department advised people who are passionate about graffiti to practice
their art at five public parks where it is legal: the Ying Feng Riverside Park,
the Meiti Riverside Park, the JingMei Riverside Park, the Fuhe Riverside Park,
and the Bailing Riverside Park North.</P>

      <P>Restrictions on Chinese business visitors were eased Saturday, with the duration
of stay extended to one month from previous 14 days.</P>
      <P>Ho Jung-chun, deputy director-general of the National Immigration Agency under

regulations governing visits by Chinese business executives and professionals
promulgated by the ministry the day before.</P>
      <P>From now on, Ho said, Chinese businessmen can stay in Taiwan for up to one month
on each visit for business purposes.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, Chinese citizens made about 80,000 business visits to Taiwan in
2008.</P>
      <P>Previous regulations stipulated that local companies with an annual business
turnover of less than NT$30 million (US$917,431) were eligible to host a maximum
of 15 Chinese business visitors annually. Under the new regulations, the number
increases to 45.</P>
      <P>The number of Chinese business visitors that local businesses with annual
business turnover of NT$30 million or over can host each year has also been

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 65 percent of businesses have plans to recruit fresh graduates this
year, about the same as last year when the job market was stronger, according to
the results of a survey released Saturday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>Of all the new jobs being offered by these businesses, 17.68 percent will go to
fresh graduates, the survey conducted by 1111 Job Bank showed.</P>
      <P>The largest portion -- 38.89 percent -- of the positions are in the areas of
customer service,  sales and trade. Operational, technical and maintenance
positions account for 9.26 percent, and administrative positions account for
6.48 percent.</P>
      <P>Although the percentage  of companies looking to hire new graduates remained
about the same, the weak economy is being reflected in the average starting
monthly salary being offered to fresh graduates, which at NT$24,133 (US$743) is
NT$2,010 lower than last year.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 91.67 percent of this year's graduates are bracing for a
long job search period in light of the constricted employment market as a result
of the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Among respondents who have not found a job, 77.04 percent began to prepare their
resumes before graduation.</P>
      <P>Considerations in seeking jobs mentioned by graduates include the duties of the
positions offered, whether the positions meet their expertise and interest, the
work environment and the pay offered.</P>
      <P>The pay expectations of this year's graduates have also been tempered by
Taiwan's floundering economy. Respondents said they are expecting a starting
salary of NT$22,599 on average, a decrease of NT$3,349 from last year.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between May 22 and June 4 among 1,356 students set to
graduate from colleges or universities this summer. It had a margin of error of
2.66 percentage points.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Malaysian Friendship and Trade Centre held a reception Saturday
to celebrate the 46th birthday of Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin, the 13th Yang di-
Pertuan Agong, or king, of Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The Malaysian king's birthday is a public holiday in the country and all
missions abroad hold receptions to celebrate the day.</P>
      <P>Dato' Abdullah Mohd Salleh, top Malaysian envoy to Taiwan, led a prayer in Malay
to wish the king good health at the function, which was attended by Malaysian
expatriates and businessmen in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mizan, who is the 16th Sultan of the state of Terengganu, became king of
Malaysia on Dec. 13, 2006 following a five-year rotational constitutional
monarchy system practiced among nine Malay rulers.</P>
      <P>Ascending to the throne at the age of 44, he is the second youngest Yang di-
Pertuan Agong since the office was established in 1957.</P>
      <P>Abdullah also touched on bilateral relations during the occasion, saying that
Taiwan and Malaysia enjoy a good relationship in trade, investment and tourism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Malaysia's ninth biggest trading partner, Abdullah said, and 10,000
Malaysians are living in Taiwan, of which 3,800 are students.</P>
      <P>Some 170,000 tourists from Taiwan visited Malaysia in 2008, a slight decrease
from the 200,000 who visited in 2007 because of the economic downturn, but
Abdullah expected the number to rebound in 2009.</P>
      <P>Bilateral relations will be further strengthened with two more direct flights
scheduled to be launched between Taiwan and Malaysia on July 1 and July 2 by Air
Asia and Malaysia Airlines, respectively, the envoy said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued yellow travel alerts Saturday for
Ukraine, Malaysia, French Polynesia and Trinidad &amp; Tobago over new confirmed
cases of swine flu in those countries.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a statement that in issuing the alert, it is advising
citizens traveling to those countries to take health precautions.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ministry retracted its yellow travel advisory for Hungary,
given that no new cases of the swine flu have emerged recently in the country,
it added.</P>
      <P>A yellow alert, the lowest level of a three-color travel advisory scale, serves
as a reminder for travelers to exercise caution. An orange travel alert advises
travelers to postpone their trips, while a red alert warns travelers not to
enter the area in question under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>On June 1, the ministry adjusted its travel advisory from orange to yellow for
Mexico -- the source of the worldwide outbreak of swine flu, known officially as
influenza A (H1N1).</P>
      <P>Taiwan has issued yellow alerts for 67 countries and areas that have reported
swine flu cases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan meanwhile confirmed two more cases of swine flu Thursday, bringing to 16
the total number of influenza A (H1N1) infections recorded in the country, with
no deaths.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, 69 countries have officially reported 21,940 cases of influenza A

      <P>The policy is especially unfair to families that cannot afford to foot the cost

    <HEADLINE>President proposes WiMAX ambulance project</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
06/06/09  20:52:21
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday he looks forward to the introduction of
WiMAX technology in ambulance service systems to upgrade the quality and
efficiency of first aid operations.</P>
      <P>Ma brought up the idea while attending a news conference at the Taipei World
Trade Center to mark the inauguration  of WiMAX commercial operations earlier
this week.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago, Ma recalled, during his tenure as mayor of Taipei, he took the
lead in offering free e-mail addresses to 250,000 city residents as part of his
efforts to promote e-government. At the time, neither hotmail nor yahoo had done
so.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma said, the city government under his leadership began a Wifly
project that covers the whole city acreage of 130 square kilometers and enables
all of its 2.3 million residents easy access to the Internet service.</P>
      <P>However, Wifly signals are unreceivable on vehicles traveling faster than 30
kilometers per hour. The inauguration of WiMax commercial operations will offer
much better wireless Internet connections, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"I'm hopeful that the WiMAX technology can be introduced into ambulance service
systems to enable firefighters and nurses aboard ambulances to connect with
medical doctors at major hospitals around the city through WiMax, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Once such mobile broadband wireless access network becomes available on
ambulances, our emergency medical operations will be far more efficient."</P>
      <P>Before attending the news conference, Ma took a ride on the Taipei mass rapid
transit (MRT) system's Muzha line to try out swift access to the Internet on a
laptop with built-in WiMAX modules.</P>
      <P>WiMAX services became available on eight trains of the Taipei MRT's Muzha line
earlier this month to allow passengers to try out the world's first mobile
broadband wireless access network.</P>
      <P>"The experience was amazing and thrilling, " Ma said, adding that he felt
gratified to be able to get quick and easy access to the Internet abaord an MRT
train. On the train ride, Ma received e-mails on a laptop.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has invested NT$37 billion in an ambitious project
aimed at building Taiwan into a country that features mobility and digitization,
Ma said WiMAX service will play a key role in accomplishing this lofty goal.</P>
      <P>"With the launch of WiMAX service on the MRT system, I'm convinced that wireless
broadband communications services will be even widely used when easy access to
the Internet on all moblie vehicles are available," he added.</P>
      <P>WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) , a big broadband
wireless application, processes data at a speed three to four times faster than
ADSL, allowing users to download a 2G film in only 20-30 seconds.</P>

      <P>Taipei City has decided to reinforce measures to crack down on the use of
graffiti to deface public property and keep the city clean, officials of the
city Department of Environmental Protection said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Those who are found arbitrarily defacing public property will be faced with a
fine of up to NT$6,000 (US$183), the officials said.</P>
      <P>The city decided to crack down on the practice because it has had trouble
cleaning graffiti done with unwashable markers or spray paint and has had to pay
considerable sums to get it off the city's walls and other venues.</P>
      <P>The department advised people who are passionate about graffiti to practice
their art at five public parks where it is legal: the Ying Feng Riverside Park,
the Meiti Riverside Park, the JingMei Riverside Park, the Fuhe Riverside Park,
and the Bailing Riverside Park North.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to focus on joining U.N. agencies: foreign ministry</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
06/07/09  16:28:53
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will make greater efforts to take part  in United  Nations-affiliated
activities  and join U.N. specialized agencies as a member, rather than renewing
its campaign for direct participation in the U.N., the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official told the Central News Agency that while the ministry could ask
Taiwan's diplomatic allies as it did last year to submit a proposal to the U.N.
Secretariat calling for reconsideration of Taiwan's bid to meaningfully take
part in U.N. specialized agencies, the MOFA is considering a different approach.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan may also choose to be more realistic and not submit a U.N. proposal at
all this year," said the official.</P>
      <P>"It would be easier to maintain our efforts of the past, but we consider it as
unrealistic to try to force a way into the U.N., which is politically a highly
sensitive matter," said the official.</P>
      <P>Instead, the Foreign Ministry will seek this year to gain a foothold in one or
two U.N. agencies using the pragmatic approach that enabled Taiwan to take part
in the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva in mid-May, he added.</P>
      <P>"We will work out solid action plans to seek international support for Taiwan's
meaningful participation in U.N.-affiliated activities, he said. "Of course,
this is presuming that mainland China does not oppose such efforts."</P>
      <P>"Our priority is to seek entry to the United Nations' 15 specialized agencies,
such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  which develops
international standards for aviation safety and the International Marine
Organization (IMO) which is concerned with the safety of shipping and cleaner
oceans, " he added.</P>
      <P>Because of Taiwan's absence from the ICAO, for example, there is gap in the
global aviation safety network because the Taipei Flight Information Region,
located in the center of Southeast Asia, covers a vast air space of 176,000
square nautical miles in which 12 international air routes and four domestic air
routes operate, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In the case of the IMO, he said, although Taiwan ranks 10th in the world in
terms of ocean navigation capability, it has no access to first-hand navigation
information and seamen identification issued in Taiwan is often questioned
around the world because Taiwan is not an IMO member.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou recently attributed Taiwan's success in gaining admission
to the World Health Organization (WHO) annual executive assembly this year
mainly to his administration's pragmatic policies and improved Taiwan-China
relations over the past several months.</P>
      <P>The previous Democratic Progressive Party administration applied in 2007 for the
first time for Taiwan to join the U.N. as a full member under the name "Taiwan."
However, that proposal did not make it onto the agenda of the U.N. General
Assembly.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan's supporters have been trying to get the General Assembly to
list Taiwan's application for admission on the U.N. agenda, but Beijing's
argument that Taiwan is part of China has prevailed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the world body since 1971, when the Republic
of China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China, and it has been
trying unsuccessfully to have the United Nations consider the issue of its
representation since 1993.</P>
      <P>In a departure from the 2007 approach of pushing for full membership under the
name Taiwan, the country in 2008 promoted a bid to "participate  meaningfully
in the activities  of the U.N. specialized agencies," in line with Ma's "modus
vivendi" diplomatic strategy that favors a moderate and pragmatic approach.</P>
      <P>However, a request jointly put forth by 17 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies to
include the issue as a supplementary item on the agenda of the 63rd session of
the U.N. General Assembly was rejected last September by the U.N. General
Committee, again because of China's opposition.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou outlined his vision Sunday for turning Taiwan into a
"tourism island" with the concerted effort of the private and public sectors.</P>
      <P>Addressing  the faculty and students of National Kaohsiung Hospitality College,
Ma said that in light of the improved relations across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan
can save the energy and resources it would direct toward war preparedness and
instead seek to boost its tourism development.</P>
      <P>"I've asked my administration to make tourism one of the six sectors to be
further developed, with governmental assistance, into Taiwan's flagship
industries," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should emulate Hong Kong and Singapore, noting that tourist
arrivals in each of those two countries exceed 10 million a year, a number that
is far in excess of their respective populations.</P>
      <P>"There is ample room for Taiwan to catch up in terms of tourism development," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He exhorted the college to play a leading role in revving up hospitality
development and education in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president sampled the dishes and dessert wine that were researched and
developed by the students at the college.</P>
      <P>National Kaohsiung Hospitality College is the only professional college in
Taiwan that specializes in hospitality training. Its mission is to train and
educate managers for work in the tourism, travel and restaurant industries, and
foster the advancement and development of local tourism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Long-term health care plan is taking shape: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
06/07/09  17:38:12
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is expected to come up
with a bill by the end of this year on a long-term care insurance system that
will require a budget of NT$25 billion- NT$30 billion a year, according to
Minister without Portfolio Tsai Tsun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>There are two versions of the plan -- one to provide long-term health care
insurance coverage to every citizen, and the other one to cover people over the
age of 40. The difference between the two versions lies in the insurance
premiums, Tsai, who is coordinating an inter-ministerial effort to introduce
this system, said Saturday after a routine Cabinet meeting at which the CEPD
gave a briefing on the plan.</P>
      <P>The premiums would be lower if a universal mandatory long- term care program is
adopted, but that means many young people would not be willing to participate in
the program and it would therefore not have wide support, the CEPD was quoted as
saying.</P>
      <P>But on the other hand, if the plan provided coverage only for people over the
age of 40, then the insurance premiums would be higher, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>The CEPD will hold a series of hearings and forums around Taiwan to obtain the
opinions of local governments and residents on the two versions, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Once the program takes effect, all insured citizens will be eligible to apply
for some type of long-term care, following evaluation by a planned bureau in
charge of the execution of the program and the social welfare authorities, Tsai
explained. The insured will be provided services based on the terms and
conditions of  their  insurance  plan,  including  in-home  nursing,  and
organizational care, he added.</P>
      <P>At present, the most important task of the government is to build long-term care
facilities, partner with long term care organizations, and help  train  skilled
caregivers  in preparation  for the implementation of the program, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>If the bill clears the legislative floor, a bureau responsible for the program's
implementation will be established to handle related affairs, he said. The
bureau will be under the jurisdiction of the existing Department of Health or
the proposed Ministry of Health and Welfare, he added.</P>
      <P>At the Cabinet meeting, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan expressed the hope that the
program will be written into legislation next year to pave the way for its
implementation by 2011.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou took part in a 4-kilometer road run Sunday that was
designed to promote the upcoming Taipei Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>Ma joined some 3,000 other people on the run -- dubbed "Power in Me" -- from the
Presidential Office plaza through the streets of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The participants, including more than 20 people with hearing disabilities and 10
visually impaired runners, vied for medals in two divisions -- the 4 km race and
an 8 km run.</P>
      <P>In a conversation with Chen Lan-feng, one of the hearing-impaired runners who
will represent Taiwan in the 2009 Deaflympics in Taipei City, Ma exhorted her to
train even harder so that she could give an outstanding performance in the Sept.
5-15 games.</P>
      <P>Chen is known as "the deer woman" in local athletics circles because of her
swift, silent movements.</P>
      <P>The runners in Sunday's promotional event, including Cabinet officials in charge
of sports affairs, officials from the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, were all
given earplugs to be worn during the race.</P>
      <P>Emile Chih-jen Sheng, CEO of the Taipei Deaflympics Organizing Committee, said
he felt unsafe and uncomfortable when he was wearing them.</P>
      <P>However, he said, the earplugs were used so that the runners could experience
the silence and try to understand how hearing impaired athletes feel and the
challenges they face when competing.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chen-wei, chairman of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, said the use of
the earplugs by the participants -- most of whom have no hearing problems -- was
a way of showing solidarity with the athletes who will compete in the
Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>The Deaflympics is limited to athletes who have a hearing loss of at least 55
decibels in the better ear.</P>
      <P>Many other promotional activities will be staged in the run up to the games,
including a grand opening of the Deaflympics main stadium on July 23 and an
invitational track and field meet from July 24-25, according to the sponsors.</P>
      <P>There will also be a series of large-scale performances to promote the 21st
Summer Deaflympics Taipei 2009, which is expected to draw over 10,000 people
from 85 countries.</P>
      <P>The performances will include Taiwanese operas as well as shows staged by the
world-famous creative organization Blue Man Group, a folk music and dance troupe
from China's Yunnan Province, and aboriginal singers, Sheng said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's economic slowdown to wane in second half of 2009: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
06/07/09  18:33:04

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic slowdown is expected to gradually  ease in the second  half of
this year as several international forecasting organizations have predicted that
the global economy will bottom out in the fourth quarter, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Major economies  experienced  a huge slowdown  and soaring unemployment rate in
the first quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year, due
to the impact of the global financial crisis, the CEPD noted.</P>
      <P>The global economy is widely predicted to bottom out in the fourth quarter of
this year and to rebound next year as the measures taken by the economies,
including efficient inventory management, relaxed monetary policies, and
economic stimulus packages, take effect, the CEPD reported.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan, its economy shrank by a record 10.24 percent year-on-year in the
first quarter of this year, due mainly to declining exports and investments
during the global financial crisis, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports and production continued to slump in April, signs that the
economy is still in recession, but the decline of the economy appears to have
slowed, the CEPD indicated.</P>
      <P>Despite a drop in the unemployment rate in April, the national job market
remains challenging, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>However, the country's consumer confidence index went up for the third
consecutive month in May, the stock market has risen more than 25 percent so far
this year, and the Taiwan dollar has jumped to its highest level in more than 5
months against the U.S. currency, the CEPD noted. There are all indicators of
growing confidence in the economy among foreign investors and the local people,
the CEPD added.</P>
      <P>In its outlook for the year, the CEPD said the pace of economic decline in
Taiwan will slow gradually in the second half of this year thanks to a Chinese
economic stimulus plan aimed at expanding domestic demand and to the increased
stability of the U.S. economy.</P>
      <P>Other factors include an expected influx of capital because of the increasingly
warmer  cross-Taiwan  Strait  relations,  the anticipated effects of the
implementation of the public construction projects in the last six months of the
year, and the development of six emerging industries to boost Taiwan's
competitiveness, it said.</P>
      <P>However, the swine flu (H1N1) outbreak could be an uncertain factor in Taiwan's
economic recovery, even though the flu situation is stabilizing, because the
possibility of an epidemic in the autumn and winter seasons this year cannot be
ruled out, the CEPD added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese woman who came down with a fever and cough after her return from a
recent visit to Australia was confirmed Saturday to have the A(H1N1) flu virus,
Taiwan health authorities said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 32-year-old woman, who was on a sightseeing trip in Australia from May
30-June 5, was Taiwan's first confirmed case of swine flu imported from that
country and the 18th case in Taiwan, said Central Epidemics Command Center
(CECC) spokesman Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>The woman was one of the two new A(H1N1) cases that were confirmed Sunday and
brought to 19 the total number of swine flu infections recorded in the country.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the infected woman did not wear a face mask on her flight
home and is now in quarantine and under observation at Taoyuan General Hospital
near the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Her husband, who was on the Australia trip with her, has also developed flu
symptoms is now in quarantine at the hospital where he is being tested for swine
flu, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Thirteen other members of the tour group and the 29 passengers who sat closest
to woman on the flight to Taiwan were advised to monitor their health at home
and contact the center if they develop any flu symptoms, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 15-year-old American boy from the U.S. state of Utah was found to
have a fever of 38 degrees Celsius upon arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport with his mother June 4 and was confirmed Saturday to be infected with
the A(H1N1) virus -- the 19th case of swine flu recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The teenager, who did not wear a face mask during his flights from Los Angeles
via Japan, was whisked away to Taoyuan General Hospital immediately after his
flight landed.</P>
      <P>His mother, who showed flu symptoms after arriving in Taiwan, has also been
placed in quarantine.</P>
      <P>Six other people who had come into close contact with the boy have been asked to
monitor their health at home.</P>
      <P>Of the 19 confirmed swine flu cases in Taiwan so far, one was indigenous, 12
were imported from the United States, three from the Philippines, and one each
from Canada, Hong Kong and Australia.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, 69 countries had officially reported 21,940 cases of influenza
A(H1N1) infection, including 125 deaths, according to the World Health

    <HEADLINE>Government taking steps to help boost birth rate: official</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government will strive to create a better social and economic environment to
encourage people to have children, Deputy Minister of the Interior Chien Tai-
lang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks after a recent survey showed that the current economic
recession, the social welfare system, and poor social order are the three main
factors that have dampened people's willingness to have children.</P>
      <P>Chien acknowledged that the government needs to do more to help boost the
country's birth rate, which has been in decline for the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>The birth rate, which measures the average number of times a woman gives birth
during her lifetime, was 7.04 in 1951, but by 1984 it had dropped to below 2.1
and last year it fell to a record low of 1.05, Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Last year, fewer than 200,000 babies were born in Taiwan, while the average
number of births per 1,000 persons per year -- also known as crude birth rate --
was 8.54.</P>
      <P>These figures were all at record lows, according to the MOI statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of people aged 65 years and older in Taiwan is expected to
rise to 39 percent of the total population by 2051, Chien said, citing a
projection by sociologists.</P>
      <P>Therefore, encouraging more births is one the government's policies, Chien said,
adding that increasing the birth rate is not only the responsibility of
individuals but also of the government.</P>
      <P>The government has launched a number of initiatives to provide assistance to the
parents and guardians of young children, such as offering vouchers for nursery
school costs and medical allowances for children under the age of 3.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Cabinet has introduced laws that allow parents to apply for
leave without pay for up to two years to take care of their children.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Legislative Yuan is expected to pass amendments to the Employment
Insurance Law to provide subsidies to workers who are on parental leave.</P>
      <P>The MOI has also commissioned  researchers  to study  the feasibility of
providing living allowances for children, in an effort to help alleviate the
financial burden on parents.</P>
      <P>Several city and county governments, including the governments of Hsinchu city
and county, Chiayi city and county and Yunlin county, all provide childbirth
subsidies. For a first baby, parents are entitled to NT$15,000, for a second
baby the sum is NT$20,000, for a third birth the subsidy is NT$25,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday visited an orphan girl whom he has been helping
for many years.</P>
      <P>The president called on Shih Yun-shuan at Kangda House, a halfway home run by
the Roman Catholic church in Kaohsiung City, and gave the 13-year-old an iPod.</P>
      <P>Shih came to the attention of Ma in 2006 after he learned in the press that a
young girl had burst into tears because she failed to get a glimpse of him while
he was stumping in Kaohsiung for a Kuomintang city councilor candidate.</P>
      <P>The news report stated that the girl Shih Yun-shuan was a firm supporter of Ma,
and eagerly soaked up any information related to him.</P>
      <P>The report stated that Shih's mother, who was raising her child single-handedly,
was suffering from terminal cancer and may not live to see her daughter grow up.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was serving as KMT chairman at that time, began to write to his young
fan out of concern and to provide financial and other assistance to her through
his office.</P>
      <P>Toward the end of her life, Shih's mother put the girl into the care of a friend
but the child refused to leave her mother and stayed with her until her death in
2006.</P>
      <P>After that, the girl was put into Kangda House, which enrolled her in a boarding
school. She returned to the halfway house only on weekends.</P>
      <P>During this time, Ma was writing to Shih regularly and continued to do so even
after he was elected president of the country.</P>
      <P>During Sunday's meeting, Shih broke into tears when the president gave her a
warm hug.</P>
      <P>Ma urged the teenager to call him or write to him whenever she wants to.</P>
      <P>"As president of the state, I am capable of doing more for you than before," he
assured her.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the girl to face adversity with courage, confidence and patience,
and he extended his thanks to Kangda House for taking care of Shih and other
girls who need help.</P>
      <P>Kangda House, founded in 1998, shelters girls who have been abused, who are
dropouts, or delinquents.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that his administration will set up a marine
affairs ministry in two phases.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at the end of an anti-terrorism drill carried out by the
Coast Guard Administration at the Kaohsiung Harbor.</P>
      <P>"As a country lies between the East China Sea and South China Sea, Taiwan plays
a special strategic role, and thereby needs a ministry in charge of marine
affairs." Ma said.</P>
      <P>Reciting a plan included in his campaign promise, the president said, his
administration will set up a marine affairs commission which will be enlarged
and converted gradually into a ministry to formulate and enforce the country's
marine policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan ranks 10th in the world in terms of its annual fish catch,
Ma, whose four-year term will end in 2012 and can be reelected no more than
once, said the government will budget NT$25 billion (US$7.8 billion) to buy a
frigate with a displacement of more than 2000 tons in 2017 to boost the Coast
Guard's strength.</P>
      <P>The largest frigate owned by the Coast Guard Administration now has a
displacement of 1800 tons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to focus on joining U.N. agencies: foreign ministry</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
06/07/09  16:28:53
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will make greater efforts to take part  in United  Nations-affiliated
activities  and join U.N. specialized agencies as a member, rather than renewing
its campaign for direct participation in the U.N., the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official told the Central News Agency that while the ministry could ask
Taiwan's diplomatic allies as it did last year to submit a proposal to the U.N.
Secretariat calling for reconsideration of Taiwan's bid to meaningfully take
part in U.N. specialized agencies, the MOFA is considering a different approach.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan may also choose to be more realistic and not submit a U.N. proposal at
all this year," said the official.</P>
      <P>"It would be easier to maintain our efforts of the past, but we consider it as
unrealistic to try to force a way into the U.N., which is politically a highly
sensitive matter," said the official.</P>
      <P>Instead, the Foreign Ministry will seek this year to gain a foothold in one or
two U.N. agencies using the pragmatic approach that enabled Taiwan to take part
in the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva in mid-May, he added.</P>
      <P>"We will work out solid action plans to seek international support for Taiwan's
meaningful participation in U.N.-affiliated activities, he said. "Of course,
this is presuming that mainland China does not oppose such efforts."</P>
      <P>"Our priority is to seek entry to the United Nations' 15 specialized agencies,
such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  which develops
international standards for aviation safety and the International Marine
Organization (IMO) which is concerned with the safety of shipping and cleaner
oceans, " he added.</P>
      <P>Because of Taiwan's absence from the ICAO, for example, there is gap in the
global aviation safety network because the Taipei Flight Information Region,
located in the center of Southeast Asia, covers a vast air space of 176,000
square nautical miles in which 12 international air routes and four domestic air
routes operate, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In the case of the IMO, he said, although Taiwan ranks 10th in the world in
terms of ocean navigation capability, it has no access to first-hand navigation
information and seamen identification issued in Taiwan is often questioned
around the world because Taiwan is not an IMO member.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou recently attributed Taiwan's success in gaining admission
to the World Health Organization (WHO) annual executive assembly this year
mainly to his administration's pragmatic policies and improved Taiwan-China
relations over the past several months.</P>
      <P>The previous Democratic Progressive Party administration applied in 2007 for the
first time for Taiwan to join the U.N. as a full member under the name "Taiwan."
However, that proposal did not make it onto the agenda of the U.N. General
Assembly.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan's supporters have been trying to get the General Assembly to
list Taiwan's application for admission on the U.N. agenda, but Beijing's
argument that Taiwan is part of China has prevailed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the world body since 1971, when the Republic
of China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China, and it has been
trying unsuccessfully to have the United Nations consider the issue of its
representation since 1993.</P>
      <P>In a departure from the 2007 approach of pushing for full membership under the
name Taiwan, the country in 2008 promoted a bid to "participate  meaningfully
in the activities  of the U.N. specialized agencies," in line with Ma's "modus
vivendi" diplomatic strategy that favors a moderate and pragmatic approach.</P>
      <P>However, a request jointly put forth by 17 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies to
include the issue as a supplementary item on the agenda of the 63rd session of
the U.N. General Assembly was rejected last September by the U.N. General
Committee, again because of China's opposition.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou outlined his vision Sunday for turning Taiwan into a
"tourism island" with the concerted effort of the private and public sectors.</P>
      <P>Addressing  the faculty and students of National Kaohsiung Hospitality College,
Ma said that in light of the improved relations across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan
can save the energy and resources it would direct toward war preparedness and
instead seek to boost its tourism development.</P>
      <P>"I've asked my administration to make tourism one of the six sectors to be
further developed, with governmental assistance, into Taiwan's flagship
industries," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should emulate Hong Kong and Singapore, noting that tourist
arrivals in each of those two countries exceed 10 million a year, a number that
is far in excess of their respective populations.</P>
      <P>"There is ample room for Taiwan to catch up in terms of tourism development," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He exhorted the college to play a leading role in revving up hospitality
development and education in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president sampled the dishes and dessert wine that were researched and
developed by the students at the college.</P>
      <P>National Kaohsiung Hospitality College is the only professional college in
Taiwan that specializes in hospitality training. Its mission is to train and

    <HEADLINE>Long-term health care plan is taking shape: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
06/07/09  17:38:12

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is expected to come up
with a bill by the end of this year on a long-term care insurance system that
will require a budget of NT$25 billion- NT$30 billion a year, according to
Minister without Portfolio Tsai Tsun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>There are two versions of the plan -- one to provide long-term health care
insurance coverage to every citizen, and the other one to cover people over the
age of 40. The difference between the two versions lies in the insurance
premiums, Tsai, who is coordinating an inter-ministerial effort to introduce
this system, said Saturday after a routine Cabinet meeting at which the CEPD
gave a briefing on the plan.</P>
      <P>The premiums would be lower if a universal mandatory long- term care program is
adopted, but that means many young people would not be willing to participate in
the program and it would therefore not have wide support, the CEPD was quoted as
saying.</P>
      <P>But on the other hand, if the plan provided coverage only for people over the
age of 40, then the insurance premiums would be higher, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>The CEPD will hold a series of hearings and forums around Taiwan to obtain the
opinions of local governments and residents on the two versions, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Once the program takes effect, all insured citizens will be eligible to apply
for some type of long-term care, following evaluation by a planned bureau in
charge of the execution of the program and the social welfare authorities, Tsai
explained. The insured will be provided services based on the terms and
conditions of  their  insurance  plan,  including  in-home  nursing,  and
organizational care, he added.</P>
      <P>At present, the most important task of the government is to build long-term care
facilities, partner with long term care organizations, and help  train  skilled
caregivers  in preparation  for the implementation of the program, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>If the bill clears the legislative floor, a bureau responsible for the program's
implementation will be established to handle related affairs, he said. The
bureau will be under the jurisdiction of the existing Department of Health or
the proposed Ministry of Health and Welfare, he added.</P>
      <P>At the Cabinet meeting, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan expressed the hope that the
program will be written into legislation next year to pave the way for its
implementation by 2011.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou took part in a 4-kilometer road run Sunday that was
designed to promote the upcoming Taipei Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>Ma joined some 3,000 other people on the run -- dubbed "Power in Me" -- from the
Presidential Office plaza through the streets of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The participants, including more than 20 people with hearing disabilities and 10
visually impaired runners, vied for medals in two divisions -- the 4 km race and
an 8 km run.</P>
      <P>In a conversation with Chen Lan-feng, one of the hearing-impaired runners who
will represent Taiwan in the 2009 Deaflympics in Taipei City, Ma exhorted her to
train even harder so that she could give an outstanding performance in the Sept.
5-15 games.</P>
      <P>Chen is known as "the deer woman" in local athletics circles because of her
swift, silent movements.</P>
      <P>The runners in Sunday's promotional event, including Cabinet officials in charge
of sports affairs, officials from the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, were all
given earplugs to be worn during the race.</P>
      <P>Emile Chih-jen Sheng, CEO of the Taipei Deaflympics Organizing Committee, said
he felt unsafe and uncomfortable when he was wearing them.</P>
      <P>However, he said, the earplugs were used so that the runners could experience
the silence and try to understand how hearing impaired athletes feel and the
challenges they face when competing.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chen-wei, chairman of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, said the use of
the earplugs by the participants -- most of whom have no hearing problems -- was
a way of showing solidarity with the athletes who will compete in the
Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>The Deaflympics is limited to athletes who have a hearing loss of at least 55
decibels in the better ear.</P>
      <P>Many other promotional activities will be staged in the run up to the games,
including a grand opening of the Deaflympics main stadium on July 23 and an
invitational track and field meet from July 24-25, according to the sponsors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's economic slowdown to wane in second half of 2009: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic slowdown is expected to gradually  ease in the second  half of
this year as several international forecasting organizations have predicted that
the global economy will bottom out in the fourth quarter, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Major economies  experienced  a huge slowdown  and soaring unemployment rate in
the first quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year, due
to the impact of the global financial crisis, the CEPD noted.</P>
      <P>The global economy is widely predicted to bottom out in the fourth quarter of
this year and to rebound next year as the measures taken by the economies,
including efficient inventory management, relaxed monetary policies, and
economic stimulus packages, take effect, the CEPD reported.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan, its economy shrank by a record 10.24 percent year-on-year in the
first quarter of this year, due mainly to declining exports and investments
during the global financial crisis, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports and production continued to slump in April, signs that the
economy is still in recession, but the decline of the economy appears to have
slowed, the CEPD indicated.</P>
      <P>Despite a drop in the unemployment rate in April, the national job market
remains challenging, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>However, the country's consumer confidence index went up for the third
consecutive month in May, the stock market has risen more than 25 percent so far
this year, and the Taiwan dollar has jumped to its highest level in more than 5
months against the U.S. currency, the CEPD noted. There are all indicators of
growing confidence in the economy among foreign investors and the local people,
the CEPD added.</P>
      <P>In its outlook for the year, the CEPD said the pace of economic decline in
Taiwan will slow gradually in the second half of this year thanks to a Chinese
economic stimulus plan aimed at expanding domestic demand and to the increased
stability of the U.S. economy.</P>
      <P>Other factors include an expected influx of capital because of the increasingly
warmer  cross-Taiwan  Strait  relations,  the anticipated effects of the
implementation of the public construction projects in the last six months of the
year, and the development of six emerging industries to boost Taiwan's
competitiveness, it said.</P>
      <P>However, the swine flu (H1N1) outbreak could be an uncertain factor in Taiwan's
economic recovery, even though the flu situation is stabilizing, because the
possibility of an epidemic in the autumn and winter seasons this year cannot be
ruled out, the CEPD added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese woman who came down with a fever and cough after her return from a
recent visit to Australia was confirmed Saturday to have the A(H1N1) flu virus,
Taiwan health authorities said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 32-year-old woman, who was on a sightseeing trip in Australia from May
30-June 5, was Taiwan's first confirmed case of swine flu imported from that
country and the 18th case in Taiwan, said Central Epidemics Command Center
(CECC) spokesman Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>The woman was one of the two new A(H1N1) cases that were confirmed Sunday and
brought to 19 the total number of swine flu infections recorded in the country.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the infected woman did not wear a face mask on her flight
home and is now in quarantine and under observation at Taoyuan General Hospital
near the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Her husband, who was on the Australia trip with her, has also developed flu
symptoms is now in quarantine at the hospital where he is being tested for swine
flu, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Thirteen other members of the tour group and the 29 passengers who sat closest
to woman on the flight to Taiwan were advised to monitor their health at home
and contact the center if they develop any flu symptoms, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 15-year-old American boy from the U.S. state of Utah was found to
have a fever of 38 degrees Celsius upon arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport with his mother June 4 and was confirmed Saturday to be infected with
the A(H1N1) virus -- the 19th case of swine flu recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The teenager, who did not wear a face mask during his flights from Los Angeles
via Japan, was whisked away to Taoyuan General Hospital immediately after his
flight landed.</P>
      <P>His mother, who showed flu symptoms after arriving in Taiwan, has also been
placed in quarantine.</P>
      <P>Six other people who had come into close contact with the boy have been asked to
monitor their health at home.</P>
      <P>Of the 19 confirmed swine flu cases in Taiwan so far, one was indigenous, 12
were imported from the United States, three from the Philippines, and one each
from Canada, Hong Kong and Australia.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, 69 countries had officially reported 21,940 cases of influenza
A(H1N1) infection, including 125 deaths, according to the World Health
Organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government taking steps to help boost birth rate: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will strive to create a better social and economic environment to
encourage people to have children, Deputy Minister of the Interior Chien Tai-
lang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks after a recent survey showed that the current economic
recession, the social welfare system, and poor social order are the three main
factors that have dampened people's willingness to have children.</P>
      <P>Chien acknowledged that the government needs to do more to help boost the
country's birth rate, which has been in decline for the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>The birth rate, which measures the average number of times a woman gives birth
during her lifetime, was 7.04 in 1951, but by 1984 it had dropped to below 2.1
and last year it fell to a record low of 1.05, Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Last year, fewer than 200,000 babies were born in Taiwan, while the average
number of births per 1,000 persons per year -- also known as crude birth rate --
was 8.54.</P>
      <P>These figures were all at record lows, according to the MOI statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of people aged 65 years and older in Taiwan is expected to
rise to 39 percent of the total population by 2051, Chien said, citing a
projection by sociologists.</P>
      <P>Therefore, encouraging more births is one the government's policies, Chien said,
adding that increasing the birth rate is not only the responsibility of
individuals but also of the government.</P>
      <P>The government has launched a number of initiatives to provide assistance to the
parents and guardians of young children, such as offering vouchers for nursery
school costs and medical allowances for children under the age of 3.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Cabinet has introduced laws that allow parents to apply for
leave without pay for up to two years to take care of their children.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Legislative Yuan is expected to pass amendments to the Employment
Insurance Law to provide subsidies to workers who are on parental leave.</P>
      <P>The MOI has also commissioned  researchers  to study  the feasibility of
providing living allowances for children, in an effort to help alleviate the
financial burden on parents.</P>
      <P>Several city and county governments, including the governments of Hsinchu city
and county, Chiayi city and county and Yunlin county, all provide childbirth
subsidies. For a first baby, parents are entitled to NT$15,000, for a second
baby the sum is NT$20,000, for a third birth the subsidy is NT$25,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday visited an orphan girl whom he has been helping
for many years.</P>
      <P>The president called on Shih Yun-shuan at Kangda House, a halfway home run by
the Roman Catholic church in Kaohsiung City, and gave the 13-year-old an iPod.</P>
      <P>Shih came to the attention of Ma in 2006 after he learned in the press that a
young girl had burst into tears because she failed to get a glimpse of him while
he was stumping in Kaohsiung for a Kuomintang city councilor candidate.</P>
      <P>The news report stated that the girl Shih Yun-shuan was a firm supporter of Ma,
and eagerly soaked up any information related to him.</P>
      <P>The report stated that Shih's mother, who was raising her child single-handedly,
was suffering from terminal cancer and may not live to see her daughter grow up.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was serving as KMT chairman at that time, began to write to his young
fan out of concern and to provide financial and other assistance to her through
his office.</P>
      <P>Toward the end of her life, Shih's mother put the girl into the care of a friend
but the child refused to leave her mother and stayed with her until her death in
2006.</P>
      <P>After that, the girl was put into Kangda House, which enrolled her in a boarding
school. She returned to the halfway house only on weekends.</P>
      <P>During this time, Ma was writing to Shih regularly and continued to do so even
after he was elected president of the country.</P>
      <P>During Sunday's meeting, Shih broke into tears when the president gave her a
warm hug.</P>
      <P>Ma urged the teenager to call him or write to him whenever she wants to.</P>
      <P>"As president of the state, I am capable of doing more for you than before," he
assured her.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the girl to face adversity with courage, confidence and patience,
and he extended his thanks to Kangda House for taking care of Shih and other
girls who need help.</P>
      <P>Kangda House, founded in 1998, shelters girls who have been abused, who are
dropouts, or delinquents.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that his administration will set up a marine
affairs ministry in two phases.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at the end of an anti-terrorism drill carried out by the
Coast Guard Administration at the Kaohsiung Harbor.</P>
      <P>"As a country lies between the East China Sea and South China Sea, Taiwan plays
a special strategic role, and thereby needs a ministry in charge of marine
affairs." Ma said.</P>
      <P>Reciting a plan included in his campaign promise, the president said, his
administration will set up a marine affairs commission which will be enlarged
and converted gradually into a ministry to formulate and enforce the country's
marine policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan ranks 10th in the world in terms of its annual fish catch,
Ma, whose four-year term will end in 2012 and can be reelected no more than
once, said the government will budget NT$25 billion (US$7.8 billion) to buy a
frigate with a displacement of more than 2000 tons in 2017 to boost the Coast
Guard's strength.</P>
      <P>The largest frigate owned by the Coast Guard Administration now has a
displacement of 1800 tons.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Men who, when they see what is good and honest,
try to act up to it, and when they see what is bad and dishonest try to avoid it
as if avoiding scalding water: Such men I have known and the expressions of such
principle I have heard." "But men who live in retirement in order to study their
aims and who practice righteousness in order to carry out their principles: The
expression of such principles I have heard, but I have not seen such men."</TEXT>

      <P>The administration plans to establish a Cabinet-level marine affairs council
then later upgrade it to a full ministry, the head of a governmental research
agency said Monday.</P>
      <P>The marine affairs council will be established  to gather information related to
the portfolio and to coordinate with other Cabinet-level agencies on relevant
policies, said Jiang Yi-huah, minister in charge of the Research, Development
and Evaluation Commission.</P>
      <P>The proposed council will be responsible for implementing policy on matters
ranging from marine industry, resources, ecology, culture and education, to
security of the country's maritime territory, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>He said that right now there is no timetable for upgrading the planned marine
affairs council to a ministry. The necessity for a ministry will be determined
based on the contents of the relevant policies and how the council performs, he
added.</P>
      <P>Jiang made the remarks during a legislative committee meeting at which
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators criticized President
Ma Ying-jeou for failing to set up a marine affairs ministry as promised during
his election campaign.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators said that Ma has been in office for more than one year and
there are as yet no plans in sight for the establishment of a marine affairs
ministry.</P>
      <P>Ma, during a whirlwind visit to the southern port city of Kaohsiung the day
before, said that his administration will set up a marine affairs ministry in

      <P>"Taiwan has a special strategic role in the region, located as it is in the area
of the East China Sea and South China, and therefore needs a ministry to handle

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is scheduled to
confer a medal June 9 on an astronomy  professor at National Central University
(NCU)  in recognition of his achievements on a Saturn exploration space project.</P>
      <P>Ip Wing-huen,  a professor at NCU's Graduate Institute of Astronomy, is an
internationally renowned astronomer and one of the initiators of the "Cassini-
Huygens" space mission, an international collaboration project involving NASA,
the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI).</P>
      <P>Ip, along with two other initiators, Daniel Gautier from the Observatoire Meudon
and Toby Owen from the University of Hawaii, has been chosen to receive the
NASA's Exceptional Public Service Medal, NCU said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Ip's daughter Anita Ip will accept the award on behalf of her father at an award
ceremony to be held at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California on
June 9, NCU added.</P>
      <P>"Everyone has dreams but realizing them is most important, " Ip said in the
press release.</P>
      <P>He said that it is because planetary science received scant attention in the
early 1980s that a budding astronomer like him was able to initiate the project.
Studying astronomy is a long path, he said, as he thanked his wife for her full
support during the time he was committed to the Cassini project.</P>
      <P>The US$3.26 billion Cassini-Huygens project was launched on Oct. 15, 1997 with
the participation of 256 scientists from 18 countries. It is the second largest
space mission next to the International Space Station program.</P>
      <P>The mission is composed of two elements, the NASA Cassini orbiter and the ESA
Huygens probe, and is aimed at studying the planet Saturn and its moons. The
Huygens probe landed on Saturn's moon Titan Jan. 14, 2005 and began transmitting
scientific data, which helped scientists in their study of not only the
atmospheric structure of Titan, but also of the origin of life on earth.</P>
      <P>NASA announced on April 18, 2008 a two year extension of the exploration, which
is called the "Cassini Equinox mission," as it is seeking answers to new
questions that arose from the first orbit of Saturn by the spacecraft Cassini.</P>
      <P>Ip, who was born in Macau and was employed as the chief scientist at Taiwan's
National Space Organization in 1991, said that investment in scientific
research  to is crucial  to social sustainable development, as this encourages
scientific creativity in a country.</P>
      <P>"Back in the 1980s, there were only two Titan experts in Europe, but they were
already planning to go to Titian. That was because Europe had hundreds of years
of scientific development and historical heritage and could therefore invest in
what seemed unachievable at the time," he said.</P>
      <P>Ip is now heading a project to build what is called the Lulin Two-meter
Telescope at Lulin Observatory in the Yushan National Park in central Taiwan.
This project would allow greater participation by Taiwanese scientists in major
international astronomical projects, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Nurses Association started a nursing training program for 10 Afghan
trainees Monday, Taiwan's first effort in helping the war-worn country develop
its health care personnel, the association announced that same day.</P>
      <P>The association, a Taipei-based civic group that includes the promotion of
international nursing services among its functions, organized the program with
the assistance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , the Cabinet-level
Department of Health and the government-funded Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>The trainees arrived in Taiwan June 5 and started with two days of classroom
instruction Monday, according to the association.</P>
      <P>They will then receive clinical training at the Tri-Service General Hospital in
Taipei June 10-Aug. 26 to learn about maternal and child health, wound care,
emergency medical treatment, community health care and nursing administration.</P>
      <P>Sun Huei-fang, director-general of the hospital's Department of Nursing, said
the trainees will learn skills and gain experience in various medical fields
such as surgery, anesthesiology, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, in the
three-month program.</P>
      <P>They will also benefit from the hospital's resources for treating the war
injuries common in the country as a result of the conflict there, Sun said.</P>
      <P>Afghanistan has suffered continuous civil war, in addition to foreign
intervention, since the 1970s.</P>
      <P>The 10 trainees were recommended by Afghanistan's non-profit Shuhada
Organization,  which operates clinics and hospitals in Afghanistan and Pakistan
dedicated to the provision of health care to Afghan women and girls.</P>
      <P>It also operates schools for girls and boys in Afghanistan and for Afghan
refugees in the city of Quetta in neighboring Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Sima Samar, founder of the organization, was presented with the 2008 Asia
Democracy and Human Rights Award by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,
receiving the award from President Ma Ying-jeou last December.</P>
      <P>Samar served as deputy prime minister and minister of women's affairs in the
interim administration of Afghanistan from Dec. 22, 2001 to June 22, 2002.</P>
      <P>According to David Wu, vice chairman of the MOFA's NGO Affairs Committee, Samar
wrote to him after returning to Afghanistan to express hope that Taiwan's non-
government organizations can provide help to improve Afghanistan's medical
environment.</P>
      <P>Wu said he hopes Taiwan can contribute more knowledge and experience in medical
care -- one of Taiwan's areas of expertise -- to the world,  and that the
training  program will help its non-government  organizations  make  better
connections  with international aid efforts.</P>

      <P>The Central Epidemics Command Center reported Monday two more cases of imported
swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1) , bringing the total number of
confirmed cases to 21.</P>
      <P>The center said the 20th case is a 27-year-old woman who traveled with her
husband to New York May 11 on a backpacking tour and was detected with a fever
at the airport upon her return to Taiwan June 6.</P>
      <P>A center official said the woman began feeling unwell June 3 and took over-the-
counter medication. She wore a mask throughout the flight and the official
estimated that the passengers who shared the flight with her had no risk of
being infected -- although her husband was given anti-flu medicine as a
precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>The official said the 21st case is a 21-year-old student who went to the United
States in January to study. She toured New York and Los Angles before returning
to Taiwan June 3.</P>
      <P>As she reported that she had stayed at home since her return, the center issued
anti-flu medicine to five members of her family.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou signed an instrument of accession to the World Trade
Organization's Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) Monday, completing the
procedure to make Taiwan the 41st signatory to the multilateral accord.</P>
      <P>This means that the Taiwan's government procurement market will be open to other
GPA members, and vice versa, based on the principles of reciprocity and national
parity.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government procurement market in the other GPA signatory
countries totals US$960 billion per year, Ma said his administration will spare
no effort to assist Taiwanese companies to explore markets around the world that
will now be open to them.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's public sector markets will also be open to the other GPA signatory
countries.</P>
      <P>"The multi-billion dollar 'i-Taiwan 12 Development Projects' that the
administration has been pushing since early this year are good sources of
government procurement for foreign bidders," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said joining the GPA was one of the most important commitments that Taiwan
made after it was admitted  to the World Trade Organization in 2002. The
consultations for GPA accession were completed that same year, but Taiwan could
not enter into the accord until this year because of differences across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma said that since he took office in May 2008, he has been striving to employ a
"modus vivendi" or pragmatic diplomatic strategy in relations with China and
other countries in the world.</P>
      <P>After strenuous efforts by Taiwan to communicate with the WTO, the WTO Committee
on Government Procurement  formally approved Taiwan's application to enter the
GPA on Dec. 9, 2008 and the Legislative Yuan endorsed the decision May 15, Ma
added.</P>
      <P>The GPA was adopted by the WTO in 1981 with the purpose of opening  up as much
government  procurement  as possible  to international competition.</P>
      <P>It was designed to make laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding
government procurement more transparent and to ensure they do not protect
domestic products or suppliers, or discriminate against foreign products or
suppliers.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan hopes to play a more active and responsible role in the
international community, Ma said the country will continue to study
international covenants to facilitate its efforts to integrate into the world.</P>
      <P>He added that because Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, his
administration will pull out all the stops, including ratifying international
covenants as domestic laws, to achieve international participation.</P>

06/08/09  17:49:22
(By Roger Chou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A signing activity for an online global petition calling for dementia to be made
a health-care priority has been launched, the non-profit Taiwan Alzheimer's
Disease Association (TADA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The petition aims to increase government awareness of the disease and improve
the quality of life and care for individuals with dementia, according to the
association.</P>
      <P>The association organized a promotional activity Sunday to encourage local
people to sign the Global Charter for Alzheimer's Disease petition.</P>
      <P>During the Sunday event, the association also called on the government to adopt
a more active and pragmatic approach toward care for dementia sufferers.</P>
      <P>Chen Ta-fu, a doctor at the Neurology Department of National Taiwan University
Hospital who concurrently serves as deputy chief of the TADA's education and
publicity section, estimated the dementia prevalence among different age groups
at 1.2 percent of people aged 65-69, 2.2 percent of those aged 70-74, 4.3
percent of those aged 75-79, 8.4 percent of those aged 80-84, 16.3 percent of
those aged 85-89 and 30.9 percent of those aged 90 or over.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the population of people suffering from dementia is around 160,000, a
number that is expected to exceed 620,000 by 2056, or an increase of 10,000
people every year, according to TADA President Lee Ming-bing.</P>
      <P>"This means that elderly population ratio is increasing and that the number of
elderly citizens supported by every 100 young and middle-aged people will have
increased from 14 to 75 by that time, " Lee elaborated.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 2.4 million people aged 65 or over in the country, said
Huang Pi-hsia, director of the Department of Social Affairs under the Ministry
of the Interior. Of these, 10 percent are classed as disabled and 5 percent of
those suffer from dementia. Approximately 20,000 dementia sufferers are being
cared for by various organizations and 120,000 are using services provided by
their communities.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that future services for dementia sufferers should focus on
local communities, such as setting up special areas, day care services and group
homes.</P>
      <P>At present, the assessment criteria for disability are different to those for
dementia and elderly people with dementia are usually otherwise healthy and
cannot be diagnosed in the early stages of the disease,  according to TADA
Secretary-General Tang Li-yu. They therefore require different care than other
disabled elderly people, she said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, two major reforms of social welfare policy are in the works
this year, including a long-term care insurance system and a scheme for
international classification  of functioning, disability and health, both of
which have significant influence on the welfare of dementia patients.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting Chinese economist said Monday that the possibility of the yuan being
adopted as the single currency in Asia is not very high because nations like
Japan and India are unlikely to support that idea.</P>
      <P>Cheng Siwei, who is regarded as a pioneer in China's risk investment industry,
made the remarks on the sidelines of a symposium held by Taipei-based Shih Hsin
University to discuss risks and survival strategies in relation to the global
financial storm.</P>
      <P>Cheng, a former vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China, is now the dean of the Graduate School of Management at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is in Taiwan at the invitation of Shih Hsin
University to deliver a speech at the symposium.</P>
      <P>Asked about a proposal to create a regional currency along the lines of the euro
arrangement, Cheng said that "it will be a long time before there could be an
Asian dollar."</P>
      <P>"It would take at least 10 years," the economist said, explaining that it took
Europe a decade to initiate, plan, and implement its single currency mechanism.</P>
      <P>It would take even longer for Asian countries to develop a similar currency
system in the region because the differences in economic conditions and degrees
of economic development among Asian economies are greater than among European
countries, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>A single currency cannot be successfully adopted unless the gaps narrow in the
economic conditions of the countries in the region, he said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he thought the yuan could become the regional currency, Cheng said
that would be very difficult.</P>
      <P>As to the suggested establishment of a yuan-based clearance and settlement
mechanism in light of the free trade integration of 10 members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China, Cheng said "we agree" to that
proposal, but cannot force people to accept it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Returning Taiwanese students with diplomas issued by foreign medical schools
must sit the Ministry  of Education's qualification test and complete an
internship at an appointed local hospital before they can qualify for the state
licensing examination, the health minister said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ching-chun, minister of the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH), said
the DOH will stand firm on this requirement so as to better protect the people's
health. He was referring to a demand by some Taiwanese graduates from Polish
medical schools that they be allowed to take part in the national licensing
examination without going through the first two stages.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the present Physician Act, Taiwanese medical school
graduates, except those who obtain a diploma at medical institutes in the United
States, Japan, the European Union, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand,
Singapore and Hong Kong, must meet the requirement before participating in the
state licensing examination.</P>
      <P>However, an amendment to the law put forward by the DOH and passed by the
Cabinet June 4, as well as other revisions submitted by legislators from ruling
and opposition parties, have coincided to end these exceptions, so that all
medical school students educated abroad will have to sit the qualification tests
and complete internship first.</P>
      <P>Although Yeh praised Poland's level of medical education, he said that as many
as 150 Taiwanese students opt to study medicine in Poland every year.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Taiwanese students do not have to take an examination to enter
Poland's medical institutes, but students from Taiwan who take courses in
English are not allowed to practice in Poland after graduation.</P>
      <P>"This is a strange system and it seems that Poland allows for the system to
serve Taiwanese students," he said.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that over 600 Taiwanese students are studying in Polish medical
schools, whose desire to practice in Taiwan after they return from Poland might
be lessened by the outcome of the law amendment.</P>
      <P>Thousands of medical students took to the streets in late May to demand that the
government revise the law to level the playing field for local graduates.</P>
      <P>They were especially unhappy with students returning from Poland, saying that in
recent years, local agents have made lucrative profits by recruiting Taiwanese
senior high school students to study in the East European country, where the
tuition is cheaper and the entry threshold is lower.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there is fierce competition among senior high school students each
year for only around 700 local medical school places, which means only 0.7
percent of the some 100,000 high school graduates each year can find a place.</P>

      <P>Russia's top diplomat in Taipei said Monday that bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Russia are progressing well and that the opening of a retail store in
Taipei for the oldest Russian winery is a further step in the promotion of
exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"Bilateral relations between Taiwan and Russia are progressing now. Compared to
15 years ago when there was not much contact, the relations are moving in a very
good way, " said Sergey N. Gubarev, head of the Representative Office in Taipei
for the Moscow-Taipei Coordination Commission on Economic and Cultural
Cooperation.</P>
      <P>Gubarev made the remarks at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to open the first local
retail store of Massandra, the oldest winery in Russia which supplies top
quality wine to Russian Czars and the royal family.</P>
      <P>The wine store will contribute to the promotion of bilateral trade relations,
Gubarev told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The Representative  Office in Taipei for the Moscow-Taipei Coordination
Commission on Economic and Cultural Cooperation serves as the de facto Russian
embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that bilateral trade between Taiwan and Russia reached a record US$4
billion in 2008, Gubarev said that there is close economic cooperation between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example the fact that Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group, the
world's largest provider of electronics manufacturing services, has invested
US$50 million to build a computer assembly plant in St. Petersburg.</P>
      <P>Also, the Taiwanese company Green Country was recently awarded a contract to
construct an aquarium in Vladivostok, which is scheduled to open in 2011, he
added.</P>
      <P>People-to-people exchanges are also vibrant, with some 300 Taiwanese students in
Russia and 200 Russian students in Taiwan, Gubarev said, adding that around
10,000 to 12,000 Taiwanese travelers go to Russia each year.</P>
      <P>Alexander  Braslavskiy,  president  of the Russian Business Development Center
in Taiwan and owner of the wine store, said that he hopes the store will help
bridge the cultural gap between Taiwan and Russia and serve as a platform for
people in Taiwan to better understand the history of Russia.</P>
      <P>Established in 1894 under the order of Russian Czar Nicholas II, the Massandra
winery is frequently honored as the finest in Russia. The winery holds a
Guinness World Record for its collection of over a million bottles of both
Russian and Western European wines.</P>

      <P>A sub-group of the Yunlin County Council said Monday they want a chemical plant
owned by Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) in the southwestern Taiwan county to
suspend operations immediately to prevent locals from being further inflicted
with cancer-causing air pollution from the plant.</P>
      <P>The Sixth Naphtha Cracking Plant in Mailiao, Yunlin has been in operation since
1999. Naphtha cracking plants produce the raw materials for plastics. Cracking
is a refining process using heat and pressure.</P>
      <P>The sub-group formed by Yunlin councilors from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) cited results of an investigation conducted  by
professor Chan Chang-chuan  with National Taiwan University which indicated that
cancer rates in the areas near the plant had grown substantially since the
factory was opened.</P>
      <P>According to the investigation report, cancer incidents have grown noticeably
among residents in Mailiao township and four other adjacent townships of Taisi,
Dongshih, Lunbei and Sihhu since the cracking plant began to emit volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) in 1999.</P>
      <P>Infliction rates of liver cancer have grown 30 percent in Taisi township over
the past nine years, according to the investigation conducted by Chan under the
consignment of the Yunlin County Environmental Protection Bureau.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Yunlin residents' cancer infliction rate is now 1.7 times higher
than the average of residents in other cities and counties around Taiwan, DPP
Councilor Liao Ching-hsiang said measures must be taken immediately to address
the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Formosa office in Mailiao said that the Yunlin County
Environmental Protection Bureau had conducted testing of the air in the areas
near the cracking plant many times over the past several years and that the air
quality was found to be normal.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese businessmen will "not necessarily" immediately invest in China once
the government lifts the restrictions, according to Hwang.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Pan Meng-an said that
establishing a 12-inch fab in China costs at least NT$100 billion (US$3.04
billion) , and will attract economic resources from up- and down-stream, which
he warned will result in the "eradication" of the industry from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the ministry's evaluation will focus on the division of labor between
Taiwan and China, emphasizing that state-of-the-art technology will be made to
stay in Taiwan, while older technology will be allowed to move to China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far allowed local chipmakers to produce only 8- inch or smaller
semiconductor wafers and to use 0.18-micron or larger processes in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, the DPP held a news conference at the Legislative Yuan to
criticize the government's proposed move.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lee Chun-yee said the semiconductor industry is Taiwan's
economic lifeline and there should be a comprehensive evaluation before the move
is made into policy, while another DPP caucus whip, Kao Jyh-peng, predicted that
the policy, if adopted, will cause tens of thousands of Taiwanese people to lose
their jobs while investment and know-how will move to China.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei, the policy will result in only micro-
profits for Taiwanese firms, noting that earnings per share (EPS) and net profit
margins of local firms fell after the government lifted restrictions on
investment of 8-inch equivalent wafer fabs in China in 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.K., Taiwan seek collaboration to expand business in Greater China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Britain Business Council (TBBC) is scheduled to hold its 11th annual
joint meeting in Taipei June 9, with the objective to foster fast-growing ties
between Taiwanese and British businesses and to seek opportunities for the two
sides to collaborate in the Greater China area, the organizers said Monday.</P>
      <P>The TBBC's two co-chairmen, Leslie Koo, who is also chairman of Taiwan Cement
Corp, and Thomas Harris, vice chairman of Standard Chartered Capital Markets,
said at Monday's press conference that the meeting  will focus on three sectors
where there is already substantial synergy between the U.K. and Taiwanese
economies -- financial  and  professional  services,  ICT  and  media,  and
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In addition, the meeting seeks to identify and develop new initiatives for
British and Taiwanese companies to work together in the Greater China region and
other countries. It will also review the progress of a joint letter signed last
year involving bilateral trade issues and make suggestions to each other's
government on how to better assist business in each other's country.</P>
      <P>David Campbell, director of the Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office
(BTCO) , said at the press conference that there is still a lot of room for
improvement regarding Taiwanese investment in the U.K., despite close economic
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to Campbell, there are some 180 Taiwanese companies in the U.K.,
representing around 70 percent of Taiwan's investment in Europe. However,  just
one percent of Taiwan's total overseas investments goes to Europe and that is a
much lower figure than other economies in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>"A very important exercise for the council is to seek ways in which we can
encourage greater investment. If you look at the huge European market, the most
obvious location I would suggest as a springboard is the U.K.," Campbell said.</P>
      <P>Harris also expressed similar views, saying that in 2000, Taiwanese direct
investment in Europe was roughly the same as South Korea, while as of today,
Korea has four times as much in foreign direct investment in Europe as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has a lot of catching-up to do on the investment front, " Harris said.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, the total trade value between Taiwan and the U.K. was
worth nearly US$5.4 billion in 2008 and this continues to grow steadily despite
the current turbulent economic situation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to the U.K. amounted to US$3.5 billion in 2008, a 0.17 percent
growth from the preceding year, while Taiwan's imports from the U.K. were worth
US$1.8 billion, a slight decrease of 1.7 percent, it added.</P>
      <P>The TBBC was established in 1999 with the aim of promoting bilateral trade and
investment ties between the U.K. and Taiwan by encouraging closer links between
the two markets, by disseminating relevant market information and by cooperating
to remove impediments to market access.</P>
      <P>Supervised by the U.K. Trade and Investment Bureau and Taiwan's Bureau of
Foreign Trade, the council meets once a year, alternatively in the U.K. and
Taiwan, to bring together business representatives from both sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Increased subsidies announced for Hualien rice farmers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Rice farmers in eastern Taiwan's Hualien County will get more subsidies for
their spring crops damaged by low temperatures in early April, the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The COA's Agriculture and Food Agency announced that Hualien rice farmers will
be subsidized NT$16,000 (US$486.9) in cash for each hectare of land, if 20
percent of their rice paddy or more was hit by the cold weather. Farmers whose
paddy was at least 80 percent damaged will get an additional NT$12,000 in clean-
up fees.</P>
      <P>The NT$16,000 was on par with the request by Hualien farmers, and twice the
level the COA was originally planning to give to farmers.</P>
      <P>The increased subsidies come a couple of days after hundreds of rice farmers
from eastern Taiwan's Hualien and Taitung counties protested last Friday in
front of the COA headquarters, demanding it pay more subsidies for the damage
done to their crops by the low temperatures.</P>
      <P>According to the Hualien County, 3,229 hectares of the county's farmland were
affected by the weather condition, resulting in a loss of rice production worth
NT$169.5 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some rice paddies in Taitung and Ylan counties were also affected.
But the COA is still investigating to what extent the two counties in eastern
Taiwan have been affected.</P>
      <P>Despite damage to the crops' spring harvest in eastern Taiwan, rice prices have
remained stable, as the damaged crops' impact on the country's overall rice
production is limited.</P>
      <P>Rice planted in eastern Taiwan enjoys widespread popularity among consumers
because of its high quality. The rice has also successfully edged into the
quality-conscious Japanese market.</P>

      <P>Am artist from Pingtung County in southern Taiwan who belongs to the Paiwan
aboriginal tribe has been telling stories of his people through paintings on
coffee cups in the hope that the common modern utility can spread greater
understanding of his tribe's culture.</P>
      <P>Fifty-year-old Ljegeay Mavalin said Monday in an interview with CNA he hopes
that when people sip coffee out of his cups with their friends, they will talk
to each other about the stories told on the receptacles.</P>
      <P>"In this way the stories will be passed on, " he said, adding that he has
thought long and hard since embarking on his artistic career about how to keep
Paiwan culture alive in the modern world.</P>
      <P>Asked what inspired him to use coffee cups as his canvas, Ljegeay -- who uses
only his first name -- said coffee has a very big global market, which gives his
work a large area in which to circulate.</P>
      <P>The stories feature traditional trappings of Paiwan life such as tribal ceramic
pots, glass beads and the Formosan sambar deer.</P>
      <P>The image of the Formosa sambar in particular is often seen in Ljegeay's recent
work, because,  he said,  he wants to raise consciousness about environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>In the past, the animal was easily spotted in the mountains all over Taiwan.
Today, however, the species is seen only rarely at high altitude, having been
forced upward by human encroachment, Ljegeay said.</P>
      <P>His unique cups have been selected this year by the Pingtung county government
as one of the best souvenirs of the county.</P>
      <P>Marketing the product along with coffee grown by his tribe in the Pingtung
mountains, Ljegeay said he wants not just sell Paiwan culture but also to
promote tribal industry.</P>

      <P>The Central  Taiwan  Science  Park Administration forecast Monday that the
park's business turnover for the whole of this year will exceed NT$250 billion
(US$7.6 billion) , based on increased monthly growth.</P>
      <P>Thanks to improved business conditions around the globe since late last year,
the park recorded a combined NT$29.5 billion in revenue for the March-April
period, marking a 55 percent rise over the January-February level, according to

      <P>In terms of industry, opto-electronics contributed the largest share of 77.58
percent to the park's total turnover in March and April, followed by the

    <HEADLINE>Exports will show positive annual growth late this year: MOF</HEADLINE>

06/08/09  21:04:49
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) predicted Monday that the annual growth rate for
Taiwanese exports will turn from negative to positive this year, but not until
November or December.</P>
      <P>Lin Lee-jen, director of the ministry's Department of Statistics, noted that
exports in the first 10 months of last year were high and she made her forecast
based on this high comparison base.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in November 2008 totaled US$16.77 billion, down sharply from
the preceding month's US$20.81 billion.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks came as the department unveiled May's export figures, which
amounted to US$16.17 billion, a new high over the past six months and an
increase of 8.9 percent, or US$1.33 billion, over the April figure.</P>
      <P>However, the amount represented a decrease of US$7.42 billion, or 31.4 percent,
from the same month of last year, a smaller decline than the average of 36
percent for the first four months and also less than the drop of 41.9 percent
recorded last December.</P>
      <P>The MOF said this shows that "export decline has slowed down" and that "exports
will gradually pick up."</P>
      <P>Imports in May totaled US$13.01 billion, up for the fifth consecutive year and
representing an increase of US$300 million from April, giving the country a
trade surplus of US$3.17 billion.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's exports to major trading partners all recorded increases.
Among them, the increases were most visible in the China and Hong Kong figures,
followed by the six Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries --
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The ratio of exports to China and Hong Kong accounted for 41.7 percent of the
total exports for May, up from 29.9 percent recorded for January this year,
while the ratio for ASEAN accounted for 15 percent of the total and the ratios
for the United States, Europe and Japan were 11.4 percent, 10.3 percent and 7.1
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Among the export increases, electronics products increased by US$230 million,
chemicals increased by US$210 million and optical instrument increased by US$200
million.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's second Central America diplomatic tour this year will
center on promoting trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan's diplomatic
allies in the region, Presidential Office sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fresh from a three-leg Central America visit from May 26-June 4 that took him to
Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, Ma will head for the region again late this
month on a similar diplomatic mission.</P>
      <P>High on Ma's itinerary this time around will be attending the inauguration of
Panama President-elect Ricardo Martinelli. The main event of his just-concluded
trip was the inauguration of new El Salvador President Mauricio Funes.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to depart Taipei June 29 for Panama City via San Francisco.
Following the Panama visit, he will proceed to Nicaragua and then Honduras for
state visits before returning to Taipei July 7 via a transit stop in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office sources said that although Ma canceled a plan to meet with
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega while both of them were in San Salvador early
this month to attend Funes' inauguration, Ma's plan to visit Nicaragua during
his upcoming diplomatic tour remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Ma had courtesy phone conversations with Ortega before
leaving the Salvadoran capital June 2 for home.</P>
      <P>"The cancellation of the meeting with Ortega in San Salvador will neither affect
President Ma's Nicaragua travel plan nor relations between the two countries, "
said a Presidential Office staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma's last Central America tour focused on promoting cultural
exchanges, the official said the Panama-Nicaragua-Honduras trip will carry a
theme of promoting trade and economic ties.</P>
      <P>As many Taiwanese business groups have major investment projects in Panama, the
official went on, some prominent business executives such as Evergreen Marine
Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa will accompany Ma on his trip.</P>
      <P>Ma will also charter a plane from EVA Airways -- an Evergreen Marine Group
affiliate -- to carry him and his entourage.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching and the famed Ju Percussion Group will also accompany

      <P>Taiwan's share prices opened high but closed 3.33 percent lower Monday, dropping

      <P>The local bourse opened at the day's high of 6,907.32 and dropped to the day's

      <P>The market pullback came following recent gains after the stock market rose

    <HEADLINE>DOH firm on qualification tests for returning medical students</HEADLINE>

06/08/09  18:47:33
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Returning Taiwanese students with diplomas issued by foreign medical schools
must sit the Ministry  of Education's qualification test and complete an
internship at an appointed local hospital before they can qualify for the state
licensing examination, the health minister said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ching-chun, minister of the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH), said
the DOH will stand firm on this requirement so as to better protect the people's
health. He was referring to a demand by some Taiwanese graduates from Polish
medical schools that they be allowed to take part in the national licensing
examination without going through the first two stages.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the present Physician Act, Taiwanese medical school
graduates, except those who obtain a diploma at medical institutes in the United
States, Japan, the European Union, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand,
Singapore and Hong Kong, must meet the requirement before participating in the
state licensing examination.</P>
      <P>However, an amendment to the law put forward by the DOH and passed by the
Cabinet June 4, as well as other revisions submitted by legislators from ruling
and opposition parties, have coincided to end these exceptions, so that all
medical school students educated abroad will have to sit the qualification tests
and complete internship first.</P>
      <P>Although Yeh praised Poland's level of medical education, he said that as many
as 150 Taiwanese students opt to study medicine in Poland every year.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Taiwanese students do not have to take an examination to enter
Poland's medical institutes, but students from Taiwan who take courses in
English are not allowed to practice in Poland after graduation.</P>
      <P>"This is a strange system and it seems that Poland allows for the system to
serve Taiwanese students," he said.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that over 600 Taiwanese students are studying in Polish medical
schools, whose desire to practice in Taiwan after they return from Poland might
be lessened by the outcome of the law amendment.</P>
      <P>Thousands of medical students took to the streets in late May to demand that the
government revise the law to level the playing field for local graduates.</P>
      <P>They were especially unhappy with students returning from Poland, saying that in
recent years, local agents have made lucrative profits by recruiting Taiwanese
senior high school students to study in the East European country, where the
tuition is cheaper and the entry threshold is lower.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there is fierce competition among senior high school students each
year for only around 700 local medical school places, which means only 0.7
percent of the some 100,000 high school graduates each year can find a place.</P>

      <P>Russia's top diplomat in Taipei said Monday that bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Russia are progressing well and that the opening of a retail store in
Taipei for the oldest Russian winery is a further step in the promotion of
exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"Bilateral relations between Taiwan and Russia are progressing now. Compared to
15 years ago when there was not much contact, the relations are moving in a very
good way, " said Sergey N. Gubarev, head of the Representative Office in Taipei
for the Moscow-Taipei Coordination Commission on Economic and Cultural
Cooperation.</P>
      <P>Gubarev made the remarks at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to open the first local
retail store of Massandra, the oldest winery in Russia which supplies top
quality wine to Russian Czars and the royal family.</P>
      <P>The wine store will contribute to the promotion of bilateral trade relations,
Gubarev told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The Representative  Office in Taipei for the Moscow-Taipei Coordination
Commission on Economic and Cultural Cooperation serves as the de facto Russian
embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that bilateral trade between Taiwan and Russia reached a record US$4
billion in 2008, Gubarev said that there is close economic cooperation between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example the fact that Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group, the
world's largest provider of electronics manufacturing services, has invested
US$50 million to build a computer assembly plant in St. Petersburg.</P>
      <P>Also, the Taiwanese company Green Country was recently awarded a contract to
construct an aquarium in Vladivostok, which is scheduled to open in 2011, he
added.</P>
      <P>People-to-people exchanges are also vibrant, with some 300 Taiwanese students in
Russia and 200 Russian students in Taiwan, Gubarev said, adding that around
10,000 to 12,000 Taiwanese travelers go to Russia each year.</P>
      <P>Alexander  Braslavskiy,  president  of the Russian Business Development Center
in Taiwan and owner of the wine store, said that he hopes the store will help
bridge the cultural gap between Taiwan and Russia and serve as a platform for
people in Taiwan to better understand the history of Russia.</P>
      <P>Established in 1894 under the order of Russian Czar Nicholas II, the Massandra
winery is frequently honored as the finest in Russia. The winery holds a
Guinness World Record for its collection of over a million bottles of both
Russian and Western European wines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Yunlin wants FPG naphtha cracker closed on cancer fears</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A sub-group of the Yunlin County Council said Monday they want a chemical plant
owned by Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) in the southwestern Taiwan county to
suspend operations immediately to prevent locals from being further inflicted
with cancer-causing air pollution from the plant.</P>
      <P>The Sixth Naphtha Cracking Plant in Mailiao, Yunlin has been in operation since
1999. Naphtha cracking plants produce the raw materials for plastics. Cracking
is a refining process using heat and pressure.</P>
      <P>The sub-group formed by Yunlin councilors from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) cited results of an investigation conducted  by
professor Chan Chang-chuan  with National Taiwan University which indicated that
cancer rates in the areas near the plant had grown substantially since the
factory was opened.</P>
      <P>According to the investigation report, cancer incidents have grown noticeably
among residents in Mailiao township and four other adjacent townships of Taisi,
Dongshih, Lunbei and Sihhu since the cracking plant began to emit volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) in 1999.</P>
      <P>Infliction rates of liver cancer have grown 30 percent in Taisi township over
the past nine years, according to the investigation conducted by Chan under the
consignment of the Yunlin County Environmental Protection Bureau.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Yunlin residents' cancer infliction rate is now 1.7 times higher
than the average of residents in other cities and counties around Taiwan, DPP
Councilor Liao Ching-hsiang said measures must be taken immediately to address
the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Formosa office in Mailiao said that the Yunlin County
Environmental Protection Bureau had conducted testing of the air in the areas
near the cracking plant many times over the past several years and that the air
quality was found to be normal.</P>
      <P>"It's hard to pinpoint one single factor as the culprit of cancers since factors
that may cause cancers are so many, " said a Formosa staff member.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government evaluating allowing local 12-inch fabs in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is evaluating whether to allow
semiconductor manufacturers to move their 12-inch wafer fabs to China, an
evaluation that will be the ministry's main task in the second half of the year,
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hwang made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to lawmakers'
questions stemming from an earlier statement on the move by President Ma Ying-
jeou.</P>
      <P>Ma said in a statement June 5 after meeting Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT.O)
President and CEO Michael Splinter that Taiwan does not rule out allowing local
12-inch wafer fabs to go to China.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question from ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-hua, Hwang
said the policy has not yet been hammered out and added that the ministry's
evaluation will craft measures to keep research and development and advanced
technology in Taiwan, although he admitted it is unavoidable that some
technicians and engineers will move to China.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen will "not necessarily" immediately invest in China once
the government lifts the restrictions, according to Hwang.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Pan Meng-an said that
establishing a 12-inch fab in China costs at least NT$100 billion (US$3.04
billion) , and will attract economic resources from up- and down-stream, which
he warned will result in the "eradication" of the industry from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the ministry's evaluation will focus on the division of labor between
Taiwan and China, emphasizing that state-of-the-art technology will be made to
stay in Taiwan, while older technology will be allowed to move to China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far allowed local chipmakers to produce only 8- inch or smaller
semiconductor wafers and to use 0.18-micron or larger processes in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, the DPP held a news conference at the Legislative Yuan to
criticize the government's proposed move.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lee Chun-yee said the semiconductor industry is Taiwan's
economic lifeline and there should be a comprehensive evaluation before the move
is made into policy, while another DPP caucus whip, Kao Jyh-peng, predicted that
the policy, if adopted, will cause tens of thousands of Taiwanese people to lose
their jobs while investment and know-how will move to China.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei, the policy will result in only micro-
profits for Taiwanese firms, noting that earnings per share (EPS) and net profit
margins of local firms fell after the government lifted restrictions on
investment of 8-inch equivalent wafer fabs in China in 2002.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Britain Business Council (TBBC) is scheduled to hold its 11th annual
joint meeting in Taipei June 9, with the objective to foster fast-growing ties
between Taiwanese and British businesses and to seek opportunities for the two
sides to collaborate in the Greater China area, the organizers said Monday.</P>
      <P>The TBBC's two co-chairmen, Leslie Koo, who is also chairman of Taiwan Cement
Corp, and Thomas Harris, vice chairman of Standard Chartered Capital Markets,
said at Monday's press conference that the meeting  will focus on three sectors
where there is already substantial synergy between the U.K. and Taiwanese
economies -- financial  and  professional  services,  ICT  and  media,  and
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In addition, the meeting seeks to identify and develop new initiatives for
British and Taiwanese companies to work together in the Greater China region and
other countries. It will also review the progress of a joint letter signed last
year involving bilateral trade issues and make suggestions to each other's
government on how to better assist business in each other's country.</P>
      <P>David Campbell, director of the Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office
(BTCO) , said at the press conference that there is still a lot of room for
improvement regarding Taiwanese investment in the U.K., despite close economic
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to Campbell, there are some 180 Taiwanese companies in the U.K.,
representing around 70 percent of Taiwan's investment in Europe. However,  just
one percent of Taiwan's total overseas investments goes to Europe and that is a
much lower figure than other economies in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>"A very important exercise for the council is to seek ways in which we can
encourage greater investment. If you look at the huge European market, the most
obvious location I would suggest as a springboard is the U.K.," Campbell said.</P>
      <P>Harris also expressed similar views, saying that in 2000, Taiwanese direct
investment in Europe was roughly the same as South Korea, while as of today,
Korea has four times as much in foreign direct investment in Europe as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has a lot of catching-up to do on the investment front, " Harris said.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, the total trade value between Taiwan and the U.K. was
worth nearly US$5.4 billion in 2008 and this continues to grow steadily despite
the current turbulent economic situation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to the U.K. amounted to US$3.5 billion in 2008, a 0.17 percent
growth from the preceding year, while Taiwan's imports from the U.K. were worth
US$1.8 billion, a slight decrease of 1.7 percent, it added.</P>
      <P>The TBBC was established in 1999 with the aim of promoting bilateral trade and
investment ties between the U.K. and Taiwan by encouraging closer links between
the two markets, by disseminating relevant market information and by cooperating
to remove impediments to market access.</P>
      <P>Supervised by the U.K. Trade and Investment Bureau and Taiwan's Bureau of
Foreign Trade, the council meets once a year, alternatively in the U.K. and
Taiwan, to bring together business representatives from both sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Increased subsidies announced for Hualien rice farmers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Rice farmers in eastern Taiwan's Hualien County will get more subsidies for
their spring crops damaged by low temperatures in early April, the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The COA's Agriculture and Food Agency announced that Hualien rice farmers will
be subsidized NT$16,000 (US$486.9) in cash for each hectare of land, if 20
percent of their rice paddy or more was hit by the cold weather. Farmers whose
paddy was at least 80 percent damaged will get an additional NT$12,000 in clean-
up fees.</P>
      <P>The NT$16,000 was on par with the request by Hualien farmers, and twice the
level the COA was originally planning to give to farmers.</P>
      <P>The increased subsidies come a couple of days after hundreds of rice farmers
from eastern Taiwan's Hualien and Taitung counties protested last Friday in
front of the COA headquarters, demanding it pay more subsidies for the damage
done to their crops by the low temperatures.</P>
      <P>According to the Hualien County, 3,229 hectares of the county's farmland were
affected by the weather condition, resulting in a loss of rice production worth
NT$169.5 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some rice paddies in Taitung and Ylan counties were also affected.
But the COA is still investigating to what extent the two counties in eastern
Taiwan have been affected.</P>
      <P>Despite damage to the crops' spring harvest in eastern Taiwan, rice prices have
remained stable, as the damaged crops' impact on the country's overall rice
production is limited.</P>
      <P>Rice planted in eastern Taiwan enjoys widespread popularity among consumers
because of its high quality. The rice has also successfully edged into the
quality-conscious Japanese market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Am artist from Pingtung County in southern Taiwan who belongs to the Paiwan
aboriginal tribe has been telling stories of his people through paintings on
coffee cups in the hope that the common modern utility can spread greater
understanding of his tribe's culture.</P>
      <P>Fifty-year-old Ljegeay Mavalin said Monday in an interview with CNA he hopes
that when people sip coffee out of his cups with their friends, they will talk
to each other about the stories told on the receptacles.</P>
      <P>"In this way the stories will be passed on, " he said, adding that he has
thought long and hard since embarking on his artistic career about how to keep
Paiwan culture alive in the modern world.</P>
      <P>Asked what inspired him to use coffee cups as his canvas, Ljegeay -- who uses
only his first name -- said coffee has a very big global market, which gives his
work a large area in which to circulate.</P>
      <P>The stories feature traditional trappings of Paiwan life such as tribal ceramic
pots, glass beads and the Formosan sambar deer.</P>
      <P>The image of the Formosa sambar in particular is often seen in Ljegeay's recent
work, because,  he said,  he wants to raise consciousness about environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>In the past, the animal was easily spotted in the mountains all over Taiwan.
Today, however, the species is seen only rarely at high altitude, having been
forced upward by human encroachment, Ljegeay said.</P>
      <P>His unique cups have been selected this year by the Pingtung county government
as one of the best souvenirs of the county.</P>
      <P>Marketing the product along with coffee grown by his tribe in the Pingtung
mountains, Ljegeay said he wants not just sell Paiwan culture but also to
promote tribal industry.</P>

      <P>The Central  Taiwan  Science  Park Administration forecast Monday that the
park's business turnover for the whole of this year will exceed NT$250 billion
(US$7.6 billion) , based on increased monthly growth.</P>
      <P>Thanks to improved business conditions around the globe since late last year,
the park recorded a combined NT$29.5 billion in revenue for the March-April
period, marking a 55 percent rise over the January-February level, according to
statistics compiled by the administration.</P>
      <P>In terms of industry, opto-electronics contributed the largest share of 77.58
percent to the park's total turnover in March and April, followed by the
semiconductor industry with 19.26 percent.</P>
      <P>The park's business is expected to continue showing monthly growth over the next
several months, administration officials said.</P>
      <P>The park's business turnover in February totaled NT$10.3 billion (US$308

    <HEADLINE>Exports will show positive annual growth late this year: MOF</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) predicted Monday that the annual growth rate for
Taiwanese exports will turn from negative to positive this year, but not until
November or December.</P>
      <P>Lin Lee-jen, director of the ministry's Department of Statistics, noted that
exports in the first 10 months of last year were high and she made her forecast
based on this high comparison base.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in November 2008 totaled US$16.77 billion, down sharply from
the preceding month's US$20.81 billion.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks came as the department unveiled May's export figures, which
amounted to US$16.17 billion, a new high over the past six months and an
increase of 8.9 percent, or US$1.33 billion, over the April figure.</P>
      <P>However, the amount represented a decrease of US$7.42 billion, or 31.4 percent,
from the same month of last year, a smaller decline than the average of 36
percent for the first four months and also less than the drop of 41.9 percent
recorded last December.</P>
      <P>The MOF said this shows that "export decline has slowed down" and that "exports
will gradually pick up."</P>
      <P>Imports in May totaled US$13.01 billion, up for the fifth consecutive year and
representing an increase of US$300 million from April, giving the country a
trade surplus of US$3.17 billion.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's exports to major trading partners all recorded increases.
Among them, the increases were most visible in the China and Hong Kong figures,
followed by the six Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries --
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The ratio of exports to China and Hong Kong accounted for 41.7 percent of the
total exports for May, up from 29.9 percent recorded for January this year,
while the ratio for ASEAN accounted for 15 percent of the total and the ratios
for the United States, Europe and Japan were 11.4 percent, 10.3 percent and 7.1
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Among the export increases, electronics products increased by US$230 million,
chemicals increased by US$210 million and optical instrument increased by US$200
million.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's second Central America diplomatic tour this year will
center on promoting trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan's diplomatic
allies in the region, Presidential Office sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fresh from a three-leg Central America visit from May 26-June 4 that took him to
Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, Ma will head for the region again late this
month on a similar diplomatic mission.</P>
      <P>High on Ma's itinerary this time around will be attending the inauguration of
Panama President-elect Ricardo Martinelli. The main event of his just-concluded
trip was the inauguration of new El Salvador President Mauricio Funes.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to depart Taipei June 29 for Panama City via San Francisco.
Following the Panama visit, he will proceed to Nicaragua and then Honduras for
state visits before returning to Taipei July 7 via a transit stop in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office sources said that although Ma canceled a plan to meet with
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega while both of them were in San Salvador early
this month to attend Funes' inauguration, Ma's plan to visit Nicaragua during
his upcoming diplomatic tour remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Ma had courtesy phone conversations with Ortega before
leaving the Salvadoran capital June 2 for home.</P>
      <P>"The cancellation of the meeting with Ortega in San Salvador will neither affect
President Ma's Nicaragua travel plan nor relations between the two countries, "
said a Presidential Office staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma's last Central America tour focused on promoting cultural
exchanges, the official said the Panama-Nicaragua-Honduras trip will carry a
theme of promoting trade and economic ties.</P>
      <P>As many Taiwanese business groups have major investment projects in Panama, the
official went on, some prominent business executives such as Evergreen Marine
Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa will accompany Ma on his trip.</P>
      <P>Ma will also charter a plane from EVA Airways -- an Evergreen Marine Group
affiliate -- to carry him and his entourage.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching and the famed Ju Percussion Group will also accompany

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's second Central America diplomatic tour this year will
center on promoting trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan's diplomatic
allies in the region, Presidential Office sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fresh from a three-leg Central America visit from May 26-June 4 that took him to
Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, Ma will head for the region again late this
month on a similar diplomatic mission.</P>
      <P>High on Ma's itinerary this time around will be attending the inauguration of
Panama President-elect Ricardo Martinelli. The main event of his just-concluded
trip was the inauguration of new El Salvador President Mauricio Funes.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to depart Taipei June 29 for Panama City via San Francisco.
Following the Panama visit, he will proceed to Nicaragua and then Honduras for
state visits before returning to Taipei July 7 via a transit stop in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office sources said that although Ma canceled a plan to meet with
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega while both of them were in San Salvador early
this month to attend Funes' inauguration, Ma's plan to visit Nicaragua during
his upcoming diplomatic tour remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Ma had courtesy phone conversations with Ortega before
leaving the Salvadoran capital June 2 for home.</P>
      <P>"The cancellation of the meeting with Ortega in San Salvador will neither affect
President Ma's Nicaragua travel plan nor relations between the two countries, "
said a Presidential Office staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma's last Central America tour focused on promoting cultural
exchanges, the official said the Panama-Nicaragua-Honduras trip will carry a
theme of promoting trade and economic ties.</P>
      <P>As many Taiwanese business groups have major investment projects in Panama, the
official went on, some prominent business executives such as Evergreen Marine
Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa will accompany Ma on his trip.</P>
      <P>Ma will also charter a plane from EVA Airways -- an Evergreen Marine Group
affiliate -- to carry him and his entourage.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching and the famed Ju Percussion Group will also accompany
Ma as they did on his last trip, the official said.</P>

      <P>Completion of the first phase of the project, on a 6.5-hectare site that has
been leased for 99 years from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office, Taiwan's representative office in the United States, is expected to take
about two years.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the project will include clearing and grading the site in
suburban Neihu District as well as building a perimeter security system,
vehicular and pedestrian access control facilities, recreational facilities,
guards quarters, maintenance buildings and a surface parking area.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei was ranked as the 62nd most livable city in the world for the second
consecutive year, in the latest global  survey  released  Monday  by the
U.K.-based  Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).</P>
      <P>The survey, now in its 10th year, assesses living conditions in 140 cities
around the world by assigning a rating of relative comfort based on over 30
qualitative and quantitative factors in five broad categories -- stability,
healthcare,  culture and environment, education, and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The survey gives an overall rating of 0-100, with 1 denoting intolerable
conditions and 100 ideal conditions.</P>
      <P>Sixty-four cities achieved scores of more than 80, while 13 cities were ranked
in the bottom tier of livability with ratings of below 50.</P>
      <P>Jon Copestake, editor of the report, told the CNA that Taipei obtained a rating
of 81.9, which means that the city has few, if any, living standard challenges.</P>
      <P>He suggested,  however,  that  Taipei  seek to hold  more international sports
events and improve its living environment in order to gain a higher ranking.</P>
      <P>In the greater China region, Hong Kong placed the highest at 39th, Tianjin 72nd,
Suzhou 74th, Beijing 76th, Shenzhen 83rd, Shanghai 84th, Dalian 85th, Guangzhou
89th, and Qingdao 95th.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, Vancouver retained its ranking as the most livable city, followed by
Vienna, Melbourne, Toronto, Perth and Calgary (tied for fifth), Helsinki,
Geneva, and Sydney and Zurich (tied for ninth).</P>
      <P>Rounding up the top 20 were Adelaide, Auckland, Osaka, Stockholm and Hamburg
(tied for 14th), Brisbane, Montreal and Paris (tied for 17th), and Frankfurt and
Tokyo (tied for 19th).</P>
      <P>Among the U.S. cities in the top tier were Pittsburgh in 29th place, and New
York in 56th position.</P>
      <P>London, meanwhile, was ranked 51st.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the cities with the best score tend to be mid-sized, in
developed countries with a low population density, have cultural and
recreational assets, lower crime levels, and fewer infrastructure problems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>British expert positive about Taiwan's economic prospects</HEADLINE>

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gerard Lyons, chief economist of the British Standard Chartered Bank, expressed
confidence Tuesday in Taiwan's economic prospects and suggested that Taiwanese
companies seize the business opportunities in China.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese economy will lead Asia out of this recession. It will lead Asia out
of this recession both directly through increased demands and indirectly through
increased confidence, " Lyons said at the 11th Joint Meeting of the Taiwan
British Business Council (TBBC) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, like the U.K., is an industrial country but it should transform to a
more service-driven economy by investing in R&amp;D and knowledge-based
capabilities, he suggested.</P>
      <P>With regard to the global economy, the turning point is near, Lyons said.</P>
      <P>"The positive factor is that the economy is likely to hit bottom this autumn and
recovery will become evident next year, " the economist forecast.</P>
      <P>However, Standard Chartered Bank thinks that the recovery in the West will be a
difficult one, he added.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Asia would come out of the recession sooner than the West, but
the region would not return to the levels of the boom years, as it would need a
strong America, Britain and Germany for that to happen.</P>
      <P>"You will see growth and exports return to the levels of 2002-2004, not to the
levels of 2004-2007, " Lyons said. "A very important message is that rebalance
in this region will need to see Asia spending more and saving less."</P>
      <P>David Campbell, director of the Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office,
also expressed similar confidence in Taiwan's economic prospects.</P>
      <P>He said at the meeting that the improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations between
Taiwan and China over the past year have greatly benefited both Taiwanese and
British companies in the region and that many British companies have expressed
interest in development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is a very good time for us to be raising the awareness in the U.K. of the
changes and the new opportunities in Taiwan, " Campbell said.</P>
      <P>The TBBC was established in 1999 with the aim of promoting bilateral trade and
investment ties between the U.K. and Taiwan by encouraging closer links between
the two markets, by disseminating relevant market information and by cooperation
to remove impediments to market access.</P>
      <P>The council, which is supervised by the U.K. Trade and Investment Bureau and
Taiwan's Bureau of Foreign Trade, meets once a year alternatively in the U.K.
and Taiwan and brings together business representatives from both sides.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou proposed Tuesday that people learning Chinese should
learn to read the traditional Chinese characters used in Taiwan and Hong Kong
but at the same time should also know how to use the simplified character system
engineered by the communist regime in China.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes his proposal of "recognizing traditional Chinese characters but
also knowing simplified" will be put on the agenda of discussions between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at the Presidential Office in a meeting with a group of
overseas Chinese who live in the United States.</P>
      <P>Traditional Chinese characters and the simplified version are two standard sets
of printed Chinese characters, with the traditional used in Taiwan as the
official written language, while China uses the simplified characters it
introduced in the 1950s in an effort to reduce illiteracy among rural Chinese.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has spared no efforts to promote the use of traditional Chinese
characters over the years and pointed out that the system is essential for
people who want to read books written in China 2,000 or 3,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>"There are few cultures in the world apart from Chinese whose writing systems
have remained viable throughout so many different eras, " he said, underlining
the importance of preserving the traditional system of writing Chinese
characters.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in many Chinese schools overseas, they teach students from Taiwan
traditional characters, but lecture students from China using simplified.</P>
      <P>He said it is a pity that those who only know simplified characters cannot read
words in traditional characters, while people taught using traditional
characters can quite easily read simplified.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he proposed that traditional characters should be used in printing as
much as possible to allow the Chinese canon to remain linked to tradition
Chinese culture.</P>

      <P>A megamouth shark, one of the world's rarest species, was caught Monday by a
fisherman from the eastern county of Taitung, marine biologists said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to National Taiwan Ocean University's Department of Environmental
Biology and Fisheries Science, the shark is only the 42nd that has been caught
or sighted worldwide and the ninth in Taiwan since the species was discovered in
1976.</P>
      <P>The shark was 3.9 meter long, weighed 350 kilograms and its mouth when opened
measured 75 centimeters across. It was netted off the county's Chenggong coast
and was sold Tuesday for NT$18,000 (US$549) to a local shark museum where it
will be displayed as a preserved specimen.</P>
      <P>The fish was identified by a researcher surnamed Tien, from the Eastern  Marine
Biology Research  Center under the Council of Agriculture's Fisheries Research
Institute. Tien said the species is very unusual and that it was the first time
in his career that he ever saw a megamouth shark.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-jung, the owner of the shark museum, said he has collected dozens of
shark specimens but this was his first megamouth.</P>
      <P>The last record of the species being spotted was in late March, when a
500-kilogram, 4-meter megamouth was caught off Burias Island in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The megamouth shark is so named because of its large mouth.</P>

Islands, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, this year's leaders' summit will touch on issues such as the
global economic downturn, climate change and fishery resources.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry will also seek to establish a long-term cooperation
mechanism with the allies based on the main objective stated in its recent
foreign aid white paper, which is to provide more effective and meaningful
assistance overseas, she added.</P>
      <P>Details such as the exact date of the summit have not yet confirmed, but it will
probably be in October or November, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, President Ma was greatly impressed with the World War II
historical sites and the friendly and passionate people of Solomon Islands
during his visit as a scholar to the country in 1997. The president is therefore
excited about traveling to the South Pacific country again and is also planning
to visit one or two other diplomatic allies in the region, she added.</P>
      <P>The trip to the South Pacific, if it takes place, will be Ma's third diplomatic
tour this year.</P>
      <P>Fresh from a three-leg Central America visit May 26-June 4 that took him to
Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, Ma will head for the region again later this
month to attend the inauguration  of Panamanian President-elect Ricardo
Martinelli and will then visit Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>

      <P>The weighted stock price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange plunged 3.22 percent
Tuesday, or 213.63 points, to close at 6,414.39 as strong selling pressure
persisted.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened high at 6,636.84 before rising to the day's high of
6,640.44 and dropping below the 6,400-point level to the day's low of 6,394.34.</P>
      <P>The sharp fall came after a big drop of 228.72 points a day before.</P>
      <P>A total of 5.96 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$159.12
billion (US$ 4.84 billion).</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories lost ground, with paper and pulp issues moving

      <P>The health authorities reported Tuesday three new cases of swine flu imported
from Thailand, bringing to 24 the total number of influenza A(H1N1) infections
recorded in the country.</P>
      <P>The three cases are students who were traveling in two separate graduation tours
to Thailand June 1-7, which mainly stayed in Bangkok and Pattaya, according to
Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC) spokesman Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>One of the groups had 57 members, while the other had 17.</P>
      <P>Two of the confirmed cases began displaying flu symptoms while in Thailand. They
were sent to hospital immediately upon their June 7 arrival at the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport where they were detected as having fevers, Shih
said.</P>
      <P>The other confirmed case was in a group of six students who had complained of
flu-like symptoms and were given blood tests, Shih went on.</P>
      <P>He said 10 of the other students had been listed as suspected cases after
reporting flu-like symptoms after their return, making it likely that the number
of confirmed infections  would further increase.</P>
      <P>The CECC has informed the World Health Organization and the Thai government of
the situation, Shih said.</P>
      <P>According to the CECC, of the 24 cases recorded in Taiwan so far, only one has
been indigenous and there have been no community outbreaks.</P>

      <P>A government blueprint to build a terminal for international flights at Taichung
City's Chingchuankang Airport will definitely boost the central city's
development, Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Construction of the facility will help the city move a step forward toward its
desire to build an aviation park near the airport by linking adjacent areas that
can be developed into a warehousing and commercial zone, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>The city government also looks forward to setting up a network that will connect
the airport, Taichung Harbor, the Central Taiwan Science Park and the city
center to give an additional boost to local development, he explained.</P>
      <P>Hsiao's remarks came after the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) a day earlier approved an "overall development  project and
first-phase construction  plan for an international airport in central Taiwan"
submitted by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Under the project, the central government will earmark NT$3.9 billion (US$118.9
million)  to build Chinachuankang  Airport's international terminal by 2012,
with the aim of serving 1.35 million passengers per year and promoting the
international charter flight business in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CEPD plans to make Chingchuankang Airport into a regional hub serving
passenger charter flights and cross-Taiwan Strait routes.</P>
      <P>The central Taiwan airport served 1.1 million passengers last year, with 640,000
flying on domestic routes, while its international traffic volume has continued
to grow in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to CEPD statistics, the airport served a total of 461,575 travelers on
international charter flights in 2008, compared with 3,528 in 2004.</P>
      <P>Although Shanghai is the most popular Chinese destination among Taiwanese
carriers, none have applied to ply the Taichung-Shanghai route due to the
limitations of Chingchuankang Airport, which can only accommodate smaller planes
with a seat capacity of some 100 passengers, despite the fact that scheduled
cross-strait flights are set to be expanded in July.</P>
      <P>In response to rising local demand, the CAA has asked China Airlines, EVA
Airways and Trans Asia Airways, all of which fly to Shanghai from either Taipei
or Kaohsiung, to offer one flight per week each from Chingchuankang Airport to
Shanghai.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau is seeking more contestants for a contest to design the
best itinerary for traveling in Taiwan - part of efforts to promote tourism on
the island.</P>
      <P>So far, the "Best Trip in the World -- Taiwan Explorers Wanted" contest has
generated interest from people around the world and many teams have signed up.</P>
      <P>The Bureau, however, is hoping more teams will register for the competition to
attract more interest, especially online, about the island, which in previous
decades had not promoted its tourism sector, focusing instead on its high-tech
and electronics industries.</P>
      <P>Anyone can enter the contest as long as his or her team has at least two people
and at least one team member is a non-Taiwanese national.</P>
      <P>Fifty teams which have the best itineraries will be selected and each will get
NT$ 7,000 (around US$215) per day for up to 4 days, or NT$ 28,000 in total, to
travel during those four days. Team members must buy their own airplane ticket
to come to Taiwan but the Bureau can help them obtain special discounts from
Taiwanese carriers.</P>
      <P>The 50 teams will be selected based on how creative and inexpensive their
itinerary is, as well as how feasible and popular it is with online readers.</P>
      <P>Contestants must upload a video introducing their team on the contest website
and submit their itinerary for their four-day trip in Taiwan by the deadline of
June 30.</P>
      <P>The most popular teams will be selected in each of the contest's three groups:
Chinese, English, and Japanese.</P>
      <P>During their four-day travels, the 50 teams must upload a short video about
their daily adventures in Taiwan with a 200-word description on the official
contest website.</P>
      <P>The team that generates the most interest online stands the best chance of
winning the grand prize - NT$1,000,000 (around US$30,446) to travel in Taiwan
for a month.</P>
      <P>The grand prize winning team will come back to Taiwan in February or March in
2010 for a one-month trip that will be used to promote Taiwan as a top travel
destination to people overseas.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau will announce the list of 50 winning teams for the first
stage of the contest by July 10.</P>
      <P>Each of the winning teams must complete its itinerary from July 11 to Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>Online voting results will be part of the criteria to choose the grand prize
winner, which will be announced on Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau expects the contest will draw more international tourists to
Taiwan who will share their travel experience with the world as a way to promote
Taiwan tourism, the Bureau's New York representative office said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan so far draws a little less than 4 million visitors a year, much less than
its neighboring countries, even those that are a lot smaller and with far less
natural scenic attractions, such as Singapore.</P>
      <P>Detailed contest rules and related registration forms are available on the
contest's official Web site at http://www.TaiwanBestTrip.net.</P>

      <P>This year's Photonics Festival in Taiwan will open Wednesday at the Taipei World
Trade Center Exhibition Hall 1, covering solar energy, LED, precision optics and
other areas of photonics,  according to the Photonics Industry and Technology
Development Association, the event's organizer.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers from Taiwan and China are expected to use the show to establish
connections for future business, the association said in a press statement
issued Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With about 360 exhibitors and 800 booths, the show, which is in conjunction with
Display Taiwan 2009, is expected to attract 35,000 visitors this year and to
generate over NT$30 billion (US$914.6 million)-worth of business opportunities
for the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Business opportunities created by LEDs and solar energy are expected to further
encourage buying, the organizers said, adding that with the continued pushing of
LED applications, the momentum of the industry's growth is expected to recover
when the economy bottoms out.</P>
      <P>The solar energy industry has not been affected by the global recession, with
the output growth last year recording 60 percent and total output value reaching
NT$106.1 billion.</P>
      <P>With  manufacturers  continuing  to expand  production  and significantly
increase capacity for the production of thin film panels, the growth rate is
expected to reach 23 percent, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the output of the local photovoltaic system industry was around
NT$500 million in 2008. With various photovoltaic plans in the works this year,
investment in the photovoltaic plan by the Taiwan Power Company and the passage
of the Renewable Energy Development Bill, the output growth rate is expected to
reach 47 percent.</P>
      <P>Other featured exhibition areas include a "cross-strait photonics show, " with
the organizers noting that the increasing cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges are
influencing the future of industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tainan county mangoes to target top-spending Japanese customers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-jhih said Tuesday that he will target top spenders
when promoting the county's Irwin strain of mangoes during a trip to Japan.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at a news conference prior to his scheduled departure for
Japan Thursday to promote the fruit, of which a first batch of more than 500 kg
was undergoing the quarantine process.</P>
      <P>Su is expected to take part in a series of promotional activities in department
stores and hotels in Tokyo, Osaka and Hokkaido during his six-day visit.</P>
      <P>Su said the Irwin mangoes will "target top-spending customers, " adding that a
case of just three mangoes will be sold from 2,800 yen (US$28.4) to 6,300 yen,
depending on quality.</P>
      <P>Every case will include a Japanese introduction to the fruit, as well as stay-
fresh bags, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su said the county government worked with international delivery operators last
year to send their products directly to the customers in an "order from Japan
with direct delivery from Taiwan" system.</P>
      <P>"In this way, we sold 2,000 cases of mangoes in just three weeks," he noted.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan and Japan will increase cooperation, with home delivery,
online ordering and for the first time, ordering via a Japanese department store
with outlets around the country.</P>
      <P>Wei Te-sheng, director of the blockbuster romantic film "Cape No. 7, " who
happened to be visiting the Tainan county government, was also invited to
promote the mangoes at the news conference.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yi-pin, director of the county government's Department of Agriculture, said
that annual production of the Irwin strain of mangoes in the county is around
100,000 metric tons.</P>
      <P>The county government has promoted the fruit since 2004 and has made successful
inroads into the Japanese market, which has helped prop up the price of local
mangoes, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>"This year, mangoes from Taiwan will be available in major cities in Japan, "
Kuo said, estimating that 10,000 cases will be sold this year, up five-fold from
last year.</P>
      <P>Agriculture officials said this year's mango crop is down from last year's and
that exports, which usually continue until August, will finish by the end of
July.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A trade group organized by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) that is visiting three countries in the Middle East and Central
Asia has racked up good business on the Mid-East leg of the trip, TAITRA
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation  of representatives  of 18 local companies, including the Export-
Import Bank of China (Taipei) , embarked on the tour May 30 and has visited
Jordan and Syria, with the Kazakhstan leg slated to begin June 9, TAITRA
officials said.</P>
      <P>Based upon on-the-spot interviews with group members, TAITRA estimated that the
delegation will be able to chalk up business worth US$3.25 million after
wrapping up its two-day visit to Kazakhstan.</P>
      <P>TAITRA decided to send the trade-promotion mission to the three countries in an
effort to help local enterprises hit by the global financial crisis more
effectively explore emerging markets.</P>
      <P>On June 1, it held its first seminar with businessmen from Jordan, Iraq and
Lebanon in the Jordanian capital of Amman, obtaining business worth US$1.35
million, with strong demand for construction materias, hardware, textiles, car
components and accessories.</P>
      <P>As Jordan is slated to sign a free trade agreement with the United States in
2010, Taiwanese companies interested in setting up strongholds in the country
will stand a good chance of seizing business opportunities in neighboring Iraq's
reconstruction program as Jordan holds a key location for travel to Iraq.</P>
      <P>Two-way Taiwan-Jordan trade totaled US$250.3 million in 2008, up by 20.5 percent
over the 2007 figure, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$126.7 million.</P>
      <P>During the second seminar held June 4 in Damascus, capital of Syria, close to
200 businessmen attended the event and business worth US$1.9 million was
secured, according to TAITRA,</P>
      <P>TAITRA officials said Syria also has a strong demand for textiles and hardware
products, as well as for car components and electrical wire, because the country
has been promoting light industry.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese exports to Syria in 2008 reached US$166.71 million, marking an
increase of 26 percent year on year, TAITRA tallies show.</P>
      <P>With a population of 22 million, Syria provides a promising market for Taiwanese
businesses because it remains almost untouched by the vast majority of local
companies.</P>

      <P>A local university is launching a campaign aimed at encouraging students to shut
down their computers at night after discovering that doing so helps reduce
carbon dioxide emissions significantly.</P>
      <P>The findings were made by a group of students at National Chiao Tung University
who took a class this year given by senior lecturer Niu Yu-chen on the
relationship between ecology and health, according to a statement released by
the university on its Web site Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Based on a calculation formula adopted by the Environmental Protection
Administration, the students found that a computer running round the clock
consumes 8.6 kilowatt hours of electricity per day, causing a daily carbon
dioxide emission of 6 kg, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The students then concluded that switching off the computer for six hours every
night can help save 56 kWh per month, as well reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
nearly 40 kg each month.</P>
      <P>After a campus survey found that 71 percent of the students at the university
are not in the habit of turning off their computers at night, the students
further concluded that taking the 7,000 beds in the school's dormitories as an
example, if 71 percent of the students living in the dormitories during term-
time adopted the practice of switching off at night, they would save more than
2.5 million kWh per year.</P>
      <P>This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 1.79 million kg, the
students said, noting that they then initiated a campaign titled "PC vs. Earth,
KO or OK? " in the hope of raising environmental awareness among other students.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government and EVA Airways are cooperating to provide a "lucky
tour" program in a bid to attract Japanese tourists, whose numbers have declined
sharply because of fears over swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>The selling points of the tour include the slogans that it "will bring good
luck" and that "the more you stay in Taipei, the luckier you will become."</P>
      <P>Several tour plans have been mapped out for Japanese visitors, each of which
features scenic spots and local delicacies available in the city.</P>
      <P>Each tour plan also recommends visits to various temples, such as one for
lovers, who can visit the Xiahai City Lord Temple, while those seeking career
success can visit the Xintian Temple, those seeking divine help for their health
can visit the Baoan Temple and those who want success in examinations can visit
the Confucius Temple.</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting temples, the scenic spots listed in the travel plans
also have special meanings. For example, those who want to have career success
can visit Taipei 101 to symbolize a gradual ascent to a higher position, while
those who want good health can visit the Chinese herbal tea shops in the Wanhua
area and those who want success in examinations can visit the giant Eslite
bookstore.</P>
      <P>Air carriers have complained that due to the swine flu scare, passenger rates on
Japanese routes have dropped to below 60 percent from the more usual 80 percent.
The drop has been sharpest among all flight routes serving Taiwan and both EVA
Airways and China Airlines, the nation's largest air carriers, have cut flights.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a package of law amendments Tuesday that shorten the
waiting periods for Chinese spouses of local citizens before they can obtain
residency and citizenship, and greatly eases restrictions on their work rights.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-controlled legislature completed a third reading of the
raft of amendments to the Statute Governing Relations between the People of
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area at a floor meeting.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law, Chinese spouses will be eligible to apply to stay in
Taiwan once they enter Taiwan with legal travel documents and can apply for a
change to long-term stay status after having lived in Taiwan for four years.
They will later be eligible to apply to settle in Taiwan after having stayed
here for two more consecutive years.</P>
      <P>The revisions will mean that Chinese citizens can apply for settlement or
citizenship six years after their arrival, rather than the eight years
stipulated at present.</P>
      <P>The amended law will also allow them to work right after they enter Taiwan to
live with their Taiwanese spouses. Under the current law, Chinese spouses cannot
work until after they acquire long-term stay status.</P>
      <P>The amended regulations will take effect after promulgation by the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the amendments also do away with a NT$2 million cap on inheritances
or gifts that Chinese spouses are allowed to accept.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chinese spouses who have acquired long-term stay status will be
eligible to inherit real estate in Taiwan once the new law is promulgated.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced a digitalization  program for elementary and
junior high schools Tuesday,  saying that the Cabinet will earmark NT$7.1
billion (US$216.5 million) to build advanced classrooms in schools all over the
country as part of the government's education reforms.</P>
      <P>Liu made the announcement during a visit to the Shenkeng Elementary School in
northern Taiwan's Taipei County.  He was accompanied by Minister of Education
Cheng Jei-cheng, Minister without Portfolio Ovid J.L. Tzeng and Taipei
Magistrate Chou Shi-wei.</P>
      <P>"Software infrastructure, namely education, is an extremely important aspect of
the government's all-out efforts to improve Taiwan's environment and advance its
high-tech standards, " he said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government aims to provide elementary and high school
students  with a computerized  wireless  learning environment in which they can
interact with their teachers through electronic  boards and remote control
devices instead of the traditional classroom blackboard, the premier said.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, close to 60,000 classrooms will be fully computerized by the
end of this year, while the government may need to purchase in excess of 90,000
personal computers as part of the plan.</P>
      <P>By the time that has been achieved, every school will have at least one
digitalized classroom for their students -- which Cheng said will help reduce
the marked digital gap between rural and urban areas.</P>
      <P>Schools in remote areas and outlying islands and those catering to aboriginal

      <P>Half of the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) polled recently in Taiwan
believe the recession will bottom out in 2010, according to the 2009 UPS Asia
Business Monitor report.</P>
      <P>The percentage is the highest among the 12 countries surveyed, followed by 46

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) held a reception
Tuesday to celebrate the 83rd birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, the British
monarch.</P>
      <P>BTCO Director David Campbell praised the good relations between Taiwan and the
United Kingdom during the function, which was attended by Deputy Foreign
Minister Andrew Hsia and vice foreign ministers David Lin and Javier Hou, as
well as members of the diplomatic corps and other dignitaries.</P>
      <P>"2009 has been a very positive year for relations between the U.K. and Taiwan,"
said Campbell, who took office as Britain's top envoy in Taiwan in February.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and the U.K. have close relations in economic, trade,
investment, cultural, educational and the arts sectors, Campbell said the close
exchanges have been further strengthened since Taiwan was included in the U.K.'s
visa waiver program that started March 3.</P>
      <P>The official travel figures from Taiwan to the U.K. will be released later this
year, Campbell went on, adding that one major Taiwanese tour company told his
office that they had arranged more travel packages to the U.K. over the past
three months than in the whole of last year.</P>
      <P>"I am sure we will see a considerable increase in the number of Taiwanese
visiting the U.K. I hope this in turn will lead to much greater awareness of
Taiwan among British people," Campbell said.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the U.K. will send a large contingent of athletes to
participate in the upcoming World Games in Kaohsiung in July and to the
Deaflympics in Taipei in September, as sport in particular is an activity that
brings people closer together.</P>
      <P>Hsia for his part said the U.K., which has offered great support for Taiwan's
meaningful participation in international organizations, is an invaluable
partner of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two countries' shared beliefs in freedom, democracy, respect for human
rights and the rule of law bring the two sides closer despite the thousands of
miles separating them, he added.</P>
      <P>What brings Taiwan and the U.K. even closer is their bilateral trade and
investment relations, as well as the increasingly wide range of exchanges in the
areas of economy, tourism, science and technology, culture and education, Hsia
went on.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade reached US$5.55 billion in 2008 and the U.K. was Taiwan's 5th-
largest foreign investor, Hsia continued, adding that there are some 15,000
Taiwanese students in the U.K., representing 25 percent of the total number of
local people studying abroad.</P>
      <P>"There is still plenty of room for further cooperation between Taiwan and the
U.K. in all areas and I'm confident that our relations will continue to grow on
the already substantial foundations, " Hsia added.</P>
      <P>The Queen's Official Birthday is celebrated as a public holiday in several
Commonwealth countries. While the exact date of the celebration varies from
country to country, it does not usually mark the real birthday of the sovereign,
as Queen Elizabeth II was born April 21, 1926.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President defends decision to continue lawsuit against prosecutor</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
06/09/09  23:32:44
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou defended Tuesday his pursuit of legal action against a
prosecutor in his 2007 corruption trial who allegedly falsified a witness
statement, arguing that the case will have a positive effect on judicial reform.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed his attorneys to lodge an appeal with the Taipei District Court in
March, which is now under review. If the court finds that Prosecutor Hou Kuan-
jen did not accurately document his questioning of Ma's witness, Wu Li-ju -- a
Taipei city government treasurer -- Hou will be indicted and the case sent to
trial.</P>
      <P>Hou, a prosecutor on the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, was one of the prosecutors investigating Ma's handling of
his special allowance funds during his tenure as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13, 2007 on charges of embezzling some NT$11 million
(US$333,000) from his special mayoral allowance fund and using it for private
purposes.</P>
      <P>That same day, Ma stepped down as Kuomintang chairman and announced his
candidacy for the 2008 presidential race. At the time, Ma said being indicted
for corruption was more painful than losing his life.</P>
      <P>In August 2007, the Taipei District Court acquitted Ma after finding he had no
criminal intent nor did he act deceitfully. Prosecutors appealed the court's
decision, which was eventually decided again in Ma's favor Dec. 28, 2007.</P>
      <P>At the time,  Ma argued that Hou had not documented his questioning of Wu
correctly and sued the prosecutor for forgery in January last year.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office argued that even if the written record of
Wu's testimony was incomplete, it could not be used as evidence in a trial. For
this reason, it was concluded that there were no grounds for inferring that Hou
deliberately falsified documents. On Dec. 31, 2008, the prosecutors office
declined to pursue action against Hou.</P>
      <P>Following  the decision,  Ma appealed  to the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office,
but was rejected again on the grounds that the witness did not express any
opinion after listening to Hou's documentation of her statements being read
aloud.</P>
      <P>Ma's appeal for District Court action drew criticism from the opposition, to
which Presidential Office Public Affairs Department Director Tsai Chung-li said
that Ma's decision to appeal was not made out of his personal interest but to
serve as an example to others, because every citizen could encounter such a
situation.</P>
      <P>"The case is not only about judicial rights but also part of judicial education.
President Ma believes that the case will be helpful in better protecting local
people's rights and will have a positive effect on judicial reform," Tsai added.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Ma thought that he was duty-bound to pursue the lawsuit
against the prosecutor.</P>
      <P>"The president found that local prosecutors have become more prudent and
circumspect in documenting witnesses' statements since he filed the lawsuit
against the prosecutor," Tsai added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President suggests learning simplified Chinese characters</HEADLINE>

06/09/09  17:06:42
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou proposed Tuesday that people learning Chinese should
learn to read the traditional Chinese characters used in Taiwan and Hong Kong
but at the same time should also know how to use the simplified character system
engineered by the communist regime in China.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes his proposal of "recognizing traditional Chinese characters but
also knowing simplified" will be put on the agenda of discussions between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at the Presidential Office in a meeting with a group of
overseas Chinese who live in the United States.</P>
      <P>Traditional Chinese characters and the simplified version are two standard sets
of printed Chinese characters, with the traditional used in Taiwan as the
official written language, while China uses the simplified characters it
introduced in the 1950s in an effort to reduce illiteracy among rural Chinese.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has spared no efforts to promote the use of traditional Chinese
characters over the years and pointed out that the system is essential for
people who want to read books written in China 2,000 or 3,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>"There are few cultures in the world apart from Chinese whose writing systems
have remained viable throughout so many different eras, " he said, underlining
the importance of preserving the traditional system of writing Chinese
characters.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in many Chinese schools overseas, they teach students from Taiwan
traditional characters, but lecture students from China using simplified.</P>
      <P>He said it is a pity that those who only know simplified characters cannot read
words in traditional characters, while people taught using traditional
characters can quite easily read simplified.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he proposed that traditional characters should be used in printing as
much as possible to allow the Chinese canon to remain linked to tradition
Chinese culture.</P>

      <P>A megamouth shark, one of the world's rarest species, was caught Monday by a
fisherman from the eastern county of Taitung, marine biologists said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to National Taiwan Ocean University's Department of Environmental
Biology and Fisheries Science, the shark is only the 42nd that has been caught
or sighted worldwide and the ninth in Taiwan since the species was discovered in
1976.</P>
      <P>The shark was 3.9 meter long, weighed 350 kilograms and its mouth when opened
measured 75 centimeters across. It was netted off the county's Chenggong coast
and was sold Tuesday for NT$18,000 (US$549) to a local shark museum where it
will be displayed as a preserved specimen.</P>
      <P>The fish was identified by a researcher surnamed Tien, from the Eastern  Marine
Biology Research  Center under the Council of Agriculture's Fisheries Research
Institute. Tien said the species is very unusual and that it was the first time
in his career that he ever saw a megamouth shark.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-jung, the owner of the shark museum, said he has collected dozens of
shark specimens but this was his first megamouth.</P>
      <P>The last record of the species being spotted was in late March, when a
500-kilogram, 4-meter megamouth was caught off Burias Island in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The megamouth shark is so named because of its large mouth.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it is planning for
President Ma Ying-jeou to travel to the South Pacific in the later half of the
year to attend the Taiwan-South Pacific leaders' summit in the Solomon Islands
and to visit several diplomatic allies in the region.</P>
      <P>"The preparations for the summit are progressing well and all the leaders of
Taiwan's six diplomatic allies in the region will most likely attend, " said
Frances Lee, acting director-general of the MOFA's Department of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's six diplomatic allies in the South Pacific region are the Solomon
Islands, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, this year's leaders' summit will touch on issues such as the
global economic downturn, climate change and fishery resources.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry will also seek to establish a long-term cooperation
mechanism with the allies based on the main objective stated in its recent
foreign aid white paper, which is to provide more effective and meaningful
assistance overseas, she added.</P>
      <P>Details such as the exact date of the summit have not yet confirmed, but it will
probably be in October or November, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, President Ma was greatly impressed with the World War II
historical sites and the friendly and passionate people of Solomon Islands
during his visit as a scholar to the country in 1997. The president is therefore
excited about traveling to the South Pacific country again and is also planning
to visit one or two other diplomatic allies in the region, she added.</P>
      <P>The trip to the South Pacific, if it takes place, will be Ma's third diplomatic
tour this year.</P>
      <P>Fresh from a three-leg Central America visit May 26-June 4 that took him to
Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, Ma will head for the region again later this
month to attend the inauguration  of Panamanian President-elect Ricardo
Martinelli and will then visit Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>

      <P>One of the groups had 57 members, while the other had 17.</P>

      <P>A government blueprint to build a terminal for international flights at Taichung
City's Chingchuankang Airport will definitely boost the central city's
development, Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Construction of the facility will help the city move a step forward toward its
desire to build an aviation park near the airport by linking adjacent areas that
can be developed into a warehousing and commercial zone, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>The city government also looks forward to setting up a network that will connect
the airport, Taichung Harbor, the Central Taiwan Science Park and the city
center to give an additional boost to local development, he explained.</P>
      <P>Hsiao's remarks came after the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) a day earlier approved an "overall development  project and
first-phase construction  plan for an international airport in central Taiwan"
submitted by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Under the project, the central government will earmark NT$3.9 billion (US$118.9
million)  to build Chinachuankang  Airport's international terminal by 2012,
with the aim of serving 1.35 million passengers per year and promoting the
international charter flight business in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CEPD plans to make Chingchuankang Airport into a regional hub serving
passenger charter flights and cross-Taiwan Strait routes.</P>
      <P>The central Taiwan airport served 1.1 million passengers last year, with 640,000
flying on domestic routes, while its international traffic volume has continued
to grow in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to CEPD statistics, the airport served a total of 461,575 travelers on
international charter flights in 2008, compared with 3,528 in 2004.</P>
      <P>Although Shanghai is the most popular Chinese destination among Taiwanese
carriers, none have applied to ply the Taichung-Shanghai route due to the
limitations of Chingchuankang Airport, which can only accommodate smaller planes
with a seat capacity of some 100 passengers, despite the fact that scheduled
cross-strait flights are set to be expanded in July.</P>
      <P>In response to rising local demand, the CAA has asked China Airlines, EVA
Airways and Trans Asia Airways, all of which fly to Shanghai from either Taipei
or Kaohsiung, to offer one flight per week each from Chingchuankang Airport to
Shanghai.</P>

travel during those four days. Team members must buy their own airplane ticket
to come to Taiwan but the Bureau can help them obtain special discounts from
Taiwanese carriers.</P>
      <P>The 50 teams will be selected based on how creative and inexpensive their
itinerary is, as well as how feasible and popular it is with online readers.</P>
      <P>Contestants must upload a video introducing their team on the contest website
and submit their itinerary for their four-day trip in Taiwan by the deadline of
June 30.</P>
      <P>The most popular teams will be selected in each of the contest's three groups:
Chinese, English, and Japanese.</P>
      <P>During their four-day travels, the 50 teams must upload a short video about
their daily adventures in Taiwan with a 200-word description on the official
contest website.</P>
      <P>The team that generates the most interest online stands the best chance of
winning the grand prize - NT$1,000,000 (around US$30,446) to travel in Taiwan
for a month.</P>
      <P>The grand prize winning team will come back to Taiwan in February or March in
2010 for a one-month trip that will be used to promote Taiwan as a top travel
destination to people overseas.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau will announce the list of 50 winning teams for the first
stage of the contest by July 10.</P>
      <P>Each of the winning teams must complete its itinerary from July 11 to Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>Online voting results will be part of the criteria to choose the grand prize
winner, which will be announced on Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau expects the contest will draw more international tourists to
Taiwan who will share their travel experience with the world as a way to promote
Taiwan tourism, the Bureau's New York representative office said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan so far draws a little less than 4 million visitors a year, much less than
its neighboring countries, even those that are a lot smaller and with far less
natural scenic attractions, such as Singapore.</P>
      <P>Detailed contest rules and related registration forms are available on the
contest's official Web site at http://www.TaiwanBestTrip.net.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>This year's Photonics Festival in Taiwan will open Wednesday at the Taipei World
Trade Center Exhibition Hall 1, covering solar energy, LED, precision optics and
other areas of photonics,  according to the Photonics Industry and Technology
Development Association, the event's organizer.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers from Taiwan and China are expected to use the show to establish
connections for future business, the association said in a press statement
issued Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With about 360 exhibitors and 800 booths, the show, which is in conjunction with
Display Taiwan 2009, is expected to attract 35,000 visitors this year and to
generate over NT$30 billion (US$914.6 million)-worth of business opportunities
for the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Business opportunities created by LEDs and solar energy are expected to further
encourage buying, the organizers said, adding that with the continued pushing of
LED applications, the momentum of the industry's growth is expected to recover
when the economy bottoms out.</P>
      <P>The solar energy industry has not been affected by the global recession, with
the output growth last year recording 60 percent and total output value reaching
NT$106.1 billion.</P>
      <P>With  manufacturers  continuing  to expand  production  and significantly
increase capacity for the production of thin film panels, the growth rate is
expected to reach 23 percent, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the output of the local photovoltaic system industry was around
NT$500 million in 2008. With various photovoltaic plans in the works this year,
investment in the photovoltaic plan by the Taiwan Power Company and the passage
of the Renewable Energy Development Bill, the output growth rate is expected to
reach 47 percent.</P>
      <P>Other featured exhibition areas include a "cross-strait photonics show, " with
the organizers noting that the increasing cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges are
influencing the future of industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tainan county mangoes to target top-spending Japanese customers</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-jhih said Tuesday that he will target top spenders
when promoting the county's Irwin strain of mangoes during a trip to Japan.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at a news conference prior to his scheduled departure for
Japan Thursday to promote the fruit, of which a first batch of more than 500 kg
was undergoing the quarantine process.</P>
      <P>Su is expected to take part in a series of promotional activities in department
stores and hotels in Tokyo, Osaka and Hokkaido during his six-day visit.</P>
      <P>Su said the Irwin mangoes will "target top-spending customers, " adding that a
case of just three mangoes will be sold from 2,800 yen (US$28.4) to 6,300 yen,
depending on quality.</P>
      <P>Every case will include a Japanese introduction to the fruit, as well as stay-
fresh bags, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su said the county government worked with international delivery operators last
year to send their products directly to the customers in an "order from Japan
with direct delivery from Taiwan" system.</P>
      <P>"In this way, we sold 2,000 cases of mangoes in just three weeks," he noted.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan and Japan will increase cooperation, with home delivery,
online ordering and for the first time, ordering via a Japanese department store
with outlets around the country.</P>
      <P>Wei Te-sheng, director of the blockbuster romantic film "Cape No. 7, " who
happened to be visiting the Tainan county government, was also invited to
promote the mangoes at the news conference.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yi-pin, director of the county government's Department of Agriculture, said
that annual production of the Irwin strain of mangoes in the county is around
100,000 metric tons.</P>
      <P>The county government has promoted the fruit since 2004 and has made successful
inroads into the Japanese market, which has helped prop up the price of local
mangoes, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>"This year, mangoes from Taiwan will be available in major cities in Japan, "
Kuo said, estimating that 10,000 cases will be sold this year, up five-fold from
last year.</P>
      <P>Agriculture officials said this year's mango crop is down from last year's and
that exports, which usually continue until August, will finish by the end of
July.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Group racks up over US$3 million worth of business in Central Asia</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A trade group organized by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) that is visiting three countries in the Middle East and Central
Asia has racked up good business on the Mid-East leg of the trip, TAITRA
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation  of representatives  of 18 local companies, including the Export-
Import Bank of China (Taipei) , embarked on the tour May 30 and has visited
Jordan and Syria, with the Kazakhstan leg slated to begin June 9, TAITRA
officials said.</P>
      <P>Based upon on-the-spot interviews with group members, TAITRA estimated that the
delegation will be able to chalk up business worth US$3.25 million after
wrapping up its two-day visit to Kazakhstan.</P>
      <P>TAITRA decided to send the trade-promotion mission to the three countries in an
effort to help local enterprises hit by the global financial crisis more
effectively explore emerging markets.</P>
      <P>On June 1, it held its first seminar with businessmen from Jordan, Iraq and
Lebanon in the Jordanian capital of Amman, obtaining business worth US$1.35
million, with strong demand for construction materias, hardware, textiles, car
components and accessories.</P>
      <P>As Jordan is slated to sign a free trade agreement with the United States in
2010, Taiwanese companies interested in setting up strongholds in the country
will stand a good chance of seizing business opportunities in neighboring Iraq's
reconstruction program as Jordan holds a key location for travel to Iraq.</P>
      <P>Two-way Taiwan-Jordan trade totaled US$250.3 million in 2008, up by 20.5 percent
over the 2007 figure, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$126.7 million.</P>
      <P>During the second seminar held June 4 in Damascus, capital of Syria, close to
200 businessmen attended the event and business worth US$1.9 million was
secured, according to TAITRA,</P>
      <P>TAITRA officials said Syria also has a strong demand for textiles and hardware
products, as well as for car components and electrical wire, because the country
has been promoting light industry.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese exports to Syria in 2008 reached US$166.71 million, marking an
increase of 26 percent year on year, TAITRA tallies show.</P>
      <P>With a population of 22 million, Syria provides a promising market for Taiwanese
businesses because it remains almost untouched by the vast majority of local
companies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local university is launching a campaign aimed at encouraging students to shut
down their computers at night after discovering that doing so helps reduce
carbon dioxide emissions significantly.</P>
      <P>The findings were made by a group of students at National Chiao Tung University
who took a class this year given by senior lecturer Niu Yu-chen on the
relationship between ecology and health, according to a statement released by
the university on its Web site Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Based on a calculation formula adopted by the Environmental Protection
Administration, the students found that a computer running round the clock
consumes 8.6 kilowatt hours of electricity per day, causing a daily carbon
dioxide emission of 6 kg, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The students then concluded that switching off the computer for six hours every
night can help save 56 kWh per month, as well reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
nearly 40 kg each month.</P>
      <P>After a campus survey found that 71 percent of the students at the university
are not in the habit of turning off their computers at night, the students
further concluded that taking the 7,000 beds in the school's dormitories as an
example, if 71 percent of the students living in the dormitories during term-
time adopted the practice of switching off at night, they would save more than
2.5 million kWh per year.</P>
      <P>This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 1.79 million kg, the
students said, noting that they then initiated a campaign titled "PC vs. Earth,
KO or OK? " in the hope of raising environmental awareness among other students.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government and EVA Airways are cooperating to provide a "lucky
tour" program in a bid to attract Japanese tourists, whose numbers have declined
sharply because of fears over swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>The selling points of the tour include the slogans that it "will bring good
luck" and that "the more you stay in Taipei, the luckier you will become."</P>
      <P>Several tour plans have been mapped out for Japanese visitors, each of which
features scenic spots and local delicacies available in the city.</P>
      <P>Each tour plan also recommends visits to various temples, such as one for
lovers, who can visit the Xiahai City Lord Temple, while those seeking career
success can visit the Xintian Temple, those seeking divine help for their health
can visit the Baoan Temple and those who want success in examinations can visit
the Confucius Temple.</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting temples, the scenic spots listed in the travel plans
also have special meanings. For example, those who want to have career success
can visit Taipei 101 to symbolize a gradual ascent to a higher position, while
those who want good health can visit the Chinese herbal tea shops in the Wanhua
area and those who want success in examinations can visit the giant Eslite
bookstore.</P>
      <P>Air carriers have complained that due to the swine flu scare, passenger rates on
Japanese routes have dropped to below 60 percent from the more usual 80 percent.
The drop has been sharpest among all flight routes serving Taiwan and both EVA
Airways and China Airlines, the nation's largest air carriers, have cut flights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a package of law amendments Tuesday that shorten the
waiting periods for Chinese spouses of local citizens before they can obtain
residency and citizenship, and greatly eases restrictions on their work rights.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-controlled legislature completed a third reading of the
raft of amendments to the Statute Governing Relations between the People of
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area at a floor meeting.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law, Chinese spouses will be eligible to apply to stay in
Taiwan once they enter Taiwan with legal travel documents and can apply for a
change to long-term stay status after having lived in Taiwan for four years.
They will later be eligible to apply to settle in Taiwan after having stayed
here for two more consecutive years.</P>
      <P>The revisions will mean that Chinese citizens can apply for settlement or
citizenship six years after their arrival, rather than the eight years
stipulated at present.</P>
      <P>The amended law will also allow them to work right after they enter Taiwan to
live with their Taiwanese spouses. Under the current law, Chinese spouses cannot
work until after they acquire long-term stay status.</P>
      <P>The amended regulations will take effect after promulgation by the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the amendments also do away with a NT$2 million cap on inheritances
or gifts that Chinese spouses are allowed to accept.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chinese spouses who have acquired long-term stay status will be
eligible to inherit real estate in Taiwan once the new law is promulgated.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced a digitalization  program for elementary and
junior high schools Tuesday,  saying that the Cabinet will earmark NT$7.1
billion (US$216.5 million) to build advanced classrooms in schools all over the
country as part of the government's education reforms.</P>
      <P>Liu made the announcement during a visit to the Shenkeng Elementary School in
northern Taiwan's Taipei County.  He was accompanied by Minister of Education
Cheng Jei-cheng, Minister without Portfolio Ovid J.L. Tzeng and Taipei
Magistrate Chou Shi-wei.</P>
      <P>"Software infrastructure, namely education, is an extremely important aspect of
the government's all-out efforts to improve Taiwan's environment and advance its
high-tech standards, " he said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government aims to provide elementary and high school
students  with a computerized  wireless  learning environment in which they can
interact with their teachers through electronic  boards and remote control
devices instead of the traditional classroom blackboard, the premier said.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, close to 60,000 classrooms will be fully computerized by the
end of this year, while the government may need to purchase in excess of 90,000
personal computers as part of the plan.</P>
      <P>By the time that has been achieved, every school will have at least one
digitalized classroom for their students -- which Cheng said will help reduce
the marked digital gap between rural and urban areas.</P>
      <P>Schools in remote areas and outlying islands and those catering to aboriginal
students in mountainous areas will be the first to be included in the NT$7.1
billion program, the education minister said.</P>
      <P>The program forms part of a four-year, NT$500 billion economic stimulus package
announced by the Executive Yuan late last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) held a reception
Tuesday to celebrate the 83rd birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, the British
monarch.</P>
      <P>BTCO Director David Campbell praised the good relations between Taiwan and the
United Kingdom during the function, which was attended by Deputy Foreign
Minister Andrew Hsia and vice foreign ministers David Lin and Javier Hou, as
well as members of the diplomatic corps and other dignitaries.</P>
      <P>"2009 has been a very positive year for relations between the U.K. and Taiwan,"
said Campbell, who took office as Britain's top envoy in Taiwan in February.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and the U.K. have close relations in economic, trade,
investment, cultural, educational and the arts sectors, Campbell said the close
exchanges have been further strengthened since Taiwan was included in the U.K.'s
visa waiver program that started March 3.</P>
      <P>The official travel figures from Taiwan to the U.K. will be released later this
year, Campbell went on, adding that one major Taiwanese tour company told his
office that they had arranged more travel packages to the U.K. over the past
three months than in the whole of last year.</P>
      <P>"I am sure we will see a considerable increase in the number of Taiwanese
visiting the U.K. I hope this in turn will lead to much greater awareness of
Taiwan among British people," Campbell said.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the U.K. will send a large contingent of athletes to
participate in the upcoming World Games in Kaohsiung in July and to the
Deaflympics in Taipei in September, as sport in particular is an activity that
brings people closer together.</P>
      <P>Hsia for his part said the U.K., which has offered great support for Taiwan's
meaningful participation in international organizations, is an invaluable
partner of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two countries' shared beliefs in freedom, democracy, respect for human
rights and the rule of law bring the two sides closer despite the thousands of
miles separating them, he added.</P>
      <P>What brings Taiwan and the U.K. even closer is their bilateral trade and
investment relations, as well as the increasingly wide range of exchanges in the
areas of economy, tourism, science and technology, culture and education, Hsia
went on.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade reached US$5.55 billion in 2008 and the U.K. was Taiwan's 5th-
largest foreign investor, Hsia continued, adding that there are some 15,000
Taiwanese students in the U.K., representing 25 percent of the total number of
local people studying abroad.</P>
      <P>"There is still plenty of room for further cooperation between Taiwan and the
U.K. in all areas and I'm confident that our relations will continue to grow on
the already substantial foundations, " Hsia added.</P>
      <P>The Queen's Official Birthday is celebrated as a public holiday in several
Commonwealth countries. While the exact date of the celebration varies from
country to country, it does not usually mark the real birthday of the sovereign,
as Queen Elizabeth II was born April 21, 1926.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President defends decision to continue lawsuit against prosecutor</HEADLINE>

06/09/09  23:32:44
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou defended Tuesday his pursuit of legal action against a
prosecutor in his 2007 corruption trial who allegedly falsified a witness
statement, arguing that the case will have a positive effect on judicial reform.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed his attorneys to lodge an appeal with the Taipei District Court in
March, which is now under review. If the court finds that Prosecutor Hou Kuan-
jen did not accurately document his questioning of Ma's witness, Wu Li-ju -- a
Taipei city government treasurer -- Hou will be indicted and the case sent to
trial.</P>
      <P>Hou, a prosecutor on the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, was one of the prosecutors investigating Ma's handling of
his special allowance funds during his tenure as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13, 2007 on charges of embezzling some NT$11 million
(US$333,000) from his special mayoral allowance fund and using it for private
purposes.</P>
      <P>That same day, Ma stepped down as Kuomintang chairman and announced his
candidacy for the 2008 presidential race. At the time, Ma said being indicted
for corruption was more painful than losing his life.</P>
      <P>In August 2007, the Taipei District Court acquitted Ma after finding he had no
criminal intent nor did he act deceitfully. Prosecutors appealed the court's
decision, which was eventually decided again in Ma's favor Dec. 28, 2007.</P>
      <P>At the time,  Ma argued that Hou had not documented his questioning of Wu
correctly and sued the prosecutor for forgery in January last year.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office argued that even if the written record of
Wu's testimony was incomplete, it could not be used as evidence in a trial. For
this reason, it was concluded that there were no grounds for inferring that Hou
deliberately falsified documents. On Dec. 31, 2008, the prosecutors office
declined to pursue action against Hou.</P>
      <P>Following  the decision,  Ma appealed  to the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office,
but was rejected again on the grounds that the witness did not express any
opinion after listening to Hou's documentation of her statements being read
aloud.</P>
      <P>Ma's appeal for District Court action drew criticism from the opposition, to
which Presidential Office Public Affairs Department Director Tsai Chung-li said
that Ma's decision to appeal was not made out of his personal interest but to
serve as an example to others, because every citizen could encounter such a
situation.</P>
      <P>"The case is not only about judicial rights but also part of judicial education.
President Ma believes that the case will be helpful in better protecting local
people's rights and will have a positive effect on judicial reform," Tsai added.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Ma thought that he was duty-bound to pursue the lawsuit
against the prosecutor.</P>
      <P>"The president found that local prosecutors have become more prudent and
circumspect in documenting witnesses' statements since he filed the lawsuit
against the prosecutor," Tsai added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou defended Tuesday his pursuit of legal action against a
prosecutor in his 2007 corruption trial who allegedly falsified a witness
statement, arguing that the case will have a positive effect on judicial reform.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed his attorneys to lodge an appeal with the Taipei District Court in
March, which is now under review. If the court finds that Prosecutor Hou Kuan-
jen did not accurately document his questioning of Ma's witness, Wu Li-ju -- a
Taipei city government treasurer -- Hou will be indicted and the case sent to
trial.</P>
      <P>Hou, a prosecutor on the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, was one of the prosecutors investigating Ma's handling of
his special allowance funds during his tenure as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13, 2007 on charges of embezzling some NT$11 million
(US$333,000) from his special mayoral allowance fund and using it for private
purposes.</P>
      <P>That same day, Ma stepped down as Kuomintang chairman and announced his
candidacy for the 2008 presidential race. At the time, Ma said being indicted
for corruption was more painful than losing his life.</P>
      <P>In August 2007, the Taipei District Court acquitted Ma after finding he had no
criminal intent nor did he act deceitfully. Prosecutors appealed the court's
decision, which was eventually decided again in Ma's favor Dec. 28, 2007.</P>
      <P>At the time,  Ma argued that Hou had not documented his questioning of Wu
correctly and sued the prosecutor for forgery in January last year.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office argued that even if the written record of
Wu's testimony was incomplete, it could not be used as evidence in a trial. For
this reason, it was concluded that there were no grounds for inferring that Hou
deliberately falsified documents. On Dec. 31, 2008, the prosecutors office
declined to pursue action against Hou.</P>
      <P>Following  the decision,  Ma appealed  to the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office,
but was rejected again on the grounds that the witness did not express any
opinion after listening to Hou's documentation of her statements being read
aloud.</P>
      <P>Ma's appeal for District Court action drew criticism from the opposition, to
which Presidential Office Public Affairs Department Director Tsai Chung-li said
that Ma's decision to appeal was not made out of his personal interest but to
serve as an example to others, because every citizen could encounter such a
situation.</P>
      <P>"The case is not only about judicial rights but also part of judicial education.
President Ma believes that the case will be helpful in better protecting local
people's rights and will have a positive effect on judicial reform," Tsai added.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Ma thought that he was duty-bound to pursue the lawsuit
against the prosecutor.</P>
      <P>"The president found that local prosecutors have become more prudent and
circumspect in documenting witnesses' statements since he filed the lawsuit
against the prosecutor," Tsai added.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced a digitalization  program for elementary and
junior high schools Tuesday,  saying that the Cabinet will earmark NT$7.1
billion (US$216.5 million) to build advanced classrooms in schools all over the
country as part of the government's education reforms.</P>
      <P>Liu made the announcement during a visit to the Shenkeng Elementary School in
northern Taiwan's Taipei County.  He was accompanied by Minister of Education
Cheng Jei-cheng, Minister without Portfolio Ovid J.L. Tzeng and Taipei
Magistrate Chou Shi-wei.</P>
      <P>"Software infrastructure, namely education, is an extremely important aspect of
the government's all-out efforts to improve Taiwan's environment and advance its
high-tech standards, " he said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government aims to provide elementary and high school
students  with a computerized  wireless  learning environment in which they can
interact with their teachers through electronic  boards and remote control
devices instead of the traditional classroom blackboard, the premier said.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, close to 60,000 classrooms will be fully computerized by the
end of this year, while the government may need to purchase in excess of 90,000
personal computers as part of the plan.</P>
      <P>By the time that has been achieved, every school will have at least one
digitalized classroom for their students -- which Cheng said will help reduce
the marked digital gap between rural and urban areas.</P>
      <P>Schools in remote areas and outlying islands and those catering to aboriginal
students in mountainous areas will be the first to be included in the NT$7.1
billion program, the education minister said.</P>
      <P>The program forms part of a four-year, NT$500 billion economic stimulus package

      <P>The Yushan National Park Headquarters called Wednesday on those who have not
done so to vote for Yushan, or Jade Mountain, as one of the world's natural
wonders, as the second stage of global online voting entered its final month.</P>
      <P>The 3,952-meter mountain, the highest in Northeast Asia, has so far maintained
the top position in the "mountain, volcanoes" category in the second round of
voting for the world's new seven natural wonders organized by the Swiss-based
New7Wonders Foundation, which is scheduled to end July 7.</P>
      <P>According to the park headquarters, continued support for Yushan from the public
is essential if it is to continue the leading position amid intense competition
from other nominees.</P>
      <P>Over the past month, many newcomers have entered the top five in the "mountain,
volcanoes" ranking, squeezing Mount Everest and Mount Fuji off the list, park
officials noted.</P>
      <P>The five recent entries are Greece's Mount Olympus, which climbed from sixth to
second; Italy's Mount Vesuvius, which shot up from 13th to third; Azerbaijan's
Mud Volcanoes, which soared from 21st to fourth; and South Africa's Table
Mountain, which rose from 27th to fifth.</P>
      <P>To drum up support for Yushan, the park headquarters is holding various events
in the coming month to encourage the public to take part in the voting being
held at www.new7wonders.com.</P>
      <P>They include an exhibition and performance scheduled for June 14 at Taipei's
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, and a cycle race set for June 20 in Tataka, the
highest point of the New Central Cross-Island Highway.</P>
      <P>From June 22 to July 6, the seven Yushan publicity ambassadors -- selected in
April through an online vote -- will make a cycling tour around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yushan, located on the boundaries of Chiayi, Nantou and Kaohsiung counties, is
known for its diverse wildlife and ecology. It is the only natural attraction
from Taiwan to make the list of contenders in any category.</P>
      <P>As of June 9, Africa's Kalahari Desert had taken the top position in the
"landscape, ice formations" category; Ecuador's Galapagos Islands in the
"islands" category; Serbia's Djavolja Varos in the "caves, rock formations,
valleys" category; the Philippines's Puerto Princesa Subterranean River in the
"forest, national parks, nature reserves" category; South America's Lake
Titicaca in the "lakes, rivers, waterfalls" category; and Vietnam's Ha Long Bay
in the "seascape" category.</P>
      <P>The top 11 sites chosen in each of the seven categories by July 7 will then be
reviewed by a panel of experts headed by Federico Mayor Zaragoza, former UNESCO
director-general, who will select three nominees in each category.</P>
      <P>The 21 nominees will be put to a final round of worldwide online voting in 2010

      <P>The two separate tour groups, comprising a total of 74 members, were in Thailand
June 1-7, staying mainly in Bangkok and Pattaya.</P>
      <P>The groups were organized by the same Thai travel agency and met while in

      <P>The first three confirmed cases were reported by the CECC Tuesday, including two
who were detected with fevers upon their arrival at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport June 7.</P>
      <P>According to the CECC, 32 cases of influenza A (H1N1) have been recorded in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Strolling around 273-year-old Meinong, a Hakka township in southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung County, one immediately notices rundown red-roofed sheds scattered
across the town's fields.</P>
      <P>These tobacco kilns, remnants of Meinong's bygone days when tobacco growing was
the main source of income for many local families, add charm to the town that is
now better known for tourism.</P>
      <P>Its bucolic setting, with expansive fields bordered to the north by mountains,
has fashioned Meinong as a rural retreat for travelers looking to escape city
pressures, but the onset of more than 1 million tourists a year and land
developers  looking for new opportunities threaten the town's idyllic image.</P>
      <P>Chung Kun-hung, a Meinong native who runs "Yekousan, " a magazine promoting
Hakka culture in the town, feels the land developers present a big threat.</P>
      <P>"Meinong has changed a lot, and the many new villas built in the field, with
walls and swimming pools, have ruined its rustic landscape and ambiance, " he
says.</P>
      <P>As the traditional staples of the local economy -- tobacco growing and pig
raising -- faded in importance in the early 2000s, some local people sold their
land to outsiders and moved to cities in search of a better life.</P>
      <P>"About 10 years ago, land developers, brokers and rich city dwellers began
appearing in Meinong.  They purchased land and constructed all kinds of new and
luxury villas in the town, " Chung explained, saying that Meinong's unusually
clean air and water and majestic vistas were attractive to people looking for a
rural getaway.</P>
      <P>"Now, you can still see many yellow land sales banners erected in the fields
seeking buyers. Some land plots have even changed hands four or five times -- a
result of the speculative land development business," Chung said.</P>
      <P>According to Chung, no less than 5 percent of Meinong's land has been sold to
outsiders, mostly from Kaohsiung City and neighboring townships in the county.</P>
      <P>"Most Meinong people don't like it and are worried about what they see, but what
can we do? " Chung said. "Although we want to maintain our conservative
lifestyle, modernization is unavoidable."</P>
      <P>Lo Chin-jung, secretary-general of Meinong township, acknowledged that the trend
may have some discomforting consequences but he agreed that land development was
unavoidable as traditional agriculture fades as a source of income.</P>
      <P>He believes one solution could be stricter zoning and building codes.</P>
      <P>"Both the central and local governments should come up with adequate laws and
regulations and financial support to help Meinong keep its traditional look,"he
said. "For a town like ours filled with Hakka heritage, new buildings should be
erected with local features."</P>
      <P>While some of these new villas and developments blot the Meinong landscape, a
bigger problem is the heavy influx of tourists and the need for more modern
facilities.</P>
      <P>Although Meinong has long been a tourist attraction, drawing an estimated
500,000 visitors a year as early as 20 years ago, the larger number of tourists
it now gets seem to be overloading the town's infrastructure, especially in
terms of transportation.</P>
      <P>A drive between Meinong and Kaohsiung City, the largest city in southern Taiwan,
now only takes about 45 minutes, half the time needed in the past before the
nearby No. 10 expressway was built.</P>
      <P>But that convenient roadway creates traffic congestion  on weekends and holidays
that can rival the worst tie-ups seen in Taiwan's biggest cities.</P>
      <P>Bathrooms are also in short supply when 250,000 visitors flock in during the
town's flower festival during the Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>To be sure, Meinong, dubbed the most beautiful village in Taiwan, has many
assets that continue to make it a popular destination. Its enchanting mountains,
expanses of green wild fields and traditional Hakka architecture and culture
remain popular magnets.</P>
      <P>Some visitors enjoy biking around the town's narrow alleys and countryside,
where there is plenty to explore, while others gravitate to Meinong's trademark
crafts -- its oil-paper umbrellas or blue Hakka frocks.</P>
      <P>But local residents like Hsu Man-hsian, a 73-year-old doctor who lives in
downtown Meinong, fear that the town's once pure Hakka culture -- preserved
intact over the centuries because of its remote location and 95 percent Hakka
population -- is being eroded by modernization.</P>
      <P>"Relevant government authorities have done nothing. There is no effort being
made to help us integrate our traditions and tourism to pursue a better life,"
Hsu said, complaining that the town turns into a mess every time visitors pour
in. "It's an insult to Meinong."</P>
      <P>Huang Bin-shii, another Meinong native who is now an assistant professor at
National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, agrees that there has been
a loss of traditional architecture and folk rituals, but he feels the town
should confront it rather than accepting it with resignation.</P>
      <P>Meinong, he said, should be brave enough to upgrade and add new meaning to its
cultural content rather than simply conserve the tobacco kilns, oil-paper
umbrellas or rice noodles it has long been known for.</P>
      <P>It's not as though the town has nowhere to go for help. Because of the Hakka
people's traditional  emphasis on education  and knowledge, Meinong is said to
have the highest density of Ph.D. holders per land area of any region of Taiwan
and now enjoys fame as the country's "home of pundits."</P>
      <P>Though Meinong is stuck at a crossroad between the past and the future, it is
still trying to offer the best to visitors.</P>
      <P>"Meinong is not as famous as other townships like Danshuei or Jioufen in
northern Taiwan or Lugang in central Taiwan, but it was voted as the country's
'happiest town' and 'town of smiles' by tourists in an online competition four
years ago," Chung noted.</P>
      <P>Many foreign tourists from Hong Kong, Japan Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea
come to Meinong in the quest for the traces of a past Taiwan, he said.  "To many
of them, Meinong stands as the epitome of Taiwan's earliest days."</P>

for extensions to their expected period of study.</P>
      <P>The extensions would cover pregnancy, childbirth and the care of children under
three years old, according to the draft amendment to the University Act, which
cleared the legislature's Education and Culture Committee.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment was introduced in light of the fact that some students
are often forced to give up their studies because of the demands of parenting.</P>
      <P>Although the Ministry of Education in 2005 directed universities to allow
maternity leave for pregnant students and to deduct the period of absence from
their expected duration of study, some universities have not done so.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, pregnant students have to ask for sick leave or
private affairs leave instead, in which case they can face expulsion if they are
absent from more than one-third of their classes in a semester.</P>
      <P>If the students choose to withdraw temporarily from university, the maximum
duration of such withdrawal, as stipulated in the University Act, is four years.
In reality, however, most universities only allow a withdrawal of two years at
the maximum.</P>

      <P>The world's first documentary on the migration patterns of the endangered black-
faced spoonbill, which makes an 8,000-km round trip from Northeast Asia to
Taiwan every year, was premiered in Taipei Wednesday, one day before being
broadcast on TV.</P>
      <P>Chong Jong Ryol, a Japan-based North Korean scholar who is acclaimed as the
world's first person to have bred the white wading bird with its distinctive
black spoon-shaped beak, attended the premiere held by Taiwan's Public
Television Service (PTS) Foundation.</P>
      <P>The attendees at the event included Academia Sinica research fellow Lucia Liu
Severinghaus, who proposed international cooperation for the protection of
black-faced spoonbills at the 1994 Birdlife International Conference; Wang Ying,
a professor of life science at National Taiwan Normal University who carried out
Taiwan's first satellite tracking program on the waterfowl; and Taiwanese bird
photographer Wang Cheng-chi.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate Dance Theatre founder and choreographer Lin Huai-min, who narrated
the film in Mandarin, described the bird as Taiwan's most loyal ally, saying
that "the government does not need to give money to black-faced spoonbills in
order to persuade them to come here."</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan is isolated in the international community, black-faced
spoonbills consistently come in October, when the country celebrates its
national day, " Lin narrates in the documentary, which was produced through an
international cooperation project involving British director Dean Johnson and
Taiwanese bird photographer Liang Chieh-te.</P>
      <P>To record how the graceful birds migrate every year from the north to warmer
Asian wintering sites, the experts, carrying heavy high definition cameras and
other sophisticated equipment, traveled from Taiwan and filmed in Japan, on an
uninhabited island off the coast of northeastern China, and in the Korean
Demilitarized Zone on the Korean peninsula in a single year, overcoming many
challenges in order to get the shooting completed, according to the PST.</P>
      <P>The film, to be broadcast in various countries, will be shown in Taiwan at 10
p.m. Thursday on PTS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beijing's famous roast ducks will hit Taiwan's market in July</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's famous brand of roast ducks, Quanjude, will go trial sales in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung City beginning July 10 as planned, the company's Taiwanese
collaborator said Wednesday, denying recent rumors that the company might have
changed its plan to open its first branch on the island.</P>
      <P>Chang Su-luan,  chairwoman of the Kaohsiung City Riverside Restaurant Group,
said Quanjude (Group) Co. Ltd. may postpone the inauguration of its branch in
Kaohsiung City because Taiwan's central government has yet to scrap its ban on
Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government, however, recently announced it will allow Chinese investments in
Taiwan late this month or early next month. Investment will be allowed in around
100 sectors, including the service industry.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the company's planned sales of the ducks in the city will still
be launched as scheduled.</P>
      <P>The trial sales will be held in the Kaohsiung Port's No. 3 wharf, and a dozen
chefs from Beijing-based Quanjude will be stationed on the spot to entice
Taiwanese customers with their world famous dish.</P>
      <P>Ducks to be used during the launch will be high-quality ducks grown in
neighboring Pingtung County, Chang said. Stoves to cook the ducks will be
shipped from Beijing, she added.</P>
      <P>To effectively preserve the original taste of the Quanjude roast duck, the
Pingtung poultry farm which will provide the ducks used a different feed from
the one it normally uses to help build protein in the ducks and shorten its
maturation period from 72 days to 58.</P>
      <P>Late last year, Quanjude signed an agreement with its Kaohsiung partner to sell
its globally famous special dish to Taiwanese people in Taiwan's second largest
city.</P>
      <P>It set the date of trial sales at that time in the hope of taking advantage of
the 2009 World Games, which will be held in the city from July 16-26.</P>
      <P>Quanjude enjoys global fame due to the special techniques it uses to make the
roast ducks and the quality of its dish.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1864 during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), Quanjude is one of the most
renowned restaurants in China. The company became a corporate group in 1993 and
went public in 2007 on the Shenzhen bourse to support its goal of growing into
an international brand.</P>
      <P>It now operates 16 restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Changchun and
sells more than 2 million ducks a year to some 5 million patrons. It also has 65
franchised outlets, 55 of which are based on the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou announced Wednesday his intention to run for the
chairmanship of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), breaking a one-year period of
indecision on the matter.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that his plan to serve concurrently as the party chairman is not
intended to expand his presidential power, but rather to more effectively
fulfill his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>"I hope my bid will be supported by the party members in the interest of
facilitating closer cooperation between the ruling party and the administration
and achieving more effective government, " Ma told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Such teamwork is especially important at time when the country is experiencing
economic hardships, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that soon after his administration took office in May 2008, the
global financial crisis and economic downturn hit Taiwan, forcing many
businesses to shut down and leaving numerous people out of work.</P>
      <P>Under  these circumstances,  the government  is laden with responsibilities such
as revitalizing the economy, stabilizing the financial market and protecting the
disadvantaged, he said.</P>
      <P>Although the country's economy has begun to improve through the efforts of
various sectors, the government cannot relax its guard on the economic situation
and should unite the nation in order to overcome the crisis, the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma last assumed the KMT chairmanship in August 2005. He resigned from the party
post in February 2007, after he was indicted on charges of mishandling funds and
embezzling a total of NT$11.17 million from his special allowance fund during
his term as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006. He was later found not guilty of
the charges.</P>
      <P>According to the president, incumbent KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung first floated
the idea of Ma returning to the party helm in April 2008 -- one month after he
was elected president -- and raised the proposal again in September the same
year.</P>
      <P>Ma said he then promised Wu that he would make a decision on the matter by June
this year.</P>
      <P>Also during Wednesday's news conference, Wu said his support for the idea of Ma
as party chairman remains unchanged and that he will not run in the next
chairmanship election now that Ma has decided to stand as a candidate.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear if the election slated for July 26 will draw any other
aspirants.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT's schedule, registration forms for the election will be
distributed June 15-16, with candidate registration to be accepted June 25-26.</P>

      <P>A survey has found that the Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) system's overall
passenger satisfaction for 2008 reached a new high of 95 percent, according to
statement released by the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey results indicated  that the system's  passenger satisfaction rate has
kept growing from that registered at 86.2 percent in 2003 when the company first
began conducting the annual survey, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The figure for 2007 was 94.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The cleanliness of stations received the highest level of satisfaction at 97.6
percent, followed by the cleanliness of trains at 97.1 percent, the convenience
of ticket vending machines and add value machines at 93.7 percent, and the
safety of escalators at 93.2 percent.</P>
      <P>More than 91 percent of survey respondents were satisfied with the ventilation
and air conditioning at stations. Meanwhile, 90.6 percent of the passengers
expressed satisfaction with the information given about arriving trains, and
90.4 percent were content with the low occurrence of train delays.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 60 percent of the passengers ride the MRT, also
known as Metro, more than five days per week, an increase of 1.9 percent from
the figure in 2007, and an indication that the public is relying more on this
public transportation system.</P>
      <P>Most passengers - 32.3 percent - ride the subway system for commuting, 20.5
percent take it to go to school, and 15.5 percent use it to get to places for
recreation.</P>
      <P>According to the TRTC's statement, the survey was commissioned by the TRTC and
conducted by a market survey company via on-site interviews with passengers over
16 years old, along various MRT lines from Oct. 28 to Nov. 2, 2008. A total of
1,082 valid samples were collected.</P>
      <P>The TRTC expressed gratitude for the public's support for the system, saying
improvements will be made based on passengers' needs and suggestions.</P>
      <P>Taipei's MRT started operations in March 1996.  Its daily passenger volume
exceeded 1.24 million this April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President's proposal targets simplified character users in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10 (CNA)
06/10/09  19:45:38
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou was aiming his remarks at the 1.3 billion people of China
who use simplified characters when he broached the idea of being able to
recognize traditional characters but writing in simplified characters, the
Presidential Office said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office dismissed media reports that Ma was advocating the use
in Taiwan of simplified Chinese characters for writing.</P>
      <P>The officials issued the clarification one day after Ma's remarks triggered
concern among some scholars who said such a move would lead to pro-Taiwan
overseas  Chinese schools --  which only teach traditional Chinese -- beginning
to accept "simplified characters in writing," which in turn would affect
domestic teaching.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with visiting overseas Chinese leaders, Ma proposed using
traditional Chinese characters as much as possible in print, although he added
that it would be acceptable to use simplified in writing. He expressed hope that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can "reach an agreement on the matter."</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong use traditional Chinese characters, while China and
Singapore use a simplified version developed by Beijing in the 1950s in a bid to
promote literacy among rural peasants.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that China has used simplified Chinese characters for
years and that Taiwan could not possibly force Beijing to change it. Ma's
proposal was simply aimed at giving Chinese people the opportunity to learn how
to recognize more traditional Chinese characters and was "by no means an attempt
to promote simplified characters in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"There is no need to advocate the idea in Taiwan," an official went on, since
people in Taiwan recognize traditional Chinese characters, which makes
deciphering simplified a fairly simple process.</P>
      <P>The official also noted that ever since the end of Japanese colonial rule,
Taiwan has always used traditional Chinese characters and said its use
represents a unique status in Chinese culture and also plays a role with regard
to sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The official said that Taiwanese people are used to writing in the traditional
form, but added that if some use simplified, the government could not ban it,
although in "schools, government offices and the military" the traditional
system should still be adopted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Ma is hoping
that China could promote traditional Chinese characters to allow its people a
deeper understanding of Chinese culture, while Taiwan will continue to read and
write using the traditional system.</P>
      <P>In the legislature, meanwhile, lawmakers reacted along party lines, with
opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislators Chen Ting-fei and Kuan Bi-
ling saying that the president "should not promote" the recognition of
simplified Chinese characters, which they claimed is evidence of Ma's tilting
toward China.</P>
      <P>However, ruling Kuomintang legislators Kuo Shu-chun and Hung Hsiu-chu said Ma's
idea is actually to promote the use of traditional characters for cross-strait
documents and papers, which they lauded as a "strong approach" toward China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China will not necessarily sign an Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) in the second half of this year or the first half of 2010
during their coming rounds of talks, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks while answering questions from legislators on the issue at
a joint legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lai said she could not give any assurances concerning the issue, although she
noted that the government hopes to start relevant talks with China as quickly as
possible.</P>
      <P>"The two sides will talk at the right time, when both of them have made
sufficient preparations," she said.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC chairwoman, timetables have not been set regarding either
exchanges of offices or crime investigation officers between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"The matter of exchanging offices has not been included on the agenda of the
current stage of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations," she pointed out.</P>
      <P>In the recent third round of bilateral negotiations, Taiwan and China reached
preliminary agreement to discuss topics concerning the avoidance of double
taxation, fishery cooperation, cooperation on agricultural  quarantine and
collaboration  on standard product certification in their next meeting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's oldest graduate student Chao Mu-he, 98, will be awarded a master's
degree in philosophy Friday, in an embodiment of the adage "never too old to
learn."</P>
      <P>Chao was born on July 4, 1912, the year the Republic of China was established.
Notably, his birthday also falls on the same date as the United States
independence day.</P>
      <P>Chao, who has mastered the "bird-worm-style" calligraphy, used his research on
the spirit of the Chinese calligraphic art as the basis for his degree from the
Graduate Institute of Philosophy, Nanhua University in Chiayi County, southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chao said he learned the calligraphic style as child in China.</P>
      <P>"It is a difficult form of calligraphy because each stroke in the script has to
be shaped like a bird or worm," he said.</P>
      <P>As he had spent several decades of his life learning the style, which is now
almost obsolete, he knew it would be the best subject for his thesis, Chao said
in an interview with CNA Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chao, a graduate of a teachers' college in Shandong in northern China, moved to
Taiwan in 1951. He taught at Kaohsiung Girls Normal College, which later became
National Kaohsiung Normal University, and had attained the position of director
of general affairs at the university before his retirement in 1978.</P>
      <P>Asked why he decided to pursue a graduate degree so late in life, Chao said he
wanted to encourage one of his friend's sons who appeared reluctant to go back
to school. Chao said he invited the young man to study with him in graduate
school.</P>
      <P>As Chao was living in Kaohsiung, he had to commute to Chiayi by bus to attend
university, but he was proud to say that in two years of study he never missed a
class.</P>
      <P>Physically, Chao appears to be in good shape and moves around unassisted. Asked
about the secret to his good health, he said there is none, but noted that he
never quarrels with anyone.</P>
      <P>Chen Teh-ho, who is Chao's thesis adviser, described his student as diligent and
said he has a sense of humor. Chen added that he was impressed by Chao's desire
to acquire knowledge.</P>
      <P>Chao is the best example of the saying "never too old to learn, " Chen said,
adding that his student will receive a special award at the graduation ceremony
Friday in recognition of his diligence.</P>

      <P>Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair said Wednesday that he will drop a plan to
visit Xiamen in China's Fujian Province in early July, if China insists that he
must enter with a travel document especially designed for people from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, once the matter is handled as he wishes, Hsu said, he will definitely
head for Xiamen to attend the First Strait Cup Sailing Boat Championship next
month as scheduled, even if his pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) disagrees with his decision.</P>
      <P>Hsu is slated to visit Xiamen July 17-21 for the regatta.</P>
      <P>According to Tainan City's cultural bureau, the Taiwan Affairs Office under the
Beijing-based State Council has yet to respond to the question of whether Hsu
could enter China without a special entry permit issued by Beijing for travelers
from Taiwan, known as "Taiwan Compatriot Travel Certificate."</P>
      <P>Hsu's trip is being planned on the heels of visit to China by Chen Chu, a DPP
heavyweight and mayor of Kaohsiung City, May 21-24.</P>
      <P>Chen, the most prominent DPP incumbent official to have ever visited China, was
on promotional trip for the World Games in Kaohsiung next month.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou recently said that he welcomed Chen's visit to China and
that he hoped to see increased interaction between the DPP and Chinese
officials. He said that such interaction will allow Beijing to more clearly hear
voices from Taiwan other than those of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and will be
conducive to further development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ma encouraged DPP members to continue this approach for the sake of Taiwan and
its people.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that improving Taiwan-China ties is not a prerogative of
the KMT. "Rather, it is a path that all Taiwan's political parties should take,
because Taiwan needs to reach out in order to survive," he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT favors strengthening relations with China, especially trade links, but
the DPP has warned that some of Ma's China-friendly policies could jeopardize
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

January-May period, marking a 19.2 percent decline year on year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at news conference on government policies, Lee said that although the
national coffers saw the largest ever decrease in tax revenues over the past
five months because of the sluggish economy and sagging exports, the amount lost
was actually less than expected.</P>
      <P>Usually, the central government is able to save 5-to-8 percent annually on its
projected expenditures, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Last year, Lee noted, the government had a budget surplus of NT$90.9 billion.
"This year, we should be able to save as much as that amount," he added.</P>
      <P>Quoting a forecast by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Lee said the country's economic contraction will
gradually narrow from the second quarter of this year and turn to positive
growth in the fourth quarter. Against this backdrop, Lee said, tax revenue
prospects will steadily improve as well.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China sign letter of intent on LED industry cooperation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait signed a letter of intent Wednesday on
cooperation in the development of light emitting diode (LED) lighting technology
and production.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed at the conclusion  of a two-day conference on cross-
strait cooperation in the LED industry, which opened in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the accord, the two sides will cooperate to establish a platform for
inspection, safety testing and certification of LED products.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference brought together 450 LED experts, industry executives and
relevant government officials from both sides to discuss cooperative measures
for the establishment of the largest standardized market for LED products in the
world.</P>
      <P>Some 200 Taiwan companies sent representatives to meet with their counterparts
from 71 Chinese corporations at the conference, which was the first large-scale
cross-strait exchange in the LED industry.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is promoting a project to install LED street lamps in its 10
major cities, Lee Chung-hsi, director of Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) , said the project will provide  an estimated  NT$80 billion
worth  of business opportunities.</P>
      <P>Lee said local LED companies should step up efforts to cooperate with Chinese
corporations to secure a share of that huge pie.</P>
      <P>ITRI Deputy Director Chu Hsin-sheng said the LED industry will see a fierce
patent battle in the next few years. Against this backdrop, he said, the two
sides of the strait should cooperate and integrate their resources.</P>
      <P>After two days of extensive discussions, the two sides reached a six-point
consensus  to jointly craft a permanent cooperative mechanism, form a cross-
strait LED industry alliance, set up a cross-strait LED patent databank, design
a standardization mechanism and jointly establish an LED production chain.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's largest manufacturer of LED lighting products, with sales
reaching NT$54 billion in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Documentary on black-faced spoonbill premiered</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's first documentary on the migration patterns of the endangered black-
faced spoonbill, which makes an 8,000-km round trip from Northeast Asia to
Taiwan every year, was premiered in Taipei Wednesday, one day before being
broadcast on TV.</P>
      <P>Chong Jong Ryol, a Japan-based North Korean scholar who is acclaimed as the
world's first person to have bred the white wading bird with its distinctive
black spoon-shaped beak, attended the premiere held by Taiwan's Public
Television Service (PTS) Foundation.</P>
      <P>The attendees at the event included Academia Sinica research fellow Lucia Liu
Severinghaus, who proposed international cooperation for the protection of
black-faced spoonbills at the 1994 Birdlife International Conference; Wang Ying,
a professor of life science at National Taiwan Normal University who carried out
Taiwan's first satellite tracking program on the waterfowl; and Taiwanese bird
photographer Wang Cheng-chi.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate Dance Theatre founder and choreographer Lin Huai-min, who narrated
the film in Mandarin, described the bird as Taiwan's most loyal ally, saying
that "the government does not need to give money to black-faced spoonbills in
order to persuade them to come here."</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan is isolated in the international community, black-faced
spoonbills consistently come in October, when the country celebrates its
national day, " Lin narrates in the documentary, which was produced through an
international cooperation project involving British director Dean Johnson and
Taiwanese bird photographer Liang Chieh-te.</P>
      <P>To record how the graceful birds migrate every year from the north to warmer
Asian wintering sites, the experts, carrying heavy high definition cameras and
other sophisticated equipment, traveled from Taiwan and filmed in Japan, on an
uninhabited island off the coast of northeastern China, and in the Korean
Demilitarized Zone on the Korean peninsula in a single year, overcoming many
challenges in order to get the shooting completed, according to the PST.</P>
      <P>The film, to be broadcast in various countries, will be shown in Taiwan at 10
p.m. Thursday on PTS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beijing's famous roast ducks will hit Taiwan's market in July</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 10 (CNA)
06/10/09  18:00:36
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's famous brand of roast ducks, Quanjude, will go trial sales in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung City beginning July 10 as planned, the company's Taiwanese
collaborator said Wednesday, denying recent rumors that the company might have
changed its plan to open its first branch on the island.</P>
      <P>Chang Su-luan,  chairwoman of the Kaohsiung City Riverside Restaurant Group,
said Quanjude (Group) Co. Ltd. may postpone the inauguration of its branch in
Kaohsiung City because Taiwan's central government has yet to scrap its ban on
Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government, however, recently announced it will allow Chinese investments in
Taiwan late this month or early next month. Investment will be allowed in around
100 sectors, including the service industry.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the company's planned sales of the ducks in the city will still
be launched as scheduled.</P>
      <P>The trial sales will be held in the Kaohsiung Port's No. 3 wharf, and a dozen
chefs from Beijing-based Quanjude will be stationed on the spot to entice
Taiwanese customers with their world famous dish.</P>
      <P>Ducks to be used during the launch will be high-quality ducks grown in
neighboring Pingtung County, Chang said. Stoves to cook the ducks will be
shipped from Beijing, she added.</P>
      <P>To effectively preserve the original taste of the Quanjude roast duck, the
Pingtung poultry farm which will provide the ducks used a different feed from
the one it normally uses to help build protein in the ducks and shorten its
maturation period from 72 days to 58.</P>
      <P>Late last year, Quanjude signed an agreement with its Kaohsiung partner to sell
its globally famous special dish to Taiwanese people in Taiwan's second largest
city.</P>
      <P>It set the date of trial sales at that time in the hope of taking advantage of
the 2009 World Games, which will be held in the city from July 16-26.</P>
      <P>Quanjude enjoys global fame due to the special techniques it uses to make the
roast ducks and the quality of its dish.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1864 during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), Quanjude is one of the most
renowned restaurants in China. The company became a corporate group in 1993 and
went public in 2007 on the Shenzhen bourse to support its goal of growing into
an international brand.</P>
      <P>It now operates 16 restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Changchun and
sells more than 2 million ducks a year to some 5 million patrons. It also has 65
franchised outlets, 55 of which are based on the mainland.</P>

      <P>Rebounding after two consecutive losing sessions, the local bourse opened at the

Chinese tour group is slated to arrive in Taiwan Sunday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, shares in several food firms made significant gains, which analysts
said were caused by an increase of salad oil and soy flour prices as a result of
a sharp rise of soybean and corn prices on the international market.</P>

prices will increase in the coming days, according to David Dong, an investment

    <HEADLINE>President Ma announces bid for KMT chairmanship</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
06/10/09  19:14:31
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou announced Wednesday his intention to run for the
chairmanship of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), breaking a one-year period of
indecision on the matter.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that his plan to serve concurrently as the party chairman is not
intended to expand his presidential power, but rather to more effectively
fulfill his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>"I hope my bid will be supported by the party members in the interest of
facilitating closer cooperation between the ruling party and the administration
and achieving more effective government, " Ma told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Such teamwork is especially important at time when the country is experiencing
economic hardships, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that soon after his administration took office in May 2008, the
global financial crisis and economic downturn hit Taiwan, forcing many
businesses to shut down and leaving numerous people out of work.</P>
      <P>Under  these circumstances,  the government  is laden with responsibilities such
as revitalizing the economy, stabilizing the financial market and protecting the
disadvantaged, he said.</P>
      <P>Although the country's economy has begun to improve through the efforts of
various sectors, the government cannot relax its guard on the economic situation
and should unite the nation in order to overcome the crisis, the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma last assumed the KMT chairmanship in August 2005. He resigned from the party
post in February 2007, after he was indicted on charges of mishandling funds and
embezzling a total of NT$11.17 million from his special allowance fund during
his term as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006. He was later found not guilty of
the charges.</P>
      <P>According to the president, incumbent KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung first floated
the idea of Ma returning to the party helm in April 2008 -- one month after he
was elected president -- and raised the proposal again in September the same
year.</P>
      <P>Ma said he then promised Wu that he would make a decision on the matter by June
this year.</P>
      <P>Also during Wednesday's news conference, Wu said his support for the idea of Ma
as party chairman remains unchanged and that he will not run in the next
chairmanship election now that Ma has decided to stand as a candidate.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear if the election slated for July 26 will draw any other
aspirants.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT's schedule, registration forms for the election will be
distributed June 15-16, with candidate registration to be accepted June 25-26.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey has found that the Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) system's overall
passenger satisfaction for 2008 reached a new high of 95 percent, according to
statement released by the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey results indicated  that the system's  passenger satisfaction rate has
kept growing from that registered at 86.2 percent in 2003 when the company first
began conducting the annual survey, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The figure for 2007 was 94.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The cleanliness of stations received the highest level of satisfaction at 97.6
percent, followed by the cleanliness of trains at 97.1 percent, the convenience
of ticket vending machines and add value machines at 93.7 percent, and the
safety of escalators at 93.2 percent.</P>
      <P>More than 91 percent of survey respondents were satisfied with the ventilation
and air conditioning at stations. Meanwhile, 90.6 percent of the passengers
expressed satisfaction with the information given about arriving trains, and
90.4 percent were content with the low occurrence of train delays.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 60 percent of the passengers ride the MRT, also
known as Metro, more than five days per week, an increase of 1.9 percent from
the figure in 2007, and an indication that the public is relying more on this
public transportation system.</P>
      <P>Most passengers - 32.3 percent - ride the subway system for commuting, 20.5
percent take it to go to school, and 15.5 percent use it to get to places for
recreation.</P>
      <P>According to the TRTC's statement, the survey was commissioned by the TRTC and
conducted by a market survey company via on-site interviews with passengers over
16 years old, along various MRT lines from Oct. 28 to Nov. 2, 2008. A total of
1,082 valid samples were collected.</P>
      <P>The TRTC expressed gratitude for the public's support for the system, saying
improvements will be made based on passengers' needs and suggestions.</P>
      <P>Taipei's MRT started operations in March 1996.  Its daily passenger volume
exceeded 1.24 million this April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President's proposal targets simplified character users in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10 (CNA)
06/10/09  19:45:38
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou was aiming his remarks at the 1.3 billion people of China
who use simplified characters when he broached the idea of being able to
recognize traditional characters but writing in simplified characters, the
Presidential Office said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office dismissed media reports that Ma was advocating the use
in Taiwan of simplified Chinese characters for writing.</P>
      <P>The officials issued the clarification one day after Ma's remarks triggered
concern among some scholars who said such a move would lead to pro-Taiwan
overseas  Chinese schools --  which only teach traditional Chinese -- beginning
to accept "simplified characters in writing," which in turn would affect
domestic teaching.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with visiting overseas Chinese leaders, Ma proposed using
traditional Chinese characters as much as possible in print, although he added
that it would be acceptable to use simplified in writing. He expressed hope that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can "reach an agreement on the matter."</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong use traditional Chinese characters, while China and
Singapore use a simplified version developed by Beijing in the 1950s in a bid to
promote literacy among rural peasants.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that China has used simplified Chinese characters for
years and that Taiwan could not possibly force Beijing to change it. Ma's
proposal was simply aimed at giving Chinese people the opportunity to learn how
to recognize more traditional Chinese characters and was "by no means an attempt
to promote simplified characters in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"There is no need to advocate the idea in Taiwan," an official went on, since
people in Taiwan recognize traditional Chinese characters, which makes
deciphering simplified a fairly simple process.</P>
      <P>The official also noted that ever since the end of Japanese colonial rule,
Taiwan has always used traditional Chinese characters and said its use
represents a unique status in Chinese culture and also plays a role with regard
to sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The official said that Taiwanese people are used to writing in the traditional
form, but added that if some use simplified, the government could not ban it,
although in "schools, government offices and the military" the traditional
system should still be adopted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Ma is hoping
that China could promote traditional Chinese characters to allow its people a
deeper understanding of Chinese culture, while Taiwan will continue to read and
write using the traditional system.</P>
      <P>In the legislature, meanwhile, lawmakers reacted along party lines, with
opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislators Chen Ting-fei and Kuan Bi-
ling saying that the president "should not promote" the recognition of
simplified Chinese characters, which they claimed is evidence of Ma's tilting
toward China.</P>
      <P>However, ruling Kuomintang legislators Kuo Shu-chun and Hung Hsiu-chu said Ma's
idea is actually to promote the use of traditional characters for cross-strait
documents and papers, which they lauded as a "strong approach" toward China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China will not necessarily sign an Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) in the second half of this year or the first half of 2010
during their coming rounds of talks, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks while answering questions from legislators on the issue at
a joint legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lai said she could not give any assurances concerning the issue, although she
noted that the government hopes to start relevant talks with China as quickly as
possible.</P>
      <P>"The two sides will talk at the right time, when both of them have made
sufficient preparations," she said.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC chairwoman, timetables have not been set regarding either
exchanges of offices or crime investigation officers between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"The matter of exchanging offices has not been included on the agenda of the
current stage of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations," she pointed out.</P>
      <P>In the recent third round of bilateral negotiations, Taiwan and China reached
preliminary agreement to discuss topics concerning the avoidance of double
taxation, fishery cooperation, cooperation on agricultural  quarantine and
collaboration  on standard product certification in their next meeting.</P>
      <P>A consensus on opening Taiwan to Chinese investment was one of the agreements
reached in the third round of cross-strait talks held in China's Nanjing in late
April, following previous accords on direct transport and postal links between

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's oldest graduate student Chao Mu-he, 98, will be awarded a master's
degree in philosophy Friday, in an embodiment of the adage "never too old to
learn."</P>
      <P>Chao was born on July 4, 1912, the year the Republic of China was established.
Notably, his birthday also falls on the same date as the United States
independence day.</P>
      <P>Chao, who has mastered the "bird-worm-style" calligraphy, used his research on
the spirit of the Chinese calligraphic art as the basis for his degree from the
Graduate Institute of Philosophy, Nanhua University in Chiayi County, southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chao said he learned the calligraphic style as child in China.</P>
      <P>"It is a difficult form of calligraphy because each stroke in the script has to
be shaped like a bird or worm," he said.</P>
      <P>As he had spent several decades of his life learning the style, which is now
almost obsolete, he knew it would be the best subject for his thesis, Chao said
in an interview with CNA Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chao, a graduate of a teachers' college in Shandong in northern China, moved to
Taiwan in 1951. He taught at Kaohsiung Girls Normal College, which later became
National Kaohsiung Normal University, and had attained the position of director
of general affairs at the university before his retirement in 1978.</P>
      <P>Asked why he decided to pursue a graduate degree so late in life, Chao said he
wanted to encourage one of his friend's sons who appeared reluctant to go back
to school. Chao said he invited the young man to study with him in graduate
school.</P>
      <P>As Chao was living in Kaohsiung, he had to commute to Chiayi by bus to attend
university, but he was proud to say that in two years of study he never missed a
class.</P>
      <P>Physically, Chao appears to be in good shape and moves around unassisted. Asked
about the secret to his good health, he said there is none, but noted that he
never quarrels with anyone.</P>
      <P>Chen Teh-ho, who is Chao's thesis adviser, described his student as diligent and
said he has a sense of humor. Chen added that he was impressed by Chao's desire
to acquire knowledge.</P>
      <P>Chao is the best example of the saying "never too old to learn, " Chen said,
adding that his student will receive a special award at the graduation ceremony
Friday in recognition of his diligence.</P>

      <P>Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair said Wednesday that he will drop a plan to
visit Xiamen in China's Fujian Province in early July, if China insists that he
must enter with a travel document especially designed for people from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, once the matter is handled as he wishes, Hsu said, he will definitely
head for Xiamen to attend the First Strait Cup Sailing Boat Championship next
month as scheduled, even if his pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) disagrees with his decision.</P>
      <P>Hsu is slated to visit Xiamen July 17-21 for the regatta.</P>
      <P>According to Tainan City's cultural bureau, the Taiwan Affairs Office under the
Beijing-based State Council has yet to respond to the question of whether Hsu
could enter China without a special entry permit issued by Beijing for travelers
from Taiwan, known as "Taiwan Compatriot Travel Certificate."</P>
      <P>Hsu's trip is being planned on the heels of visit to China by Chen Chu, a DPP
heavyweight and mayor of Kaohsiung City, May 21-24.</P>
      <P>Chen, the most prominent DPP incumbent official to have ever visited China, was
on promotional trip for the World Games in Kaohsiung next month.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou recently said that he welcomed Chen's visit to China and
that he hoped to see increased interaction between the DPP and Chinese
officials. He said that such interaction will allow Beijing to more clearly hear
voices from Taiwan other than those of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and will be
conducive to further development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ma encouraged DPP members to continue this approach for the sake of Taiwan and
its people.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that improving Taiwan-China ties is not a prerogative of
the KMT. "Rather, it is a path that all Taiwan's political parties should take,
because Taiwan needs to reach out in order to survive," he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT favors strengthening relations with China, especially trade links, but
the DPP has warned that some of Ma's China-friendly policies could jeopardize
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

Poh-hsiung, will preside over the fifth forum between the KMT and the Communist
Party of China (CPC), which will be held July 11-12 in Changsha, Hunan Province
in central China.</P>
      <P>The KMT issued the statement Wednesday after Wu made public his decision not to
seek reelection in light of President Ma Ying-jeou's intention to run for the
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>The agenda of the planned KMT-CPC forum was decided at a preparatory meeting
held earlier in the day in Taipei City. It was attended by KMT think tank
members and a Chinese delegation headed by Zheng Lizhong, deputy director of
CPC's Taiwan Affairs Office.</P>
      <P>According to a KMT statement on the preparatory meeting, the two sides have
agreed on three topics for discussion in the KMT-CPC forum, including the
preservation of Chinese cultural heritage, and the promotion and expansion of
cross-Taiwan Strait cultural and industrial cooperation.</P>
      <P>The agenda will also include a conference on cross-strait economic and trade
exchanges, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Some 200 scholars and experts from each side are expected to attend the forum.</P>
      <P>Zheng, who is also vice president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits, arrived in Taipei Wednesday for the preparatory
meeting. On arrival, he said that during his visit he will also try to obtain
opinions from the Taiwan people on the cross-strait transportation, postal and

      <P>The government remains financially solvent, despite a record drop in tax
revenues in the first five months of this year, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics released by the Ministry of Finance, the
government's tax revenues amounted to NT$529.6 billion (US$16.2 billion) in the
January-May period, marking a 19.2 percent decline year on year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at news conference on government policies, Lee said that although the
national coffers saw the largest ever decrease in tax revenues over the past
five months because of the sluggish economy and sagging exports, the amount lost
was actually less than expected.</P>
      <P>Usually, the central government is able to save 5-to-8 percent annually on its
projected expenditures, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Last year, Lee noted, the government had a budget surplus of NT$90.9 billion.
"This year, we should be able to save as much as that amount," he added.</P>
      <P>Quoting a forecast by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Lee said the country's economic contraction will
gradually narrow from the second quarter of this year and turn to positive
growth in the fourth quarter. Against this backdrop, Lee said, tax revenue
prospects will steadily improve as well.</P>

      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait signed a letter of intent Wednesday on
cooperation in the development of light emitting diode (LED) lighting technology
and production.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed at the conclusion  of a two-day conference on cross-
strait cooperation in the LED industry, which opened in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the accord, the two sides will cooperate to establish a platform for
inspection, safety testing and certification of LED products.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference brought together 450 LED experts, industry executives and
relevant government officials from both sides to discuss cooperative measures
for the establishment of the largest standardized market for LED products in the
world.</P>
      <P>Some 200 Taiwan companies sent representatives to meet with their counterparts
from 71 Chinese corporations at the conference, which was the first large-scale
cross-strait exchange in the LED industry.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is promoting a project to install LED street lamps in its 10
major cities, Lee Chung-hsi, director of Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) , said the project will provide  an estimated  NT$80 billion
worth  of business opportunities.</P>
      <P>Lee said local LED companies should step up efforts to cooperate with Chinese
corporations to secure a share of that huge pie.</P>
      <P>ITRI Deputy Director Chu Hsin-sheng said the LED industry will see a fierce
patent battle in the next few years. Against this backdrop, he said, the two
sides of the strait should cooperate and integrate their resources.</P>
      <P>After two days of extensive discussions, the two sides reached a six-point
consensus  to jointly craft a permanent cooperative mechanism, form a cross-
strait LED industry alliance, set up a cross-strait LED patent databank, design
a standardization mechanism and jointly establish an LED production chain.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's largest manufacturer of LED lighting products, with sales
reaching NT$54 billion in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA to make decision soon on Taiwan's U.N. bid: foreign minister</HEADLINE>

      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Thursday that the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA)  is now evaluating how to present the country's United Nations
bid this year, and will make a decision soon.</P>
      <P>"All possibilities are under evaluation," said Ou while reporting to the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee on President
Ma Ying-jeou's recent state visit to three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in
Central America.</P>
      <P>"Basically, the Foreign Ministry is considering applying again for entry, but we
are also evaluating under what circumstances we may not do so this year," he
said. "There are several options and we will make a decision after consultations
with the National Security Council."</P>
      <P>Ou noted that Taiwan has made impressive progress in terms of international
participation since its pragmatic approach to its U.N. bid last year and because
of improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations, which he said resulted in its
participation as an observer in the World Health Assembly this May.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry will carefully evaluate how to best make substantial gains
while protecting the country's dignity in its U.N. bid this year, he added.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator John Chiang said that if Taiwan decides not to make
a bid this year, the foreign ministry must produce a position paper to explain
the reasons clearly to the country's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Chiang suggested the MOFA give greater priority to Taiwan's efforts to join the
International Civil Aviation Organization and International Maritime
Organization.</P>
      <P>In addition, opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Twu Shiing-jer
suggested Taiwan try to gain entry to the Universal Postal Union and the
International Meteorological Organization, which are also U.N.-affiliated
bodies.</P>
      <P>In keeping with Ma's "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy which favors a moderate
and pragmatic approach, Taiwan asked the U.N. last September to consider its
meaningful participation in affiliated agencies, rather than full membership in
the U.N.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's attempt to have its case included as a supplementary item on
the agenda of the 63rd session of the U.N. General Assembly was rejected. But
President Ma has said repeatedly that  the more  moderate  approach  was well-
received  in the international community, as evidenced by the fact that many
major countries voiced support for the effort.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been a member of the U.N. since 1971, when the People's Republic
of China took over the China seat from the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Over the past 15 years, efforts to persuade the General Assembly to list the
issue of Taiwan's membership on the U.N. agenda have failed mainly because of
obstruction from China, which is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council
and has veto power.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's two leading smart cards, or electronic purses, are likely to be merged
by the end of this year, the heads of the issuing enterprises said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lien Shen-wen, chairman of EasyCard Corporation, which to date has issued 16
million EasyCards, and Hsu Chung-ren, chief executive officer of President Chain
Store Corp., which has so far issued 7.4 million icash cards, announced Thursday
their decision to integrate the cards.</P>
      <P>Lien said they began exploring the possibility of a joint operation after the
Legislative Yuan passed a bill to allow for the issue of multi-purpose
electronic purses.</P>
      <P>Although, the bill would not take effect before relevant regulation details
could be worked out by the Finance Supervisory Commission, Lien said, "we will
merge the two cards as soon as it is legally possible."</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-ying, the chief executive officer of EasyCard Corp., forecast that the
relevant regulations will be ready before the end of this year. "Our application
for a merger is expected to be approved by the Finance Supervisory Commission
one month after that," he added.</P>
      <P>EasyCard, which originated in Taipei City as a pass to its mass transit system,
is now being used in public transportation systems in northern Taiwan, mainly in
Taipei County, Keelung County, Yilan County, and the island county of
Lienchiang.</P>
      <P>The iCash card is mainly used for payment at the country's 4,800-odd 7-Eleven
chain stores that are operated by President Corp.</P>
      <P>Currently, holders of EasyCard and iCash and can store credit of up to NT$10,000
on each card and use them to pay for public transportation and 7-Eleven
purchases, respectively.</P>

      <P>Typhoons, one of the most common natural phenomena in Taiwan, can trigger slow
earthquakes, the findings of a joint Taiwan-U.S. research project showed
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Slow earthquakes are non-violent fault slippage events that release energy over
a period of hours to months, instead of a few seconds to minutes as is
characteristic of a typical earthquake.</P>
      <P>The results were published  in the June 11 issue of the international weekly
journal Nature, in an article co-written by Liu Chi-ching, an associate research
fellow at the Institute of Earth Science of Taiwan's Academia Sinica, and Alan
Linde and Selwyn Sacks from the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the
U.S.-based Carnegie Institution of Washington.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, for the purpose of the research, three sensitive borehole
strainmeters were installed 200 meters to 270 meters underground in Rueisuei,
Dagangkou and Jhangyuan in eastern Taiwan to detect otherwise imperceptible
seismic movements.</P>
      <P>Between August 2003 and August 2007, a total of 20 slow earthquakes were
recorded, with 11 occurring simultaneously with typhoons, Liu said.</P>
      <P>These 11 events were also stronger and characterized by more complex waveforms
than the other nine, he said.</P>
      <P>On the question of how typhoons trigger the slow quakes, the research team
explained that the low pressure associated with typhoons impacts only on land
areas and does not affect conditions at the bottom of the ocean, because water
moves into the area and equalizes the pressure there.</P>
      <P>The reduction in pressure above one section of an obliquely dipping fault that
runs partly under land and partly under the ocean floor tends to unclamp it,
they explained.</P>
      <P>The  researchers  speculated  that  the reason  devastating earthquakes  are
rare in eastern  Taiwan is because the slow earthquakes act as valves, releasing
the stress frequently along a small section of the fault.</P>
      <P>This eliminates a situation where a long segment sustains continuous  high
stresses until it ruptures in a single huge earthquake, they said.</P>

      <P>Taichung County in central Taiwan will be a destination for international
passenger cruise lines in August, in the latest positive development in Taiwan's
quest to attract more tourists, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong-based passenger liner operated by the Star Cruises company, Asia's
largest cruise operator, will stop at the county's Taichung Port Aug. 4,
bringing 1,600 tourists from China to visit the county, according to Chen Chin-
fah, the county government's executive officer.</P>
      <P>The company agreed to include Taichung County on its route during a county
delegation's visit to Hong Kong earlier this month to promote tourism, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng led the delegation to Hong Kong to
promote the county's agricultural products and tourism from June 5-8. During his
stay there, he met with the cruise company's  president  David Chua Ming-huat
to facilitate  the cooperation, Chen said</P>
      <P>He added that the county government has designed three different itineraries --
covering mountains, costal lines, and the plains - - to appeal to the Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>Star Cruises will send a representative to Taichung to better understand the
travel routes.</P>
      <P>The company said it would include Taichung County into regular cruise lines if
the destination gains popularity in the future, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Currently, Keelung Port in northern Taiwan and Kaohsiung Port in southern Taiwan
are the island's only two destinations included in passenger cruises operated by
Star Cruises.</P>
      <P>During its trip to Hong Kong, the Taichung county delegation also met with
representatives of Hong Kong's food importers and food processing industry to
pave the way for exporting the county's agricultural products to Hong Kong in
the future, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau has designated 2008 and 2009 as "Tour Taiwan Years",
rolling out a host of special deals and incentives, including  the chance for
North American and European transit passengers to stay in one of Taipei's finest
hotels for US$1 or 1 euro a night.</P>
      <P>The Bureau recently also launched the "Best Trip in the World" contest aimed at
luring interest from all over the world by offering winning teams of contestants
money to spend during their travels in Taiwan, as long as they publicize their

      <P>The Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) -- the European
Union's de Facto embassy in Taiwan -- said Thursday that it will hold an
exhibition on climate change this month to raise awareness about the issue and
encourage efforts to battle global warming.</P>
      <P>"The aim of this exhibition on climate change is to raise awareness of the
Taiwanese public of the need for global action in the fight against climate
change," the EETO said in a press release.</P>
      <P>"Cooperation and exchanges of ideas and techniques are important strategies in
the common fight against global warning," it added.</P>
      <P>According to the EETO, the exhibition will show that the European Union offers
its expertise and technical know-how to ensure the protection of the
environment, while encouraging Taiwanese citizens and companies to use simple,
but effective measures, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>The office noted that the European Union has already adopted a plan to reduce
CO2 emissions to an average of 20 percent below the 1990 level by the year 2020.</P>
      <P>It said that 2009 is a particularly important year regarding climate change as
the international  community will gather in Copenhagen in December to decide on
the level of reduction of green house gas emissions with commitment by each
country.</P>
      <P>To realize these ambitious goals for the benefit of the globe, the EU needs the
cooperation and support from every country and that is why the EU is stepping up
its contacts with partners, both in the United Nations and beyond, the EETO
said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is scheduled to be held from June 17- 19 and July 4-8 at the
atrium of the Taipei City government before moving on to a tour in October and
November to National Taiwan University, National Chung Hsing University,
National Sun Yat-sen University and National Dong Hwa University.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that Taiwan cannot solely rely on the
Chinese market to improve its economy, and it is necessary for the country to
explore emerging markets to obtain sustainable economic development.</P>
      <P>"China represents both a threat and an opportunity and Taiwan must be very
cautious in dealing with it, " Ma said in a meeting with representatives of the
Taipei-based China Youth Career Development Association from across the country
at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Improved Taiwan-China relations over the past year has helped minimize the
impact of the global financial crisis on Taiwan's economy, Ma said.</P>
      <P>But he added that Taiwan needs to set its sight on other emerging markets, such
as Brazil, India, Indonesia and Russia, in its future market exploration
efforts.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economic growth relies heavily on exports, domestic businesses
should edge into other markets with large populations and great potential for
consumption, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Currently, thousands of passengers from India make a transit each week at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport on their way to the United States, which
underlines Taiwan's key location in the region and provides a clue for Taiwanese
companies in their search of a new marketplace and ways to reduce risks arising
from over-reliance on the Chinese market, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>He added that high-quality and reasonably-priced  Taiwanese products should be
very attractive to the people in these new emerging markets.</P>

      <P>Abdullah Mohd Salleh, president of the Taipei-based Malaysian Friendship and
Trade Center (MFTC)  and Malaysias top envoy to Taiwan, urged Taiwanese
companies Thursday to explore business opportunities in his country and use it
as the springboard to the market of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) , starting by participating in Malaysia's trade exhibition later this
year.</P>
      <P>Given that Malaysia is considered the commerce center of the ASEAN bloc, INTRADE
Malaysia 2009 can also be used as a springboard to penetrate the ASEAN market of
600 million consumers as well as the Middle East markets, especially for Halal
products,said Abdullah at a news conference to promote INTRADE Malaysia, which
will take place Nov. 10-12 in Kuala Lumpur for the third consecutive year.</P>
      <P>Abdullah said the strong trade and investment relationship between Taiwan and
Malaysia has become the foundation for developing cooperation in tourism,
education, culture and friendship.</P>
      <P>According to Abdullah, the two sides can also cooperate in other sectors, such
as construction services, building materials, Islamic finance, Halal products,
palm oil-based products, agro-biotechnology, marine, pharmaceutical and tropical
medicine.</P>
      <P>Muhd Shahrulmiza Zakaria, director of trade at MFTC, said on the same occasion
that INTRADE Malaysia is an ideal platform to make new contacts and explore
opportunities with business people from various countries.</P>
      <P>He noted that last year alone, the trade show was participated by 368 exhibitors
from 32 countries and attracted some 4,800 visitors to generate US$60 million in
sales and US$ 700 million in following-up business.</P>
      <P>Given the potential opportunities for growth in trade and business in Malaysia,
which is strategically located in the ASEAN region, and taking into
consideration the difficult times we are in today, it is important for the
business community to strengthen their strategic alliances and work together in
identifying avenues to enhance commercial collaborations,Shahrulmiza said.</P>
      <P>In 2008, bilateral trade between Taiwan and Malaysia recorded a positive growth
of 2.52 percent with total trade valued at US$12.15 billion.  Taiwans imports
from Malaysia increased to US$6.78 billion, a growth of 2.8 percent, while
exports to Malaysia increased to US$5.37 billion, a 2.2 percent increase.</P>
      <P>Malaysia was Taiwan's ninth largest trading partner and export destination and
its 10th largest source of imports in 2008.</P>

      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) will later this month study the
feasibility of covering the costs of targeted therapy for early-stage breast
cancer under the national health insurance system, a BNHI official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Sheen Mao-ting, a BNHI official in charge of reviewing medical claims, made the
comment in response to a call by several ruling Kuomintang legislators for the
national health insurance to cover this type of treatment.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Huang Chao-shun said that targeted therapy for early-stage breast
cancer, which aims to slow the growth of cancer cells, costs 20 times less than
the medical bills for treating such cancers if they spread.</P>
      <P>She added that in many countries, including Thailand, targeted therapies are
covered by national health insurance. "Why can't Taiwan do the same?" she asked.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Hung-chih also said that the government's tax revenues from a
hike in the health surcharge on cigarettes, beginning June 1, are expected to be
more than NT$20 billion per year, while the cost of covering targeted medicines
for early-stage breast cancer would be only NT$900 million.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, he hopes the BNHI would soon agree to cover the payments for
that type of treatment.</P>
      <P>The health and welfare surcharge on tobacco products will be increased from
NT$10 per pack to NT$20 per pack with effect from June 1. Seventy percent of the
surcharge revenues will be used by the BNHI in various areas, including cancer
prevention which will be allocated 6 percent of the revenues.</P>
      <P>Yang Li-huan,  another KMT legislator and a breast cancer survivor, said that
women around the age of 40 years make up the largest group of breast cancer
sufferers and are also the main supporters of their families. In view of the
fact that early detection of cancer greatly increases the chances of successful
treatment, the government should quickly allocate funds for early treatment of
the disease, she urged.</P>
      <P>Citing a report released March by the Department of Health, Taiwan Breast Cancer
Alliance Secretary-General Lin Wei-jie said that 6,895 new breast cancer cases
were recorded in Taiwan in 2006, and 1,552 women died of that type of malignancy
in 2007.</P>
      <P>Lin said the national health insurance system covers targeted therapy only for
fourth-stage breast cancer treatment. However, after treatment, the survival
rate of cancer patients in this stage is only 30 percent, she noted.</P>
      <P>It costs about NT$700,000 to NT$800,000 to undergo a program of targeted
therapy, Lin said, adding that most early-stage breast cancer sufferers can
hardly afford to pay that.</P>

reef inspection program in which they will help monitor and report on the health
of coral reefs in Taiwan's coastal waters.</P>
      <P>The program, now in its 10th year, had been funded in past years by the
government and held as part of academic research. But this year, it is being
organized by the private Taiwan Environmental Information Association and the
Taiwan Marine Environment Education Promotion Association as a public activity
for the first time.</P>
      <P>According to the groups, registration for the "2009 Reef Check" is open to
individuals  who are certified as advance divers. Participants will need to pay
for the costs related to the activity and will be given the required scientific
training before the event starts.</P>
      <P>A total of eight sessions are scheduled between May 23 and late September in
Taiwan's northeast coast, Green Island, Orchid Island, Liouciouyu, Penghu and
Taitung's Shanyuan, the groups said, adding that registration is set to end
three weeks before each session.</P>
      <P>Those interested in taking part can visit the activity's Web site at
http://e-info.org.tw/node/40662.</P>
      <P>Allen Chen, an associate research fellow at the Academia Sinica's Biodiversity
Research Center, said he believes the activity will help raise public awareness
about the conservation of coral reefs, whose survival is being threatened by
climate change, land pollutants released  into seas,  overdevelopment  of
coastal  regions and overfishing.</P>
      <P>Frank, a participant of the "2009 reef check," pointed out that a large variety
of rare marine life, including pygmy seahorses, can be found in coral reefs in
Taiwan's waters.</P>
      <P>Such abundance reef resources should be properly conserved because they are one
of Taiwan's most important attractions to tourists, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported Thursday four more cases of imported swine
flu, with three from Thailand and one from America, bringing to 36 the country's
total number of confirmed cases.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC), one of the four new
cases is a 22-year-old female, who traveled on a college graduation trip to
Thailand from June 3-9 along with a 22-member group. She was found with a fever
upon her arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at the end of her trip.</P>
      <P>Two students in the same group found with fevers have been found not to be
infected with swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>The 34th case is a 26-year-old man, who was in a 30-member tour group to
Thailand from June 3-8. The man began to suffer from symptoms of fever and
coughing after returning to Taiwan, and went to the hospital on June 9.</P>
      <P>No other member in the man's group has been discovered with swine flu symptoms,
the center said.</P>
      <P>The 35th case is a 30-year-old Thai engineer working in Taiwan, who returned to
and stayed in his country from May 27-June 7. The man came down with a fever and
a runny nose from June 9 and went to the hospital by himself the following day.</P>
      <P>He had contacts with a friend with swine flu symptoms, and also had short
contacts with his colleagues in Taiwan from May 31-June 2.</P>
      <P>The center has asked those who had been around him to monitor their own health.</P>
      <P>The last case is a 14-year-old American boy who arrived in Taiwan on June 5. The
boy started to experience coughing and a fever from June 9. He canceled his trip
to Australia and stayed in Taiwan to cooperate with the country's epidemic
prevention measures, the center said.</P>
      <P>The center has reported the four new cases to the World Health Organization,
which held a meeting Thursday on whether to raise the global swine flu pandemic
alert from the current level five to level six.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's center added that examinations showed none of those who had contact
with a group of Taiwanese students, reported by the center on June 9 to have
contracted swine flu during their graduation tour in Thailand, are infected.</P>
      <P>According to WHO statistics, as of June 10, 74 countries have officially
reported 27,737 cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection, including 141 deaths.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's 36 confirmed cases, 35 are imported cases and only one is
indigenous. The country has made examinations on 1,066 reported cases, and is
conducting inspections on another 24 cases.</P>

      <P>An indigenous children's choir from the central county of Nantou was honored
Thursday  by the county magistrate for having recently won a Golden Melody
Award, a local award sometimes described in Taiwan as the "Taiwan Grammys."</P>
      <P>The Bunun children's choir of the Dongpu Elementary School -- a small school of
just 67 students nestled at the foot of Yushan, Taiwan's highest peak -- won the
award for a CD they produced, led by school principal Ma Pi-teh.</P>
      <P>The 25 choristers, in grades three to six, sang one of the tunes off the CD,
titled Sing It! -- a traditional Bunun tune titled The Welcoming Song -- at a
reception held at Nantou Magistrate Lee Chao-ching's office.</P>
      <P>At the reception, Ma expressed his appreciation to several enterprises  and
individuals,  including  the Teco  Technology Foundation, for their sponsorship
of the choir, which has over the past three years been invited to perform at the
National Music Hall in Taipei, in Bangkok and in the Chinese city of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Ma, himself a member of the Bunun tribe, said the choir was established mainly
to build confidence among the Bunun children.</P>
      <P>Ma, who established the choir and trains the children, said he disagrees with
ignorant and racist voices who claim that "indigenous children have good voices
because they are born to sing, " pointing out that the choir members' heavenly
voices are simply the results of strenuous daily practice and determination.</P>

      <P>A commencement ceremony beside the seaside is beautiful, but a group of
elementary and junior high school graduates from Taipei County will go a step
further, graduating in a ceremony they will remember for the rest of their

    <HEADLINE>MOE unveils regulations for universities to leave market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) unveiled a package  of regulations  Thursday  to
pave the way for local universities that have failed ministry evaluations or are
unable to recruit enough students to gradually exit the education market.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, universities that fail to recruit up to 70 percent of
their officially approved student numbers for three consecutive years will have
their annual quotas cut by 10 percent to 30 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result of the regulations, no local universities will see their student
quotas slashed until the 2011 school year, which critics said will hold back
domestic education reform.</P>
      <P>According to MOE statistics,  enrollment at local tertiary education
institutions fell short of the target by nearly 60,000 in the 2008 school year,
the largest shortfall in five years.</P>
      <P>The average freshman registration rate also fell to a five-year low of 82.98
percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Twenty-four of the 162 universities and technology institutes in Taiwan -- all
24 of which are privately run -- saw their freshmen registration rates fall
short of the 70 percent target in the 2008 school year and one of them even had
a miserable registration rate of just 11.62 percent.</P>
      <P>MOE officials  said the ministry has included the student enrollment rate into a
list of measurement indicators in its tertiary education institutions assessment
system to better reflect the education market situation.</P>
      <P>Under the newly unveiled  university  quantitative  control regulations,
faculty  quality  and quantity,  as well as the faculty/student ratio, will also
be factored in when deciding each school's student enrollment quota.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, media reports said that even though the government's plan to open
Taiwan to Chinese university hopefuls is still in the works, many local private
tertiary education institutions have been preparing to attract Chinese
youngsters to their campuses.</P>
      <P>Because of Taiwan's declining birth rate, the number of local university
students has been dropping steadily. Out of concern that they may not be able to
recruit enough students in the coming years, school authorities have pegged
their hopes on Chinese students as a new source of income.</P>
      <P>Ou Shan-hui, president of the private Tajen University in southern Taiwan's
Pingtung County, was quoted as having said recently that the difficulties
schools face in recruiting enough students could be largely resolved if they can
attract even just 1 percent of the over 10 million Chinese students who vie to
enter Chinese universities annually.</P>
      <P>According to Ou, his school has been forging cooperative ties with various
universities in China since last year. While China has many tertiary education
institutions, Ou said, it lags behind Taiwan in the development of colleges
catering to the needs of the leisure industry.</P>
      <P>"I believe our school's department of recreation and sport management,
department of hospitality and hotel management and department of tourism should
be attractive to Chinese college hopefuls," said Ou.</P>
      <P>Tunghai University in central Taiwan has also stepped up efforts to explore
Chinese students' learning preferences and demand by exchanges students with
several prestigious universities in China, such as Peking University, Fudan
University and Nanjing University.</P>
      <P>The university, founded by Methodist missionaries in Taichung City in 1955, has
also set aside budget for advertising on major Web portals in China to enhance
the school's awareness among Chinese students, a Tunghai official said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official went on, Tunghai will not go into the China market
blind. "We will carefully evaluate the financial status of any Chinese
applicants, as well as their academic qualifications, before recruiting them,"
he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOU on financial cooperation could come soon: FSC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It is conceivable that a Taiwan-China memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  on
financial  supervisory cooperation could be signed this month or next, but it
would be unwise to predict a timetable for such an MOU before negotiations on
the issue have ended, Financial Supervisory Committee (FSC) Chairman Sean C.
Chen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when making a report on the possible impact of Chinese
investment in Taiwan's market at a joint legislative committee meeting attended
by officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) , and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's recent opening of its securities and futures markets to Chinese
qualified domestic institutional investors, those investors cannot invest in
Taiwanese shares until the MOU on financial supervisory cooperation with China
is signed, Chen noted recently.</P>
      <P>Following the signing of a financial cooperation agreement with China during a
third round of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations April 26 in Nanjing, Taiwan's
financial authorities have placed more emphasis  on inking  an MOU with China to
allow for two-way collaboration in the supervision and regulation of the
banking, securities and futures, and insurance sectors.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan and China have no problem with the MOU's content, but
the two required versions of the MOU -- one in the traditional Chinese
characters used in Taiwan and the other in the simplified characters used in
China -- would make matters more complex.</P>
      <P>In response to lawmakers' questions regarding the establishment of a much-
anticipated Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China, MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng said that in line with an MOEA
projection, two sides are expected to start talks on the issue by the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said that "Taiwan and China will not
necessarily sign an ECFA in the second half of this year or the first half of
2010 in their coming rounds of talks, " while answering questions from
legislators at a joint legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lai said she could not give any assurances concerning the issue, although she
noted that the government hopes to start relevant talks with China as quickly as
possible.</P>
      <P>The idea of an ECFA with China has touched a nerve of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , which fears that Taiwan's independent sovereignty
might be hurt by the planned accord.</P>
      <P>The DPP wants the issue to be decided by the people in a referendum and has been
collecting signatures from its supporters in support of its plan. It hopes to
obtain 100,000 signatures by early July.</P>

      <P>Nearly 20,000 passengers on Taiwan's high speed railway were affected Thursday
by a dysfunctional switch on the section of line between Taipei and Banciao
stations in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Trains operated by the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. stopped services between
Taipei and Banciao for five hours between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., affecting some
20,000 passengers, THSRC authorities said.</P>
      <P>The switch dysfunction led to delays for 14 trains, seven of which were held up
for more than 30 minutes, entitling around 4,000 passengers aboard these trains
to receive a 50 percent refund on the cost of their tickets, THSRC authorities
said.</P>
      <P>The 345-km railway linking Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan,

      <P>The top Russian envoy to Taiwan praised relations between Taipei and Moscow
Thursday,  saying the two countries have close ties not only on the economic and
trade fronts but also in many other fields such as science and technology,
culture and education.</P>
      <P>Sergey N. Gubarev made the remarks at a reception hosted by the Representative
Office of the Moscow-Taipei Coordination Commission on Economic and Cultural
Cooperation Thursday on the eve of Russia's national day.</P>
      <P>"I've already worked here for 3.5 years and in this period I've never met a cold
attitude on the part of Taiwanese, " Gubarev said at the function, which was
attended by Vice Foreign Minister Javier Hou, members of the diplomatic corps
and other dignitaries.</P>
      <P>According to Gubarev, while bilateral trade between Taiwan and Russia reached a
record US$4 billion in 2008, people-to-people exchanges are also vibrant, with
some 300 Taiwanese students in Russia and 200 Russian students in Taiwan, as
well as around 10,000 Taiwanese travelers going to Russia each year.</P>
      <P>Hou said for his part that despite the close economic ties, there is still ample
room for growth in bilateral relations and he expressed pleasure that the
government's "New Zheng He" export promotion plan has set Russia as one of the
countries with which Taiwan aims to boost economic and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>"I'm confident that the already solid foundations and pragmatic approaches in
bilateral relations will allow even greater mutual development and beneficial
growth in the future," Hou added.</P>
      <P>Established in 1992, the representative office is the de facto Russian embassy
in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between Russia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On June 12, 1990, the Russian parliament formally declared its sovereignty from
the Soviet Union, which set the wheels in motion for the creation of what is now
known as the Russian Federation. Russian Day was officially recognized as a
national holiday by former President Boris Yeltsin in 1991.</P>

      <P>After many twists and turns, the Executive Yuan finally passed a draft legal
amendment Thursday that, if approved by the legislature, will cancel the
decades-old income tax exemption for grassroots school teachers and military
personnel.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed the draft amendment to the Income Tax Law at a weekly
Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>If the draft package clears the legislative floor, the amended law will be put
into force at the beginning of next year, Government Information Office Minister
Su Jun-pin said at a news conference held after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Su called on the ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislative Yuan to approve the
draft as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the law revision will affect some 350,000 people, including the
country's active duty military personnel and teachers at day care centers and
kindergartens, as well as at public and private elementary and junior high
schools.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said the
national coffers will receive an estimated NT$16 billion (US$487.8 million) in
increased tax revenues annually as a result of the revisions.</P>
      <P>He added that the increased tax revenues in the first year will all be returned
to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of National Defense for various
projects to improve welfare services for school faculty members and military
personnel.</P>
      <P>In the future, however, the national coffers will gradually benefit from the
annulment of the tax exemption privileges, he said.</P>

      <P>Abdullah Mohd Salleh, president of the Taipei-based Malaysian Friendship and
Trade Center (MFTC)  and Malaysias top envoy to Taiwan, urged Taiwanese
companies Thursday to explore business opportunities in his country and use it
as the springboard to the market of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) , starting by participating in Malaysia's trade exhibition later this
year.</P>
      <P>Given that Malaysia is considered the commerce center of the ASEAN bloc, INTRADE
Malaysia 2009 can also be used as a springboard to penetrate the ASEAN market of
600 million consumers as well as the Middle East markets, especially for Halal
products,said Abdullah at a news conference to promote INTRADE Malaysia, which
will take place Nov. 10-12 in Kuala Lumpur for the third consecutive year.</P>
      <P>Abdullah said the strong trade and investment relationship between Taiwan and
Malaysia has become the foundation for developing cooperation in tourism,
education, culture and friendship.</P>
      <P>According to Abdullah, the two sides can also cooperate in other sectors, such
as construction services, building materials, Islamic finance, Halal products,
palm oil-based products, agro-biotechnology, marine, pharmaceutical and tropical
medicine.</P>
      <P>Muhd Shahrulmiza Zakaria, director of trade at MFTC, said on the same occasion
that INTRADE Malaysia is an ideal platform to make new contacts and explore
opportunities with business people from various countries.</P>
      <P>He noted that last year alone, the trade show was participated by 368 exhibitors
from 32 countries and attracted some 4,800 visitors to generate US$60 million in
sales and US$ 700 million in following-up business.</P>
      <P>Given the potential opportunities for growth in trade and business in Malaysia,
which is strategically located in the ASEAN region, and taking into
consideration the difficult times we are in today, it is important for the
business community to strengthen their strategic alliances and work together in
identifying avenues to enhance commercial collaborations,Shahrulmiza said.</P>
      <P>In 2008, bilateral trade between Taiwan and Malaysia recorded a positive growth
of 2.52 percent with total trade valued at US$12.15 billion.  Taiwans imports
from Malaysia increased to US$6.78 billion, a growth of 2.8 percent, while
exports to Malaysia increased to US$5.37 billion, a 2.2 percent increase.</P>
      <P>Malaysia was Taiwan's ninth largest trading partner and export destination and
its 10th largest source of imports in 2008.</P>

national health insurance to cover this type of treatment.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Huang Chao-shun said that targeted therapy for early-stage breast
cancer, which aims to slow the growth of cancer cells, costs 20 times less than
the medical bills for treating such cancers if they spread.</P>
      <P>She added that in many countries, including Thailand, targeted therapies are
covered by national health insurance. "Why can't Taiwan do the same?" she asked.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Hung-chih also said that the government's tax revenues from a
hike in the health surcharge on cigarettes, beginning June 1, are expected to be
more than NT$20 billion per year, while the cost of covering targeted medicines
for early-stage breast cancer would be only NT$900 million.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, he hopes the BNHI would soon agree to cover the payments for
that type of treatment.</P>
      <P>The health and welfare surcharge on tobacco products will be increased from
NT$10 per pack to NT$20 per pack with effect from June 1. Seventy percent of the
surcharge revenues will be used by the BNHI in various areas, including cancer
prevention which will be allocated 6 percent of the revenues.</P>
      <P>Yang Li-huan,  another KMT legislator and a breast cancer survivor, said that
women around the age of 40 years make up the largest group of breast cancer
sufferers and are also the main supporters of their families. In view of the
fact that early detection of cancer greatly increases the chances of successful
treatment, the government should quickly allocate funds for early treatment of
the disease, she urged.</P>
      <P>Citing a report released March by the Department of Health, Taiwan Breast Cancer
Alliance Secretary-General Lin Wei-jie said that 6,895 new breast cancer cases
were recorded in Taiwan in 2006, and 1,552 women died of that type of malignancy
in 2007.</P>
      <P>Lin said the national health insurance system covers targeted therapy only for
fourth-stage breast cancer treatment. However, after treatment, the survival
rate of cancer patients in this stage is only 30 percent, she noted.</P>
      <P>It costs about NT$700,000 to NT$800,000 to undergo a program of targeted
therapy, Lin said, adding that most early-stage breast cancer sufferers can
hardly afford to pay that.</P>

      <P>Two environmental groups invited divers Thursday to take part in an annual coral
reef inspection program in which they will help monitor and report on the health
of coral reefs in Taiwan's coastal waters.</P>
      <P>The program, now in its 10th year, had been funded in past years by the
government and held as part of academic research. But this year, it is being
organized by the private Taiwan Environmental Information Association and the
Taiwan Marine Environment Education Promotion Association as a public activity
for the first time.</P>
      <P>According to the groups, registration for the "2009 Reef Check" is open to
individuals  who are certified as advance divers. Participants will need to pay

      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported Thursday four more cases of imported swine
flu, with three from Thailand and one from America, bringing to 36 the country's
total number of confirmed cases.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC), one of the four new
cases is a 22-year-old female, who traveled on a college graduation trip to
Thailand from June 3-9 along with a 22-member group. She was found with a fever
upon her arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at the end of her trip.</P>
      <P>Two students in the same group found with fevers have been found not to be
infected with swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>The 34th case is a 26-year-old man, who was in a 30-member tour group to
Thailand from June 3-8. The man began to suffer from symptoms of fever and
coughing after returning to Taiwan, and went to the hospital on June 9.</P>
      <P>No other member in the man's group has been discovered with swine flu symptoms,
the center said.</P>
      <P>The 35th case is a 30-year-old Thai engineer working in Taiwan, who returned to
and stayed in his country from May 27-June 7. The man came down with a fever and
a runny nose from June 9 and went to the hospital by himself the following day.</P>
      <P>He had contacts with a friend with swine flu symptoms, and also had short
contacts with his colleagues in Taiwan from May 31-June 2.</P>
      <P>The center has asked those who had been around him to monitor their own health.</P>
      <P>The last case is a 14-year-old American boy who arrived in Taiwan on June 5. The
boy started to experience coughing and a fever from June 9. He canceled his trip
to Australia and stayed in Taiwan to cooperate with the country's epidemic
prevention measures, the center said.</P>
      <P>The center has reported the four new cases to the World Health Organization,
which held a meeting Thursday on whether to raise the global swine flu pandemic
alert from the current level five to level six.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's center added that examinations showed none of those who had contact
with a group of Taiwanese students, reported by the center on June 9 to have
contracted swine flu during their graduation tour in Thailand, are infected.</P>
      <P>According to WHO statistics, as of June 10, 74 countries have officially
reported 27,737 cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection, including 141 deaths.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's 36 confirmed cases, 35 are imported cases and only one is
indigenous. The country has made examinations on 1,066 reported cases, and is
conducting inspections on another 24 cases.</P>

      <P>An indigenous children's choir from the central county of Nantou was honored
Thursday  by the county magistrate for having recently won a Golden Melody
Award, a local award sometimes described in Taiwan as the "Taiwan Grammys."</P>
      <P>The Bunun children's choir of the Dongpu Elementary School -- a small school of
just 67 students nestled at the foot of Yushan, Taiwan's highest peak -- won the
award for a CD they produced, led by school principal Ma Pi-teh.</P>
      <P>The 25 choristers, in grades three to six, sang one of the tunes off the CD,
titled Sing It! -- a traditional Bunun tune titled The Welcoming Song -- at a
reception held at Nantou Magistrate Lee Chao-ching's office.</P>
      <P>At the reception, Ma expressed his appreciation to several enterprises  and
individuals,  including  the Teco  Technology Foundation, for their sponsorship
of the choir, which has over the past three years been invited to perform at the
National Music Hall in Taipei, in Bangkok and in the Chinese city of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Ma, himself a member of the Bunun tribe, said the choir was established mainly
to build confidence among the Bunun children.</P>
      <P>Ma, who established the choir and trains the children, said he disagrees with
ignorant and racist voices who claim that "indigenous children have good voices
because they are born to sing, " pointing out that the choir members' heavenly
voices are simply the results of strenuous daily practice and determination.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) unveiled a package  of regulations  Thursday  to
pave the way for local universities that have failed ministry evaluations or are
unable to recruit enough students to gradually exit the education market.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, universities that fail to recruit up to 70 percent of
their officially approved student numbers for three consecutive years will have
their annual quotas cut by 10 percent to 30 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result of the regulations, no local universities will see their student
quotas slashed until the 2011 school year, which critics said will hold back
domestic education reform.</P>
      <P>According to MOE statistics,  enrollment at local tertiary education
institutions fell short of the target by nearly 60,000 in the 2008 school year,
the largest shortfall in five years.</P>
      <P>The average freshman registration rate also fell to a five-year low of 82.98
percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Twenty-four of the 162 universities and technology institutes in Taiwan -- all
24 of which are privately run -- saw their freshmen registration rates fall
short of the 70 percent target in the 2008 school year and one of them even had
a miserable registration rate of just 11.62 percent.</P>
      <P>MOE officials  said the ministry has included the student enrollment rate into a
list of measurement indicators in its tertiary education institutions assessment
system to better reflect the education market situation.</P>
      <P>Under the newly unveiled  university  quantitative  control regulations,
faculty  quality  and quantity,  as well as the faculty/student ratio, will also
be factored in when deciding each school's student enrollment quota.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, media reports said that even though the government's plan to open
Taiwan to Chinese university hopefuls is still in the works, many local private
tertiary education institutions have been preparing to attract Chinese
youngsters to their campuses.</P>
      <P>Because of Taiwan's declining birth rate, the number of local university
students has been dropping steadily. Out of concern that they may not be able to
recruit enough students in the coming years, school authorities have pegged
their hopes on Chinese students as a new source of income.</P>
      <P>Ou Shan-hui, president of the private Tajen University in southern Taiwan's
Pingtung County, was quoted as having said recently that the difficulties
schools face in recruiting enough students could be largely resolved if they can
attract even just 1 percent of the over 10 million Chinese students who vie to
enter Chinese universities annually.</P>
      <P>According to Ou, his school has been forging cooperative ties with various
universities in China since last year. While China has many tertiary education
institutions, Ou said, it lags behind Taiwan in the development of colleges
catering to the needs of the leisure industry.</P>
      <P>"I believe our school's department of recreation and sport management,
department of hospitality and hotel management and department of tourism should
be attractive to Chinese college hopefuls," said Ou.</P>
      <P>Tunghai University in central Taiwan has also stepped up efforts to explore
Chinese students' learning preferences and demand by exchanges students with
several prestigious universities in China, such as Peking University, Fudan
University and Nanjing University.</P>
      <P>The university, founded by Methodist missionaries in Taichung City in 1955, has
also set aside budget for advertising on major Web portals in China to enhance
the school's awareness among Chinese students, a Tunghai official said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official went on, Tunghai will not go into the China market
blind. "We will carefully evaluate the financial status of any Chinese
applicants, as well as their academic qualifications, before recruiting them,"
he added.</P>

      <P>It is conceivable that a Taiwan-China memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  on
financial  supervisory cooperation could be signed this month or next, but it
would be unwise to predict a timetable for such an MOU before negotiations on
the issue have ended, Financial Supervisory Committee (FSC) Chairman Sean C.
Chen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when making a report on the possible impact of Chinese
investment in Taiwan's market at a joint legislative committee meeting attended
by officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) , and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's recent opening of its securities and futures markets to Chinese
qualified domestic institutional investors, those investors cannot invest in
Taiwanese shares until the MOU on financial supervisory cooperation with China
is signed, Chen noted recently.</P>
      <P>Following the signing of a financial cooperation agreement with China during a
third round of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations April 26 in Nanjing, Taiwan's
financial authorities have placed more emphasis  on inking  an MOU with China to
allow for two-way collaboration in the supervision and regulation of the
banking, securities and futures, and insurance sectors.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan and China have no problem with the MOU's content, but
the two required versions of the MOU -- one in the traditional Chinese
characters used in Taiwan and the other in the simplified characters used in
China -- would make matters more complex.</P>
      <P>In response to lawmakers' questions regarding the establishment of a much-
anticipated Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China, MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng said that in line with an MOEA
projection, two sides are expected to start talks on the issue by the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said that "Taiwan and China will not
necessarily sign an ECFA in the second half of this year or the first half of
2010 in their coming rounds of talks, " while answering questions from
legislators at a joint legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lai said she could not give any assurances concerning the issue, although she
noted that the government hopes to start relevant talks with China as quickly as
possible.</P>
      <P>The idea of an ECFA with China has touched a nerve of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , which fears that Taiwan's independent sovereignty
might be hurt by the planned accord.</P>
      <P>The DPP wants the issue to be decided by the people in a referendum and has been
collecting signatures from its supporters in support of its plan. It hopes to
obtain 100,000 signatures by early July.</P>

      <P>The top Russian envoy to Taiwan praised relations between Taipei and Moscow
Thursday,  saying the two countries have close ties not only on the economic and
trade fronts but also in many other fields such as science and technology,
culture and education.</P>
      <P>Sergey N. Gubarev made the remarks at a reception hosted by the Representative
Office of the Moscow-Taipei Coordination Commission on Economic and Cultural
Cooperation Thursday on the eve of Russia's national day.</P>
      <P>"I've already worked here for 3.5 years and in this period I've never met a cold
attitude on the part of Taiwanese, " Gubarev said at the function, which was
attended by Vice Foreign Minister Javier Hou, members of the diplomatic corps
and other dignitaries.</P>
      <P>According to Gubarev, while bilateral trade between Taiwan and Russia reached a
record US$4 billion in 2008, people-to-people exchanges are also vibrant, with
some 300 Taiwanese students in Russia and 200 Russian students in Taiwan, as
well as around 10,000 Taiwanese travelers going to Russia each year.</P>
      <P>Hou said for his part that despite the close economic ties, there is still ample
room for growth in bilateral relations and he expressed pleasure that the
government's "New Zheng He" export promotion plan has set Russia as one of the
countries with which Taiwan aims to boost economic and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>"I'm confident that the already solid foundations and pragmatic approaches in
bilateral relations will allow even greater mutual development and beneficial
growth in the future," Hou added.</P>
      <P>Established in 1992, the representative office is the de facto Russian embassy
in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between Russia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On June 12, 1990, the Russian parliament formally declared its sovereignty from
the Soviet Union, which set the wheels in motion for the creation of what is now
known as the Russian Federation. Russian Day was officially recognized as a
national holiday by former President Boris Yeltsin in 1991.</P>

      <P>After many twists and turns, the Executive Yuan finally passed a draft legal
amendment Thursday that, if approved by the legislature, will cancel the
decades-old income tax exemption for grassroots school teachers and military
personnel.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed the draft amendment to the Income Tax Law at a weekly
Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>If the draft package clears the legislative floor, the amended law will be put
into force at the beginning of next year, Government Information Office Minister
Su Jun-pin said at a news conference held after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Su called on the ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislative Yuan to approve the
draft as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the law revision will affect some 350,000 people, including the
country's active duty military personnel and teachers at day care centers and
kindergartens, as well as at public and private elementary and junior high
schools.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said the
national coffers will receive an estimated NT$16 billion (US$487.8 million) in
increased tax revenues annually as a result of the revisions.</P>
      <P>He added that the increased tax revenues in the first year will all be returned
to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of National Defense for various
projects to improve welfare services for school faculty members and military
personnel.</P>
      <P>In the future, however, the national coffers will gradually benefit from the
annulment of the tax exemption privileges, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Russian envoy gratified with close Taipei-Moscow ties</HEADLINE>

      <P>The top Russian envoy to Taiwan praised relations between Taipei and Moscow
Thursday,  saying the two countries have close ties not only on the economic and
trade fronts but also in many other fields such as science and technology,
culture and education.</P>
      <P>Sergey N. Gubarev made the remarks at a reception hosted by the Representative
Office of the Moscow-Taipei Coordination Commission on Economic and Cultural
Cooperation Thursday on the eve of Russia's national day.</P>
      <P>"I've already worked here for 3.5 years and in this period I've never met a cold
attitude on the part of Taiwanese, " Gubarev said at the function, which was
attended by Vice Foreign Minister Javier Hou, members of the diplomatic corps
and other dignitaries.</P>
      <P>According to Gubarev, while bilateral trade between Taiwan and Russia reached a
record US$4 billion in 2008, people-to-people exchanges are also vibrant, with
some 300 Taiwanese students in Russia and 200 Russian students in Taiwan, as
well as around 10,000 Taiwanese travelers going to Russia each year.</P>
      <P>Hou said for his part that despite the close economic ties, there is still ample
room for growth in bilateral relations and he expressed pleasure that the
government's "New Zheng He" export promotion plan has set Russia as one of the
countries with which Taiwan aims to boost economic and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>"I'm confident that the already solid foundations and pragmatic approaches in
bilateral relations will allow even greater mutual development and beneficial
growth in the future," Hou added.</P>
      <P>Established in 1992, the representative office is the de facto Russian embassy
in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between Russia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On June 12, 1990, the Russian parliament formally declared its sovereignty from
the Soviet Union, which set the wheels in motion for the creation of what is now
known as the Russian Federation. Russian Day was officially recognized as a
national holiday by former President Boris Yeltsin in 1991.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Activist group wants law to legalize sex workers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of a women's rights activist organization  appealed  Friday to the
government  to speed up legislation to legalize workers in the sex trade.</P>
      <P>Wang Fang-ping, secretary-general of the private Je-Je-chuen Compassionate
Concern Association, which fights for the rights of licensed prostitutes, said
her group wants the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)  to draft an amendment to the
Statute of the Maintenance of Social Order and get it passed in two years to
protect the rights of sex workers.</P>
      <P>Wang, flanked by more than 20 supporters of the association, said the MOI has
come up with a plan to allow exclusive sex trade zones to be established around
the country, with local city or county governments sponsoring referendums for
final decisions on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, Wang argued, the plan is just an empty framework lacking details or
coping measures for implementation.</P>
      <P>She called for the MOI to sponsor civic forums in northern, central and southern
Taiwan on government policies on the sex trade and related affairs so that forum
discussions and opinions can be used as references when the government is
drafting the amendment.</P>
      <P>"Sex workers' voices should also be counted," she noted.</P>
      <P>Ho Ming-liao, deputy director of the MOI's Department of Social Affairs, who
acknowledged Wang and her group's appeal, said the ministry will take all points
of view into consideration before coming up with a draft bill, but he declined
to make any commitment to Wang's appeal for a timetable for the legislation and
the content of the draft bill.</P>

      <P>The Public Television Service (PTS) will use the highest transmission standards
ever used in Taiwan to broadcast the July 16-26 World Games in Kaohsiung, PTS
Deputy Executive Director Chung Yu-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>PTS has leased four satellites to transmit the July 16 opening ceremony to
ensure that audiences in five continents can view the games live, Chung said at
a news briefing on details about TV coverage for the games.</P>
      <P>In addition, more than 30 outside broadcast vans equipped with high definition
television (HDTV) cameras will be mobilized, in what Chung described as the
biggest event in TV broadcasting in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>A 20-meter long helium-filled blimp will also fly over the World Games Main
Stadium to film the opening and closing ceremonies, Chung went on, adding that
the airship can stay aloft for four hours at a time.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-bin, who was also present at the
news conference, thanked PTS for its efforts to promote the games and Taiwan to
the world.</P>
      <P>Su also said that through the games, which are expected to attract the
participation of 102 countries, the visibility of Taiwan and Kaohsiung will be
increased.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony will feature singers Hayley Westenra of New Zealand and
Russell Watson of Britain, as well as local pop singers Huang Hisao-hu and Ah
Shin, according to event organizers.</P>
      <P>In addition to PTS, Chunghwa Telecom will deploy more than 500 staff to
broadcast 35 sports from 23 event venues via its Media on Demand (MOD) system,
hiChannel Internet and emome cell phone platforms, the organizers added.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the games, the Kaohsiung city government began Friday to
partially drain Lotus Lake -- the largest lake in the city -- in order to refill
it with better quality water later this month to meet the requirements of the
water sports events.</P>
      <P>At present, the lake is not suitable for water sports because it has been
depleted of oxygen due to a high concentration of algae, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The water skiing, dragon boat racing and canoe polo events will be held on the

      <P>In 2008, nearly one in every 10 people in Taiwan were suffering from diabetes, a
disease that is becoming increasingly prevalent in the country, according to the
results of a study released Friday by the National Health Research Institutes
(NHRI).</P>
      <P>The study found that 9.2 percent of Taiwan's population was affected by the
disease in 2008, up 2.7 percentage points from 2002, when the prevalence rate
was 6.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The disease was more common among men than among women, with the prevalence rate
among men reaching 11.1 percent in 2008, up from 7.5 percent in 2002 and 5.4
percent for the 1993-1996 period, the results show.</P>
      <P>The highest prevalence was found among men aged 65 and older -- registering 28.5
percent in 2008, a sharp rise from 17.6 percent in 2002 and 13.1 percent for the
1993-1996 period.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsin-yi, an associate research fellow at the NHRI's Institute of
Population Health Sciences, noted that the prevalence of diabetes tends to
increase with age, which is true for both men and women.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, diabetes-related treatment now claims the fifth-largest
share of National Health Insurance expenditure and was the fourth-most common
cause of death in Taiwan in 2007, indicating that the disease is becoming an
urgent health concern.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH), meanwhile, advised the public to get regular
health check-ups to facilitate early diagnosis.</P>
      <P>To prevent the disease, people should adopt a diet with a high proportion of
vegetables and whole grains and control their weight within ideal limits, the
DOH said.</P>

      <P>The average ages at first marriage for men and women in 2007 were 31 and 28.1,
respectively, both rising by about two years from the 1991 figures, according to
statistics released Friday by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development.</P>
      <P>The report also shows that the number of people of both genders aged between
15-39 who were married had fallen, with the rate of married male people aged
between 30-34 -- which covers men's age at first marriage -- dropping from 73.2
percent in 1991 to 47.3 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>The rate for women aged between 25-29 -- which covers women's age at first
marriage -- fell from 65.1 percent in 1991 to 31.4 percent in the same year.</P>
      <P>The overall percentage of married men aged over 15 in 2007 was 44.8 percent,
while that of married women aged over 15 was 52.8 percent, according to the
statistics.</P>
      <P>The report did not provide official figures for 2008.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that education, financial independence of both genders,
and changes in societal values have resulted in the rising ages at first
marriage and the falling percentages of married people.</P>
      <P>In addition,  about 148,000 couples got married  in 2008, representing a
marriage rate of 0.65 percent of the population. About 56,000 couples divorced
in the same year, representing a divorce rate of 0.243 percent, according to the

      <P>After seven years of negotiations, Washington has finally approved Taiwan's
application to export fresh longans to the whole of the United States except for
the state of Florida, Taiwan's representative office in the United States said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the Washington-based Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in the United States, Taiwanese fresh longans (Euphoria longana) , after
having been stored for 17 days at temperatures lower than 1 degree Celsius or
for 20 days at under 1.38 degrees Celsius, will be allowed onto the U.S. market
from June 20, one day after U.S. notification detailing quarantine conditions
for such exports from Taiwan takes effect.</P>
      <P>This will make longans the fourth Taiwan-produced fruit eligible to be sold in
the United States after lychees, star fruit and mangoes, said a Taiwanese
official stationed in Washington.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the
Taipei-based Council of Agriculture (COA) referred the application to Washington
in 2002 seeking U.S. export approval.</P>
      <P>The bureau's advanced quarantine techniques has also succeeded in helping
Taiwanese lychees, star fruit, mangoes, oranges, grapes and papayas to break
into the Japanese, U.S., South Korean, New Zealand and Australian markets.</P>

program were men, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said

      <P>However, among the 3,963 approved applications, 1,856 involved workers at
insured companies of fewer than 30 employees, 2,017 involved workers at
companies of more than 30 employees, while employees of state-run enterprises,
government agencies and schools accounted for only 182 cases, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>The subsidy program was designed to encourage both working mothers and working
fathers to share the responsibility of child rearing and to allow both mothers
and fathers to ask for unpaid parental leave for up to two years until their
children reach the age of three, Wang explained.</P>
      <P>Men in the 30-34 age group made up the largest group comprising 454 fathers who
were approved to receive the subsidies, Wang went on.</P>
      <P>The number of applications  for the subsidies was earlier projected by the CLA
at about 30,000 per year, but 9,000 applications have been filed in only about
one month since the program's implementation, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Workers who have paid into the labor insurance program for at least one year and
who take unpaid parental leave under the Gender Equality in Employment Act are
eligible for the monthly subsidies, Wang noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices opened low and closed 1.81 percent lower Friday, a day
after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a swine flu pandemic -- the
first global flu epidemic in 41 years.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, lost 119.14 points to close at
6,448.23.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened at 6,552.58 and fluctuated between 6,586.20 and
6,443.86. A total of 4.74 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of
NT$128.85 billion (US$3.93 billion).</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories lost ground, with banking and financial shares
dropping the most at 2.9 percent. Machinery and electronics shares shed 2.0
percent, construction stocks dropped 1.4 percent, plastics and chemicals stocks
dropped 1.3 percent, cement issues fell 0.8 percent, foodstuff shares fell 0.3
percent, paper and pulp stocks lost 0.2 percent, and textile stocks dropped 0.1
percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,268 to 886,  with 167 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth NT$5.53 billion.</P>
      <P>Following two days of gains, the market could not maintain its momentum after
the WHO raised the swine flu alert level from phase 5 to phase 6 -- the agency's
highest alert level -- which means a pandemic is under way.</P>
      <P>However,  the announcement  pushed  a rise  in shares  of pharmaceutical and
biotechnology issues.</P>
      <P>Foodstuff shares were propped up by a surge in the global prices of oil,
soybeans, wheat and bulk commodities.</P>
      <P>Real estate shares also outperformed the overall market as the property market
has shown recent signs of recovery along with the completion of several public
construction projects, with Huaku Development Corp. and Huang Hsiang
Construction Corp. rising by the maximum daily limit of 7 percent.</P>
      <P>Shihlin Paper Corp., Shihlin Electric and Engineering Corp. and Shinkong Textile
Co. also made strong showings, all surging by more than 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Shares in LED companies were pushed up due to an influx of orders from China and
the bright outlook for the sector.</P>
      <P>A SinoPac Securities analyst said that if the global market does not face
technical resistance in the short term, the TAIEX could hover between 6,650 and

    <TEXT>
      <P>A college student has lost a whopping 17.4 kg over the past six months to
prepare himself for surgery in a race against time to donate part of his liver
to save his father, who is awaiting a transplant.</P>
      <P>The 160 cm college student surnamed Chou, who originally weighed 90 kg, is
expected to reach his ideal weight of 70 kg by the middle of this month, to be
fit to undergo the liver donation procedure.</P>
      <P>Chou said Friday he has been chubby since he was a baby, adding that if it were
not for his excess weight, he would have donated liver to his father more than a
year ago.</P>
      <P>Chou's father was diagnosed with liver disease two years ago and doctors
suggested a transplant.</P>
      <P>However, since compatible liver donors are difficult to find and because time is
running out for the senior Chou, his son decided to do what it takes to make it
possible for him to donate part of his liver to save his father's life.</P>
      <P>Although tests showed that his liver is a match for his father, his weight made
him unfit for surgery, in addition to which, he suffered from fatty liver. A
weight management center at the Taipei Medical University Hospital then stepped
in to plan a weight-loss program for him.</P>
      <P>Center director Wang Wei said that most people seek to lose weight because of
their health or their looks, and that Chou's case was the first of its kind he
has encountered.</P>
      <P>"Chou's determination has moved a lot of my colleagues, " he noted.</P>
      <P>Wang inserted a water balloon in Chou's abdomen last December to reduce the size
of his stomach, and after six months with careful monitoring, his weight had
dropped by 17.4 kg to 72.6 kg.</P>
      <P>During the half-year period, Chou said, he felt discomfort only for the first
four days of living with the balloon in his stomach, suffering initial
queasiness and vomiting but otherwise experiencing no distress.</P>
      <P>Chou said he feels confident that the liver surgery will be a success and that
he is not afraid of the procedure.</P>
      <P>"Donating liver to my father is one way to repay my indebtedness to him," he
said.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) reiterated Friday that the goal of
efforts to keep a global swine flu pandemic from spreading to Taiwan has been
revised from "blocking" entry to the country by the virus to "controlling"
outbreaks.</P>
      <P>DOH Centers for Disease Control Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung said Taiwan needs
to be prepared for a possible community outbreak despite having done well in
stopping the A(H1N1) influenza virus from entering the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far reported 36 confirmed cases, only one of which is indigenous.
No local deaths have been reported.</P>
      <P>The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) held a meeting earlier in the day
that was attended by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, officials from relevant
authorities and experts in epidemic disease control, who discussed  Taiwan's
preparations  after the World  Health Organization (WHO) raised the level of
influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to phase 6, the highest level on the
scale.</P>
      <P>Chang Shan-chwen,  associate  dean of the National  Taiwan University College of
Medicine, noted after the meeting that although the WHO has described the latest
pandemic as being of "moderate severity," the cases in Taiwan have all been mild
and confined.</P>
      <P>What Taiwan needs is to stockpile vaccines and if the vaccine supply cannot meet
demand, prepare sufficient anti-flu medication for possible  severe infections,
Chang said in response to media inquiries.</P>
      <P>Friday's CECC meeting, the 12th of its kind since the center's establishment
April 28, produced six resolutions regarding the WHO pandemic alert, which
include accelerating work to stock up on materials required to stem any
outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The second resolution demands changing the infection monitoring measure from
voluntary reporting by hospitals and local clinics that discover infection cases
to overall detection and monitoring of the virus, while the third requires
medical facilities to reinforce anti-flu preparations and use all their
resources to cure flu patients.</P>
      <P>The CECC meeting also concluded that large-scale international activities such
as the July 16-26 World Games 2009 in Kaohsiung and the Sept. 5-15 Deaflympics
in Taipei, can take place as scheduled, and that the government will draft a
special statute to authorize compensation to those who suffer losses caused by
the pandemic.</P>
      <P>The last CECC resolution calls on the public to cooperate with the government
measures to fight any outbreaks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan announced that the government has
decided to double the amount of A(H1N1) vaccine it plans to buy from overseas
from 2.5 million doses to 5 million doses.</P>
      <P>Yeh admitted that "it is not sure Taiwan will be able to secure all the vaccine
it has ordered, " since all countries around the world want the vaccine too.
However, he promised that people at high risk of contracting the virus, such as
those working in the health care sector, will be first to be vaccinated.</P>
      <P>He revealed that the inoculation program will be launched at the beginning of
autumn.</P>

      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Friday that the cancellation of a
meeting between President Ma Ying-jeou and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
while the two heads of state were in El Salvador earlier this month will not
affect Ma's upcoming state visit to Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>"I can guarantee that here are no hard feelings at all, " Ou said after
presiding over a book donation ceremony to commemorate the late Foreign Minister
Chu Fu-sung that was attended by Ding Mao-shih, former secretary-general of the
National Security Council, as well as various retired diplomats.</P>
      <P>According to Ou, the meeting was canceled simply because the two presidents, who
were in El Salvador to attend the inauguration of President Mauricio Funes, were
unable to find a convenient time to meet. The fact that Ortega's wife invited Ma
and his wife to stay an extra night during his visit in July is a clear sign
that the cancellation did not hurt bilateral relations, said Ou.</P>
      <P>Fresh from a three-leg Central America visit that took him to Belize, Guatemala
and El Salvador, Ma will head for the region again June 29-July 7 to attend the
inauguration of Panama President-elect Ricardo Martinelli and visit two of
Taiwan's other Central American diplomatic allies, Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>Ou said members of the president's travel delegation will include entrepreneurs
such as Chang Yung-fa, founder and chairman of the Evergreen Group, and Eugene
Wu, chairman of Shin Kong Financial Holding Co., Ltd., which have large
investments in Panama and Nicaragua, respectively.</P>
      <P>This is the first time Ma has invited businessmen to join him on a state visit.
Other members of the delegation will include legislators, county magistrates and
cultural groups.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the president's travel plans will be affected by the World Health
Organization's declaration of a swine flu pandemic, Ou said there have been no
changes so far.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former antique trader weathers adversities through scavenging</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/12/09  20:06:38</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Chien-li experienced the most unthinkable mishaps of his life in just 10
years -- his home was destroyed in an earthquake and his antique business ruined
in a subsequent flood. Despite these unfortunate incidents, the unbeaten man is
now rebuilding his career by trash scavenging, in the hopes he will soon be able
to return to his old home.</P>
      <P>"My greatest wish is to go back to the home in the Tunghsing Building," said 42
-year-old Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen had been living in an apartment in the 12-story building since moving to
Taipei City from Taiwan's outlying island Penghu with his parents when he was
16.</P>
      <P>The building stood witness to his entrepreneurship  as an eyeglasses and
antiques dealer, his marriage with his wife and the birth of their first child,
a daughter.</P>
      <P>Many of his belongings and memorabilia, however, were destroyed when a
tremendous earthquake struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999 and crumpled the
building located more than 200 kilometers away from the epicenter.</P>
      <P>Chen's mother and younger brother were among a total of 87 residents killed in
the disaster, while he and his father sustained injuries.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Chen's daughter and his wife, who was expecting their second child,
were safe and unharmed.</P>
      <P>Just when Chen and other surviving residents were still seeking a reconstruction
of their lost homes, a second misfortune happened. In September 2001, a severe
flood caused by Typhoon Nari swamped his temporary residence and eyeglasses
store, destroying all his antique collections.</P>
      <P>Forced to close his business, Chen opted to stay home to take care of his
children and allowed his wife -- who is a nurse -- to assume the role as the
family's sole breadwinner.</P>
      <P>This was also when he began a life scavenging through garbage piles.</P>
      <P>In the beginning, Chen was just looking for furniture or toys dumped by other
households for use by his family. But he later came across many other items
which through the eyes of an antique connoisseur are treasures.</P>
      <P>Among these were a rare Japanese doll, Chinese porcelain wares that were no
longer in production, portraits of the late President Chiang Kai-shek and old-
fashioned liquor bottles of various shapes.</P>
      <P>There were also account books and diaries written by Japanese prisoners during
the Japanese colonial period, pornographic playing cards from the martial law
era, as well as documents, passports and jewelry discarded by veterans who came
from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen began to auction the items online in 2005 -- a business that helps him earn
up to NT$60,000 (US$1,829) a month when sales are brisk.</P>
      <P>Now that he has found a new start for his career, his dream to rebuild his home
remains unfulfilled even though 10 years have passed.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction project of the Tunghsing Building, which only started in 2004
-- four years after the earthquake -- was forced to be suspended in October 2006
as a result of a financial crisis faced by the contractor.</P>
      <P>The project was taken over in August 2008 by another contractor, which again
halted the project two months later after experiencing a similar problem as its
predecessor.</P>
      <P>A third contractor has continued the project since December 2008.</P>
      <P>"Although I'm now living very close to the original site of the Tunghsing
Building, I have not been able to return home all these 10 years. This is my
greatest regret," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The day, however, may not be far away when Chen and other former residents can
finally move into their new homes, given that the reconstruction project is
expected to be completed in August this year.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes his experience in fighting against ill fate will inspire
others facing adversities to "never give up hope."</P>

      <P>The prospects of Taiwan's atemoya making inroads into the Japanese market looks
favorable, as an official from the Japan Association of Travel Agents (JATA) has
promised to promote the fruit, an official of the Taitung County government said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Ho Shih-min, who is in charge of the cultural and tourism affairs of the city
government, said that during a visit to Taitung by members of the JATA in
February, Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-cheng recommended the fruit to the
visitors.</P>
      <P>JATA President Tomoaki Hukuhara liked the taste of the fruit -- sweet and yet
slightly tart -- and before his departure vowed to "make every effort to promote
the fruit so it could make inroads into the Japan market," Ho said.</P>
      <P>During another visit to Taitung earlier this month, Hukuhara learned that the
county produces about 120,000 tons of atemoya annually, and made a commitment to
buy 10,000 tons for export to Japan, according to Ho.</P>
      <P>Although the fruit was not in season at the time, Hukuhara visited the
production region, Ho added.</P>
      <P>The magistrate said the quarantine problems related to the fruit can be overcome
and that he hopes to impress Japanese consumers with the product.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Taitung has been aggressively promoting its atemoya and has
made inroads into the China and Hong Kong markets.</P>
      <P>The atemoya, or Annonax atemoya, is a cross between two tropical fruits -- the
sweetsop (Annona squamosa) and the cherimoya (Annona cherimola) -- which are
both native fruits of the tropical Americas. It is popular in Taiwan where it is
known as the "pineapple sweetsop."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Apart from Shanghai and Shenzhen, Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung City will
soon handle regularly scheduled flights to and from Beijing, an official in
charge of the issue said Friday.</P>
      <P>"After the program of expanding cross-Taiwan Strait flights kicks off in July or
August, the central Taiwan airport will also serve a flight to Beijing each
week, in addition to Shanghai and Shenzhen, " said Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) Director- General Lee Lung-wen at a Legislative Yuan news
conference, as he sought to ease concerns that the central Taiwanese city was
losing out on direct transportation links with China.</P>
      <P>"Talks with Taiwan's carriers on arranging a weekly flight from Taiwan's third
largest city Taichung to Beijing will start next week," Lee said in response to
complaints by legislators from central regions that the city was being left out.</P>
      <P>Some 5 million people, or 21 percent of the country's total population, live in
central Taiwan, but legislators pointed out that it is extremely unfair to local
residents that there are no direct flights between Taichung and destinations in
China after non-stop charter flights were launched in July last year.</P>
      <P>"It is normal that central Taiwan's residents want more flights between
Chingchuankang Airport and a larger number of Chinese destinations," Legislator
Lin Chang-min said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is entitled to operate 135 scheduled flights per week to China
beginning in this summer based on an accord reached in April between the two
sides, the legislators said that Chingchuankang Airport has only been allotted a
total of five flights per week in the program that has yet to begin.</P>
      <P>Lin and other legislators also asked the CAA to improve the airport's runways so
they can accommodate larger airplanes.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lin's requests, Lee said the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) has ironed out a blueprint to build a terminal
for larger airplanes and international flights at the Chingchuankang Airport,
with the aim of serving 1.35 million passengers per year in the short term.</P>
      <P>Under the project, the central government will earmark NT$3.9 billion (US$118.9
million) to build an international terminal at the airport. Construction of the
facility is slated to be completed by 2012.</P>
      <P>The CEPD plans to turn Chingchuankang Airport into a regional hub serving
passenger flights and cross-strait routes. It projects that the airport could
serve at least 3.5 million passengers each year in the long term, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Demand for flights from residents in the Taichung area has steadily risen over
the years. According to CEPD statistics, the airport served a total of 461,575
travelers on international charter flights in 2008, compared with 3,528 in 2004.</P>
      <P>Although Shanghai is the most popular Chinese destination among Taiwanese
carriers, Lee said earlier this week that none had applied to ply the Taichung-
Shanghai route due to the limitations of the runways at the Chingchuankang
Airport, which can only accommodate small planes with a seat capacity of some
100 passengers.</P>
      <P>Lee revealed that the CAA asked Taiwanese carriers, including China Airlines,
EVA Airways and Trans Asia Airways, all of which fly to Shanghai from either
Taipei or Kaohsiung, to offer one flight per week each from Chingchuankang
Airport to Shanghai.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu on Friday inspected the facilities for the rock-
climbing events in the July 16-26 World Games in Kaohsiung, as the countdown to
the opening reached 33 days.</P>
      <P>Braving the rain that persisted during the inspection tour, Chen cheered  on a
number of athletes  who were training  at the rock-climbing venue at Kaohsiung
Municipal Shou Shan Junior High School.</P>
      <P>She expressed satisfaction with the facilities, saying that the heavy rain that
day served as a test of the rock-climbing area and equipment, and that they met
the requirements for the upcoming competition.</P>
      <P>The rock-climbing facilities at the school were expanded and refurbished after
the International Federation of Sport Climbing selected the campus as the venue
for the rock-climbing events, according to the World Games 2009 Kaohsiung
Organizing Committee (KOC).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as the KOC moved into the final stages of preparations for the games,
it warned people against scalping tickets for the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>The 30,000 tickets that were available for the opening ceremony sold like hot
cakes when they were released and people are now looking online for scalped
tickets, the KOC said.</P>
      <P>In April, the KOC began sales of the total 350,000 tickets available for the
opening and closing ceremonies and the sports events, but only those for the
opening ceremony have sold out, according to a KOC official.</P>
      <P>As the opening date draws near, some sports fans who did not manage to obtain
tickets for the July 16 opening ceremony are becoming frantic and are trying to
buy scalped tickets online, the official said. Tickets are being resold on the
Internet at 1.5 times the original price, the official added.</P>
      <P>Citing a complaint lodged with the city government, the official said that a
NT$600 ticket for the opening had been resold for NT$900.</P>
      <P>The KOC warned that anyone found reselling World Games tickets could face
penalties, and advised the public not to buy tickets from scalpers.</P>
      <P>People who did not get tickets for the opening ceremony can watch it live on TV,

      <P>The police said that over the past two years Hu had been selling banned pitcher
plants, which he advertised as a "living art, at a price of between NT$200 and
NT$5,000 each, depending on the variety.</P>
      <P>The police estimated that Hu had sold more than 200 plants, netting around NT$1
million.</P>
      <P>In the raid Friday, the police seized around 100 pitcher plants, the report
stated.</P>
      <P>Under the Plant Protection and Quarantine Act, people who import banned plants
could face a penalty of up to three years in prison and a fine up to NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>There is no blanket ban on the importation of pitcher plants to Taiwan,  but
they are not allowed in if they originated  in nematode-affected regions such as
Australia, several states of the United States, Malaysia or Thailand, the report
stated.</P>
      <P>The burrowing nematode is a pest that can devastate banana and citrus crops and
can also affect coconut, avocado, coffee and sugarcane plantations as well as
several types of grasses and ornamental plants.</P>
      <P>The nematode causes a lesion on the plant's root, which develops into a canker,
and the plant suffers from malnutrition while the parasite completes its life
cycle within the root.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Less than half of local people exercise daily: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Less than half of respondents to a recent survey on the lifestyles of health and
sustainability (LOHAS) said that they exercise daily, according to pollsters
Friday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of randomly chosen citizens over the age of 15 was conducted
by Shih Hsin University to explore local people's awareness of and attitude
toward the LOHAS lifestyles.</P>
      <P>The results showed while 59.2 percent of those interviewed recognized the
importance of daily exercise to the LOHAS lifestyles, only 45 percent said they
had been following that regimen.</P>
      <P>On the importance of LOHAS, the respondents gave it an average score of 7.2 on a
1-to-10-point scale, with those in the age group 45-64 and residing in rural
counties of Yilan, Hualien and Taitung and the outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu giving the highest score of 7.6 points.</P>
      <P>The average score given by all respondents to the compatibility of LOHAS with
their own lifestyles was 5.7 points. Among them, those aged over 55, residing in
Yilan, Hualien, Taitung, Kinmen and Matsu and with an average monthly income of
over NT$50,000 had the highest score of 6.1 points. In comparison, central
Taiwan residents aged between 25 and 34 had the lowest score of 5.4 points.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, Lee Yi-tien, a polling manager at Shih Hsin's
opinion survey center, said the gap between the 7.2 points given by respondents
to the importance of healthy lifestyles and the 5.7 points for their actual
lifestyles reflects that there is still ample room for local people to improve
their lifestyles.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 59.2 percent said regular exercise is most important to
the LOHAS lifestyles, compared to 28.1 percent who cited eating organic and
natural health foods and 19.5 percent who mentioned purchasing energy-saving
products, cycling and backpacking as the most important ways to love themselves
and the Earth.</P>
      <P>The survey collected 1,189 valid samples, and had a confidence level of 95
percent and a margin of error of 2.84 percent.</P>

      <P>The Atomic Energy Council (AEC) said Friday that a fire at the third nuclear
power plant in Hengchun in southern Taiwan earlier in the day did not cause any
radioactive leaks.</P>
      <P>The two nuclear reactors at the plant have been running as usual, AEC officials
said in an attempt to allay public concerns.</P>
      <P>The fire started on a transformer, triggering the automatic fire fighting system
at the plant and alerting fire fighting personnel who put out the blaze within
30 minutes, the AEC said.</P>
      <P>The fire ranked zero on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), which
means that there were no radioactive or safety concerns, the state-run Taiwan

    <TEXT>
      <P>The threat of a possible water shortage in the southern areas of the country is
dissipating, thanks to the wet fronts that have moved into the south of the
island in recent days, a spokesman for the Taiwan Water Corp. (TWC) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>With the recent monsoon rains in southern Taiwan's Tainan area, the Nanhua
Reservoir was able to collect about 1.2 million metric tons of water Thursday
alone, the official said.</P>
      <P>Before the beginning of last week, southern Taiwan had had scant rainfall this
year, which prompted concerns over the impact on rice plantation and domestic
water supplies.</P>
      <P>However, according to the spokesman, the situation has since eased.</P>
      <P>"The threat of a looming water shortage will dissipate once the reservoir
collects more water during the coming typhoon season, before the dry season
begins again at the end of the year," he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, the Nanhua Reservoir, which supplies water to the Tainan and
Kaohsiung areas, contains 40 million metric tons of water -- 10 million metric
tons less than the volume at the same time last -- despite lower demand from the
nearby South Taiwan Science Park.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Zoo launched a campaign Thursday to solicit entries for naming its
five-month-old Formosan black bear male cub, as part of its efforts to raise
public awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation.</P>
      <P>The cub was bred under a cooperative project between the city zoo and Lee Teng-

Formosan black bears, said Taipei Zoo Director Jason Yeh.</P>
      <P>The zoo struck the cooperation deal with Lee in February 2007 and the male cub
was born last December -- the first of the protected species to be bred through
a cooperative effort by the public and private sectors, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Formosan black bear has a very low reproduction rate, Yeh said
the zoo hopes to enhance local people's awareness of this rare endemic species'

      <P>According to Yeh, Taiwan now has 32 Formosan black bears living in captivity. In
recent years, he said, there have been incremental technical advances in the
efforts to breed the species in captivity.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yeh said, basic biological data about the species remains limited.
Against this backdrop,  documentation of the five-month-old cub's growth is

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pharmacists working in Taiwan hospitals tend to have too heavy a workload, which
leaves them little time to advise patients, according to the results of a survey
released Saturday by the Taiwan Healthcare Reform Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted from Jan. 19-21 at 20 medical centers around Taiwan, found
that, on average, the pharmacists served 450 patients per day during the three-
day period leading up to the Lunar New Year holiday this year.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that more than one quarter of pharmacists are so busy that
they cannot provide any verbal information to patients.</P>
      <P>Among those who could do so, 80 percent only spoke if the patients asked them
questions, with the conversations averaging just 35 seconds, the results showed.</P>
      <P>Also, 6.3 percent of pharmacists do not verify the identities of patients before
distributing medicines to them, which could increase the chances of mistakes,
the poll found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, approximately 60 percent of the patients surveyed thought that
pharmacists should explain to them matters such as possible side effects of the
medicines and whether there is likely to be any interaction with other drugs or
food. However, only about one quarter of pharmacists offer such information
verbally to patients, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Kao Yea-huei, an associate professor at National Cheng Kung University's
Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, estimated that it takes at least 7 minutes and
32 seconds for a pharmacist to fill a single prescription and that it would take
another two minutes and nine seconds to give verbal instructions on use of the
drugs.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the maximum number of prescriptions handled by each pharmacist should
be 64 per day, Kao suggested.</P>
      <P>However, a Department of Health estimate in 2004 showed that on average,
pharmacists in Taiwan completed one prescription in 2.9 minutes, with each
pharmacist handling up to 165 prescriptions per day.</P>
      <P>The number was significantly higher than the maximum limit of 30 prescriptions
per day set by the United States and 40 set by Japan, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance currently sets a limit of 100
prescriptions per day.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, hospitals in Taiwan have not paid attention to the
quality of service provided by their pharmacists because this aspect is not part
of the evaluation criteria for hospitals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several international relations scholars from National Chengchi University
(NCCU) said Saturday that instead of seeking to join the United Nations, Taiwan
should focus on applying for entry to U.N.-related agencies and programs that
are more in line with the country's substantive interests.</P>
      <P>Teng Chung-chian, director of NCCU's Center for International Negotiation, and
Yen Chen-shen, chairman of the NCCU Institute of International Relations
America-Europe Division, made the remarks in a forum that discussed President Ma
Ying-jeou's pursuit of a "diplomatic  truce" with China and Taiwan's  foreign
relations strategies.</P>
      <P>"We don't have to participate in the U.N. Instead, we should try to tap into
other U.N. organizations, based on the World Health Assembly (WHA) model, " Teng
contended,  referring to Taiwan's participation in this year's WHA as an
observer under the designation "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>"We should weave our way through, given all the advantages we have, which can be
used for expanding Taiwan's international space, " he added.</P>
      <P>The frosty relations between Taiwan and China have been thawing since Ma took
office in May 2008, and his proposed "diplomatic truce" is aimed at ending the
longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war between the two sides over allies.</P>
      <P>Ma is also touting the strategy of "modus vivendi" or "flexible diplomacy" to
leverage greater international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The WHA's invitation to Taiwan this year to attend for the first time as an
observer, after 12 failed attempts by the country to do so, is widely viewed as
a measure of the success of Ma's policies and his administration's engagement
with China.</P>
      <P>Yen said at the forum that the "Chinese Taipei" designation used in the WHA may
be the best possible common ground that Taiwan and China  can find on the issue
of Taiwan's  participation  in international agencies. Taiwan should use that
model and set its priorities  straight  on the question  of which  international
organizations it wants to join, he suggested.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, it might be possible for Taiwan to participate in U.N.
specialized agencies, funds and programs such as the International Labor
Organization; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization;
U.N. Environment Programme; U.N. Children's Fund; International Atomic Energy
Agency; United Nations Institute for Training and Research; and the Office of
the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights.</P>
      <P>He said that public hearings  should  be held,  with the participation of
relevant social groups and experts, to determine which organizations should be
given priority in Taiwan's efforts to expand its international space.</P>
      <P>Also, Yeh went on, Taiwan must file its applications before going to the
negotiation table with Beijing.</P>
      <P>"We should not naively believe that China will just let us participate in those
organizations," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>As to how long the flexible diplomacy strategy will work, Yen said that the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is a key factor, as Beijing is
likely to make certain concessions for fear that the Taiwan-centric DPP might
return to power.</P>
      <P>Cheng Tuan-yao, director of NCCU's Institute of International Relations, said
that stable cross-Taiwan Strait relations are the pillar on which Ma's "flexible
diplomacy" rests.</P>
      <P>"Our government should maintain effective communication with Beijing. At the
moment, there is only indirect communication and some goodwill, and there is
lack of mutual trust between the two sides, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He contended that in order to put Taiwan's diplomatic efforts on the right
track, the country should continue to seek a "balance point with China,"
consensus with the opposition, and the support of major international countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New marriages up 12% in 2008 ahead of 'lonely phoenix year'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
06/13/09  17:20:51
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of new marriages recorded in 2008 was 12.57 percent higher than in
the previous year -- a sudden surge related to the superstition that 2009 is an
inauspicious year for marriage, according to a report released Saturday by the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>The report showed that a total of 148,425 couples tied the knot in 2008, an
increase of 16,574 from 2007.</P>
      <P>The MOI attributed the jump to a trend in which many lovers chose to get married
early because they wanted to avoid doing so in 2009 -- which is believed to be a
"ku luan nien," or "lonely phoenix year."</P>
      <P>The superstition that the chances of losing one's partner are higher in certain
years, including 2009, originated in Japan. A "lonely phoenix year" is usually
one in which there are two "li chun," or Beginnings of Spring -- one of the 24
seasonal periods in a lunar year.</P>
      <P>As "spring" is metaphoric of romance in the Chinese language, the appearance of
two "springs" in a lunar year is believed to be unfavorable to the longevity of
marriages.</P>
      <P>A "lonely phoenix year" can come every four to five years. The last such year
was in 2004.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI report, 85.43 percent of men who got married in 2008 were
first-time grooms and 87.41 percent of women were first-time brides.</P>
      <P>The average age of the first-time husbands was 31.1, while for the first-time
brides it was 28.4, an increase of 0.1 years and 0.3 years, respectively, from
2007.</P>
      <P>Of all the new marriages recorded last year, 14.49 percent involved one foreign
spouse or one from China, Hong Kong or Macau, the report stated.</P>

      <P>The performance of Taiwan's integrated circuit (IC) sector is expected to
improve in the second half of this year, thanks to increased demand for
electronic products in China, the Topology Research Institute (TRI) forecast
Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the TRI, the IC sector will benefit from China's economic stimulus
measures that encourage home appliance purchases by rural consumers and a
growing market in China for "shan zhai" or "bandit" products -- copies of
branded electronic items sold at low prices.</P>
      <P>The sector's recovery will also be helped by strong demand for touch-screen
products and 3G mobile phones, the TRI said.</P>
      <P>However, the overall 2009 performance of the IC sector -- covering design,
manufacturing, packaging and testing -- will still be below par compared to
2008, due to the lingering impact of the global economic downturn, the TRI
forecast.</P>
      <P>The total output of the sector is expected to amount to 1.15 trillion in 2009, a
decline of 14.41 percent from last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar from a top local university warned Saturday that the government should
not entertain the idea of China setting up representative offices in the
countries that are Taiwan's diplomatic allies because Beijing might overshadow
Taipei, given China's economic and trade advantages.</P>
      <P>Yen Chen-shen, chairman of Institute of International Relations America-Europe
Division, National Chengchi University (NCCU) , made the remarks at a forum held
by NCCU to discuss President Ma Ying-jeou's pursuit of a "diplomatic truce" with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma is proposing that the two sides end their longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war
over allies. He has also said that Taiwan is not opposed to its diplomatic
allies developing economic or trade relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, Yen warned that if China sets up representative offices in countries
that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan and starts building substantial links
with them, it could overshadow Taiwan and thus cause confusion, given the larger
numbers of Chinese expatriates in those countries and China's economic clout.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA's) recent decision to
close five of its overseas representative offices, Yen said it was justified,
but suggested that the MOFA also identify potential new locations to set up
offices.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration Taiwan's strategic plans and energy needs, the
government should try to develop substantial relations with countries such as
Iran and Kazakhstan, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana and set up offices there, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said June 6 that in an effort to put the
country's diplomatic resources to better use, the government will close down
five underutilized overseas offices in the coming months, including its
representative offices in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Bangladesh, its consulate-
general offices in Colon, Panama, and its liaison office in Johannesburg, South
Africa.</P>
      <P>The reasons Ou listed for the closures included a perception of unfriendliness
of some of the countries toward Taiwan and the existence of more than one office
within close proximity of each other.</P>
      <P>However, Chiu Kun-shuan, director of NCCU's Graduate Institute of East Asian
Studies, said that the closure of the Venezuela and Bangladesh offices might
also be viewed as "a favor done at little cost" to demonstrate Taiwan's goodwill
toward China, as those two countries are of great strategic importance because
of their energy resources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has 121 offices in countries around the world, a number that Ou
said was too high in relation to the size of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng Tuan-yao, director of NCCU's Institute of International Relations, said at
the forum that Taiwan should carefully evaluate its decisions regarding
representative offices so that any expansion would not be mistaken by Beijing as
an offensive.</P>

      <P>Japan's professional Go scene is now dominated by players from Taiwan, with Cho
U and Hsieh Yi Min jointly holding seven of the 10 most prestigious titles in
the Japanese male and female professional Go competitions.</P>
      <P>Cho, 29, holds five of the seven major titles in Japan's male Go ranks, while 19
-year-old Hsieh controls two of the three principal titles on the women's scene.</P>
      <P>Impressed by the pair's extraordinary achievements in the subtle Oriental board
game known as "wei-chi" in Taiwan, Hideo Otake, president of the Japan Go
Association, better known as Nihon Ki-in in Japan, said Friday that Taiwanese Go
players are amazing.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese Go players are really outstanding... What are Japanese players doing?
They should step up," Otake said in a speech delivered during a ceremony at
which Cho was given the Judan crown, the fifth title he has won so far this
year, and Hsieh was awarded the women's Meijin crown, her second this year.</P>
      <P>Cho, who went to Japan at the tender age of 10 to pursue a Go career, now also
holds four other major titles -- Meijin, Tengen, Oza and Gosei.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, an emerging star on Japan's female Go scene, is also the women's Honinbo
title holder.</P>
      <P>Addressing the crowning ceremony, Cho said he is gratified at setting a new
record with his capture of five coveted titles.</P>
      <P>"I take pride in my accomplishments. This time, the Judan competition drew a lot
of attention. I was lucky to be able to live up to my usual standards, but there
is still ample room for improvement," a jubilant Cho said.</P>
      <P>For her part, Hsieh said she has been yearning to excel in major international
Go competitions. "But this dream has not yet been realized. I'll redouble my
efforts to score more wins in prestigious world games," the Go prodigy said
modestly.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the Sankei Shimbun economic daily presented the male
Judan and women's Honinbo titles simultaneously, which allowed the two
outstanding Taiwanese Go players to receive their career laurels on the same
stage.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to Japan, John Feng, was invited to attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Speaking in fluent Japanese, Feng said that his first public speech in Japanese
after he assumed his post last autumn was at a ceremony honoring Cho for his
career achievements.</P>
      <P>"With Cho and Hsieh continuing to capture titles in the Go arena, I have since
attended many similar crowning ceremonies, which has given me a chance to
improve my Japanese," he said jokingly.</P>

      <P>Germany has presented one of its famous Buddy bears to a senior high school in
southern Taiwan as part of its efforts to promote its ideal of "living together
in peace and harmony on the Earth".</P>
      <P>Fengshan Senior High School in Kaohsiung County's Fengshan City hosted a
ceremony Saturday to celebrate its receipt of Germany's trademark fiberglass
Buddy bear.</P>
      <P>Many dignitaries, including Birgitt Ory, director-general of the German
Institute in Taipei which represents German interests in Taiwan in the absence
of diplomatic ties, and Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing attended the Buddy
bear donation ceremony.</P>
      <P>Since the Buddy bear was delivered four days ago, Hung Chun-yuan, a fine arts
teacher at the school, has been leading a group of students to paint it. Four
students from the German School in Taipei also joined the efforts Saturday to
paint the bear in acrylic colors.</P>
      <P>The painting project is scheduled to be completed Sunday and the bear will then
be sent to Germany's representative office in Taipei where a formal inauguration
ceremony will be held June 27 to mark the Buddy bear's arrival on a Taiwan
school campus.</P>
      <P>Yang said he welcomes the gift of a Buddy bear to help promote student and
cultural exchanges between his county and Germany.</P>
      <P>"The Buddy bear will certainly inspire more interaction and cooperation between
our two countries and help expand local students' international perspectives and
vision," Yang said.</P>
      <P>The Buddy bear, a "hybrid" of Taiwan's endemic Formosan black bear and Germany's
indigenous Brown bear, will be taken to two major international sports events to
be held in Taiwan later this year -- the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung City and
the 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The German Institute in Taipei has launched a campaign to solicit entries for
naming the Buddy bear. Prospective participants should mail their entries before
Oct.3, it said.</P>
      <P>Germany has presented a total of 1,300 Buddy bears to countries around the world
and one at the Fengshan school has been given the serial number "1289."</P>
      <P>The German Institute in Taipei has forged partnerships with five Taiwan schools,
one of which is Fengshan Senior High School. Twelve German students were at the
Fengshan school on a study tour in May, and 12 students from the school are
scheduled to visit Germany for two weeks later this year.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) said Saturday that the travel time
between Taipei and Taitung will be greatly reduced when the railway section
between Hualien and Taitung goes electric in five years time.</P>
      <P>"When that happens, the travel time between Taitung and Taipei will be cut to
four hours from the current seven-plus hours, " said Chang Chien-li, deputy head

      <P>"It will also greatly reduce the time it takes to travel between urban and rural

      <P>The segment of railway between Taipei and Hualien is electric, but all trains on
the Hualien-Taitung section have to switch to non-electric locomotives to be
able to enter the Taitung station.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that in order to meet weekend visitor demand, the TRA will
add two Chukuang-class express trains to its service on weekends, starting June
16.</P>
      <P>The TRA will also step up its cooperation with local tourism promotion efforts,

      <P>Ma made the remarks after visiting an exhibition hall at Far East University of
Science and Technology in southern Taiwan's Tainan County where Chen is holding
her second solo exhibition.</P>
      <P>On display are 80-plus oil paintings by the 26-year-old artist who suffered
brain damage at the age of 3, due to injuries sustained in a traffic accident.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was fascinated by Chen's colorful cubist paintings, which he said
reflect her love for life and her feelings and insight with regard to day-to-day
affairs.</P>
      <P>In a brief encounter with Chen at the exhibition hall, Ma expressed his
admiration for her perseverance in overcoming her disabilities and pursuing
excellence in the art world.</P>
      <P>Ma also encouraged Chen to continue her art career to make her life as colorful
as her paintings.</P>
      <P>As Chen had difficulty memorizing and could not speak normally, she had a hard
time learning and communicating with others. She informed her family of her
daily needs by drawing.</P>
      <P>Her major breakthrough in life came seven years ago when Chao Si-chiang, a
professor at Far East University of Science and Technology, discovered Chen's
artistic talent and began to teach her to paint, free of cost.</P>
      <P>Since then, Chen has not stopped painting and she held her first-ever solo

      <P>This time around, the exhibition will tour major cities in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should not agree to China offices in allied nations: scholar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13 (CNA)
06/13/09  19:25:10
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar from a top local university warned Saturday that the government should
not entertain the idea of China setting up representative offices in the
countries that are Taiwan's diplomatic allies because Beijing might overshadow
Taipei, given China's economic and trade advantages.</P>
      <P>Yen Chen-shen, chairman of Institute of International Relations America-Europe
Division, National Chengchi University (NCCU) , made the remarks at a forum held
by NCCU to discuss President Ma Ying-jeou's pursuit of a "diplomatic truce" with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma is proposing that the two sides end their longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war
over allies. He has also said that Taiwan is not opposed to its diplomatic
allies developing economic or trade relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, Yen warned that if China sets up representative offices in countries
that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan and starts building substantial links
with them, it could overshadow Taiwan and thus cause confusion, given the larger
numbers of Chinese expatriates in those countries and China's economic clout.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA's) recent decision to
close five of its overseas representative offices, Yen said it was justified,
but suggested that the MOFA also identify potential new locations to set up
offices.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration Taiwan's strategic plans and energy needs, the
government should try to develop substantial relations with countries such as
Iran and Kazakhstan, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana and set up offices there, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said June 6 that in an effort to put the
country's diplomatic resources to better use, the government will close down
five underutilized overseas offices in the coming months, including its
representative offices in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Bangladesh, its consulate-
general offices in Colon, Panama, and its liaison office in Johannesburg, South
Africa.</P>
      <P>The reasons Ou listed for the closures included a perception of unfriendliness
of some of the countries toward Taiwan and the existence of more than one office
within close proximity of each other.</P>
      <P>However, Chiu Kun-shuan, director of NCCU's Graduate Institute of East Asian
Studies, said that the closure of the Venezuela and Bangladesh offices might
also be viewed as "a favor done at little cost" to demonstrate Taiwan's goodwill
toward China, as those two countries are of great strategic importance because
of their energy resources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has 121 offices in countries around the world, a number that Ou
said was too high in relation to the size of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng Tuan-yao, director of NCCU's Institute of International Relations, said at
the forum that Taiwan should carefully evaluate its decisions regarding
representative offices so that any expansion would not be mistaken by Beijing as
an offensive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese players dominate Japanese Go world</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's professional Go scene is now dominated by players from Taiwan, with Cho
U and Hsieh Yi Min jointly holding seven of the 10 most prestigious titles in
the Japanese male and female professional Go competitions.</P>
      <P>Cho, 29, holds five of the seven major titles in Japan's male Go ranks, while 19
-year-old Hsieh controls two of the three principal titles on the women's scene.</P>
      <P>Impressed by the pair's extraordinary achievements in the subtle Oriental board
game known as "wei-chi" in Taiwan, Hideo Otake, president of the Japan Go
Association, better known as Nihon Ki-in in Japan, said Friday that Taiwanese Go
players are amazing.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese Go players are really outstanding... What are Japanese players doing?
They should step up," Otake said in a speech delivered during a ceremony at
which Cho was given the Judan crown, the fifth title he has won so far this
year, and Hsieh was awarded the women's Meijin crown, her second this year.</P>
      <P>Cho, who went to Japan at the tender age of 10 to pursue a Go career, now also
holds four other major titles -- Meijin, Tengen, Oza and Gosei.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, an emerging star on Japan's female Go scene, is also the women's Honinbo
title holder.</P>
      <P>Addressing the crowning ceremony, Cho said he is gratified at setting a new
record with his capture of five coveted titles.</P>
      <P>"I take pride in my accomplishments. This time, the Judan competition drew a lot
of attention. I was lucky to be able to live up to my usual standards, but there
is still ample room for improvement," a jubilant Cho said.</P>
      <P>For her part, Hsieh said she has been yearning to excel in major international
Go competitions. "But this dream has not yet been realized. I'll redouble my
efforts to score more wins in prestigious world games," the Go prodigy said
modestly.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the Sankei Shimbun economic daily presented the male
Judan and women's Honinbo titles simultaneously, which allowed the two
outstanding Taiwanese Go players to receive their career laurels on the same
stage.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to Japan, John Feng, was invited to attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Speaking in fluent Japanese, Feng said that his first public speech in Japanese
after he assumed his post last autumn was at a ceremony honoring Cho for his
career achievements.</P>
      <P>"With Cho and Hsieh continuing to capture titles in the Go arena, I have since
attended many similar crowning ceremonies, which has given me a chance to
improve my Japanese," he said jokingly.</P>

      <P>The Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC) reported seven new swine flu cases
Saturday, bringing to 44 the total number of influenza A (H1N1) infections
recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"All seven new cases were infected during tours of Thailand," CECC spokesman
Shih Wen-yi said.</P>
      <P>He advised travelers to Thailand to refrain from going to crowded indoor places
such as pubs, and to stick instead to outdoor activities to avoid the risk of
A(H1N1) infection.</P>
      <P>Among the seven new cases, three were male students who went to Thailand on
graduation trips, while the other four were members of tour groups from Taiwan
to the Southeastern Asian country, he said.</P>
      <P>Shih said the seven patients are now in quarantine and are being treated.
Individuals who had come into close contact with the patients have been asked to
monitor their own condition, even if they have no flu-like symptoms, he added.</P>
      <P>Data from the World Health Organization shows that as of June 12, 74 countries
had officially reported 29,669 cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection, including
145 deaths.</P>

    <HEADLINE>German Buddy bear enters Taiwan high school campus</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Germany has presented one of its famous Buddy bears to a senior high school in
southern Taiwan as part of its efforts to promote its ideal of "living together
in peace and harmony on the Earth".</P>
      <P>Fengshan Senior High School in Kaohsiung County's Fengshan City hosted a
ceremony Saturday to celebrate its receipt of Germany's trademark fiberglass
Buddy bear.</P>
      <P>Many dignitaries, including Birgitt Ory, director-general of the German
Institute in Taipei which represents German interests in Taiwan in the absence
of diplomatic ties, and Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing attended the Buddy
bear donation ceremony.</P>
      <P>Since the Buddy bear was delivered four days ago, Hung Chun-yuan, a fine arts
teacher at the school, has been leading a group of students to paint it. Four
students from the German School in Taipei also joined the efforts Saturday to
paint the bear in acrylic colors.</P>
      <P>The painting project is scheduled to be completed Sunday and the bear will then
be sent to Germany's representative office in Taipei where a formal inauguration
ceremony will be held June 27 to mark the Buddy bear's arrival on a Taiwan
school campus.</P>
      <P>Yang said he welcomes the gift of a Buddy bear to help promote student and
cultural exchanges between his county and Germany.</P>
      <P>"The Buddy bear will certainly inspire more interaction and cooperation between
our two countries and help expand local students' international perspectives and
vision," Yang said.</P>
      <P>The Buddy bear, a "hybrid" of Taiwan's endemic Formosan black bear and Germany's
indigenous Brown bear, will be taken to two major international sports events to
be held in Taiwan later this year -- the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung City and
the 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The German Institute in Taipei has launched a campaign to solicit entries for
naming the Buddy bear. Prospective participants should mail their entries before
Oct.3, it said.</P>
      <P>Germany has presented a total of 1,300 Buddy bears to countries around the world
and one at the Fengshan school has been given the serial number "1289."</P>
      <P>The German Institute in Taipei has forged partnerships with five Taiwan schools,
one of which is Fengshan Senior High School. Twelve German students were at the
Fengshan school on a study tour in May, and 12 students from the school are
scheduled to visit Germany for two weeks later this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) said Saturday that the travel time
between Taipei and Taitung will be greatly reduced when the railway section
between Hualien and Taitung goes electric in five years time.</P>
      <P>"When that happens, the travel time between Taitung and Taipei will be cut to
four hours from the current seven-plus hours, " said Chang Chien-li, deputy head
of TRA's Hualien Transportation Section.</P>
      <P>"It will also greatly reduce the time it takes to travel between urban and rural
areas," Chang added.</P>
      <P>The segment of railway between Taipei and Hualien is electric, but all trains on
the Hualien-Taitung section have to switch to non-electric locomotives to be
able to enter the Taitung station.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that in order to meet weekend visitor demand, the TRA will
add two Chukuang-class express trains to its service on weekends, starting June
16.</P>
      <P>The TRA will also step up its cooperation with local tourism promotion efforts,
he added.</P>
      <P>For example, 13 flagship bicycle rental booths will be set up at train stations
along eastern Taiwan from Yilan to Taitung, in tandem with the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications' efforts to combine and promote bicycle and
train tourism, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Disabled artist holds solo exhibition of paintings</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday he was impressed and moved by the amazing
paintings by Chen Tzi-jung, a mentally challenged artist, and described them as
full of feeling and imagination.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after visiting an exhibition hall at Far East University of
Science and Technology in southern Taiwan's Tainan County where Chen is holding
her second solo exhibition.</P>
      <P>On display are 80-plus oil paintings by the 26-year-old artist who suffered
brain damage at the age of 3, due to injuries sustained in a traffic accident.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was fascinated by Chen's colorful cubist paintings, which he said
reflect her love for life and her feelings and insight with regard to day-to-day
affairs.</P>
      <P>In a brief encounter with Chen at the exhibition hall, Ma expressed his
admiration for her perseverance in overcoming her disabilities and pursuing
excellence in the art world.</P>
      <P>Ma also encouraged Chen to continue her art career to make her life as colorful
as her paintings.</P>
      <P>As Chen had difficulty memorizing and could not speak normally, she had a hard
time learning and communicating with others. She informed her family of her
daily needs by drawing.</P>
      <P>Her major breakthrough in life came seven years ago when Chao Si-chiang, a
professor at Far East University of Science and Technology, discovered Chen's
artistic talent and began to teach her to paint, free of cost.</P>
      <P>Since then, Chen has not stopped painting and she held her first-ever solo
painting exhibition last year.</P>
      <P>This time around, the exhibition will tour major cities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chao said Chen has expressed her understanding,  feelings, imagination and
insight with respect to her environment. "She also aspires to bring joy and
happiness to others," Chao added.</P>

      <P>"In our society,  many people,  including  some government officials, who have
rich professional knowledge, lack common sense and a deep understanding of
social problems," Liu lamented.</P>
      <P>Liu encouraged all new graduates to tackle adversities they may face after

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has recently acted to strengthen its economic and trade cooperation with
Myanmar as part of its efforts to seek closer ties with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), an expanding regional economic bloc.</P>
      <P>A memorandum of understanding (MOU) on mutual cooperation between the quasi-
official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and the Union of
Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) was signed in
Yangon last week, according to a TAITRA statement.</P>
      <P>UMFCCI Vice Chairman Zaw Min Win said during the signing ceremony that he
welcomed Taiwanese investment in his country of 57 million people, which he
described as having a sizable domestic market.</P>
      <P>He also said Myanmar was a key player in regional economic integration in the
Mekong River Basin, Bay of Bengal and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>According to the TAITRA statement, a TAITRA-organized trade promotion delegation
visited Myanmar and Cambodia last week to study the local economic and
investment climate.</P>
      <P>The group was composed of representatives of manufacturers of textile materials,
garments, shoes, machines, electronic appliances, plastic and rubber goods,
automobile parts and components, and cosmetics, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The UMFCCI arranged a trade presentation in Yangon for the delegation to attract
local buyers, TAITRA said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$93.7 million worth of goods to Myanmar in 2008, 33.6 percent
higher than in 2007, according to TAITRA.</P>
      <P>With Myanmar's manufacturing sector underdeveloped, it has relied heavily on
imports to satisfy its citizens' daily needs, and TAITRA suggested it was an
ideal place to open labor-intensive production lines because workers are paid
only US$30 to US$50 a month on average.</P>
      <P>In addition, TAITRA sees Myanmar as a place suitable for the development of the
energy industry and of other businesses such as precious stone processing,
farming and fish breeding due to its abundant natural resources.</P>
      <P>Myanmar has one of the world's worst human rights records and the United States
imposed economic sanctions on the country beginning in 2004.</P>
      <P>The sanctions and the existing political environment have cast a shadow over
local economic activity, but the TAITRA believes that change could be
forthcoming after next year's general election, enabling the country to develop
its economic potential.</P>
      <P>It suggested that Taiwanese businesses develop a foothold there to be ready to
take advantage of the changes when they occur.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan green energy industry set to boom after new law enacted</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's green energy industy is poised to boom after a statute aimed at
promoting renewable energy development cleared the legislative floor last week,
a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Hui-ching, director of the MOEA Bureau of Energy, said passage of the
Renewable Energy Development Act has formally ushered into Taiwan the era of
alternative energy development and related applications.</P>
      <P>"It means that in the future, the development and application of renewable,
pollution-free sources of energy that produce low amounts of carbon-dioxide
emissions will be given priority in terms of low-carbon energy development in
the country, " Yeh said during a ceremony marking the establishment of the
Taipei-based Chinese Alternative Energy Association.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the statute represents the beginning of a linkage between
energy and environmental conservation, he said.</P>
      <P>The act provides a legal framework that will encourage investment in renewable
energy production and offer incentives  to local consumers to install renewable
energy equipment.</P>
      <P>Under the law, the government will provide incentives such as equipment purchase
subsidies and low-interest loans to increase renewable energy generating
capacity in Taiwan to between 6.5 million kilowatts and 10 million kilowatts.</P>
      <P>Yeh said it is hoped that these and other incentives will boost the development
of local solar, wind, biomass and other green sectors.</P>
      <P>In line with the spirit of the new statute, he said, the Executive Yuan has also
instructed that 10 percent of the funding for public construction projects under
the government's public works stimulus package will be set aside for the
development of renewable energy or energy-saving efforts.</P>
      <P>"These plans will in turn form the foundation of green business in the country,"
he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to permitting state-run Taiwan Power Co. to buy electricity
generated by private renewable energy investors, the statute also allows the
government to offer other incentives to speed up the development of renewable
energy technologies.</P>
      <P>The  statute  stipulates  that  the  development  of solar photovoltalic energy,
solar thermal energy, wind power generation, biomass energy and nuclear power
generation will be given priority in terms of energy development.</P>
      <P>Of these sectors, the solar energy sector will hopefully become the country's
next NT$1 trillion industrial sector and result in Taiwan becoming a leading
manufacturer of solar photovoltalic energy equipment in the world, said National
Taiwan University President Lee Si-chen, who is the convener of a national

      <P>"The government's target is quite clear now that the installation capacity of

    <HEADLINE>Taipei City increases incentives for facelift of old buildings</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City is trying to make itself more attractive and has decided to offer
more generous incentives to owners of old buildings in the metropolitan area,
particularly high-rises, who want to give their structures a facelift.</P>
      <P>Hoping to sharpen Taipei's look ahead of the 2010 Taipei International Flora
Expo, the city government recently increased the subsidy it will provide for
renovating an old building's exterior to 75 percent of the total cost, from 33
percent previously, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Taipei International Flora Expo, slated for Nov. 6, 2010-April 24, 2011
in four venues in Taipei City, is aimed at showcasing Taiwan's technical
strength in the horticulture industry, its ability to organize major events and
its capacity to generate economic activity.</P>
      <P>Some 6 million people from Taiwan and abroad are expected to attend.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, the city has subsidized 33 percent of the cost of renovating
an old building since 2006. To date, 30 projects benefiting from the incentive
program have been completed, he said.</P>
      <P>"The facelifts have not only renewed the appearances of old buildings, they've
also helped shore up the buildings' values in the real estate market," Hau said.</P>
      <P>The mayor made the comments in response to a United Daily News report Sunday
which said that the Cabinet-level Construction and Planning Administration has
allocated NT$2 billion as subsidies to help renovate the exteriors of old
buildings.</P>
      <P>The administration said it would begin to accept applications for the new
program on Monday.</P>
      <P>Subsidies of up to NT$10 million will be provided for each approved project. To
be eligible for the program, a building must be at least 20 years old, and over
80 percent of the building's residents agree to the renovation plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Irwin mangoes will be a hit in Japan: Tainan County chief</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June 14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan-grown Irwin mangoes should be a big hit in the Japanese market this
summer, as some 10,000 cases of the fruit delivered directly from Tainan to
Japan are expected to be sold out by early July, Tainan County Magistrate Su
Huan-jhih said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Keen to help promote the fruit to Japanese consumers, Su led a group of Tainan
County officials in a promotional event in Tokyo's Fukagawa area.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's envoy to Japan, John Fang, also attended the event, at which 250
mangoes to be given away were snatched up by consumers in a matter of minutes.</P>
      <P>An 84-year-old women, who was born in Hsinchu in northern Taiwan but moved to
Japan at the age of 20, exclaimed after tasting a juicy mango, "I really missed
this taste."</P>
      <P>Placing an order for the fruit on the spot, she said that although mangoes from
Mexico are available in Japanese markets, they cannot match the special flavor
of Taiwanese mangoes.</P>
      <P>Based on last year's success, which saw 2,000 cases of Irwin mangoes sold in two
weeks in the Japanese market, Tainan County again launched a special promotional
sale of the fruit targeting Japanese consumers this year in conjunction with a
private Taiwan-Japan joint venture company.</P>
      <P>The Irwin mangoes, labeled as "Midsummer's Ruby" exclusively for the quality-
conscious Japanese market, are being sold in Hankyu Department  Store  and
online  shopping  sites,  such  as www.rakuten.co.jp. -- Japan's largest of the
kind, the Tainan County chief said.</P>
      <P>According to an executive at Japan's Yamato Transport Co., Ltd., the 10,000
cases, which will each contain three 1.1-kilogram to 1.5-kg. mangoes and sell
for 2,800 yen (US$28), should be sold out by by early July at the latest as
orders have begun pouring in since early June.</P>
      <P>"We hope to present Taiwan's Irwin mangoes as a 'cheap and good' alternative to
the more pricey mangoes produced in Japan's Miyazaki Prefecture," the executive
noted.</P>
      <P>"We are planning to introduce Taiwan's high-end fresh lychees into Japan next
year as long as quarantine issues are overcome, and we believe they will also be
a hit," the executive said.</P>
      <P>Su arrived in Japan June 12 on a six-day trip to promote the county's mangoes
that will take him to Tokyo, Osaka, as well as Kanazawa and Hokkaido
prefectures.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County government has promoted the fruit since 2004 and has made
successful inroads into the Japanese market, which has helped push up the price
of local mangoes, county officials said.</P>
      <P>Japan is the No. 1 overseas market of Taiwan's agricultural and farm product
exports, according to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>In 2008, Taiwan fruit shipments to Japan hit US$22.72 million, accounting for 54
percent of the country's total fresh fruit exports last year, COA statistics
showed. Taiwan's 2008 mango exports to Japan were worth US$5.21 million.</P>

06/14/09  18:38:02
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Investigation Bureau has recently found that some processed foods advertised
as vegetarian contained meat, and it has vowed to refer producers who knowingly
added meat to their products for prosecution on fraud charges.</P>
      <P>Pu Chang-en, a technician at the bureau's department of forsensic science, said
Sunday that among samples collected from 31 vegetarian food vendors in Taipei
City and County for safety checks, food taken from 17 vendors were found to
contain meat.</P>
      <P>DNA tests revealed that in the two most serious cases, the vegetarian patties
and ham of one vendor and vegetarian dried shredded pork from another vendor
contained at least 20 percent beef or pork, Pu said.</P>
      <P>An investigation targeting the producers of the fraudulent vegetarian processed
foods has been launched to find out whether meat was deliberately added to the
soybean-based products to enrich their texture and flavor.</P>
      <P>Fu explained that it is possible that vegetarian foods showing small traces of
meat could have been contaminated by poorly cleaned work tables or cooking
equipment in factories that also produce meat products.</P>
      <P>Producers found not to have deliberately defrauded consumers would not be
subject to prosecution but would receive a warning and be ordered to remove
problem products off store shelves, Fu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan sends human rights ratification documents to U.N.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,   June  13  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has sent instruments of ratification for two United Nations human rights
covenants to the U.N. Secretariat for deposit through four of its diplomatic
allies, Taiwan's representative office in the United States said Saturday.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou signed into law May 14 the U.N.-sponsored International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a move that ensures implementation of the
two human rights protection treaties under the country's domestic laws.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan lost its U.N. seat to China in 1971, it asked the U.N. ambassadors of
Palau, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize and The Gambia to refer relevant
ratification documents to the U.N. Secretariat June 8 for depsoit.</P>
      <P>The action marked completion of the legal procedures  for ratifying the two
covenants, sources close to the representative office said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was one of the original signatories to the two treaties in 1967 when the
Republic of China was still a U.N. member. Because of international politics, it
took 42 years for Taiwan to finalize its domestic ratification procedures.</P>
      <P>With once-strained relations across the Taiwan Strait thawing, it remains to be
seen whether or how the U.N. Secretariat will react to Taiwan's latest move.</P>
      <P>Last month, Taiwan was invited to attend the World Health Assembly, the World
Health Organization's (WHO's) decision-making arm, for the first time since its
ouster from the U.N. 38 years ago.</P>
      <P>The presence at the annual WHO meeting in Geneva as an observer under the
designation "Chinese Taipei" came after 12 failed attempts. It was widely seen
as a result of the Ma administration's efforts to improve cross-strait relations
over the past year.</P>
      <P>The U.N. Secretariat has so far not commented on Taiwan's ratification  of the
two human  rights  pacts.</P>
      <P>Whether U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will return or accept Taiwan's
ratification documents or adopt a third option could serve as yet another litmus
test of China's attitude toward Taiwan's quest for greater international space,
observers said.</P>
      <P>Under former President Chen Shui-bian's leadership, Taiwan sent instruments of
accession to the Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to the U.N.
Secretariat for deposit in 2005 and 2007, respectively.</P>
      <P>The FCTC was the first legally binding international health regulations
sponsored by the U.N.-affiliated WHO. When then-U.N. Secretary-General  Kofi
Annan received Taiwan's  instrument  of accession through its diplomatic allies,
he did not react or return the document.</P>
      <P>In contrast, his successor,  Ban Ki-moon returned Taiwan's instrument of
accession to the CEDAW, which was delivered by Nauru's U.N. permanent
representative. He even cited U.N. Resolution No. 2758 to back his rejection of
the document, claiming that "Taiwan was part of the People's Republic of China"
and not a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>Ban's remarks drew a strong protest from Taiwan on the ground that Taiwan was
not part of the PRC. Taiwan also sought a legal remedy. Ultimately, the U.N.
Office of Legal Affairs issued a letter of apology, but Taiwan's CEDAW accession
document has so far not been deposited at the U.N.</P>

      <P>Noni juice from El Salvador, one of the leading agricultural products of
Taiwan's Central American ally and said by its proponents to help strengthen the
immune system, will be available in Taiwan soon.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of Salvadoran company Invernova, Taiwan's ambassador to El
Salvador, Liao Shih-chieh, attended a ceremony June 8 held in San Salvador to
mark the first ever shipment of noni juice from El Salvador to Taiwan, Ministry
of Foreign Affairs officials said.</P>
      <P>The shipment is expected to arrive in Taiwan before the opening of this year's
Taipei International Food Show on June 23, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials cited Liao as saying that bilateral trade has grown noticeably
over the past two years since Taiwan and El Salvador signed a free trade
agreement (FTA) in 2007.</P>
      <P>In addition to Invernova's noni juice exports to Taiwan, El Salvador shipped
40,000 tons of cane sugar worth US$12 million to Taiwan on May 17 under a
contract signed between the Central American country and Taiwan Sugar Corp.
under an FTA quota system, according to Liao.</P>
      <P>Liao also encouraged Invernova to take advantage of the business niche that is
provided under the FTA to make inroads into bigger markets in China and other
Asian countries via Taiwan, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, representative foods from five diplomatic allies that have signed
free trade agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan will be on display at the 2009 Taipei
International Food Show slated for June 23-26, according to the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Twenty companies from Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras
will display their most representative food products in 14 booths at the fair,
which will take place at the Taipei World Trade Center Nankang Exhibition Hall,
TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>The products expected to be exhibited at the Panama booth will include coffee,
dried papaya, hot chili sauces and noni products.</P>
      <P>Two Guatemalan companies will exhibit dried vegetables and fruit, nuts, roselle
and lemongrass, while two Nicaraguan companies will show products such as honey,
coffee, peanuts and frozen beef.</P>
      <P>Two other Nicaraguan companies will use the fair to search for Taiwanese
suppliers of food processing and packing machines, TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>On display at the El Salvador booth will be products including organic lemon
salt, organic lemon tea, roselle tea, coffee, noni juice, cashew nuts, organic
soap, massage oils and shrimp powder.</P>
      <P>Four Honduran companies will display palm oil, frozen shrimps, frozen lobsters,
hot chili sauces, snack foods and jams, TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>Exhibitors from the five countries are also expected to meet Taiwanese food
importers for discussions on further cooperation during the fair, which is an
important platform for domestic food producers and importers seeking to make
contacts with companies around the world.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, a nonprofit organization set up by the
government to promote democracy around the world, defended Sunday its financial
aid to Chinese dissidents and Tibetans who have called for Tibet's independence.</P>
      <P>Maysing H. Yang, vice president of the foundation, said it is normal for
democracy-promoting groups in Western countries to help these people.</P>
      <P>"Why should Taiwan have the foundation if it doesn't help human rights and
democracy activists? " Yang said in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"Those who criticize the foundation simply don't know its purpose and mission."</P>
      <P>Yang's comments came as a local newspaper reported that President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration is set to reshuffle the top officials of the foundation appointed
by the previous administration of President Chen Shui-bian, with Yang among the
targets.</P>
      <P>The paper said the foundation's aid to Chinese dissidents and Tibetan
independence activists has made Ma look like a double-dealer in calling for
better ties with China.</P>
      <P>What raised  the eyebrows  of Ma's administration  is the foundation's attempts
to seek contacts with Cuba, "which could jeopardize Taiwan's ties with
Washington, " the paper cited an anonymous senior official as saying.</P>
      <P>Yang argued that the U.S. has offered aid to Chinese dissidents and Tibetan
independence activists as well, but that did not hinder Washington's engagement
with Beijing at all.</P>
      <P>She admitted that her foundation did extend financial aid four years ago to
U.S.-based Cuban groups that promote democracy in Cuba at the urging of pro-
Taiwan U.S. congressmen, but that the funding stopped two years ago.</P>
      <P>Yang said the aid offered by the foundation was "above board" and verified by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Audit, and she denied reports it
was not properly  recorded in the foundation's accounts.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has recently found that helping its diplomatic allies in Central America
improve their farmers' lives could be a good way to maintain and strengthen
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Minister of Agriculture Chen Wu-hsiung said Sunday that the Council of
Agriculture (COA) has outlined plans aimed at sharing Taiwan's acclaimed farming
know-how and agricultural techniques with Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, and
has delivered them to the Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>Chen was part of the delegation that accompanied President Ma Ying-jeou on his
recent state visit to the three Central American allies. He said he found during
the trip that he was one of the Taiwanese officials that allied countries seemed
most interested in meeting.</P>
      <P>They all showed considerable interest in how Taiwan recorded its many
agricultural achievements using a small-scale farming system, Chen said in an
interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>He explained that in the large-scale industrialized  farms commonly seen in the
Central American countries, those who actually do the hard work are mostly
tenants who have no land of their own.</P>
      <P>Unlike in Taiwan, farmers in Central America could live off one-hectare plots of
land, Chen said, and he noted that the small-scale farming model drew the
attention of some left-wing heads of state and ranking officials in the allied
countries.</P>
      <P>"Their governments want to learn from Taiwan to improve the living standards of
the middle and low class, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chen mentioned newly inaugurated El Salvador President Mauricio Funes as among
those attaching importance to the development of a small-scale farming economy.</P>
      <P>The COA-initiated "agricultural  diplomacy projects" include working with
Taiwan's technical missions stationed in the Central American countries to pass
on Taiwan's agricultural knowledge and techniques in breeding and cultivation,
according to Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) welcomed Sunday the recent passage of a statue
that would allow prosecutors to seek community service assignments, rather than
prison sentences, for some felons.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials said this is a "win-win-win" policy that will cost the government
less than building new prisons and detention centers or expanding existing ones
to deal with the problem of overcrowding.</P>
      <P>The community service program will allow prisoners -- who are "consumers" in
sociological terms -- to become "producers" by serving in communities, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The program will also be of advantage to the felons' families, as community work
will allow the convicts go home every day, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The no-pay community service assignments for felons could range from household
caregiving and care of the elderly and members of disadvantaged families, to
mountain and beach cleaning, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The felons could also serve as community and natural sanctuary guards, office
staff and traffic safety personnel, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has the highest rate of blood donation among all the countries in Asia,
the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation said Monday.</P>
      <P>Foundation chairman Lin Kuo-hsin said that people in Taiwan donated a total of
2.39 million 250-ml bags of blood last year, representing a donation rate of
7.86 percent, a figure that tops all other countries in Asia.</P>
      <P>Donors with the blood type O positive accounted for 43.56 percent of the total
number in 2008 -- the highest percentage of donors that year among the different
blood groups, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation sponsored a carnival-style blood drive Sunday at its six blood
centers around the country in observance of World Blood Donor Day, which is
marked annually on June 14.</P>
      <P>Lin said that millions of people around the world owe their lives to individuals
they will never meet -- people who donate their blood to help others.</P>
      <P>To drive home the message that blood donation is not limited by borders, Lin
said, the foundation invited five foreign donors to tell their stories.</P>
      <P>A slender woman from the United States who has been in Taiwan over the last 25
years and is now teaching English at National Taiwan University, said she was
not allowed to donate blood in the U.S. because of her weight, but can do so in
Taiwan because she meets the minimum weight requirement of 45 kg.</P>
      <P>A French professor at Tamkang University said he began donating blood at the age
of 19, and that after he got married and had children in Taiwan, he continued to
donate blood as a way of showing his love for the country.</P>
      <P>A Japanese woman, who has been living in Taiwan for nine years, said that giving
blood is good for the health of the donor, in addition to the obvious value to
the recipients.</P>
      <P>An Indian man from Mumbai who has lived in Taiwan for 30 years said he has given
blood in Taiwan "too many times to remember." He said it is amazing that God has
created people of different nationalities but with the same blood types so they
can share.</P>
      <P>"Whether American, French, Japanese, or Taiwanese, the people on Earth are one
family," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that he and his aides will stick to the
principles of lawfulness and frugality while seeking the chairmanship of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , Legislative Yuan Vice Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Tseng, who picked up candidate registration forms for the KMT chairmanship on
behalf of Ma that day, relayed the president's message that in his run for the
party chairmanship, lawfulness and frugality will be the supreme guiding
principles and that his campaign headquarters will operate in a spirit of
simplicity and efficiency.</P>
      <P>"The campaign headquarters will be operated by volunteers only and no extra
spokesmen or officials will be established for the election," Tseng quoted Ma as
saying.</P>
      <P>Ma announced  June 10 his intention  to run for the KMT chairmanship, breaking a
one-year silence on the matter.</P>
      <P>Upon making the announcement, Ma said that his plan to serve concurrently as the
nation's president and as party chairman is not intended to expand his
presidential power, but rather to more effectively fulfill his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>"I hope my bid will be supported by the party members in the interest of
facilitating closer cooperation between the ruling party and the administration
and achieving more effective government, " Ma said at the June 10 news
conference to announce his bid.</P>
      <P>According to the president, incumbent KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung first floated
the idea of Ma returning to the party helm in April 2008 -- one month after he
was elected president -- and raised the proposal again in September that same
year.</P>
      <P>Ma said that at the time, he promised Wu that he would make a decision on the
matter by June this year.</P>
      <P>Also during the June 10 news conference, Wu said his support for the idea of Ma
as party chairman remains unchanged and that he will not run in the next
chairmanship election now that Ma has decided to stand as a candidate.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear if the election slated for July 26 will draw any other
aspirants.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) denied Monday that it has been
drafting regulations governing Chinese people working in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-min,  director-general of the CLA's Employment and Vocational Training
Administration, said his office has not been making plans for granting work
permits to Chinese citizens, as Taiwan has not opened its doors to Chinese
workers, either white- collar or blue-collar.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to a report published in the Liberty Times
newspaper that day that said the CLA is moving to grant work permits to Chinese
workers and have relevant regulations drafted, "paving the way for Chinese-
funded companies operating in Taiwan to hire Chinese white-collar professionals
to work in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Discounting the report, Chen noted that the administration has no plans so far
to open Taiwan's job market to Chinese workers. In addition, he argued, it is
difficult to differentiate between white-collar and blue-collar workers.</P>
      <P>"It will be up to the development of the domestic job market and how cross-
Taiwan Strait relations unfold in the future as to whether Taiwan will open its
job market to Chinese workers," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed out that professionals from China, including property
developers and real estate operators, have been allowed to come to Taiwan for
short periods of stay under Article 10 of the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>"No Chinese professionals or workers are allowed by the country's laws to come
to Taiwan for long-term employment, " he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou expressed
optimism Sunday about the future of ties between his country and Panama -- one
of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America.</P>
      <P>Ou made the remarks in an interview with CNA in Panama City. He arrived there
earlier in the day for a two-day visit, which he said is aimed at acquiring
knowledge  of the incoming  Panamanian government's policies and top priorities.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the ROC government's willingness to reinforce cooperation with its
ally.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the outlook for Taiwan-Panama ties, Ou said he believes they will
continue on a stable and solid basis, given that the two countries have
maintained friendship since 1954.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Ou said, he will visit President-elect Ricardo Martinelli and
his appointed foreign affairs minister, Juan Carlos Varela, for talks that will
allow him to find out the country's development needs, as well as exchange views
on future cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He will also give a briefing on Taiwan's development and offer Taiwanese
assistance  in helping Panama promote  its economic development, Ou said.</P>
      <P>Martinelli and Varela will assume office July 1.</P>
      <P>Ou said the ROC wants to cooperate fully with the new government of Panama.</P>
      <P>Asked about Martinelli's  earlier statement  that he would reconsider Panama's
relations with China if elected, Ou said he believes the president-elect will
continue his country's ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, faced with pleas from several Taiwanese expatriates not to close the
consulate-general office in Panama's Colon, Ou explained that the decision to
shut down the facility was taken to make better use of Taiwan's limited
diplomatic resources.</P>
      <P>He noted that Colon is just a one-hour drive from Panama City, where the ROC
Embassy can offer all the necessary services.</P>

      <P>Following her recent ice-breaking visit to China in mid-May, Kaohsiung City
Mayor Chen Chu and a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chen Chu, said she would like to visit China again if there is
another chance to do so, the Singapore-based Lianhe Zaobo reported Monday.</P>
      <P>"Of course I would like to visit China again, if the opportunity arises,
although I don't know when, " Chen was quoted by the newspaper as saying during
an interview last week in Taiwan. "As a member of the global village, we should
reach out and must not leave out China."</P>
      <P>Chen visited China May 21-24 to promote this summer's World Games that will be
held in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City July 16-26.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the China trip had impacted on her political ideas
and beliefs, Chen said "no, " adding that it is impossible for that to happen in
three days.</P>
      <P>She called on Beijing to listen to voices other than those of Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) if it wants to gain a better and more accurate understanding of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Beijing only engages the KMT, it will not be able to hear the different
opinions in Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>"Whether or not you like it, the opposition DPP still has the support of some 40
percent of the Taiwan people, " she said. "This is precisely the biggest
difference between Taiwan and China. In contrast to China, Taiwan is a
democratic and multi-faceted society."</P>

      <P>The weighted stock price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange plunged 3.45 percent
Monday, or 222.67 points, to close at 6,225.56 due mainly to investors rushing

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will not rashly engage China
but should adjust its strategy to deal with a rising China, Tainan Mayor Hsu
Tain-tsair, a prominent DPP member, was reported as saying Monday.</P>
      <P>"I harbor no hostility toward China, but the DPP must stick firm to its
standpoint, " Hsu said in a report published by the Singapore-based Lianhe Zaobo
newspaper that same day.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should strengthen its internal confidence and must not engage China
amid an ambiguous and unequal situation, " he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Turning to a visit he plans to make to China July 17-21, Hsu described it as a
"sports and cultural" journey.</P>
      <P>During his stay in China, he will attend the First Straits Cup Sailing Boat
Championship to be held between Fujian Province's Xiamen and Tainan's Anping --
a cross-Taiwan Strait route that used to be thriving prior to World War Two. He
will also visit the cities of Zhangzhou and Quangzhou, also in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>He reiterated his demands that he should be allowed to enter China without a
special entry permit issued by Beijing for travelers from Taiwan,  commonly
known as the "Taiwan Compatriot Travel Certificate" and stressed that China must
not describe Taiwan as a "province of China."</P>
      <P>"However, it is acceptable if China views Tainan as a city of Taiwan Province,
the Republic of China, or Tainan City, Taiwan, or simply Tainan City," he added.</P>
      <P>"Although some DPP members are opposed to my (planned) China journey, a majority
of them support my decision to go and help attract more Chinese tourists to
Tainan City, " he explained, stressing that "it will provide a chance for the
Taiwanese people to test China's true colors if Beijing attempts to suppress me
during this trip."</P>
      <P>Commenting on an allegation that variables might arise ahead of the official
opening of the regatta, Hsu said he is still looking forward to the trip.</P>
      <P>He made it clear last week that he will drop his plans if Beijing insists that
he must enter with the "Taiwan Compatriot Travel Certificate."</P>
      <P>In addition, the Tainan mayor admitted that he might consider running for the
DPP chairmanship, as many backers have encouraged him to take on the challenge.</P>
      <P>Hsu's planned trip comes on the heels of a May 21-24 visit to China by Chen Chu,
also a DPP heavyweight and mayor of Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Chen, the most prominent DPP incumbent official to have ever visited China, was
making a promotional trip for the World Games in Kaohsiung next July 16-26.</P>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou  said in late  May that improving Taiwan-China ties is
not a prerogative of the ruling Kuomintang but is rather a path that all
Taiwan's political parties should take because Taiwan needs to reach out in
order to survive.</P>
      <P>He encouraged DPP members to increase their contacts with China for the benefit
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The KMT favors strengthening relations with China, especially trade and economic
links, but the DPP fears that some of Ma's China-friendly  policies  could
undermine  Taiwan's  independent sovereignty.</P>

port, while 8.6 percent held an opposing view.</P>
      <P>RDEC Executive Director Hsu Li-ming attributed  the rising satisfaction  rating
to the completion  of significant  public infrastructure projects, including the
city's subway system, and the improvement of the city's environment and quality
of life.</P>
      <P>Those who expressed  dissatisfaction  with the government's administrative
performance complained about the poor quality of city roads, haphazard
construction on the city's roads, chaotic traffic, the city's dirty and
disorderly appearance, poor public safety, high unemployment and air pollution,
according to the RDEC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 79 percent of respondents recognized Chen's visit to China in May as
a move to fulfill her duty in promoting Kaohsiung and the upcoming 2009 World
Games, slated for July 16-26 in Kaohsiung City, while 11 percent thought the
trip was not necessary.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,081 valid samples were collected for the survey, which has a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.98 percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>100 swimmers to challenge 1st cross-strait mass swim</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A mass swim across the Taiwan Strait is scheduled to be held Aug. 15, with 100
swimmers from Taiwan and China taking part, Lee Chu-feng, magistrate of Taiwan's
outlying island of Kinmen, said in Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee said at a news conference that 50 swimmers from Taiwan will join 50 swimmers
from China in the Fujian Province port city of Xiamen in southeastern China Aug.
15 to embark on the historic swim across the Taiwan Strait to Hsiao Kinmen -- a
small islet west of Kinmen -- an 8.5-km swim that is expected to take several
hours.</P>
      <P>The swim,  which is being sponsored by the Kinmen county government and the
Xiamen city government, will begin from Xiamen's Yefengzhai Beach and finish on
Hsiao Kinmen's Shuangkou Beach, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the direct distance between the two beaches is about 6 km, but
pointed out that the swimmers will have to actually swim up to 8.5 km due to the
pull of ocean currents.</P>
      <P>"They must finish the swim in 3.5 hours or less, " the magistrate said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the news conference, Lee said the Kinmen-Xiamen swim will not only be
a sports contest but also a major activity promoting cross-strait  peace,  as
tension between Taiwan and China has noticeably eased since President Ma Ying-
jeou took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"We hope Kinmen will rid itself  of its memories  as an anti-communist
battlefield six decades ago and that cross-strait peace and new possibilities
will arrive after the swim," he said.</P>
      <P>Careful to minimize the risks involved in the swim, the sponsors decided to
conduct test swims June 17 and July 17 to allow the swimmers to get a better
grasp of the conditions in the Taiwan Strait so that they can fully prepare
themselves.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Kinmen county government will remove spear-like anti-landing
barricades from the Shuangkou Beach before August to allow easier access for the
swimmers.</P>
      <P>The devices -- built in the shallow waters of the beach during the Cold War era
to obstruct landing craft from China -- will be replaced after the event,
according to county government officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the workers assigned to Kinmen to clear landmines left over from the
same period will be put to work cleaning up the Shuangkou Beach area the
officials added.</P>

      <P>A first grade student from the Guo An Elementary School in central Taiwan's
Taichung City, has been publicly commended for donating her piggy bank savings,
on her own initiative, to help economically disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ching-yu's parents were not aware of her actions until they were informed
that she was to receive Sunday a commendation from the Long Yan Ling Foundation,
the non-profit group that launched the charity drive to help poor families.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which is dedicated to assisting such families and helping
disadvantaged children fulfill their dreams, initiated a "NT$10-a-day, pay it
forward" campaign that Ching-yu became aware of in school.</P>
      <P>At the function Sunday, the "Long Yan Angels" -- donors whose generosity helped
poor children to realize their dreams -- were commended for their efforts and
Ching-yu was the star of the event.</P>
      <P>Her daily NT$10 donations were noticed by her school teachers but they thought
that she had been asking her parents for the money.</P>
      <P>They later learned that she had earned the money by helping her family with the
housework. The foundation then decided to invite her to the charity show and
commended her for her initiative and her beneficence.</P>
      <P>One of the recipients, Tung Hsiao-chieh, a fifth grade soccer player who did not
have the required NT$50,000 (US$1,520) to travel to Spain with his school's
soccer team, expressed his appreciation to the "angels" who made his dream come

      <P>Zheng Lizhong, the visiting deputy director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office,
met with local farmers on a visit to Tainan County in southern Taiwan Monday and
expressed an interest in further agricultural cooperation between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Zheng, who also serves as vice president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , said China's government has
attached great importance to its agricultural development.</P>
      <P>After seeing that Tainan County enjoys a competitive edge in the sector with its
high-quality subtropical fruits, Zheng suggested the county capitalize on its
advantages in cooperating with China, focusing on high value-added items and
strengthening the division of labor across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said his country will soon send a procurement delegation to Tainan and that
he hopes the county will sell its best fruit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>As to the problems of quarantine and customs clearance, Zheng said he
anticipated they would be likely put on the agenda of the fourth round of talks
between the ARATS and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation -- two intermediary
bodies founded to handle cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges in the absence of
official links.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Zheng also visited Chiayi County where he toured Budai harbor, a
designated destination for direct cross-strait cargo shipping links.</P>
      <P>Zheng arrived in Taiwan last Wednesday to work out the agenda of the planned
fifth forum between Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China,

      <P>Chinese business executives will be allowed to stay in Taiwan for up to one year
if revised regulations proposed by the National Immigration Agency (NIA) take
effect.</P>
      <P>NIA officials said Monday executives of Chinese companies that have obtained

be allowed to stay in Taiwan for up to one year under the planned revision.</P>
      <P>If the executives have children 18 years of age or older who are living with
them, the children can also apply to study in Taiwan in line with regulations
governing multinational business executives in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The revised regulations on Chinese professionals coming to Taiwan for
professional activities are among the complementary measures being planned in
anticipation of the scheduled announcement by the MOEA on opening Taiwan to
Chinese investment at the end of the month.</P>
      <P>Regulations would also be revised for Chinese nationals investing in the local
property market. Existing guidelines limit the stay of Chinese invited to Taiwan
to one month, but under the proposed revisions, they could make an unlimited
number of visits and stay in Taiwan for up to four months of the year.</P>
      <P>The latest proposals follow an announcement earlier this month that Chinese

    <HEADLINE>Suspects in aimless killing in Hsinchu City arrested</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
06/15/09  23:03:14
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five teenagers were arrested in the northern city of Hsinchu Monday for
allegedly beating a former semiconductor engineer to death last week, police
said.</P>
      <P>Yu Che-pin, a Canada-trained master's degree holder who once worked for a
semiconductor company in the Hsinchu Science Park, was fatally beaten while
chatting with a friend in the city's coastal Nanliao Park early Wednesday. He
died shortly after being rushed to a nearby hospital.</P>
      <P>Police said they had screened security videos at 100-plus locations in the
vicinity of the crime scene, including those installed at nearby convenience
stores, and pored over data on more than 200 notorious street dragsters and
those with previous criminal records in the city before tracking  down the five
suspected assailants.</P>
      <P>"The five adolescent suspects have confessed to their involvement in the aimless
killing spree," said a Hsinchu police officer.</P>
      <P>The suspects told police that they rode on three motorcycles to Nanliao Park at
around 1 a.m. June 10. They were having fun drinking on the park's elevated
observation platform when they spotted Yu talking with a woman on the lawn
nearby at around 2:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>They then planted a wooden bar in front of Yu in a provocative gesture. When Yu
attempted to leave the scene, one of the suspects hit his head with another
wooden stick found on park grounds.</P>
      <P>The four other accomplices  then continued beating Yu and eventually fled when
he collapsed to the ground.</P>
      <P>The teen attackers said they did not realize Yu had died until the following day
when they read about it on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi and Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-tzer jointly hosted a
news conference at Hsinchu City police headquarters to announce that the tragic
case had been broken.</P>
      <P>Liao said the government put a high priority on the case and that the speed with
which the crime was solved signified the government's determination to crack
down on youth crime.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lin said the city government will install more
lamps and monitoring cameras at scenic spots around the city and step up
counseling services for school dropouts to reduce the juvenile crime rate.</P>
      <P>Yu's death triggered an uproar in the city, which is the home of Taiwan's high-
tech nerve center -- the Hsinchu Science Park. Internet users in the city
launched a "one man one letter" campaign after news of Yu's death spread.</P>
      <P>Local activists blamed the city government for failing to take effective
measures to wipe out what they called rampant drag racing in the city. They
recalled that three years ago, two science park engineers were seriously wounded
by teen attackers in two separate cases.</P>
      <P>They appealed to campaign supporters to write to President Ma Ying-jeou and
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and urge them to take immediate steps to solve the case.</P>
      <P>They also questioned the credibility of Lin's high approval rating in some
public opinion surveys, claiming that he has been unable to reduce the city's
juvenile crime rate.</P>
      <P>Yu's heartbroken mother was quoted by local papers as saying that she hoped her
son would be the last victim of this kind of aimless killing spree.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Paiwan woman retires after devoting 47 years to education</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  July 15 (CNA)
06/15/09  23:22:22
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kao Chin-yu, a 65-year-old member of the Paiwan aboriginal tribe, will retire
Aug. 1 after teaching for 47 years in her hometown in eastern Taiwan's Taitung
County and taking on the role of mother and esteemed colleague to many in her
remote village.</P>
      <P>Kao has never looked back since becoming a teacher at Sinsing Elementary School
in her native Jinfong Township at the age of 18, but the time has finally
arrived for her to exit the stage that has meant so much to her.</P>
      <P>Also retiring will be Lu Shien-nan, the principal of Sanchien Elementary School,
who was one of Kao's students in 1962 -- the year she began teaching at Sinsing
Elementary shortly after graduating from "Taitung Normal School."</P>
      <P>At the only school in the small township, almost every township resident was
once her student. Kao even taught her own daughters and granddaughter as well as
three generations of one family.</P>
      <P>"I treated all of them equally," Kao said.</P>
      <P>"She is our mom, co-worker and grandma, " explained Cheng Hui-feng, director of
the Sinsing Elementary School.</P>
      <P>"She is truly one of a kind," hailed Sinsing Elementary principal Cheng Hen-wen.
"There will never be anyone again who will be able to serve so many years at the
same school as she has."</P>
      <P>After the normal education system, responsible for producing Taiwan's teachers,
was upgraded to the higher university level, normal university graduates are now
generally at least 22 years old, making a repeat of Kao's career a near
impossibility.</P>
      <P>For Kao to be admitted to her county's normal school in the late 1950s was truly
a feat in itself. It was a "great honor" for her tribe and the underprivileged
township, which is secluded in a mountainous area in sparsely populated
southeastern Taiwan and did not have any resources in that underdeveloped era.</P>
      <P>Recalling her long-term devotion to grassroots education in Jinfong Township,
Kao said her most unforgettable experience was the so-called "lunch box
episode."</P>
      <P>Because many parents of her students were poor, some of them would knock on her
door early in the morning and ask her to help them nourish their children, Kao
said. By lunch time, the entire class, including Kao, would have similar lunch
boxes, she remembered.</P>
      <P>Apart from educating young children, Kao also enthusiastically promoted learning
and knowledge among adult Paiwan men and women.</P>
      <P>In 1992, she was cited by the Ministry of Education as the "outstanding
teacher" of the year in honor of her life-long contribution to the indigenous
Paiwan people.</P>
      <P>Although Kao will officially retire on August 1, township residents have decided
to host a big feast for Kao on Wednesday to express their deepest gratitude to a
person so dear and so precious to them.</P>
      <P>"She is the pride of our tribe and our town, " township representative Hu Chao-
ching said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) welcomed Sunday the recent passage of a statue
that would allow prosecutors to seek community service assignments, rather than
prison sentences, for some felons.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials said this is a "win-win-win" policy that will cost the government
less than building new prisons and detention centers or expanding existing ones
to deal with the problem of overcrowding.</P>
      <P>The community service program will allow prisoners -- who are "consumers" in
sociological terms -- to become "producers" by serving in communities, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The program will also be of advantage to the felons' families, as community work
will allow the convicts go home every day, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The no-pay community service assignments for felons could range from household
caregiving and care of the elderly and members of disadvantaged families, to
mountain and beach cleaning, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The felons could also serve as community and natural sanctuary guards, office
staff and traffic safety personnel, they added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has the highest rate of blood donation among all the countries in Asia,
the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation said Monday.</P>
      <P>Foundation chairman Lin Kuo-hsin said that people in Taiwan donated a total of
2.39 million 250-ml bags of blood last year, representing a donation rate of
7.86 percent, a figure that tops all other countries in Asia.</P>
      <P>Donors with the blood type O positive accounted for 43.56 percent of the total
number in 2008 -- the highest percentage of donors that year among the different
blood groups, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation sponsored a carnival-style blood drive Sunday at its six blood
centers around the country in observance of World Blood Donor Day, which is
marked annually on June 14.</P>
      <P>Lin said that millions of people around the world owe their lives to individuals
they will never meet -- people who donate their blood to help others.</P>
      <P>To drive home the message that blood donation is not limited by borders, Lin
said, the foundation invited five foreign donors to tell their stories.</P>
      <P>A slender woman from the United States who has been in Taiwan over the last 25
years and is now teaching English at National Taiwan University, said she was
not allowed to donate blood in the U.S. because of her weight, but can do so in
Taiwan because she meets the minimum weight requirement of 45 kg.</P>
      <P>A French professor at Tamkang University said he began donating blood at the age
of 19, and that after he got married and had children in Taiwan, he continued to
donate blood as a way of showing his love for the country.</P>
      <P>A Japanese woman, who has been living in Taiwan for nine years, said that giving
blood is good for the health of the donor, in addition to the obvious value to
the recipients.</P>
      <P>An Indian man from Mumbai who has lived in Taiwan for 30 years said he has given
blood in Taiwan "too many times to remember." He said it is amazing that God has
created people of different nationalities but with the same blood types so they
can share.</P>
      <P>"Whether American, French, Japanese, or Taiwanese, the people on Earth are one
family," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that he and his aides will stick to the
principles of lawfulness and frugality while seeking the chairmanship of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , Legislative Yuan Vice Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Tseng, who picked up candidate registration forms for the KMT chairmanship on
behalf of Ma that day, relayed the president's message that in his run for the
party chairmanship, lawfulness and frugality will be the supreme guiding
principles and that his campaign headquarters will operate in a spirit of
simplicity and efficiency.</P>
      <P>"The campaign headquarters will be operated by volunteers only and no extra
spokesmen or officials will be established for the election," Tseng quoted Ma as
saying.</P>
      <P>Ma announced  June 10 his intention  to run for the KMT chairmanship, breaking a
one-year silence on the matter.</P>
      <P>Upon making the announcement, Ma said that his plan to serve concurrently as the
nation's president and as party chairman is not intended to expand his
presidential power, but rather to more effectively fulfill his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>"I hope my bid will be supported by the party members in the interest of
facilitating closer cooperation between the ruling party and the administration
and achieving more effective government, " Ma said at the June 10 news
conference to announce his bid.</P>
      <P>According to the president, incumbent KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung first floated
the idea of Ma returning to the party helm in April 2008 -- one month after he
was elected president -- and raised the proposal again in September that same
year.</P>
      <P>Ma said that at the time, he promised Wu that he would make a decision on the
matter by June this year.</P>
      <P>Also during the June 10 news conference, Wu said his support for the idea of Ma
as party chairman remains unchanged and that he will not run in the next
chairmanship election now that Ma has decided to stand as a candidate.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear if the election slated for July 26 will draw any other
aspirants.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) denied Monday that it has been
drafting regulations governing Chinese people working in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-min,  director-general of the CLA's Employment and Vocational Training
Administration, said his office has not been making plans for granting work
permits to Chinese citizens, as Taiwan has not opened its doors to Chinese
workers, either white- collar or blue-collar.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to a report published in the Liberty Times
newspaper that day that said the CLA is moving to grant work permits to Chinese
workers and have relevant regulations drafted, "paving the way for Chinese-
funded companies operating in Taiwan to hire Chinese white-collar professionals
to work in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Discounting the report, Chen noted that the administration has no plans so far
to open Taiwan's job market to Chinese workers. In addition, he argued, it is
difficult to differentiate between white-collar and blue-collar workers.</P>
      <P>"It will be up to the development of the domestic job market and how cross-
Taiwan Strait relations unfold in the future as to whether Taiwan will open its
job market to Chinese workers," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed out that professionals from China, including property
developers and real estate operators, have been allowed to come to Taiwan for
short periods of stay under Article 10 of the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>"No Chinese professionals or workers are allowed by the country's laws to come
to Taiwan for long-term employment, " he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou expressed
optimism Sunday about the future of ties between his country and Panama -- one
of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America.</P>
      <P>Ou made the remarks in an interview with CNA in Panama City. He arrived there
earlier in the day for a two-day visit, which he said is aimed at acquiring
knowledge  of the incoming  Panamanian government's policies and top priorities.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the ROC government's willingness to reinforce cooperation with its
ally.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the outlook for Taiwan-Panama ties, Ou said he believes they will
continue on a stable and solid basis, given that the two countries have
maintained friendship since 1954.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Ou said, he will visit President-elect Ricardo Martinelli and
his appointed foreign affairs minister, Juan Carlos Varela, for talks that will
allow him to find out the country's development needs, as well as exchange views
on future cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He will also give a briefing on Taiwan's development and offer Taiwanese
assistance  in helping Panama promote  its economic development, Ou said.</P>
      <P>Martinelli and Varela will assume office July 1.</P>
      <P>Ou said the ROC wants to cooperate fully with the new government of Panama.</P>
      <P>Asked about Martinelli's  earlier statement  that he would reconsider Panama's
relations with China if elected, Ou said he believes the president-elect will
continue his country's ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, faced with pleas from several Taiwanese expatriates not to close the
consulate-general office in Panama's Colon, Ou explained that the decision to
shut down the facility was taken to make better use of Taiwan's limited
diplomatic resources.</P>
      <P>He noted that Colon is just a one-hour drive from Panama City, where the ROC
Embassy can offer all the necessary services.</P>

      <P>Following her recent ice-breaking visit to China in mid-May, Kaohsiung City
Mayor Chen Chu and a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chen Chu, said she would like to visit China again if there is
another chance to do so, the Singapore-based Lianhe Zaobo reported Monday.</P>
      <P>"Of course I would like to visit China again, if the opportunity arises,
although I don't know when, " Chen was quoted by the newspaper as saying during
an interview last week in Taiwan. "As a member of the global village, we should
reach out and must not leave out China."</P>
      <P>Chen visited China May 21-24 to promote this summer's World Games that will be
held in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City July 16-26.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the China trip had impacted on her political ideas
and beliefs, Chen said "no, " adding that it is impossible for that to happen in
three days.</P>
      <P>She called on Beijing to listen to voices other than those of Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) if it wants to gain a better and more accurate understanding of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Beijing only engages the KMT, it will not be able to hear the different
opinions in Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>"Whether or not you like it, the opposition DPP still has the support of some 40
percent of the Taiwan people, " she said. "This is precisely the biggest
difference between Taiwan and China. In contrast to China, Taiwan is a
democratic and multi-faceted society."</P>

      <P>The weighted stock price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange plunged 3.45 percent

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will not rashly engage China
but should adjust its strategy to deal with a rising China, Tainan Mayor Hsu
Tain-tsair, a prominent DPP member, was reported as saying Monday.</P>
      <P>"I harbor no hostility toward China, but the DPP must stick firm to its
standpoint, " Hsu said in a report published by the Singapore-based Lianhe Zaobo
newspaper that same day.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should strengthen its internal confidence and must not engage China
amid an ambiguous and unequal situation, " he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Turning to a visit he plans to make to China July 17-21, Hsu described it as a
"sports and cultural" journey.</P>
      <P>During his stay in China, he will attend the First Straits Cup Sailing Boat
Championship to be held between Fujian Province's Xiamen and Tainan's Anping --
a cross-Taiwan Strait route that used to be thriving prior to World War Two. He
will also visit the cities of Zhangzhou and Quangzhou, also in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>He reiterated his demands that he should be allowed to enter China without a
special entry permit issued by Beijing for travelers from Taiwan,  commonly
known as the "Taiwan Compatriot Travel Certificate" and stressed that China must
not describe Taiwan as a "province of China."</P>
      <P>"However, it is acceptable if China views Tainan as a city of Taiwan Province,
the Republic of China, or Tainan City, Taiwan, or simply Tainan City," he added.</P>
      <P>"Although some DPP members are opposed to my (planned) China journey, a majority
of them support my decision to go and help attract more Chinese tourists to
Tainan City, " he explained, stressing that "it will provide a chance for the
Taiwanese people to test China's true colors if Beijing attempts to suppress me
during this trip."</P>
      <P>Commenting on an allegation that variables might arise ahead of the official
opening of the regatta, Hsu said he is still looking forward to the trip.</P>
      <P>He made it clear last week that he will drop his plans if Beijing insists that
he must enter with the "Taiwan Compatriot Travel Certificate."</P>
      <P>In addition, the Tainan mayor admitted that he might consider running for the
DPP chairmanship, as many backers have encouraged him to take on the challenge.</P>
      <P>Hsu's planned trip comes on the heels of a May 21-24 visit to China by Chen Chu,
also a DPP heavyweight and mayor of Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Chen, the most prominent DPP incumbent official to have ever visited China, was
making a promotional trip for the World Games in Kaohsiung next July 16-26.</P>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou  said in late  May that improving Taiwan-China ties is
not a prerogative of the ruling Kuomintang but is rather a path that all
Taiwan's political parties should take because Taiwan needs to reach out in
order to survive.</P>
      <P>He encouraged DPP members to increase their contacts with China for the benefit
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The KMT favors strengthening relations with China, especially trade and economic
links, but the DPP fears that some of Ma's China-friendly  policies  could
undermine  Taiwan's  independent sovereignty.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City government under the leadership of Mayor Chen Chu has earned
the acclaim of its residents after completing several public infrastructure
projects, according to a local poll.</P>
      <P>A survey of city residents conducted by the city's Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC) June 7-9 found that 72.4 percent of respondents
were satisfied with the Kaohsiung government's performance, up 7.6 percentage
points from a similar survey conducted in May.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chen, a bigwig of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, had a 76
percent approval rating, with 11.6 percent of respondents expressing
disapproval.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 81.5 percent of those surveyed said they felt proud to
be a resident of the southern Taiwan city that features the country's biggest
port, while 8.6 percent held an opposing view.</P>
      <P>RDEC Executive Director Hsu Li-ming attributed  the rising satisfaction  rating
to the completion  of significant  public infrastructure projects, including the
city's subway system, and the improvement of the city's environment and quality
of life.</P>
      <P>Those who expressed  dissatisfaction  with the government's administrative
performance complained about the poor quality of city roads, haphazard
construction on the city's roads, chaotic traffic, the city's dirty and
disorderly appearance, poor public safety, high unemployment and air pollution,
according to the RDEC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 79 percent of respondents recognized Chen's visit to China in May as
a move to fulfill her duty in promoting Kaohsiung and the upcoming 2009 World
Games, slated for July 16-26 in Kaohsiung City, while 11 percent thought the
trip was not necessary.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,081 valid samples were collected for the survey, which has a margin

      <P>A mass swim across the Taiwan Strait is scheduled to be held Aug. 15, with 100
swimmers from Taiwan and China taking part, Lee Chu-feng, magistrate of Taiwan's
outlying island of Kinmen, said in Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee said at a news conference that 50 swimmers from Taiwan will join 50 swimmers
from China in the Fujian Province port city of Xiamen in southeastern China Aug.
15 to embark on the historic swim across the Taiwan Strait to Hsiao Kinmen -- a
small islet west of Kinmen -- an 8.5-km swim that is expected to take several
hours.</P>
      <P>The swim,  which is being sponsored by the Kinmen county government and the
Xiamen city government, will begin from Xiamen's Yefengzhai Beach and finish on
Hsiao Kinmen's Shuangkou Beach, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the direct distance between the two beaches is about 6 km, but
pointed out that the swimmers will have to actually swim up to 8.5 km due to the
pull of ocean currents.</P>
      <P>"They must finish the swim in 3.5 hours or less, " the magistrate said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the news conference, Lee said the Kinmen-Xiamen swim will not only be
a sports contest but also a major activity promoting cross-strait  peace,  as
tension between Taiwan and China has noticeably eased since President Ma Ying-
jeou took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"We hope Kinmen will rid itself  of its memories  as an anti-communist
battlefield six decades ago and that cross-strait peace and new possibilities
will arrive after the swim," he said.</P>
      <P>Careful to minimize the risks involved in the swim, the sponsors decided to
conduct test swims June 17 and July 17 to allow the swimmers to get a better
grasp of the conditions in the Taiwan Strait so that they can fully prepare
themselves.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Kinmen county government will remove spear-like anti-landing
barricades from the Shuangkou Beach before August to allow easier access for the
swimmers.</P>
      <P>The devices -- built in the shallow waters of the beach during the Cold War era
to obstruct landing craft from China -- will be replaced after the event,
according to county government officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the workers assigned to Kinmen to clear landmines left over from the
same period will be put to work cleaning up the Shuangkou Beach area the
officials added.</P>

poor children to realize their dreams -- were commended for their efforts and

      <P>Zheng Lizhong, the visiting deputy director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office,
met with local farmers on a visit to Tainan County in southern Taiwan Monday and
expressed an interest in further agricultural cooperation between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Zheng, who also serves as vice president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , said China's government has
attached great importance to its agricultural development.</P>
      <P>After seeing that Tainan County enjoys a competitive edge in the sector with its
high-quality subtropical fruits, Zheng suggested the county capitalize on its
advantages in cooperating with China, focusing on high value-added items and
strengthening the division of labor across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said his country will soon send a procurement delegation to Tainan and that
he hopes the county will sell its best fruit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>As to the problems of quarantine and customs clearance, Zheng said he

      <P>Regulations would also be revised for Chinese nationals investing in the local
property market. Existing guidelines limit the stay of Chinese invited to Taiwan
to one month, but under the proposed revisions, they could make an unlimited

      <P>Five teenagers were arrested in the northern city of Hsinchu Monday for
allegedly beating a former semiconductor engineer to death last week, police
said.</P>
      <P>Yu Che-pin, a Canada-trained master's degree holder who once worked for a
semiconductor company in the Hsinchu Science Park, was fatally beaten while
chatting with a friend in the city's coastal Nanliao Park early Wednesday. He
died shortly after being rushed to a nearby hospital.</P>
      <P>Police said they had screened security videos at 100-plus locations in the
vicinity of the crime scene, including those installed at nearby convenience
stores, and pored over data on more than 200 notorious street dragsters and
those with previous criminal records in the city before tracking  down the five
suspected assailants.</P>
      <P>"The five adolescent suspects have confessed to their involvement in the aimless
killing spree," said a Hsinchu police officer.</P>
      <P>The suspects told police that they rode on three motorcycles to Nanliao Park at
around 1 a.m. June 10. They were having fun drinking on the park's elevated
observation platform when they spotted Yu talking with a woman on the lawn
nearby at around 2:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>They then planted a wooden bar in front of Yu in a provocative gesture. When Yu
attempted to leave the scene, one of the suspects hit his head with another
wooden stick found on park grounds.</P>
      <P>The four other accomplices  then continued beating Yu and eventually fled when
he collapsed to the ground.</P>
      <P>The teen attackers said they did not realize Yu had died until the following day
when they read about it on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi and Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-tzer jointly hosted a
news conference at Hsinchu City police headquarters to announce that the tragic
case had been broken.</P>
      <P>Liao said the government put a high priority on the case and that the speed with
which the crime was solved signified the government's determination to crack
down on youth crime.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lin said the city government will install more
lamps and monitoring cameras at scenic spots around the city and step up
counseling services for school dropouts to reduce the juvenile crime rate.</P>
      <P>Yu's death triggered an uproar in the city, which is the home of Taiwan's high-
tech nerve center -- the Hsinchu Science Park. Internet users in the city
launched a "one man one letter" campaign after news of Yu's death spread.</P>
      <P>Local activists blamed the city government for failing to take effective
measures to wipe out what they called rampant drag racing in the city. They
recalled that three years ago, two science park engineers were seriously wounded
by teen attackers in two separate cases.</P>
      <P>They appealed to campaign supporters to write to President Ma Ying-jeou and
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and urge them to take immediate steps to solve the case.</P>
      <P>They also questioned the credibility of Lin's high approval rating in some
public opinion surveys, claiming that he has been unable to reduce the city's
juvenile crime rate.</P>
      <P>Yu's heartbroken mother was quoted by local papers as saying that she hoped her
son would be the last victim of this kind of aimless killing spree.</P>

      <P>Kao Chin-yu, a 65-year-old member of the Paiwan aboriginal tribe, will retire
Aug. 1 after teaching for 47 years in her hometown in eastern Taiwan's Taitung
County and taking on the role of mother and esteemed colleague to many in her
remote village.</P>
      <P>Kao has never looked back since becoming a teacher at Sinsing Elementary School
in her native Jinfong Township at the age of 18, but the time has finally
arrived for her to exit the stage that has meant so much to her.</P>
      <P>Also retiring will be Lu Shien-nan, the principal of Sanchien Elementary School,
who was one of Kao's students in 1962 -- the year she began teaching at Sinsing
Elementary shortly after graduating from "Taitung Normal School."</P>
      <P>At the only school in the small township, almost every township resident was
once her student. Kao even taught her own daughters and granddaughter as well as
three generations of one family.</P>
      <P>"I treated all of them equally," Kao said.</P>
      <P>"She is our mom, co-worker and grandma, " explained Cheng Hui-feng, director of
the Sinsing Elementary School.</P>
      <P>"She is truly one of a kind," hailed Sinsing Elementary principal Cheng Hen-wen.
"There will never be anyone again who will be able to serve so many years at the
same school as she has."</P>
      <P>After the normal education system, responsible for producing Taiwan's teachers,
was upgraded to the higher university level, normal university graduates are now
generally at least 22 years old, making a repeat of Kao's career a near
impossibility.</P>
      <P>For Kao to be admitted to her county's normal school in the late 1950s was truly
a feat in itself. It was a "great honor" for her tribe and the underprivileged
township, which is secluded in a mountainous area in sparsely populated
southeastern Taiwan and did not have any resources in that underdeveloped era.</P>
      <P>Recalling her long-term devotion to grassroots education in Jinfong Township,
Kao said her most unforgettable experience was the so-called "lunch box
episode."</P>
      <P>Because many parents of her students were poor, some of them would knock on her
door early in the morning and ask her to help them nourish their children, Kao
said. By lunch time, the entire class, including Kao, would have similar lunch
boxes, she remembered.</P>
      <P>Apart from educating young children, Kao also enthusiastically promoted learning
and knowledge among adult Paiwan men and women.</P>
      <P>In 1992, she was cited by the Ministry of Education as the "outstanding
teacher" of the year in honor of her life-long contribution to the indigenous
Paiwan people.</P>
      <P>Although Kao will officially retire on August 1, township residents have decided
to host a big feast for Kao on Wednesday to express their deepest gratitude to a
person so dear and so precious to them.</P>
      <P>"She is the pride of our tribe and our town, " township representative Hu Chao-

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese business executives will be allowed to stay in Taiwan for up to one year
if revised regulations proposed by the National Immigration Agency (NIA) take
effect.</P>
      <P>NIA officials said Monday executives of Chinese companies that have obtained
approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to invest in Taiwan would
be allowed to stay in Taiwan for up to one year under the planned revision.</P>
      <P>If the executives have children 18 years of age or older who are living with
them, the children can also apply to study in Taiwan in line with regulations
governing multinational business executives in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The revised regulations on Chinese professionals coming to Taiwan for
professional activities are among the complementary measures being planned in
anticipation of the scheduled announcement by the MOEA on opening Taiwan to
Chinese investment at the end of the month.</P>
      <P>Regulations would also be revised for Chinese nationals investing in the local
property market. Existing guidelines limit the stay of Chinese invited to Taiwan
to one month, but under the proposed revisions, they could make an unlimited
number of visits and stay in Taiwan for up to four months of the year.</P>
      <P>The latest proposals follow an announcement earlier this month that Chinese
visitors can extend their stay in Taiwan from 14 days to one month when
traveling in Taiwan on business.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GPA to take effect July 15 for Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Trade Organization (WTO) received Monday an instrument of accession to
the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) submitted by Taiwan -- the 41st
signatory of the plurilateral accord, WTO spokesman Josep Bosch said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan completed the accession procedure after depositing the instrument of
accession with the WTO.</P>
      <P>Though Taiwan has now formally become a signatory of the GPA, the agreement will
not enter into force until the 30th day (in this case July 15) following the
date on which the instrument of accession has been received by the WTO,
according to the terms of the GPA.</P>
      <P>The WTO Committee on Government Procurement formally approved Taiwan's
application to enter the GPA on Dec. 9, 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was originally required to submit the instrument of accession by June 9,
but it asked that the deadline of the submission be extended for one month to
July 9, a request which was approved by the WTO.</P>
      <P>The GPA was adopted by the WTO in 1981 with the purpose of opening  up as much
government  procurement  as possible  to international competition.</P>
      <P>It was designed to make laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding
government procurement more transparent and to ensure they do not protect
domestic products or suppliers, or discriminate against foreign products or
suppliers.</P>
      <P>Following the accession, Taiwan's government procurement market will be open to
the 40 other GPA members, and vice versa, based on the principles of reciprocity
and national treatment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has estimated that the government
procurement market in GPA signatory countries totals US$960 billion per year.</P>

      <P>Herbalife, a U.S.-based personal care direct sales company, will hold its annual
Asia Pacific leadership conference in Taiwan Sept. 11-13, a meeting that is
expected to draw the participation of some 20,000 Herbalife members from home
and abroad.</P>
      <P>William Rahn, managing director of the company's Asia Pacific region, made the
announcement at a news conference Monday that was also attended by Bureau of
Foreign Trade Deputy Director General Chiang Shih-hwang and Tourism Bureau
Deputy Director General David Hsieh Wei-chun.</P>
      <P>Expected to attend the conference at the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang
Exhibition Hall are an estimated 10,000 Herbalife members from Taiwan and
another 10,000 top sales executives from 11 other Asia Pacific countries,
including Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia.</P>
      <P>Foreign sales leaders will stay in Taiwan for at least five days and four
nights. Aside from attending the 3-day conference, they will travel around
Taiwan, according to Lu Jun-han, general manager of Herbalife Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The top sales executives' visit to Taiwan is expected to generate hundreds of
millions of Taiwan dollars of business for local hotels, restaurants, and
transportation providers because each of them earns annual incomes between NT$1

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that the most likely timing
for President Ma Ying-jeou to pay a state visit to Taiwan's diplomatic allies in
Africa is sometime next year.</P>
      <P>Our African allies are glad to know that President Ma has expressed the
willingness to visit them, and the Foreign Ministry will make relative
arrangements,said Andrew Chang, director-general of the MOFA's Department of
African Affairs, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Given the president's tight schedule this year, it will probably be more
possible for him to make such a trip next year, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>Ma said May 25 at the African Day Reception that he was deeply moved by the
solid friendship shown by Taiwan's four diplomatic allies in Africa -- Burkina
Faso, Gambia, Swaziland and Sao Tome and Principe -- which all sent top leaders
to attend his inauguration ceremony May 20, 2008.</P>
      <P>He said he wished to visit these countries during his first term of presidency.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, next year might be the time for Ma to visit Africa because
Burkina Faso will probably hold its presidential election in October 2010. The
Foreign Ministry will plan the state visit once it receives the nod from the
Presidential Office, he added.</P>
      <P>Fresh from a three-leg Central American visit that took him to Belize, Guatemala
and El Salvador, Ma will head for the region again June  29-July  7 to attend
the  inauguration  of  Panamanian President-elect Ricardo Martinelli and visit
two of Taiwan's other Central American diplomatic allies, Nicaragua and
Honduras.</P>
      <P>Ma is also planning to visit the South Pacific in the later half of the year to
attend the Taiwan-South Pacific leaders's summit in the Solomon Islands and to
visit several diplomatic allies in the region.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF), in a bid to boost Chinese tourists arrivals, is
planning to permit the use of the Chinese currency at duty-free shops at the
country's airports and seaports, with effect from early July, a ministry
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The government will revise the relevant regulations to permit transactions of up

      <P>Under the existing regulations  governing the operation of duty-free stores,
foreign currencies and New Taiwan dollars may be used for transactions at duty-
free shops. However, the yuan is not categorized in the regulations as a foreign
currency.</P>
      <P>In an effort to keep step with a government policy of attracting more Chinese
tourists to Taiwan, the ministry is planning to amend the rules to allow duty-

      <P>Yilan County recently showcased gifts specially crafted by its indigenous people
to promote tourism there, hoping that Atayal handicrafts, school bags, and
hunter's banana rice cakes for cyclists will spark visitor interest.</P>
      <P>Yilan County Magistrate Lu Guo-hwa said booths exhibiting and selling these
aboriginal gifts will be incorporated into major tourism promotion activities in
the future by the county government.</P>
      <P>The campaign is aimed at attracting tourists from outside the county and
generating local business opportunities, Lu added.</P>
      <P>Most of Yilan County's indigenous people, mainly the Atayal tribe, live in
Datong and Nanao townships and are skilled at hunting and weaving and manage to
eke out a living by growing vegetables.</P>
      <P>To boost local economy, the county's Department of Indigenous Affairs, in
conjunction with Yilan University, has recreated various traditional gifts by
repackaging existing products and providing guidance on the creation of new
items.</P>
      <P>These  gifts,  which symbolize  Atayal  culture,  emphasize environmental
consciousness and respect concepts of traditional indigenous lifestyles.</P>
      <P>The gifts include racks,  mobile phone bags, coasters and backpacks.</P>
      <P>In addition, the hunter's rice cake wrapped in banana leaves, which was
originally standard fare for Atayal hunters, has now been redesigned for
cyclists to eat during and after their outings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese crew charged with murder found not guilty: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Taiwanese crew members on trial in Mauritius for murdering two people on
their fishing vessel were found not guilty recently and returned to Taiwan June
11, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA is pleased to learn that the Mauritius court ruled the three crew
members not guilty because of insufficient evidence and the lack of credible
testimony,said Andrew Chang, director-general of the MOFA's Department of
African Affairs, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese fishing boat Jui Yin and the 35 people on board, including three
Taiwanese nationals -- the captain, the first mate and one crew member -- were
detained over a year ago by Mauritius police on murder charges after two frozen
corpses were discovered in the vessel's freezer.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Foreign Ministry's representative office in South Africa had
visited the three many times and provided necessary assistance to them during
the trial and was glad to see that the case had come to a happy ending for the
crew members.</P>
      <P>The trial was not the only case related to a Taiwanese fishing boat off Africa's
southeastern coast that the ministry has been monitoring.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boat CT7-0266 MV Chi Jing No. 3 sent out a warning signal May
28 that it was being chased by an unknown ship in the Indian Ocean southeast of
Madagascar, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>The boat, with four Taiwanese nationals, 33 Chinese,  one Indonesian and four
Filipinos on board, was told not to stop by its company in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Foreign Ministry  immediately  reported the situation to the
International Maritime Bureau Piracy Reporting Center in Kuala Lumpur and the
U.S. Navys Fifth Fleet Bahrain headquarters and later learned that the unknown
ship was a revenue cutter belonging to French Reunion, an island situated about
680 kilometers east of Madagascar.</P>
      <P>The revenue cutter was chasing Chi Jing No. 3 because the Taiwanese vessel did
not apply for a permit to pass through the economic zone of Reunion, but the
cutter gave up after a day-long chase because it was smaller than Chi Jing No.
3, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The entire incident was a misunderstanding. However, the Foreign Ministry would
like to urge all Taiwanese deep-sea fishing boats to apply for permits when
passing through other countries' economic zones and to navigate along the
permitted route in order to avoid a similar situation,Chang said.</P>
      <P>Though this is an isolated incident, the MOFA hopes that it will not happen
again because things like this will harm the image and credibility of not only
our ships but also our country, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's net international investment position at the end of 2008 was US$576.7
billion, which kept the country in its rank as the world's sixth largest net
foreign creditor, according to a report released Monday by the Central Bank of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>At the end of 2008, the external assets held by Taiwan were valued at US$877.8
billion, up 1.2 percent from the year-earlier level, mainly due to an increase
in Taiwan's official reserve assets as well as foreign loans and deposits by
Taiwanese banks, the central bank said.</P>
      <P>Residents' portfolio investment, however, shrank by US$60.1 billion, or 24.1
percent, as the private sector holdings of foreign securities decreased in
reaction to the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the country's external liabilities went down 22.5 percent to US$301.1
billion, as a result of lower stock prices and reduced acquisitions of Taiwanese
stocks by foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The net international investment position of US$576.7 billion posted by Taiwan
was lower only than that of Japan, China, Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland,
according to the central bank.</P>
      <P>The United States, with net external liabilities of US$2.44 trillion, was the
world's largest net foreign debtor in 2008, followed by Brazil, France,

      <P>Taiwan was recognized Monday for its contributions  in helping developing
countries  increase their international economic and trading competitiveness
during a meeting in the island nation of Saint Lucia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  Ambassador  to Saint Lucia  Tom Chou told CNA's Washington-based
reporter by phone that Saint Lucia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rufus Bousquet
expressed in his speech at the opening ceremony of the meeting that people of
his country were all grateful for Taiwan's assistance in helping the country in
the Caribbean Sea develop economically and socially over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Bousquet was speaking at the Seminar on Trade Related Assistance in the
Caribbean Area, which opened in Saint Lucia Monday.</P>
      <P>The  seminar  is  jointly  sponsored  by the  Taiwan-based International
Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) and the Agency for International Trade
Information and Cooperation (AITIC), which is headquartered in Geneva,
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Among its assistance to Saint Lucia, Taiwan has been helping its ally since 2008
in establishing a computerized government system to improve administrative
efficiency.</P>
      <P>In the first phase of the program last year, Taiwan assisted St. Lucia with the
development of a crime records management system, as well as an e-system in the
transportation department which features efficient management modules for
vehicle and driver registration and licenses.</P>
      <P>The cooperation program entered its second phrase in May, with Taiwan to assist
the diplomatic ally in building an agricultural information system and an
e-databank and management system for ID cards and birth registration
information.</P>
      <P>Saint Lucia is one of the 23 countries which has diplomatic relations with
Taiwan instead of China.</P>
      <P>A total of 39 representatives from 15 countries attended the three-day seminar
aimed at assisting developing and under-developed countries in following the
international multilateral economic and trading mechanism.</P>
      <P>Discussions at the seminar will focus on tourism, women's social position and
trading efficiency, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The AITIC is an important inter-governmental organization whose goal is to
assist less-advantaged countries to have more effective trade-led  growth
through  personalized   assistance   and capacity-building programs. It is made
of four sponsoring members -- Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland and Taiwan -- and 65
participating members, according to Chou.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City government and EVA Airways jointly launched a campaign in Tokyo
Monday to promote a package of "Good Luck Travel to Taipei" in bid to draw more
Japanese tourists to the Taiwan capital.</P>
      <P>Rosy Chao, deputy chief executive of the Taipei City's Tourism Commission, and
Nie Kuo-wei, CEO of the Taipei-based Evergreen Group, co-chaired the ceremony at
a local exhibition hall. About 80 representatives of Japanese tour agencies and
the media attended the event.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the "Good Luck Travel to Taipei" package is comprised of six
"pleasure routes" that would allow Japanese visitors to explore different facets
of the city. The tours are touted to be able to bring visitors good fortune in
the areas of love, work, finances, health, examinations and competition.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's envoy to Japan John Fang, who delivered an address at the function,
urged Japanese to visit Taipei by buying the special packages.</P>
      <P>Fan said he had purchased two of the tours as a treat for two Japanese workers

      <P>The number of tourist arrivals from Taiwan to Japan totals around 1.4 million
per year, as compared to 1.1 million from Japan to Taiwan. "We hope to push the
number of two-way visitors to 3 million a year by 2010," Chao said after the
news conference.</P>
      <P>Over three-quarters  of Japanese  think that the bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Japan are in good shape and 61 percent are interested in visiting
Taiwan, according to a poll commissioned by the Taiwan representative office in
Japan and conducted by U.S.-based polling company Gallup, Inc. from April 10-19.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior on Tuesday encouraged elderly people and disabled
senior citizens who need long-term care services to apply for government
subsidies for such services.</P>
      <P>The ministry, in conjunction with the Department of Health, launched the subsidy
program last year to meet the rapidly increasing need for long-term care in
Taiwan's aging population.</P>
      <P>Last year, more than 36,000 elderly people were subsidized through the program
which is funded by the central government and operated by local governments, the
ministry said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Many spaces are available on the scheme, which is geared for people aged 65 or
over and disabled people between the ages of 50 and 65.</P>
      <P>The government  provides subsidies in different amounts to eligible applicants
based on the extent of their disability and their families'  economic situation.
People with a higher level of disability and with lower family income will be
granted a higher amount of subsidy, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Normally, the government provides 60 percent of long-term care subsidies for
people from middle-income families, 90 percent for people from lower middle-
income families, and 100 percent for low-income families, the statement
indicated.</P>
      <P>Through the program, people in need of long-term care can continue to live in
their own home if they prefer to do so and would not cause a burden or pressure
on their families because a caregiver is provided, the statement noted.</P>
      <P>People who need long-term care services are encouraged to contact a long-term
care management center in their neighborhood for a family assessment. Further
information is available on the ministry's Web site at: //www.moi.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has the second fastest aging population in the world behind Japan. At
present, people aged over 65 make up 10 percent of the country's population.
Around 2020, the aged population is expected to reach 20 percent in Taiwan, a
recent report said.</P>
      <P>According to the United Nations definition of "aging society, "when the

      <P>With locally grown lemons becoming increasingly popular worldwide, exports of
fresh lemons and lemon juice this year are expected to exceed 800 metric tons,
Hsu Han-chin, chief secretary of the Agriculture and Food Agency, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The southern counties of Pingtung and Kaohsiung are the major lemon-producing
areas in the country. This year, more 2,000 hectares of farmlands have been
dedicated to the cultivation of the Eureka Seedless lemons and other seedless
lemon varieties, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>The total production volume of the crop is estimated at 15,000 tons, down 15
percent from last year due to drastic temperature changes in January and
February, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Despite the drop in production volume, the quality of this year's lemon crop is
still good, and the citrus fruit's popularity among foreign buyers has lead to a
surge in exports, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>The agency has predicted that exports of the fresh fruit will reach 350 tons,
while exports of lemon juice will amount to nearly 500 tons, a sharp increase
from last year's 90 tons, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan grown lemons are mainly exported to Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and China.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping local growers make inroads into foreign markets, the
agency will assist them in expanding domestic sales and in developing other uses
for lemons, Hsu said. Some of the possibilities are lemon essential oil, lemon
honey lozenges, lemon vinegar, and lemon sauce, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Tuesday raised the possibility of expanding the scope
of Taiwan's training program for government officials of its diplomatic allies,
as part of efforts to strengthen bilateral friendship.</P>
      <P>Touching upon the issue during an interview with the CNA, Ma noted that the
"Friend from Afar" program has targeted mainly military and police officers from
Latin American nations and he suggested that the program should also cover
broader issues such as economics, agriculture and health.</P>
      <P>According to the president, such a military-centered training program served the
need of the Latin American allies very well in the past because many of these
countries were governed by military strongmen.</P>
      <P>However, many leftist politicians who have since come to power are paying more
attention  to issues related to the economic development rather than military
issues.</P>
      <P>"If we share Taiwan's national development experience with them (the allies) ,
we should be able to move them and truly help them. They will also feel that
Taiwan is very pragmatic and grassroots (oriented)," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The "Friend from Afar" program was launched as early as the 1960s during the
Cold War era as part of Taiwan's campaign to fight against Communism. Courses
were provided to help Latin American, Middle Eastern and African countries train
their junior military officers, some of whom later became national leaders or
politicians.</P>
      <P>On his administration's foreign aid policy, Ma stressed that in providing aid to
Taiwan's allies, the government will make sure that the work serves legitimate
purposes, follows legal process and achieves effective implementation.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Taiwan has been transferring rice-farming technology to
Belize in a bid to boost rice production in the Central American ally country
and help it become a rice exporter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also provided Belize with tilapia fish farming technology, and the
fish raised using the technology is now being exported to the United States for
processing into fish fillets, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"We should not only teach our diplomatic allies how to fish, but should also
teach them how to sell fish," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about his administration's strategy to promote Taiwan's bid for membership
in the United Nations in September, Ma said the government will only decide on
the matter in August.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the government must be very careful in dealing with
the issue of Taiwan's participation in international organizations because it is
"more sensitive" than issues involving bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Ma added that although the improvement in Taiwan's ties with China over the past
year seems to have facilitated the promotion of Taiwan's  foreign relations,
Taiwan should not be content or light-headed.</P>
      <P>Pointing to Taiwan's recent success in obtaining observer status for the first
time in the World Health Assembly, Ma said the government is watching to see if
the status will open the doors for Taiwan's participation in other activities of
the World Health Organization (WHO), in addition to attending the annual
assembly.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government will not rush into the next step, but will first try to
play a positive role in the WHO to impress other member nations and win their
goodwill.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak provides a good opportunity for
Taiwan to contribute to the international community, because Taiwan is one of
the few countries that are capable of producing a vaccine against the disease,
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New research expected to help develop universal flu vaccine</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong said Tuesday that he has discovered a
way to develop and produce a "universal vaccine" that can protect against most
influenza viruses.</P>
      <P>Wong released the results of his research in a speech titled "Protein
Glycosylation: New Challenges and Opportunities" delivered at the five-day 12th
International Symposium of the Society of Chinese Bioscientists in America
(SCBA) , which opened at Academia Sinica Sunday.</P>
      <P>The  expert  in bio-organic  and synthetic  chemistry  and biocatalysis said his
team found that once the glycoprotein the flu virus uses to cover its existence
is removed, the human immune system can identify it and attack when the virus
invades the body.</P>
      <P>Wong explained that more than 50 percent of the proteins found in humans are
glocosylated, which is why flu virus uses glycoprotein as a disguise.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the protein sequence within the glycoprotein is mostly
conserved, it is theoretically possible to make a molecular vaccine with a flu
virus that has had its disguise removed, therefore allowing the immune system to
identify the virus, Wong said.</P>
      <P>The theoretical molecular vaccine could maintain its anti-flu capability for
several years, unlike the existing virus vaccines, which must be updated every
year to maintain their effectiveness, Wong said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  he noted,  such a molecular  vaccine  could theoretically be used
to fight against almost all kinds of flu virus.</P>
      <P>As the research is still now in the animal testing stages, it will take up to 10
years before a new vaccine is commercially available, Wong said, noting that the
development and manufacture of the vaccine, however, can all be achieved in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he also noted that his team has discovered that breast, lung, large
intestine, ovarian and prostate cancers all have a unique glocoaprotein named
Globo H.</P>
      <P>With this discovery, a molecular vaccine can be developed against those cancers,
Wong said, adding that this work will also be conducted in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF seeks ARATS help over murders of Taiwanese businessmen</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  16  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Tuesday that it had
contacted its Chinese counterpart to help in issues relating to the death of two
Taiwanese businessmen murdered by a Chinese man a day earlier in Dongguan,
Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>Chen Jung-yuan,  director of the SEF's trade and commerce department, said it
sent a letter on Monday to the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) asking for its assistance in dealing with the murders
after the news reached Taipei from Donguan's Dalang township.</P>
      <P>The SEF is also helping the families of the Taiwanese victims to travel to
Dongguan Wednesday to take care of their relatives' remains, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The three men are all from central Taiwan's Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese victims were Lin Yu-teng, a 33-year-old general manager of a
Taiwanese-owned  hardware factory,  the factory's 40-year-old manager named Lai
Chen-jui and its 50-year-old deputy general manager Shao Cheng-chi.  The three
men were attacked Monday at the factory's main gate by Liu Hanhuang, a 26-year-
old worker from Guizhou Province, after negotiations on compensation for Liu's
work-related injury broke down earlier the same day, China's official Xinhua
news agency quoted Chinese security officers as saying.</P>
      <P>Liu's right hand was damaged by a machine while he was at work last September
and had to be amputated.</P>
      <P>Although the company has paid out compensation of 50,000 yuan (US$7,315) for
Liu's injury in line with local labor laws, Liu was not satisfied and filed a
complaint against the company.</P>
      <P>Although Liu and the company executives had agreed to start talks on the issue
again that day, Liu intercepted Lai at the main gate as he was preparing to
leave the company.</P>
      <P>Liu and Lai had a fierce quarrel into which Lin and Shao were drawn.</P>
      <P>During the argument, Liu pulled out a knife and stabbed the three men, Xinhua
said.</P>
      <P>Shao was killed on the spot, while Lin was pronounced dead after being rushed to
a nearby hospital. Lai was seriously injured and had to undergo emergency
treatment at a hospital.  Liu was arrested by Dongguan public security officials
near the factory.</P>
      <P>The incident was the first labor dispute-related murder involving a Taiwanese-
invested business in Dongguan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based SEF is an intermediary organization responsible for cross-
Taiwan Strait exchanges through dealings with the ARATS in the absence of
government-to-government contact.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President proposes expanding training program for allies (update-1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
06/16/09  22:44:56

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Tuesday raised the possibility of expanding the scope
of Taiwan's training program for government officials of its diplomatic allies,
as part of efforts to strengthen bilateral friendship.</P>
      <P>Touching upon the issue during an interview with the CNA, Ma noted that the
"Friend from Afar" program has targeted mainly military and police officers from
Latin American nations and he suggested that the program should also cover
broader issues such as economics, agriculture and health.</P>
      <P>According to the president, such a military-centered training program served the
need of the Latin American allies very well in the past because many of these
countries were governed by military strongmen.</P>
      <P>However, many leftist politicians who have since come to power are paying more
attention  to issues related to the economic development rather than military
issues.</P>
      <P>"If we share Taiwan's national development experience with them (the allies) ,
we should be able to move them and truly help them. They will also feel that
Taiwan is very pragmatic and grassroots (oriented)," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The "Friend from Afar" program was launched as early as the 1960s during the
Cold War era as part of Taiwan's campaign to fight against Communism. Courses
were provided to help Latin American, Middle Eastern and African countries train
their junior military officers, some of whom later became national leaders or
politicians.</P>
      <P>On his administration's foreign aid policy, Ma stressed that in providing aid to
Taiwan's allies, the government will make sure that the work serves legitimate
purposes, follows legal process and achieves effective implementation.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Taiwan has been transferring rice-farming technology to
Belize in a bid to boost rice production in the Central American ally country
and help it become a rice exporter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also provided Belize with tilapia fish farming technology, and the
fish raised using the technology is now being exported to the United States for
processing into fish fillets, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"We should not only teach our diplomatic allies how to fish, but should also
teach them how to sell fish," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about his administration's strategy to promote Taiwan's bid for membership
in the United Nations in September, Ma said the government will only decide on
the matter in August.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the government must be very careful in dealing with
the issue of Taiwan's participation in international organizations because it is
"more sensitive" than issues involving bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Ma added that although the improvement in Taiwan's ties with China over the past
year seems to have facilitated the promotion of Taiwan's  foreign relations,
Taiwan should not be content or light-headed.</P>
      <P>Pointing to Taiwan's recent success in obtaining observer status for the first
time in the World Health Assembly, Ma said the government is watching to see if
the status will open the doors for Taiwan's participation in other activities of
the World Health Organization (WHO), in addition to attending the annual
assembly.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government will not rush into the next step, but will first try to
play a positive role in the WHO to impress other member nations and win their
goodwill.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak provides a good opportunity for
Taiwan to contribute to the international community, because Taiwan is one of
the few countries that are capable of producing a vaccine against the disease,
he said.</P>
      <P>Ma, who will run for the Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship in July said an annual
forum between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party should be kept as a
channel for the exchange of views, but he added that "I will not necessarily
take part in it if I am elected as KMT chairman."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Yilan County promotes tourism through innovative aboriginal gifts</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yilan County recently showcased gifts specially crafted by its indigenous people
to promote tourism there, hoping that Atayal handicrafts, school bags, and
hunter's banana rice cakes for cyclists will spark visitor interest.</P>
      <P>Yilan County Magistrate Lu Guo-hwa said booths exhibiting and selling these
aboriginal gifts will be incorporated into major tourism promotion activities in
the future by the county government.</P>
      <P>The campaign is aimed at attracting tourists from outside the county and
generating local business opportunities, Lu added.</P>
      <P>Most of Yilan County's indigenous people, mainly the Atayal tribe, live in
Datong and Nanao townships and are skilled at hunting and weaving and manage to
eke out a living by growing vegetables.</P>
      <P>To boost local economy, the county's Department of Indigenous Affairs, in
conjunction with Yilan University, has recreated various traditional gifts by
repackaging existing products and providing guidance on the creation of new
items.</P>
      <P>These  gifts,  which symbolize  Atayal  culture,  emphasize environmental
consciousness and respect concepts of traditional indigenous lifestyles.</P>
      <P>The gifts include racks,  mobile phone bags, coasters and backpacks.</P>
      <P>In addition, the hunter's rice cake wrapped in banana leaves, which was
originally standard fare for Atayal hunters, has now been redesigned for
cyclists to eat during and after their outings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese crew charged with murder found not guilty: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Taiwanese crew members on trial in Mauritius for murdering two people on
their fishing vessel were found not guilty recently and returned to Taiwan June
11, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA is pleased to learn that the Mauritius court ruled the three crew
members not guilty because of insufficient evidence and the lack of credible
testimony,said Andrew Chang, director-general of the MOFA's Department of
African Affairs, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese fishing boat Jui Yin and the 35 people on board, including three
Taiwanese nationals -- the captain, the first mate and one crew member -- were
detained over a year ago by Mauritius police on murder charges after two frozen
corpses were discovered in the vessel's freezer.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Foreign Ministry's representative office in South Africa had
visited the three many times and provided necessary assistance to them during
the trial and was glad to see that the case had come to a happy ending for the
crew members.</P>
      <P>The trial was not the only case related to a Taiwanese fishing boat off Africa's
southeastern coast that the ministry has been monitoring.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boat CT7-0266 MV Chi Jing No. 3 sent out a warning signal May
28 that it was being chased by an unknown ship in the Indian Ocean southeast of
Madagascar, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>The boat, with four Taiwanese nationals, 33 Chinese,  one Indonesian and four
Filipinos on board, was told not to stop by its company in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Foreign Ministry  immediately  reported the situation to the
International Maritime Bureau Piracy Reporting Center in Kuala Lumpur and the
U.S. Navys Fifth Fleet Bahrain headquarters and later learned that the unknown
ship was a revenue cutter belonging to French Reunion, an island situated about
680 kilometers east of Madagascar.</P>
      <P>The revenue cutter was chasing Chi Jing No. 3 because the Taiwanese vessel did
not apply for a permit to pass through the economic zone of Reunion, but the
cutter gave up after a day-long chase because it was smaller than Chi Jing No.
3, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The entire incident was a misunderstanding. However, the Foreign Ministry would
like to urge all Taiwanese deep-sea fishing boats to apply for permits when
passing through other countries' economic zones and to navigate along the
permitted route in order to avoid a similar situation,Chang said.</P>
      <P>Though this is an isolated incident, the MOFA hopes that it will not happen
again because things like this will harm the image and credibility of not only
our ships but also our country, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's net international investment position at the end of 2008 was US$576.7
billion, which kept the country in its rank as the world's sixth largest net
foreign creditor, according to a report released Monday by the Central Bank of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>At the end of 2008, the external assets held by Taiwan were valued at US$877.8
billion, up 1.2 percent from the year-earlier level, mainly due to an increase
in Taiwan's official reserve assets as well as foreign loans and deposits by
Taiwanese banks, the central bank said.</P>
      <P>Residents' portfolio investment, however, shrank by US$60.1 billion, or 24.1
percent, as the private sector holdings of foreign securities decreased in
reaction to the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the country's external liabilities went down 22.5 percent to US$301.1
billion, as a result of lower stock prices and reduced acquisitions of Taiwanese
stocks by foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The net international investment position of US$576.7 billion posted by Taiwan
was lower only than that of Japan, China, Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland,
according to the central bank.</P>
      <P>The United States, with net external liabilities of US$2.44 trillion, was the
world's largest net foreign debtor in 2008, followed by Brazil, France,
Australia and Mexico.</P>

      <P>Taiwan was recognized Monday for its contributions  in helping developing
countries  increase their international economic and trading competitiveness
during a meeting in the island nation of Saint Lucia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  Ambassador  to Saint Lucia  Tom Chou told CNA's Washington-based
reporter by phone that Saint Lucia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rufus Bousquet
expressed in his speech at the opening ceremony of the meeting that people of
his country were all grateful for Taiwan's assistance in helping the country in
the Caribbean Sea develop economically and socially over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Bousquet was speaking at the Seminar on Trade Related Assistance in the
Caribbean Area, which opened in Saint Lucia Monday.</P>
      <P>The  seminar  is  jointly  sponsored  by the  Taiwan-based International
Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) and the Agency for International Trade
Information and Cooperation (AITIC), which is headquartered in Geneva,
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Among its assistance to Saint Lucia, Taiwan has been helping its ally since 2008
in establishing a computerized government system to improve administrative
efficiency.</P>
      <P>In the first phase of the program last year, Taiwan assisted St. Lucia with the
development of a crime records management system, as well as an e-system in the
transportation department which features efficient management modules for
vehicle and driver registration and licenses.</P>
      <P>The cooperation program entered its second phrase in May, with Taiwan to assist
the diplomatic ally in building an agricultural information system and an
e-databank and management system for ID cards and birth registration
information.</P>
      <P>Saint Lucia is one of the 23 countries which has diplomatic relations with

a local exhibition hall. About 80 representatives of Japanese tour agencies and
the media attended the event.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the "Good Luck Travel to Taipei" package is comprised of six
"pleasure routes" that would allow Japanese visitors to explore different facets
of the city. The tours are touted to be able to bring visitors good fortune in
the areas of love, work, finances, health, examinations and competition.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's envoy to Japan John Fang, who delivered an address at the function,
urged Japanese to visit Taipei by buying the special packages.</P>

number of two-way visitors to 3 million a year by 2010," Chao said after the
news conference.</P>
      <P>Over three-quarters  of Japanese  think that the bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Japan are in good shape and 61 percent are interested in visiting
Taiwan, according to a poll commissioned by the Taiwan representative office in
Japan and conducted by U.S.-based polling company Gallup, Inc. from April 10-19.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior on Tuesday encouraged elderly people and disabled
senior citizens who need long-term care services to apply for government
subsidies for such services.</P>
      <P>The ministry, in conjunction with the Department of Health, launched the subsidy
program last year to meet the rapidly increasing need for long-term care in
Taiwan's aging population.</P>
      <P>Last year, more than 36,000 elderly people were subsidized through the program
which is funded by the central government and operated by local governments, the
ministry said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Many spaces are available on the scheme, which is geared for people aged 65 or
over and disabled people between the ages of 50 and 65.</P>
      <P>The government  provides subsidies in different amounts to eligible applicants
based on the extent of their disability and their families'  economic situation.
People with a higher level of disability and with lower family income will be
granted a higher amount of subsidy, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Normally, the government provides 60 percent of long-term care subsidies for
people from middle-income families, 90 percent for people from lower middle-
income families, and 100 percent for low-income families, the statement

      <P>Through the program, people in need of long-term care can continue to live in
their own home if they prefer to do so and would not cause a burden or pressure
on their families because a caregiver is provided, the statement noted.</P>
      <P>People who need long-term care services are encouraged to contact a long-term
care management center in their neighborhood for a family assessment. Further
information is available on the ministry's Web site at: //www.moi.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has the second fastest aging population in the world behind Japan. At
present, people aged over 65 make up 10 percent of the country's population.
Around 2020, the aged population is expected to reach 20 percent in Taiwan, a
recent report said.</P>
      <P>According to the United Nations definition of "aging society, "when the
percentage of population of people over 65 years old is more than 7 percent,
that society will be called "aging society".</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan lemon exports expected to hit 800 tons: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With locally grown lemons becoming increasingly popular worldwide, exports of
fresh lemons and lemon juice this year are expected to exceed 800 metric tons,
Hsu Han-chin, chief secretary of the Agriculture and Food Agency, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The southern counties of Pingtung and Kaohsiung are the major lemon-producing
areas in the country. This year, more 2,000 hectares of farmlands have been
dedicated to the cultivation of the Eureka Seedless lemons and other seedless
lemon varieties, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>The total production volume of the crop is estimated at 15,000 tons, down 15
percent from last year due to drastic temperature changes in January and
February, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Despite the drop in production volume, the quality of this year's lemon crop is
still good, and the citrus fruit's popularity among foreign buyers has lead to a
surge in exports, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>The agency has predicted that exports of the fresh fruit will reach 350 tons,
while exports of lemon juice will amount to nearly 500 tons, a sharp increase
from last year's 90 tons, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan grown lemons are mainly exported to Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and China.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping local growers make inroads into foreign markets, the
agency will assist them in expanding domestic sales and in developing other uses
for lemons, Hsu said. Some of the possibilities are lemon essential oil, lemon
honey lozenges, lemon vinegar, and lemon sauce, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President proposes expanding training program for allies</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Tuesday raised the possibility of expanding the scope
of Taiwan's training program for government officials of its diplomatic allies,
as part of efforts to strengthen bilateral friendship.</P>
      <P>Touching upon the issue during an interview with the CNA, Ma noted that the
"Friend from Afar" program has targeted mainly military and police officers from
Latin American nations and he suggested that the program should also cover
broader issues such as economics, agriculture and health.</P>
      <P>According to the president, such a military-centered training program served the
need of the Latin American allies very well in the past because many of these
countries were governed by military strongmen.</P>
      <P>However, many leftist politicians who have since come to power are paying more
attention  to issues related to the economic development rather than military
issues.</P>
      <P>"If we share Taiwan's national development experience with them (the allies) ,
we should be able to move them and truly help them. They will also feel that
Taiwan is very pragmatic and grassroots (oriented)," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The "Friend from Afar" program was launched as early as the 1960s during the
Cold War era as part of Taiwan's campaign to fight against Communism. Courses
were provided to help Latin American, Middle Eastern and African countries train
their junior military officers, some of whom later became national leaders or
politicians.</P>
      <P>On his administration's foreign aid policy, Ma stressed that in providing aid to
Taiwan's allies, the government will make sure that the work serves legitimate
purposes, follows legal process and achieves effective implementation.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Taiwan has been transferring rice-farming technology to
Belize in a bid to boost rice production in the Central American ally country
and help it become a rice exporter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also provided Belize with tilapia fish farming technology, and the
fish raised using the technology is now being exported to the United States for
processing into fish fillets, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"We should not only teach our diplomatic allies how to fish, but should also
teach them how to sell fish," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about his administration's strategy to promote Taiwan's bid for membership
in the United Nations in September, Ma said the government will only decide on
the matter in August.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the government must be very careful in dealing with
the issue of Taiwan's participation in international organizations because it is
"more sensitive" than issues involving bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Ma added that although the improvement in Taiwan's ties with China over the past
year seems to have facilitated the promotion of Taiwan's  foreign relations,
Taiwan should not be content or light-headed.</P>
      <P>Pointing to Taiwan's recent success in obtaining observer status for the first
time in the World Health Assembly, Ma said the government is watching to see if
the status will open the doors for Taiwan's participation in other activities of
the World Health Organization (WHO), in addition to attending the annual
assembly.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government will not rush into the next step, but will first try to
play a positive role in the WHO to impress other member nations and win their
goodwill.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak provides a good opportunity for
Taiwan to contribute to the international community, because Taiwan is one of
the few countries that are capable of producing a vaccine against the disease,
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New research expected to help develop universal flu vaccine</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong said Tuesday that he has discovered a
way to develop and produce a "universal vaccine" that can protect against most
influenza viruses.</P>
      <P>Wong released the results of his research in a speech titled "Protein
Glycosylation: New Challenges and Opportunities" delivered at the five-day 12th
International Symposium of the Society of Chinese Bioscientists in America
(SCBA) , which opened at Academia Sinica Sunday.</P>
      <P>The  expert  in bio-organic  and synthetic  chemistry  and biocatalysis said his
team found that once the glycoprotein the flu virus uses to cover its existence
is removed, the human immune system can identify it and attack when the virus
invades the body.</P>
      <P>Wong explained that more than 50 percent of the proteins found in humans are
glocosylated, which is why flu virus uses glycoprotein as a disguise.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the protein sequence within the glycoprotein is mostly
conserved, it is theoretically possible to make a molecular vaccine with a flu
virus that has had its disguise removed, therefore allowing the immune system to
identify the virus, Wong said.</P>
      <P>The theoretical molecular vaccine could maintain its anti-flu capability for
several years, unlike the existing virus vaccines, which must be updated every
year to maintain their effectiveness, Wong said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  he noted,  such a molecular  vaccine  could theoretically be used
to fight against almost all kinds of flu virus.</P>
      <P>As the research is still now in the animal testing stages, it will take up to 10
years before a new vaccine is commercially available, Wong said, noting that the
development and manufacture of the vaccine, however, can all be achieved in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he also noted that his team has discovered that breast, lung, large
intestine, ovarian and prostate cancers all have a unique glocoaprotein named
Globo H.</P>
      <P>With this discovery, a molecular vaccine can be developed against those cancers,
Wong said, adding that this work will also be conducted in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Tuesday that it had
contacted its Chinese counterpart to help in issues relating to the death of two
Taiwanese businessmen murdered by a Chinese man a day earlier in Dongguan,
Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>Chen Jung-yuan,  director of the SEF's trade and commerce department, said it
sent a letter on Monday to the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) asking for its assistance in dealing with the murders
after the news reached Taipei from Donguan's Dalang township.</P>
      <P>The SEF is also helping the families of the Taiwanese victims to travel to
Dongguan Wednesday to take care of their relatives' remains, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The three men are all from central Taiwan's Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese victims were Lin Yu-teng, a 33-year-old general manager of a
Taiwanese-owned  hardware factory,  the factory's 40-year-old manager named Lai
Chen-jui and its 50-year-old deputy general manager Shao Cheng-chi.  The three
men were attacked Monday at the factory's main gate by Liu Hanhuang, a 26-year-
old worker from Guizhou Province, after negotiations on compensation for Liu's
work-related injury broke down earlier the same day, China's official Xinhua
news agency quoted Chinese security officers as saying.</P>
      <P>Liu's right hand was damaged by a machine while he was at work last September
and had to be amputated.</P>
      <P>Although the company has paid out compensation of 50,000 yuan (US$7,315) for
Liu's injury in line with local labor laws, Liu was not satisfied and filed a
complaint against the company.</P>
      <P>Although Liu and the company executives had agreed to start talks on the issue
again that day, Liu intercepted Lai at the main gate as he was preparing to
leave the company.</P>
      <P>Liu and Lai had a fierce quarrel into which Lin and Shao were drawn.</P>
      <P>During the argument, Liu pulled out a knife and stabbed the three men, Xinhua
said.</P>
      <P>Shao was killed on the spot, while Lin was pronounced dead after being rushed to
a nearby hospital. Lai was seriously injured and had to undergo emergency
treatment at a hospital.  Liu was arrested by Dongguan public security officials
near the factory.</P>
      <P>The incident was the first labor dispute-related murder involving a Taiwanese-
invested business in Dongguan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based SEF is an intermediary organization responsible for cross-
Taiwan Strait exchanges through dealings with the ARATS in the absence of
government-to-government contact.</P>

Taiwan to contribute to the international community, because Taiwan is one of
the few countries that are capable of producing a vaccine against the disease,
he said.</P>
      <P>Ma, who will run for the Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship in July said an annual
forum between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party should be kept as a
channel for the exchange of views, but he added that "I will not necessarily
take part in it if I am elected as KMT chairman."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei flea markets thrive amid economic downturn</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/17/09  13:10:17</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "for lease" signs springing up on business premises in Taiwan are evidence
of how hard enterprises have been hit by the economic downturn in the country.
However, the recession has created an opening for at least one group of
entrepreneurs in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>At two flea markets in Taipei, vendors have seen a boom in sales in the last few
months.</P>
      <P>One of the markets is in the Tienmu area, which is better known as an enclave
for expatriates and the heart of the foreign diplomatic community in Taiwan,
rather than a venue for secondhand street bazaars.</P>
      <P>Located in the Shilin District on the borders of the Beitou hot spring area and
Yangmingshan National Park, Tienmu has typically been a bustling community of
exotic shops, upscale department stores and Western style restaurants.</P>
      <P>But in recent years, businesses have been moving out of Tienmu to newer
commercial areas such as the Xinyi District in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tienmu's response has been to embrace a different kind of business -- one that
now has the area swinging on weekends.</P>
      <P>The Tienmu Marketplace Development Association (TMDA) in July 2007 set up what
it called a creative bazaar in the area, and in June 2008 it opened a flea
market.</P>
      <P>"When Tienmu began to lose its popularity a few years ago, we brainstormed on
how to bring it into the limelight again and attract people from other districts
in Taipei, " TMDA Chairwoman Tang Di told CNA.</P>
      <P>Tang and her associates came up with the idea of a creative bazaar that would
primarily give young people an opportunity to showcase their ideas and start
their own businesses, and a flea market that would offer the unemployed a chance
to make a new start.</P>
      <P>Today, the outdoor bazaar and flea market, jointly dubbed "Weekend Tienmu -- We
Can," have become not only a treasure hunt spot for local residents, but also a
tourist attraction for backpackers from Hong Kong and Japan, Tang said.</P>
      <P>Since the bazaar and flea market opened on the intersection of Zhongshan North
Road and Tienmu East Road, other stalls and shops close by have seen a 30-50
percent growth in business, according to Tang.</P>
      <P>An average 30,000 to 50,000 people flock there every weekend, some to buy and
others to browse, she said. Added to the mix are a number of underground bands
and street performers that liven up the scene.</P>
      <P>Huang Shen-chieh, a bartender and part-time vendor at the Tienmu bazaar, said
that he began selling secondhand clothes and shoes there after he and his
brother were forced to close their organic food store.</P>
      <P>The weekend flea market and bazaar started out as fun event for him, Huang said,
adding that it is also a way of exercising his social responsibility.</P>
      <P>"It is never about money. The main idea is to be environmental friendly and make
the best use of everything, " he said, as he collected NT$10 from a customer who
had picked out a white tank top.</P>
      <P>"Secondhand goods gain fresh value when they are sold to new owners," he said.
"What's even better is that I get to know all these cool people. This is very
good life experience."</P>
      <P>Registration for a spot at the bazaar is open every Monday and the fee ranges
from NT$100-NT$200, although sometimes there are free places for the
underprivileged, Tang said. However, it takes some luck to get a spot, as there
are usually 500 people registering, on average, while only 200 places are
available for vendors at the market Friday to Sunday, she added.</P>
      <P>This enthusiasm for secondhand trade is also evident at the Yongchun Traditional
Market in Songshan District, where the second floor is dedicated to a weekend
flea market.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsiu-yu, chairwoman of the Yongchun Traditional Market Association, said
that the space was empty for three years before she came up with the idea in
October 2007 to open a flea market there.</P>
      <P>It has since grown from five to 180 vendors per week, with many more applicants
on the waiting list, Huang said. The number of vendors has increased to full
capacity since the economic downturn hit last autumn, she added.</P>
      <P>"For NT$200 a day, anyone can have his or her own business, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>The Yongchun Flea Market, which sells mainly secondhand clothes, shoes,
household items, used books, body products and accessories, is the only indoor
bazaar in Taiwan and that attracts thousands of people every weekend, according
to Huang.</P>
      <P>"When the economy is down, more people come to the flea market to save money, "
Huang said. "They will not buy anything unless it is a good deal."</P>
      <P>Celine Hu, a tour guide and manager of a travel agency, has been a vendor at the
Yongchun flea market for 18 months. She says her bags and clothes, mostly new,
are usually sold at 50-60 percent off of the original price.</P>
      <P>Hu said that although the flea market venture is a hobby and not her primary
source of income, she strives to provide a good service.</P>
      <P>"Everything, even if secondhand, could still be of value to someone, " Hu said.
"I want to show the best of what I have and satisfy my customers because I take
this part-time work seriously."</P>
      <P>Chen Ting-ju, a post-graduate student, who bought a second hand Louis Vuitton
bag at the market for NT$2,000, agreed that "one person's junk could be
another's treasure."</P>
      <P>As the squeeze continues from the economic downturn, Huang said, people who are
thinking of starting their own business need to have the right mindset, and the
Yongchun flea market might be a good testing ground.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes there is a big gap between reality and a person's ideals, " she said.
"Those who have lost their jobs or who have just graduated from school and are
interested in starting a business can try here first."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan needs to boost public awareness on climate change: EU envoy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
06/17/09  13:42:53
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union's top envoy in Taiwan said Wednesday that Taiwan needs to
boost public awareness on climate change and pass legislation sooner than later
on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of a worldwide effort to mitigate
global warming.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's public opinion may be aware of climate change but probably does not
realize the gravity of the problem, Guy Ledoux, head of the Taipei-based
European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) , told the Central News Agency in an
exclusive interview before opening a major exhibition on climate change at
Taipei City Hall Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Ledoux, a recent opinion poll conducted by the Taiwan Public
Opinion Studies Association showed that the top three environmental issues of
concern were landscape preservation, air quality improvement and water quality
improvement.</P>
      <P>A similar poll in the EU found that 87 percent of Europeans cited climate change
as their top environmental concern, leading Ledoux to suggest that people in
Taiwan have yet to link what's happening and the issue of climate change, Ledoux
said.</P>
      <P>That is why his office is co-organizing the exhibition on climate change with
the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) and the Taipei City government
to raise local awareness of the urgency of the global warming problem, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's 26th largest economy and produces around 1 percent of the
world's total greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Also, 2009 is a very important year for the world in its fight against global
warming, as the international community is to gather in Copenhagen in December
to decide on the level of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, according to
Ledoux.</P>
      <P>The EU has adopted legally-binding measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
to an average of 20 percent below the 1990 level by the year 2020 and is
prepared to further increase this effort if other partners take on comparable
commitments in a new international agreement, he added.</P>
      <P>No one in the world is doing enough,Ledoux acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Hailing the Legislative Yuan's passage of a statute on the development of
renewable energy June 12 as "a step in the right direction, " the top EU envoy
to Taiwan said his office strongly encourages the legislature to pass the long
pending Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act, as it would spur more investment in new
industries and could increase Taiwan's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan in many areas tries to follow trends set by international agreements. I
think in this field Taiwan will also try to do its part to contribute to
international objectives,Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>In addition to ongoing EU-Taiwan cooperation on monitoring CO2 in the atmosphere
and at sea, Ledoux suggested the two sides beef up synergies in the private
sector on new technologies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the EU Commission has offered to exchange information with Taiwan on
how its emission trading scheme can be applied in the country by inviting
officials from the EPA to visit Brussels this year, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony of the exhibition, EPA Minister Stephen  Shu-
hung  Shen said sustainability  is now the prime consideration in the
formulation of national policies and that the EPA has already developed schemes
on greenhouse gas auditing, registry, verification and voluntary reduction.</P>
      <P>The EETO's climate change exhibition, which consists of 20 large panels and a
globe showing that the earth's climate is changing due to human activity, will
be presented in the atrium of Taipei City Hall June 17-19 and July 4-8.</P>
      <P>It will then go on tour in October and November to National Taiwan University,
National Chung Hsing University, National Sun Yat-sen University and National
Dong Hwa University.</P>

inclusion of Taiwan's stock exchange as a candidate to be upgraded to developed

      <P>Yen Ching-chang, chairman of Yuanta Financial Holding Co., said that the
inclusion -- announced Tuesday -- will help improve Taiwan's international image
and lead foreign investors to increase the proportion of their portfolios
invested in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MSCI said Taiwan gained consideration for developed market status after making
market reforms in recent months, and MSCI analysts will visit Taiwan in the
coming months to gain a better understanding of the Taiwanese equity market and
its performance.</P>
      <P>Analysts have projected that the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TAIEX) will be formally
classified as a developed market in 2010 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan is still part of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Developed
market status can provide boosts to local bourses because some investors are
only allowed to invest in developed markets.</P>

      <P>The following are selected excerpts from local newspaper editorials Wednesday:</P>
      <P>China Times: On President Ma's plan to lead the ruling party</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with CommonWealth magazine, President Ma Ying-jeou  said
the ruling Kuomintang  should nominate  proper candidates for the year-end local
elections and make sure that they do not turn corrupt after being elected. The
remarks indicate that Ma is ready to confront the complex politics of exchanging
favors within the KMT after he is elected party chairman.</P>
      <P>After identifying the problems of his party, Ma must seek solutions quickly. He
should not only persuade his administration and party to accept his ideas for
reforms but should also learn to truly listen to others' opinions. Moreover, he
should learn to accept opinions different from his own in order to realize a
uniform party-government  leadership  that is different  from the past
authoritarian period.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On random killings by teenagers</P>
      <P>The killing of a young man by five drunken teenagers in Hsinchu last week was
the latest in a string of acts of random violence committed by adolescents in
recent months.</P>
      <P>We cannot definitely judge where the real problems lie, but the regression of
the roles of parents and schools in the socialization process of teenagers is
indeed a serious problem. The phenomenon of teenagers killing others
spontaneously and randomly demonstrates that families, schools and society are
all out of order.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On President Ma's plan to lead the ruling party</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's strong-willed policy to open up Taiwan to China and his
recent plan to serve concurrently as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang are
evidence of the emergence of a new strongman in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For Ma, "linking Taiwan to China" is definitely not just a slogan. He leans
toward China and curries favor with China in everything he does. He attempts to
adopt China's criteria in dealing with issues including employment, education,
cross-Taiwan Strait marriages,  freedom, democracy, human rights, national
defense, foreign affairs and the judiciary.</P>
      <P>When enjoying the benefits of the liberalization policy, the public must not
overlook the hug cobweb that the KMT and the Chinese communists are cooperating
to build. They are ready to prey on Taiwan after it is trapped by increasing its
reliance on China.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: On President Ma's plan to lead the ruling party</P>
      <P>In discussing the issue of President Ma Ying-jeou's plan to serve concurrently
as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, the possible impact on cross-Taiwan Strait
policy is one of the most worrying.</P>
      <P>As leader of the ruling party, Ma would be able to visit China to hold talks
with his Chinese Communist Party counterpart Hu Jintao, without being subject to
any political monitoring.</P>
      <P>With the Legislative Yuan having become the president's rubber stamp and most
media outlets bought off by him, how would the public express its opposition to
his cross-strait policy? Wouldn't they be forced to take to the streets?</P>

      <P>Four documentaries that explore Taiwan's unique nature and culture premiered in
Taipei Tuesday and will be broadcast as part of the "Taiwan to the World 3"
series on National Geographic Channel Taiwan every Sunday from June 21.</P>
      <P>The series, a joint effort of the Government Information Office (GIO) and
National Geographic Channels International, will be aired in 165 countries in 34
languages.</P>
      <P>At the premiere, GIO Minister Su Jun-pin said he decided to support the project
after watching nine previous "Taiwan to the World" documentaries and finding
they presented the beauty of Taiwan to the world without overt government
propaganda.</P>
      <P>The magnitude of the success of the series has been beyond expectations, Su
said, attributing it to the concerted effort of Taiwan-based production teams
and international professionals.</P>
      <P>The four latest documentaries were produced by local teams in collaboration with
professionals from the United States, Canada, Spain and South Africa, according
to Geoff Daniels, senior vice president of National Geographic Channels
International's development and production section.</P>
      <P>One of the documentaries is Typhoon Hunter, a joint undertaking by Taiwan, the
United States and Japan, which documented Taiwan's studies on typhoons. During
the film's production, four airplanes with weather detection systems were used
to track the eyes of typhoons and reveal the secret of the brewing, formation
and onset of a typhoon.</P>
      <P>Another program, called River Tracer, presents unique images of Taiwan's rivers
and creeks and the fun and thrill of river tracing. It also shows different
geographic conditions for river tracing in Taiwan, Japan and Italy.</P>
      <P>Hip Hop Nation depicts stories of Taiwan's hip hop dancers venturing into
American music circles and how they were transformed from nobodies into
celebrities.</P>
      <P>The other one is Tomb Raptor, a documentary on the migration patterns of the
endangered grey-faced buzzard--an Asian bird of prey. Film producers shot
footage in both Taiwan and Japan to capture the species' migration to Northeast
Asia in early April and back to Taiwan in mid-October.</P>

      <P>Malignant tumors were the top cause of death in Taiwan in 2008 for the 27th
consecutive year, according to statistics released by the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cancerous tumors caused a death every 13 minutes 30 seconds in 2008, 25 seconds
faster than the previous year, the figures showed.</P>
      <P>According to the yearly DOH report on death rates in Taiwan, the number of
Taiwanese who died in 2008 surpassed 140,000 for the first time, but the
mortality rate fell by 1.5 percent to 484.3 per 100,000 people.</P>
      <P>The DOH suggested the decline could be related to Taiwan's aging population and
a decline in the number of deaths caused by chronic diseases, the report said.</P>
      <P>Malignant tumors were responsible for 27.3 percent of all deaths in the country
in 2008, followed by heart disease (11.1 percent) , cerebrovascular disease (7.5
percent) , pneumonia (6.1 percent) , diabetes (5.6 percent) , accidents (5
percent) , lower chronic respiratory disease (3.8 percent) ,  chronic liver
disease and cirrhosis (3.5 percent) , suicide (2.9 percent) , and nephritis,
nephritic syndrome and nephrosis (2.8 percent).</P>
      <P>Of the fatality rates, only those for pneumonia and suicide rose last year,
recording year-on-year growth of 6.5 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The greatest declines in death rates were seen for chronic liver disease and
accidents, with both falling 6.4 percent, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The rate of death caused by cancer declined by 0.1 percent in 2008 to 133.7 per
100,000 people, with 38,913 people dying from the disease.</P>
      <P>There was no change in the order of top cancer killers. Lung cancer was
responsible for the most cancer deaths (20 percent) , followed by liver cancer
(19.7 percent), and colon and rectum cancer (11 percent).</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top 10 were breast cancer, stomach cancer, oral cancer,
prostate cancer, cervical cancer, esophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EU-Taiwan trade volume down in 2008 due to global recession: EETO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
06/17/09  17:07:32
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Total trade volume between the European Union and Taiwan contracted by 9 percent
in 2008 and European exports to Taiwan fell for the first time since 2001 as a
consequence of the global economic downturn, according to a report released by
the Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO).</P>
      <P>The 9 percent decline is significant based on general trade barometers,
according to Guy Ledoux, head of the Taipei-based European Economic and Trade
Office (EETO).</P>
      <P>According to the World Bank, the volume of global trade increased by 3 percent
in 2008, and EU trade with Japan decreased by only 4 percent and remained
unchanged with South Korea.</P>
      <P>While the economic downturn is the main explanation for this downturn, it is
more difficult to understand why EU-Taiwan trade has been more affected than EU
trade with other partners,Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>He suggested the steeper decline might be related to the type of products traded
between the EU and Taiwan, which may have been more sensitive to the economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>The 2009 EU-Taiwan trade and investment fact file on 2008 EU-Taiwan trade also
showed that Taiwan fell from 13th to 21st place among EU trading partners while
the EU remained Taiwan's fourth largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>The drop in ranking mainly results from the jump by oil and gas exporting
countries -- Algeria, Ukraine, Libya -- on the back of high oil prices in the
first part of 2008,the report said.</P>
      <P>"This will come back to normal next year, Ledoux added.</P>
      <P>The structure of trade shows the EU is still a key industrial partner for
Taiwan, with the most imported products office and telecommunication equipment
and the biggest exports to Taiwan power and non-electrical machinery and
chemicals.</P>
      <P>Germany remained Taiwan's largest trading partner within the EU due to its
leading position in machine tools and other mechanical equipment.</P>
      <P>The report noted, however, that the EU still has not exploited the full
potential of the Taiwanese market.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan in 2008 took steps on the way to joining the World Trade
Organization Government Procurement Agreement, there are still a number of
market access issues. European businesses, for their part, do not sufficiently
explore the potential of the Taiwanese market,the report said.</P>
      <P>As to investment flows, the EU is no longer the biggest holder of foreign direct
investment (FDI) in Taiwan. With its 26.35 percent share of total FDI in Taiwan
as of the end of 2008, the EU trailed behind the United States' 35.23 percent
share of FDI holdings.</P>
      <P>"This is mainly due to the lack of fresh foreign capital and general  caution of
investors,  and does not signify shifting importance in the bilateral trade
relationship,the report said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the EU was only the 10th leading destination for Taiwan's outward
investment, the report said that Taiwan is not fully using its opportunities to
invest in the large European market, which deserves more attention from the
country.</P>
      <P>In terms of people-to-people exchanges, the report said the number of students,
businesses and tourists coming from Europe to Taiwan have increased, but the
number of visas requested from Taiwan to the EU fell sharply in 2008. by 23
percent year on year, with only 218,411 visas in total issued.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the sharp drop to a strong euro and the economic crisis
that hit the world in the second half of 2008.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the report said that a significant increase is expected in

      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported three new cases of swine flu Wednesday,
including one that was contracted locally.</P>
      <P>All three cases were Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>The confirmation of these cases brought to 58 the total number of recorded
influenza A(H1N1) infections in the country, the Central Epidemics Command
Center (CECC) said.</P>
      <P>The latest indigenous case -- the second one diagnosed so far -- was a 25-year-
old woman who contracted the virus from her mother, according to the CEC. The
mother was diagnosed with A(H1N1) Monday, five days after her return from the

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's future should be decided by its people: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has advocated that Taiwan's future should be decided by
the country's people and this advocacy is his only option in terms of cross-
Taiwan  Strait relations, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang reiterated Ma's commitment in response to a report carried that same day by
the local daily Liberty Times, which questioned Ma's latest statement regarding
his "no unification" stance. The paper argued that Ma's recent statement  in an
interview  with the Commonwealth Magazine clearly underlines that unification is
the Ma Administration's "ultimate goal."</P>
      <P>Wang argued that the paper "intentionally misinterpreted" Ma's words.</P>
      <P>Ma stated in the interview that according to polls, 80 percent of the country's
citizens  agree  with his "no unification,  no independence and no provocation
of war" commitment.</P>
      <P>But Ma added that "no unification" does not mean exclusion of unification  as an
option.  The  commitment  means  that  his administration will not touch the
unification issue during the next seven years of his potential tenure --
assuming that he is re-elected -- because there will be no answers to the issue
during the next seven years and discussions on it would be meaningless, Ma said
in the interview.</P>
      <P>Wang said Ma shares the concept  of "no unification,  no independence and no use
of force" with the majority of the people in Taiwan toward cross-strait
relations, in other words, maintaining the status quo in political terms.</P>
      <P>On the "no independence" statement, the president explained that different
political parties maintain different agendas on Taiwan's future. For the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), seeking de jure independence will never be an option, because
Taiwan is already an independent nation and there is no need for it to struggle
for de jure independence.</P>
      <P>Ma was also asked during the interview about his decision to run for the KMT
chairmanship. Ma said that his plan to serve concurrently as the nation's
president and as ruling party chairman is not intended to expand his
presidential power, but rather to more effectively fulfill his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed hope that his bid will be supported by the party members in the
interest of facilitating closer cooperation between the ruling party and the
administration and achieving more effective government.</P>
      <P>"If I assume the party chairmanship, the KMT will serve as a platform for
communication between the administration and the party, while the Cabinet will
remain the decision-making and executive body," he said.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has denied a report published Wednesday that
said Taiwan wanted to hold the next round of talks with China earlier than
scheduled to expedite the signing of an agreement on economic cooperation with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"How could that be possible? " wondered MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He said the two sides have yet to hold a work meeting to pave the way for an
official meeting between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung and Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"As the accords signed in the previous round of negotiations in April in Nanjing
have yet to take effect, how could it be possible for the two sides to discuss
the planned topics projected for the next round of negotiations or touch on the
date of the talks now, " Fu added.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang said Wednesday that the only thing
that is sure about the fourth round of talks with China is that they will be
held in Taiwan, but he insisted he had not heard anything about any other
details related to the meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have to date agreed to discuss  two-way cooperation  on  farm
produce  quarantines,  standard  product certification and the avoidance of
double taxation at the fourth round of talks.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Commercial Times reported Wednesday that the talks might be
held in late July or August rather than late in the year to expedite the signing
of an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>The paper reported that Taiwan and China have been making arrangements for
signing such an agreement.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that if conditions allow, an ECFA could be
clinched during the fourth round of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based  Chinese National Federation of Industries published a white

the formation of a regional trade bloc between the Association of Southeast

    <HEADLINE>Hepatitis C patients tend to develop liver cancer: researcher</HEADLINE>

06/17/09  18:17:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>People infected with hepatitis C have an approximately five times greater risk
of developing liver cancer than those with hepatitis B, and have a 10 times risk
of liver cancer if they also drink alcohol, Michael Ming-Chiao Lai, an Academia
Sinica academician specializing in life sciences, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in a keynote speech at the 12th Society of Chinese
Bioscientists in America International Symposium held by Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Lai, who is also president of National Cheng Kung University, said there are
five types of hepatitis viruses -- A, B, C, D and E. The hepatitis viruses A and
E can cause acute hepatitis, while the hepatitis B, C, and D viruses can cause
chronic hepatitis.</P>
      <P>Before a hepatitis B vaccine was developed, up to 90 percent of liver cancer was
caused by hepatitis B. At present, as no vaccine is yet available against
hepatitis C, half of the liver cancer cases in southern Taiwan are associated
with hepatitis C, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need to develop hepatitis C vaccine as medications for
hepatitis C treatment have been found ineffective for most patients and could
cause side effects, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Patients with hepatitis B have 100 times higher risk of liver cancer than people
who don't have hepatitis infection. Most people are infected with hepatitis C
virus when they grow up and the duration of infection of the virus is normally
shorter than that of people with hepatitis B virus, so under the circumstance,
hepatitis C patients should have relatively low risk of liver cancer, Lai said.</P>
      <P>However, if people who infected with hepatitis B and hepatitis C at the same
time, hepatitis C patients have five times higher risk of liver cancer than
hepatitis B patients, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in Taiwan is 2 percent, with the
highest prevalence seen in a village in southern Taiwan, where 60 percent of the
residents are infected with the virus, Lai noted.</P>
      <P>Between 50 percent and 80 percent of those infected with hepatitis C have a
tendency to develop chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and carcinoma of the
liver, Lai went on, adding that if hepatitis C patients drink alcohol or eat
fatty food, their risk of developing liver cancer will be 10 times higher than
that if they do not.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that hepatitis C patients refrain from drinking alcohol, eating
fatty foods and taking uncertified medicines. He also advised them to undergo
ultrasound examinations every four months for timely treatment.</P>

pavilion Thursday at the Beijing International Travel Expo 2009 that will run

Chin-jui announced Wednesday at a news conference in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Taiwan welcomes Chinese people wishing to visit and that the theme of
the Taiwan pavilion at the Beijing tourism expo revolves around this point to
allow visitors to get a feel for Taiwan's charm and vigor and the hospitality of
its people.</P>
      <P>A total of 33 travel agencies from around Taiwan, including Taipei City, Taipei
County,  Miaoli County, Nantou County and Kaohsiung City, have sent officials to
participate in the fair.</P>
      <P>Chin Hui-chu, Taipei County tourism bureau chief, and local government
representatives  from Nantou,  Miaoli and Kaohsiung, introduced tourist spots
and folk rituals from their areas at the news conference.</P>
      <P>Speaking after the news conference, Chin encouraged Taiwan's tourism operators
to offer high-end quality services to foreign tourists, as even larger numbers
of Chinese tourists are expected to flock to Taiwan in the years to come.</P>
      <P>Chin urged the government to honor President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promise
that the current daily quota imposed on Chinese tourists should be increased
from 3,000 in the first year to 5,000 in the second year and 7,000 in the third
year.</P>
      <P>Since July last year, a maximum 3,000 Chinese tourists have been permitted to
enter Taiwan per day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai Jui-long, secretary-general of the Kaohsiung City tourism bureau,
pushed carriers to open more cross-Taiwan Strait flights between Kaohsiung City
and destinations in China to better serve southern Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>Lai gave his assurance that passenger loads will not be a problem, as the

festival, now in its 10th year.</P>
      <P>The strapless panty is designed with a flexible internal frame that hugs and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The suicide mortality rate rose by 3.3 percent in 2008 from the previous year,
according to a Department of Health (DOH) report released Wednesday,  an
increase that one psychiatrist said could be linked to the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Suicide was the ninth top cause of death in Taiwan last year, up one notch from
the 2007, the DOH report on 2008 death rates in Taiwan showed.</P>
      <P>Psychiatrist Chang Chia-ming from the DOH-run Suicide Prevention Center said
that the highest suicide mortality rate was among elderly people suffering from
chronic diseases, with the suicides rate in this group at 36.6 per 100,000
population in 2008.</P>
      <P>He speculated that the major reason why people in this category commit suicide
is because they do not wish to live a life racked by long-term illness. However,
the reasons behind acts of suicide are often complicated, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted that the suicide rate in the 25-44 age group rose in 2008 by
8.1 percent -- the steepest increase registered among the different age
categories. This could be related to the economic downturn as people in this age
group are the main breadwinners in the family, he said.</P>
      <P>However, "there's no evidence to prove that the suicides were related to
economic factors, " he added, reiterating that the underlying reasons are often
complex.</P>
      <P>The DOH report showed that cancer was the number one cause of death in the
country  in 2008,  followed  by heart  disease, cerebrovascular disease,
pneumonia, diabetes, accidents, chronic respiratory disease, chronic liver
disease and cirrhosis, suicide, nephritis, nephritic syndrome and nephrosis.</P>
      <P>Notably, the accident fatality rate fell 6.4 percent from the previous year --
the largest drop among the listed causes of death in 2008.</P>
      <P>The number of people who died in accidents last year was 7,077, representing a
crude death rate of 30.8 per 100,000 population, the lowest in nearly 20 years,

      <P>Six swimmers from Taiwan and mainland China swam across a section of the Taiwan
Strait Wednesday to test the waters in preparation for a historic mass swim
across the Taiwan Strait slated for Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>The eight swimmers, including two from Taiwan and four from China, took two
hours and 20 minutes from Fujian Province's port city of Xiamen in southeastern
China to Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen. This was a test swim prior to the
first Kinmen-Xiamen mass crossing that will be attempted by 100 swimmers from
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The eight swimmers kicked off an at 11: 40 a.m. from Xiamen's Yefengzhai Beach
and came ashore on Shuangkou Beach on Hsiao Kinmen, a small islet west of
Kinmen, completing a distance of 8.5 km.</P>
      <P>A professional swimmer, Lin Jiayong from China, finished first in a time of 1:
29: 23.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese swimmer Ni Sheng-liang, 46, completed the distance in 2: 10: 00 to
become the first Taiwanese to legally swim from Xiamen to Kinmen in 60 years.</P>
      <P>Ni said the swim was more complicated than he had anticipated, as the currents
were more unpredictable than he had imagined.</P>
      <P>The swimmers covered an actual distance of about 8 km from Yefengzhai Beach to
Shuangkou Beach due to the pull of the ocean currents, although the direct
distance between the two points is about 6 km.</P>
      <P>The other four Chinese swimmers did not make it to Hsiao Kinmen and were ferried
back to Xiamen by two rubber boats.</P>
      <P>The historic mass swim is being sponsored by the Kinmen county government and
the Xiamen city government.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to minimize the risks involved in the venture, the sponsors
decided to allow test swims June 17 and July 17 so that the swimmers could
assess the conditions in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Kinmen county government will remove the spear-like anti-
landing barricades from the Shuangkou Beach 20 days before the Aug. 15 mass swim
to allow the swimmers easier access.</P>
      <P>The barricades, erected in the shallow waters of the beach during the Cold War
era to block landing craft from China, will be replaced after the event,

donate a children's club to Taiwan and that the purpose of his visit is to check
out the location of the club and the plan for establishing the center.</P>
      <P>Yu declined to reveal the amount of his donation.</P>
      <P>The proposed children's club will include medical facilities, a library, an
amusement park and a hotel.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yu said that he will take the opportunity to visit his old friends
in Taiwan and stressed that he has a deep affection for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about his previous promise to give all his assets to charity, leaving
nothing to his offspring, Yu said: "If my sons are not as capable as I am, it
would not help if I leave them money; while if they are more capable than me,
why should I leave them money?"</P>
      <P>During his three-day visit here, Yu will also meet President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Yu is well-known for being the owner of famous kung fu actor Bruce Lee's last
residence in Hong Kong before his death in 1973. Yu agreed this year to donate
the house, which will be restored to its original state and turned into a

    <TEXT>
      <P>A flock of distinctive azure-winged magpies along the coast of Tainan City in
southern Taiwan is growing larger, giving rise to concerns among local bird
watchers that the alien species might threaten the survival of the common
magpies in the city.</P>
      <P>According to the Wild Bird Society of Tainan, the magpies with the blue wings
and tail are believed to have been imported from China.</P>
      <P>The members of the society said that some of the imported birds were probably
released into the wild for religious reasons, or they escaped from cages, then
settled in the coastal region.</P>
      <P>The coastal flock, which is now comprised of 40-50 birds, began to gather more
than five years ago, the society estimated.</P>
      <P>Mature azure-winged magpies -- which belong to the crow family -- are 31-35
centimeters long, which means they are smaller than the common magpies
frequently seen in the downtown areas of Tainan.</P>
      <P>A member of the society Lee Yu-jen, who has been observing the alien magpies for
five years, said they like to hop around. But Lee said that he has not been able
to take any photos detailed enough to study the birds, nor has he ever found any
of their nests.</P>
      <P>The common magpie, which is black and white, was selected as the bird of Tainan
in 2005. However, Lee said this is also an alien species from mainland China
that was introduced into Taiwan during the Ching dynasty.</P>
      <P>According to Tainan city statistics, its population of common magpies stands at
around 1,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Irwin mangoes gain popularity in Japan: Tainan county chief</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan-grown  Irwin  mangoes  have successfully hit the Japanese market this
year, as more than half of the 10,000 cases especially prepared for retail sales
in Japan have been sold, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"As of Tuesday, some 5,400 cases of Irwin mangoes were sold at Japanese
department stores and through online shopping sites, " Su told a news conference
while reporting on his six-day mango promotional tour to Japan.</P>
      <P>Although Su took pride in seeing increased exports of the fruit to Japan in
recent years, he, however, said the mangoes will have to be improved to do even
better in the Japanese market in the future.</P>
      <P>"To make greater breakthrough in the Japanese market, the next step will be
developing more advanced techniques to plant the fruit and make it more
competitive in Japan," Su said.</P>
      <P>Some Japanese retailers were shown on local TV commenting that due to some of
the Taiwan's mangoes having black spots on them, it made it difficult for them
to sell the mangoes to some Japanese consumers known for not only wanting tasty,
but perfect-looking fruits.</P>
      <P>Keen to help promote the fruit to Japanese consumers, Su led a group of Tainan
County officials to Tokyo, Osaka, and Ishikawa and Hokkaido prefectures from
June 12-16.</P>
      <P>Based on last year's success, which saw 2,000 cases of Irwin mangoes sold in two
weeks in the Japanese market, Tainan County in southern Taiwan again launched a
special promotional sale of the fruit targeting Japanese consumers this year in
conjunction with a private Taiwan-Japan joint venture company.</P>
      <P>The Irwin mangoes, labeled as "Midsummer's Ruby" exclusively for the quality-
conscious Japanese market, are being sold in Hankyu Department  Store  and
online  shopping  sites,  such  as www.rakuten.co.jp. -- Japan's largest of its
kind.</P>
      <P>An executive at Japan's Yamato Transport Co., Ltd., said last weekend that the
10,000 cases, which each contains three mangoes and sell for 2,800 yen (US$28)
on the Internet and 6,300 yen at the department store, respectively, should be
sold out by early July. Orders have begun pouring in since early June, he noted.</P>
      <P>"We hope to present Taiwan's Irwin mangoes as a 'cheap and good' alternative to
the more pricey mangoes produced in Japan's Miyazaki Prefecture," the Japanese
executive noted.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County government has promoted the fruit since 2004 and has made
successful inroads into the Japanese, South Korean and Australian markets, which
has helped push up the price of local mangoes, county officials said.</P>
      <P>Japan is the No. 1 overseas market of Taiwan's agricultural and farm product
exports, according to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>In 2008, Taiwan fruit shipments to Japan hit US$22.72 million, accounting for 54
percent of the country's total fresh fruit exports last year, COA statistics
showed. Taiwan's 2008 mango exports to Japan were worth US$5.21 million.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education launched a "Taiwan Has Taste" campaign Wednesday to
inspire local people to lead a life that prizes moral values, work quality and
fine taste.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou attended the campaign's inaugural ceremony at the Taipei
Main Station, marking the first time that he has presided over the launch of a
public education program since he assumed the presidency more than a year ago.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Ma said he hopes the campaign will become a new life
movement to instill a new spirit and taste for morality and quality into the
everyday lives of people.</P>
      <P>"Challenges and tricks abound in our society. We need to value good character,
ethical conduct, qualitative upgrades and tasteful lifestyles  to maintain
social  order  and  sustain  national development," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has upheld two principles -- "Engage people with sincerity and
work with devotion and diligence" -- as his mottos throughout his life, Ma said
he believes those values conform to the main goals of the "Taiwan Has Taste"
campaign.</P>
      <P>The campaign is also expected to complement the Executive Yuan's policy of
accelerating development of six new emerging industries -- creative and culture
industry, tourism, medical and health care, green energy, biotechnology and
refined agriculture, Ma said. This development will help to upgrade the quality
of life for local people, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Education Cheng Jui-cheng said Taiwan
is already a cultured society with good taste. Nevertheless, he said, there is
still ample room for improvement.</P>
      <P>"A spate of violence and drug abuse cases on school campuses and aimless
killings involving adolescents indicate that there are still problems that need
to be addressed with immediate and effective measures such as this campaign to
cultivate a taste for good character and good work quality," Cheng added.</P>
      <P>Celebrities from various fields, including Cloud Gate Dance Theatre founder and
artistic director Lin Hwei-min, lyricist Fang Wen-shan, and Olympic taekwondo
athlete Su Li-wen, and senior executives of major cultural foundations
established by prominent business groups such as Quanta Computer Inc. attended
the inaugural ceremony to throw their support behind the campaign.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported three new cases of swine flu Wednesday,
including one that was contracted locally.</P>
      <P>All three cases were Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>The confirmation of these cases brought to 58 the total number of recorded
influenza A(H1N1) infections in the country, the Central Epidemics Command
Center (CECC) said.</P>
      <P>The latest indigenous case -- the second one diagnosed so far -- was a 25-year-
old woman who contracted the virus from her mother, according to the CEC. The
mother was diagnosed with A(H1N1) Monday, five days after her return from the
United States.</P>
      <P>The two imported cases were a 31-year-old woman who was in Central America from
May 29 to June 1 and a 16-year-old female student who returned to Taiwan June 12
from Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared an influenza A(H1N1) pandemic on
June 11, but said the overall severity of the outbreak was moderate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's future should be decided by its people: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
06/17/09  17:27:53
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has advocated that Taiwan's future should be decided by
the country's people and this advocacy is his only option in terms of cross-
Taiwan  Strait relations, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang reiterated Ma's commitment in response to a report carried that same day by
the local daily Liberty Times, which questioned Ma's latest statement regarding
his "no unification" stance. The paper argued that Ma's recent statement  in an
interview  with the Commonwealth Magazine clearly underlines that unification is
the Ma Administration's "ultimate goal."</P>
      <P>Wang argued that the paper "intentionally misinterpreted" Ma's words.</P>
      <P>Ma stated in the interview that according to polls, 80 percent of the country's
citizens  agree  with his "no unification,  no independence and no provocation
of war" commitment.</P>
      <P>But Ma added that "no unification" does not mean exclusion of unification  as an
option.  The  commitment  means  that  his administration will not touch the
unification issue during the next seven years of his potential tenure --
assuming that he is re-elected -- because there will be no answers to the issue
during the next seven years and discussions on it would be meaningless, Ma said
in the interview.</P>
      <P>Wang said Ma shares the concept  of "no unification,  no independence and no use
of force" with the majority of the people in Taiwan toward cross-strait
relations, in other words, maintaining the status quo in political terms.</P>
      <P>On the "no independence" statement, the president explained that different
political parties maintain different agendas on Taiwan's future. For the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), seeking de jure independence will never be an option, because
Taiwan is already an independent nation and there is no need for it to struggle
for de jure independence.</P>
      <P>Ma was also asked during the interview about his decision to run for the KMT
chairmanship. Ma said that his plan to serve concurrently as the nation's
president and as ruling party chairman is not intended to expand his
presidential power, but rather to more effectively fulfill his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed hope that his bid will be supported by the party members in the
interest of facilitating closer cooperation between the ruling party and the
administration and achieving more effective government.</P>
      <P>"If I assume the party chairmanship, the KMT will serve as a platform for
communication between the administration and the party, while the Cabinet will
remain the decision-making and executive body," he said.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has denied a report published Wednesday that
said Taiwan wanted to hold the next round of talks with China earlier than
scheduled to expedite the signing of an agreement on economic cooperation with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"How could that be possible? " wondered MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He said the two sides have yet to hold a work meeting to pave the way for an
official meeting between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung and Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"As the accords signed in the previous round of negotiations in April in Nanjing
have yet to take effect, how could it be possible for the two sides to discuss
the planned topics projected for the next round of negotiations or touch on the
date of the talks now, " Fu added.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang said Wednesday that the only thing
that is sure about the fourth round of talks with China is that they will be
held in Taiwan, but he insisted he had not heard anything about any other
details related to the meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have to date agreed to discuss  two-way cooperation  on  farm
produce  quarantines,  standard  product certification and the avoidance of
double taxation at the fourth round of talks.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Commercial Times reported Wednesday that the talks might be
held in late July or August rather than late in the year to expedite the signing
of an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>The paper reported that Taiwan and China have been making arrangements for
signing such an agreement.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that if conditions allow, an ECFA could be
clinched during the fourth round of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based  Chinese National Federation of Industries published a white
paper Tuesday, calling for the early establishment of the planned ECFA to tackle
the formation of a regional trade bloc between the Association of Southeast

    <HEADLINE>Hepatitis C patients tend to develop liver cancer: researcher</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
06/17/09  18:17:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>People infected with hepatitis C have an approximately five times greater risk
of developing liver cancer than those with hepatitis B, and have a 10 times risk
of liver cancer if they also drink alcohol, Michael Ming-Chiao Lai, an Academia
Sinica academician specializing in life sciences, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in a keynote speech at the 12th Society of Chinese
Bioscientists in America International Symposium held by Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Lai, who is also president of National Cheng Kung University, said there are
five types of hepatitis viruses -- A, B, C, D and E. The hepatitis viruses A and
E can cause acute hepatitis, while the hepatitis B, C, and D viruses can cause
chronic hepatitis.</P>
      <P>Before a hepatitis B vaccine was developed, up to 90 percent of liver cancer was
caused by hepatitis B. At present, as no vaccine is yet available against
hepatitis C, half of the liver cancer cases in southern Taiwan are associated
with hepatitis C, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need to develop hepatitis C vaccine as medications for
hepatitis C treatment have been found ineffective for most patients and could
cause side effects, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Patients with hepatitis B have 100 times higher risk of liver cancer than people
who don't have hepatitis infection. Most people are infected with hepatitis C
virus when they grow up and the duration of infection of the virus is normally
shorter than that of people with hepatitis B virus, so under the circumstance,
hepatitis C patients should have relatively low risk of liver cancer, Lai said.</P>
      <P>However, if people who infected with hepatitis B and hepatitis C at the same
time, hepatitis C patients have five times higher risk of liver cancer than
hepatitis B patients, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in Taiwan is 2 percent, with the
highest prevalence seen in a village in southern Taiwan, where 60 percent of the
residents are infected with the virus, Lai noted.</P>
      <P>Between 50 percent and 80 percent of those infected with hepatitis C have a
tendency to develop chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and carcinoma of the
liver, Lai went on, adding that if hepatitis C patients drink alcohol or eat
fatty food, their risk of developing liver cancer will be 10 times higher than
that if they do not.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that hepatitis C patients refrain from drinking alcohol, eating
fatty foods and taking uncertified medicines. He also advised them to undergo
ultrasound examinations every four months for timely treatment.</P>

allow visitors to get a feel for Taiwan's charm and vigor and the hospitality of
its people.</P>
      <P>A total of 33 travel agencies from around Taiwan, including Taipei City, Taipei
County,  Miaoli County, Nantou County and Kaohsiung City, have sent officials to
participate in the fair.</P>
      <P>Chin Hui-chu, Taipei County tourism bureau chief, and local government
representatives  from Nantou,  Miaoli and Kaohsiung, introduced tourist spots
and folk rituals from their areas at the news conference.</P>
      <P>Speaking after the news conference, Chin encouraged Taiwan's tourism operators
to offer high-end quality services to foreign tourists, as even larger numbers
of Chinese tourists are expected to flock to Taiwan in the years to come.</P>
      <P>Chin urged the government to honor President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promise
that the current daily quota imposed on Chinese tourists should be increased
from 3,000 in the first year to 5,000 in the second year and 7,000 in the third
year.</P>
      <P>Since July last year, a maximum 3,000 Chinese tourists have been permitted to
enter Taiwan per day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai Jui-long, secretary-general of the Kaohsiung City tourism bureau,
pushed carriers to open more cross-Taiwan Strait flights between Kaohsiung City
and destinations in China to better serve southern Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>Lai gave his assurance that passenger loads will not be a problem, as the
existing cross-strait flights from and to Kaohsiung are running at almost full
capacity.</P>

      <P>The Taipei county government declared a ban Wednesday on the sale and display of
C-string "invisible underwear" at an upcoming music festival to be held in the
county, on the grounds of modesty.</P>
      <P>Those who wear this type of underwear will also "not be welcomed" -- at least by
county government officials -- at the Ho-Hai-Yan Rock Festival slated for July
10-12 at Fulong beach in the county's Gongliao township, according to officials
of the county's Tourism and Travel Bureau.</P>
      <P>Saying that the local government wants the annual music festival to be "healthy
and simple, " the officials said anyone who breaks the ban on the skimpy smalls
can be arrested by the police for "violating public modesty."</P>
      <P>The ban was imposed in the wake of reports that a seller of the garment has
recruited models to exhibit and sell the product at the venue of the popular
festival, now in its 10th year.</P>
      <P>The strapless panty is designed with a flexible internal frame that hugs and
holds it to the body. The product is advertised as being perfect for wearing
either under clothing or alone as beachwear for tanning, because it does not
produce any panty lines or tan lines.</P>

      <P>"AIT's new compound will be a spacious,  state-of-the-art, environmentally

the people of the United States, " the AIT said in a press release.</P>
      <P>AIT Director Stephen M. Young and Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin will both speak at
the site dedication before an audience of individuals who have played a key role
in advancing the many elements of Taiwan's relationship with the U.S., according
to the press release.</P>
      <P>The AIT said the US$170 million compound will include an office building of
approximately 14,000 square meters, a parking structure and support structures,
with all of AIT's Taipei offices, including the American Cultural Center, the
Commercial Section, the Chinese Language and Area Studies School and the
Agricultural Trade Office located for the first time at one single site.</P>
      <P>The 6.5 hectare site is within walking distance of the planned Neihu stop of

      <P>The compound will be constructed in three stages. The first phase -- rear access
road construction -- started in March and will be completed in six to nine
months, while the second phase will consist of site clearing and grading, and
construction of perimeter security systems and the third phase will consist of
construction of the new office building, the contract for which has not yet been

    <HEADLINE>Suicide mortality rate rose 3.3 percent in 2008: report</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The suicide mortality rate rose by 3.3 percent in 2008 from the previous year,
according to a Department of Health (DOH) report released Wednesday,  an
increase that one psychiatrist said could be linked to the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Suicide was the ninth top cause of death in Taiwan last year, up one notch from
the 2007, the DOH report on 2008 death rates in Taiwan showed.</P>
      <P>Psychiatrist Chang Chia-ming from the DOH-run Suicide Prevention Center said
that the highest suicide mortality rate was among elderly people suffering from
chronic diseases, with the suicides rate in this group at 36.6 per 100,000
population in 2008.</P>
      <P>He speculated that the major reason why people in this category commit suicide
is because they do not wish to live a life racked by long-term illness. However,
the reasons behind acts of suicide are often complicated, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted that the suicide rate in the 25-44 age group rose in 2008 by
8.1 percent -- the steepest increase registered among the different age
categories. This could be related to the economic downturn as people in this age
group are the main breadwinners in the family, he said.</P>
      <P>However, "there's no evidence to prove that the suicides were related to
economic factors, " he added, reiterating that the underlying reasons are often
complex.</P>
      <P>The DOH report showed that cancer was the number one cause of death in the
country  in 2008,  followed  by heart  disease, cerebrovascular disease,
pneumonia, diabetes, accidents, chronic respiratory disease, chronic liver
disease and cirrhosis, suicide, nephritis, nephritic syndrome and nephrosis.</P>
      <P>Notably, the accident fatality rate fell 6.4 percent from the previous year --
the largest drop among the listed causes of death in 2008.</P>
      <P>The number of people who died in accidents last year was 7,077, representing a
crude death rate of 30.8 per 100,000 population, the lowest in nearly 20 years,
the DOH reported.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six swimmers from Taiwan and mainland China swam across a section of the Taiwan
Strait Wednesday to test the waters in preparation for a historic mass swim
across the Taiwan Strait slated for Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>The eight swimmers, including two from Taiwan and four from China, took two
hours and 20 minutes from Fujian Province's port city of Xiamen in southeastern
China to Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen. This was a test swim prior to the
first Kinmen-Xiamen mass crossing that will be attempted by 100 swimmers from
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The eight swimmers kicked off an at 11: 40 a.m. from Xiamen's Yefengzhai Beach
and came ashore on Shuangkou Beach on Hsiao Kinmen, a small islet west of
Kinmen, completing a distance of 8.5 km.</P>
      <P>A professional swimmer, Lin Jiayong from China, finished first in a time of 1:
29: 23.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese swimmer Ni Sheng-liang, 46, completed the distance in 2: 10: 00 to
become the first Taiwanese to legally swim from Xiamen to Kinmen in 60 years.</P>
      <P>Ni said the swim was more complicated than he had anticipated, as the currents
were more unpredictable than he had imagined.</P>
      <P>The swimmers covered an actual distance of about 8 km from Yefengzhai Beach to
Shuangkou Beach due to the pull of the ocean currents, although the direct
distance between the two points is about 6 km.</P>
      <P>The other four Chinese swimmers did not make it to Hsiao Kinmen and were ferried
back to Xiamen by two rubber boats.</P>
      <P>The historic mass swim is being sponsored by the Kinmen county government and
the Xiamen city government.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to minimize the risks involved in the venture, the sponsors
decided to allow test swims June 17 and July 17 so that the swimmers could
assess the conditions in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Kinmen county government will remove the spear-like anti-
landing barricades from the Shuangkou Beach 20 days before the Aug. 15 mass swim
to allow the swimmers easier access.</P>
      <P>The barricades, erected in the shallow waters of the beach during the Cold War
era to block landing craft from China, will be replaced after the event,
according to county government officials.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A flock of distinctive azure-winged magpies along the coast of Tainan City in
southern Taiwan is growing larger, giving rise to concerns among local bird
watchers that the alien species might threaten the survival of the common
magpies in the city.</P>
      <P>According to the Wild Bird Society of Tainan, the magpies with the blue wings
and tail are believed to have been imported from China.</P>
      <P>The members of the society said that some of the imported birds were probably
released into the wild for religious reasons, or they escaped from cages, then
settled in the coastal region.</P>
      <P>The coastal flock, which is now comprised of 40-50 birds, began to gather more
than five years ago, the society estimated.</P>
      <P>Mature azure-winged magpies -- which belong to the crow family -- are 31-35
centimeters long, which means they are smaller than the common magpies
frequently seen in the downtown areas of Tainan.</P>
      <P>A member of the society Lee Yu-jen, who has been observing the alien magpies for
five years, said they like to hop around. But Lee said that he has not been able
to take any photos detailed enough to study the birds, nor has he ever found any
of their nests.</P>
      <P>The common magpie, which is black and white, was selected as the bird of Tainan
in 2005. However, Lee said this is also an alien species from mainland China
that was introduced into Taiwan during the Ching dynasty.</P>
      <P>According to Tainan city statistics, its population of common magpies stands at
around 1,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Irwin mangoes gain popularity in Japan: Tainan county chief</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan-grown  Irwin  mangoes  have successfully hit the Japanese market this
year, as more than half of the 10,000 cases especially prepared for retail sales
in Japan have been sold, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"As of Tuesday, some 5,400 cases of Irwin mangoes were sold at Japanese
department stores and through online shopping sites, " Su told a news conference
while reporting on his six-day mango promotional tour to Japan.</P>
      <P>Although Su took pride in seeing increased exports of the fruit to Japan in
recent years, he, however, said the mangoes will have to be improved to do even
better in the Japanese market in the future.</P>
      <P>"To make greater breakthrough in the Japanese market, the next step will be
developing more advanced techniques to plant the fruit and make it more
competitive in Japan," Su said.</P>
      <P>Some Japanese retailers were shown on local TV commenting that due to some of
the Taiwan's mangoes having black spots on them, it made it difficult for them
to sell the mangoes to some Japanese consumers known for not only wanting tasty,
but perfect-looking fruits.</P>
      <P>Keen to help promote the fruit to Japanese consumers, Su led a group of Tainan
County officials to Tokyo, Osaka, and Ishikawa and Hokkaido prefectures from
June 12-16.</P>
      <P>Based on last year's success, which saw 2,000 cases of Irwin mangoes sold in two
weeks in the Japanese market, Tainan County in southern Taiwan again launched a
special promotional sale of the fruit targeting Japanese consumers this year in
conjunction with a private Taiwan-Japan joint venture company.</P>
      <P>The Irwin mangoes, labeled as "Midsummer's Ruby" exclusively for the quality-
conscious Japanese market, are being sold in Hankyu Department  Store  and
online  shopping  sites,  such  as www.rakuten.co.jp. -- Japan's largest of its
kind.</P>
      <P>An executive at Japan's Yamato Transport Co., Ltd., said last weekend that the
10,000 cases, which each contains three mangoes and sell for 2,800 yen (US$28)
on the Internet and 6,300 yen at the department store, respectively, should be
sold out by early July. Orders have begun pouring in since early June, he noted.</P>
      <P>"We hope to present Taiwan's Irwin mangoes as a 'cheap and good' alternative to
the more pricey mangoes produced in Japan's Miyazaki Prefecture," the Japanese
executive noted.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County government has promoted the fruit since 2004 and has made
successful inroads into the Japanese, South Korean and Australian markets, which
has helped push up the price of local mangoes, county officials said.</P>
      <P>Japan is the No. 1 overseas market of Taiwan's agricultural and farm product
exports, according to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>In 2008, Taiwan fruit shipments to Japan hit US$22.72 million, accounting for 54
percent of the country's total fresh fruit exports last year, COA statistics
showed. Taiwan's 2008 mango exports to Japan were worth US$5.21 million.</P>

      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Ma said he hopes the campaign will become a new life

      <P>"Challenges and tricks abound in our society. We need to value good character,

      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Education Cheng Jui-cheng said Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese companies see U.K. as springboard for growth: BTCO</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Asian companies, including those in Taiwan, continue to view the United Kingdom
as a springboard for global growth, with foreign investment there rising despite
the world economic downturn, the British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) stated
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Companies from Taiwan increasingly see the U.K. as an ideal hub for their
international ambitions," BTCO Director David Campbell said in a press release.</P>
      <P>"The U.K. continues to be a leading destination for foreign investment because
companies going global recognize it has the best environment for business. It is
a gateway to international connections including a huge market in Europe of 455
million consumers," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the press release, companies from around the world invested in
1,744 foreign direct investment (FDI) projects during the 2008-2009 financial
year to March, which was an 11 percent increase and growth for the fifth
successive year.</P>
      <P>It added that the record numbers have been achieved in a year when the latest
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) figures confirmed
the U.K. to be ahead of most global competitors, attracting US$1.348 billion in
foreign investment to take up a share of 8.9 percent of its stock market and
trailing only behind the United States.</P>
      <P>Campbell noted that Taiwanese investment in the U.K.  has increased across a
range of sectors such as information communication technology (ICT), healthcare,
chemicals, and transportation.</P>
      <P>ICT continued to be a strong sector for Taiwanese investors, including LCD
screen manufacturer Hannstar, which set up its European sales and marketing
office in Hemel Hempstead northwest of London, and IC design company Mediatek,
which set up its R&amp;D center in Cambridge, he stated.</P>
      <P>There is increasing focus on the healthcare sector, with Caremed Supply setting
up its European sales and marketing in the U.K. to work with the British
National Health Service (NHS).</P>
      <P>"We chose the U.K. because of the centralized NHS procurement system and the
U.K. market size," Antony Liu, Chairman of Caremed Supply, said in the press
release.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  Chang  Chun Group has established  its European headquarters in the
U.K. and Yang Ming Marine has expanded its operations with an additional
logistics center in Manchester to serve the U.K. market.</P>
      <P>"The U.K.'s world-class creativity and innovation fused with its commitment to
R&amp;D are also major attractions," Campbell said.</P>
      <P>The BTCO serves as the de facto British embassy in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA launches anti-dengue fever drive ahead of World Games</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Wednesday that it has
launched a one-month clean-up campaign to prevent any dengue fever outbreaks
during the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung City this summer.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Shen Shu-hung said at the Executive Yuan that the drive will last
until July 15, the day before the World Games open in the southern Taiwan city,
to eliminate the chances of dengue fever illness among the athletes and tourists
who will be in the country at that time.</P>
      <P>The EPA decided to expand the clean-up program this year, in light of its
success last year through the joint efforts of five city and county governments,
according to Shen.</P>
      <P>The minister said that 92 percent of the 218 villages and boroughs that
participated in last year's campaign passed the subsequent environmental
inspections.</P>
      <P>This year, the EPA will adopt strict inspection standards and will mobilize more
villages and boroughs to join the clean-up drive, Shen added.</P>
      <P>According to EPA statistics, as of June 15 this year, 81 cases of dengue fever
had been reported in Taiwan, which signaled an earlier start of the dengue fever
season. The possibility of a dengue fever outbreak in Taiwan therefore cannot be
ruled out, the EPA stated.</P>
      <P>Shen warned that if property owners, managers or tenants fail to clean up their
environs as stipulated, they could face fines of up to NT$6,000.</P>
      <P>In related news, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu lambasted the Sports Affairs Council
at a news conference Wednesday for slashing its budget for the World Games by
NT$230 million.</P>
      <P>The council had originally planned to allocate NT$845 million for the games, but
the budget was cut to NT$614 million, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The city government had considered launching a fund raising drive to raise the
budget difference, but that is not permissible under the regulations, therefore
the city would have to cut spending instead, she said.</P>
      <P>The NT$230 million that was cut from the budget was intended for World Games
broadcast, a World Games exposition, rental of the Kaohsiung Arena, the hosting
of an athletes night, and for cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The city will stand on its own feet for the games, even though it does not feel
good to be belittled in this way, Chen said. The city council, local citizens
will stand behind the city government to make the games a success, she added.</P>
      <P>The July 16-26 World Games are expected to attract 4,000 athletes from some 100
countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following are excerpts from selected local newspaper editorials Thursday:</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On the corruption case of ex-first family</P>
      <P>There are many fallacies in the argument presented by Chen Jui-ren -- the
prosecutor who handled the corruption case involving former President Chen Shui-
bian and his family -- in defense of his earlier decision not to list the former
president's daughter, Chen Hsing-yu, as an accomplice in the case. Chen Hsing-yu
was recently placed under investigation by the Taipei District Prosecutors
Office on perjury charges, based on findings by the Special Investigation
Division (SID) of the Supreme Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Chen Jui-ren's failure to properly deal with the alleged
irregularities involving members of the former first family was probably what
indirectly allowed them to continue their money-laundering activities overseas,
even after the indictment of Chen Shui-bian's wife, Wu Shu-jen, in November
1996.</P>
      <P>When criticizing the SID, Chen Jui-ren should probably first consider whether he
was responsible for the loopholes in the case that are still open up to today.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On Taiwan's investment in China</P>
      <P>Since the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou in May 2008, his administration
has been leaning heavily toward China and has painted China as the world's most
important market, giving the impression that there will be no tomorrow for
Taiwanese businesses unless they enter the China market.</P>
      <P>However, statistics compiled by the Straits Exchange Foundation show that since
1991, 102 Taiwanese businessmen have been killed in China, while more than 300
others have been reported missing. There have also been numerous reports of
China-based Taiwanese businesses falling victim to embezzlement or saddled with
bad debts.</P>
      <P>To put it simply, the Chinese market is like a dark jungle. Taiwanese businesses
must open their eyes to this reality in order to avoid falling into the abyss.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: on President Ma's China policy</P>
      <P>In a recent magazine interview, President Ma Ying-jeou said he "does not rule
out unification  as an option" in the future development of relations between
Taiwan and China. A few years ago, Ma also mentioned Taiwan independence as an
option.</P>
      <P>The words that he spoke before he came to power cannot be taken seriously, but
those spoken after are from the bottom of his heart.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, all of Ma's policies have been geared toward one end: moving
closer to China. This is not the image of a normal country. We should be
watchful of this trend and seek to deter its progress.</P>
      <P>China Times: On Want Want China Times Group's planned legal action</P>
      <P>The Want Want China Times Group has heard the criticisms of its intention to sue
those who made unfounded speculations about its takeover of China Television Co.
and CTiTV. We deeply regret that our ideals are repeatedly and grossly
distorted.</P>
      <P>As media outlets and academics continue to voice suspicions that there is
Chinese capital in the Want Want Group and to doubt our reasons for purchasing
the China Times Group, do we not have the right to rebut?</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued an orange travel advisory for Iran
Thursday, suggesting that travelers postpone any visits to the country because
of the mass street protests following last week's presidential election there.</P>
      <P>"In light of the upheaval in Iran, the Foreign Ministry is also urging Taiwanese
expatriates in Iran to stay vigilant and watch out for their own safety, " said
Ali Yang, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of West Asian Affairs, at
a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"The ministry is advising business travelers and other visitors to postpone
their travel plans for Iran," he stated.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, there are fewer than 10 Taiwanese studying in Iran and only
five or six Taiwanese expatriates in the country, most of whom are married to
Iranians. The ministry has made contact with them all, but they think that there
is no need for them to leave the country as the protests are confined to Tehran,
he said.</P>
      <P>"I believe the unrest is only temporary and Iran will soon return to peace," he
said.</P>
      <P>In case of emergency, Taiwanese nationals can contact the MOFA's representative
office in Dubai at 971-50-6453018, he added.</P>
      <P>A yellow alert, the lowest on a three-color travel advisory scale, serves as a
reminder for travelers to exercise caution. An orange travel alert advises
travelers to postpone their trips, while a red alert warns travelers not to
enter the area in question under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Yang, oil supplies from Iran have not been affected by
the unrest.</P>
      <P>Iran is Taiwan's third largest oil supplier, after Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Iran amounts to US$4 billion per year.</P>
      <P>Thousands of supporters of the reformist presidential candidate Mir-Hossein
Mousavi took to the streets of Tehran for the fifth consecutive  day  Wednesday
in protest  against  the disputed presidential election results.</P>
      <P>According to the Iranian Interior Ministry, incumbent President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad won 62.63 percent of the vote in the June 12 presidential election,
while his main rival Mousavi took 33.75 percent.</P>
      <P>Demonstrators, who have either accused the government of massive vote fraud or
the United States of interference in Iranian internal affairs, have had clashes
with local police and dozens of people have reportedly been killed.</P>
      <P>The Iranian Guardian Council has agreed on a recount of disputed ballots.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that applications have been
flooding in for a Europe-Taiwan youth summer program to promote interaction
between young people of the two sides.</P>
      <P>"So far, the Foreign Ministry has received many applications from European
youth, which indicates that the financial crisis has not affected their interest
in learning more about Taiwan," said Anne Hung, director-general of the MOFA's
Department of European Affairs, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA hopes that the program will help promote exchanges between young
people in Europe and Taiwan and allow Europeans to learn more about our
country," she added.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, the exchange program is receiving great attention
particularly in Austria and Hungary, and the Foreign Ministry is encouraging
young people aged 18-40 to sign up before the 100 openings are filled.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has commissioned the non-governmental China Youth Corps to organize two
workshops from July 28-Aug. 10 and Aug. 18-31 in Taipei to give the participants
a better understanding of Taiwan through interactions with local youth, she
added.</P>
      <P>While similar programs were held more than 10 years ago, Hung said the Foreign
Ministry hopes that this time the program will help to lift Taiwan's profile in
Europe.</P>

      <P>Dashu township in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County has increased exports of
its famous Jade Purse lychees to Japan this year, following a good crop over the
past month, said the town's farmers association Thursday.</P>
      <P>Dashu township has harvested about 18,000 metric tons of Jade Purse lychees over
the past month, and some 30 metric tons of the fruit has been exported to Japan,
six times the volume last year, association officials said.</P>
      <P>Dashu growers were originally slated to provide 200 metric tons of the fresh
fruit to Japan buyers, who offered to purchase it through the farmers
association at NT$80-NT$90 (US$2.5) per kilogram.</P>
      <P>But local farmers were only able to supply 30 metric tons, because it is
difficult to produce the fruit in bulk over a short period, the farmers
association officials explained.</P>
      <P>Lychees for export to Japan must meet strict quarantine standards and must be
labeled with a detailed production profile.</P>
      <P>Lychees, mangoes and pineapples are popular summer fruit in Taiwan, and are
mainly grown in the Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas in the south.</P>
      <P>Japan is the No. 1 overseas market for Taiwan's agricultural and farm product
exports. In 2008, Taiwan fruit shipments to Japan reached US$22.72 million,
accounting for 54 percent of the country's total fresh fruit exports that year,
according to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA).</P>

      <P>Environmental Protection Administration Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen has said
that it is not appropriate to write the goal and timetable for cutting the
country's greenhouse gas emissions into legislation before international
consensus is reached on this issue.</P>
      <P>Shen, who was speaking at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, was referring to adraft
bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The bill has yet to pass the
Legislative Yuan in the current session because legislators across party lines
hope it will be discussed only after new standards for emissions are set at the
United Nations Climate Change Conference slated for December in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jyng-ping had previously voiced similar views.</P>
      <P>Environmental groups, however, have called for including the county's goal and
timeframe of emission reduction into the draft bill.</P>
      <P>In response to the group's demands, Shen said at the Cabinet meeting that
emission reduction issues have been listed in the Executive Yuan's guidelines on
sustainable energy and that it is not appropriate to write them into law before
an international agreement is reached.</P>
      <P>Doing so would mean Taiwan would have less flexibility in international
negotiations on emissions control, Shen said.</P>
      <P>As for a proposal by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party to enact an
energy tax bill, Shen agreed it should be given a higher priority.</P>
      <P>Many European countries would take into account the overall imposition of carbon
and energy taxes, as well as a cap on greenhouse gas emissions, while enacting
relevant laws, Shen said. This approach can serve as a reference for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He further explained that if enterprises impose a high carbon tax for emitting
high volumes of carbon dioxide emissions, that would influence their
international competitiveness. Therefore, Shen said, in most European countries,
a carbon tax is only part of a broad-based energy tax aimed at encouraging
individuals to save energy, accounting for only 10 percent-20 percent of the
total.</P>
      <P>A carbon trading approach would be more effective in forcing major polluters to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he added.</P>
      <P>Shen also said the EPA hopes the Executive Yuan would soon submit the energy tax
draft bill to the Legislative Yuan to allow it to be reviewed along with the
greenhouse gas reduction draft act so that both can be passed in the next
session.</P>

were later doctored with photos of the Chinese children, according to the Border
Affairs Corps of the National Immigration Agency.</P>
      <P>Ring members then used these forged passports to apply for U.S. visas. Once they
got the visas in Taiwan, they took the fake passports to Hong Kong, where the
fake passport holders, mainly underage children from China, would use them to
travel to the United States, accompanied by one of several Taiwanese women hired
by the gang to serve as a pseudo parent or guardian for the child to dupe U.S.
immigration officials.</P>
      <P>These Taiwanese women, aware or unaware of the scheme, were paid US$1,000 to
US$1,500 in reward for each trip.</P>
      <P>Under the fraudulent scheme, more than 50 Chinese children, all underage girls,
have successfully entered the United States using the fake ROC passports, the
corps said.</P>
      <P>A total of 74 Taiwanese suspects allegedly involved in the smuggling operation
have been handed over to the Taoyuan Prosecutors Office for further
investigation, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>The corps said it tracked down the ring after analyzing clues from scores of
cases which seemed irrelevant on the surface. It finally solved the case
following months of investigations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's economy likely to shrink 3.46% in 2009: Academia Sinica</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to contract by 3.46 percent --
the worst in history -- in 2009, due to the prolonged recovery process of the
global economy, the Academic Sinica forecasted Thursday.</P>
      <P>The projection, however, is more optimistic than the official projection of
-4.25 percent, released on May 21 by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>According to the Sinica's Institute of Economics, Taiwan is expected to
gradually get out of the worst period for its economy later this year and move
slowly toward recovery.</P>
      <P>While government investment will be the key to Taiwan's economic recovery, there
are uncertainties such as international commodity and oil prices, recovery in
the global economy, Taiwan's economic ties with China, and the development of
the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, the institute said.</P>
      <P>It predicted that in 2009, the real private consumption will likely post a 0.26
percent increase, reversing the negative growth of -0.3 percent recorded last
year.</P>
      <P>However,  with businesses'  demand for equipment  expansion remaining weak, the
contraction in real private-sector investment is expected to widen from -13.28
percent in 2008 to -23.97 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>The decline in exports of goods and services will deepen from -0.03 percent in
2008 to -13.97 percent in 2009, while the fall in imports will broaden from
-3.98 percent in 2008 to -17.41 percent.</P>
      <P>The slowing commodity demand will be reflected in the wholesale price index,
which is expected to drop by 7.46 percent in 2009. The consumer price index,
meanwhile, is likely to decline 0.19 percent, the institute said.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) and a local enterprise TutorABC signed a joint
venture Thursday to tap into the global Chinese language learning market via the
world's first real-time interactive online Mandarin learning platform.</P>
      <P>NTU President Lee Si-chen signed a contract with TutorABC Chairman Yang Cheng-
tah Thursday, committing to an expansion of the platform known as TutorMing.</P>
      <P>The joint venture is aimed at meeting a growing demand for Chinese-language
study  and making  inroads  into  the global Chinese-language market that is
expected to be worth NT$2 trillion (US$62.5 billion) in the next five years,
they said.</P>
      <P>At signing ceremony, Lee said that in light of the fact that Chinese language
learning has become a major trend of the 21st century and the shortage of
Mandarin teachers will become more acute in the future, the NTU is collaborating
with TutorABC to expand TutorMing.</P>
      <P>TutorMing  employs a type of voice recognition  technology developed by NTU
under the leadership of professor Lee Lin-shan.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that through the TutorMing online Chinese-learning program, Taiwan
would be able to send Chinese-learning tools to every corner of the world where
Chinese teachers are not available in person," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the ceremony, Yang said TutorABC was the world's first
technology consultancy enterprise to develop the online intelligent learning
system Smart Enterprise Suites, and to provide real-time, interactive, tailored
content with accurate efficacy tracing.</P>
      <P>Yang said currently TutorABC provides a total of 40,000 hours of online English
teaching sessions for some 80,000 students per week, with teachers from 56
cities in 29 countries.</P>
      <P>He forecast a huge growth in demand for Chinese language classes, citing China's
forecast that by 2010, about 100 million non-Chinese speaking people will be
learning Mandarin. He also cited a U.S. estimate that by 2015, some 750,000
American middle school students will be learning Mandarin.</P>
      <P>"Based on these estimates, the global business opportunities linked to Chinese
learning and teaching are expected to top NT$2 trillion in the next five years,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The global demand for Chinese teachers will grow to 500,000 in the next few
years, five times the current number of 100,000, he predicted.</P>
      <P>"TutorABC hopes to employ 100,000 Chinese teachers in the next few years, which
would in turn generate NT$1 billion in business opportunities," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the expansion of TutorMing will provide a golden opportunity for
Taiwanese teachers who have been unemployed for the past few years due to over
supply.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese teachers are generally better Mandarin teachers than those from China
and other Chinese-speaking communities throughout the world because they have a
global perspective, online and digital skills, and a lively teaching style," he
said.</P>
      <P>Sergey Redkin, a Russian working in Taiwan, said at the ceremony that he had had
trouble with Mandarin tongue twisters even after years of Chinese-language
study, but that has changed since he has been taking Chinese classes on
TutorMing.</P>
      <P>Janelle Harrington, a U.S. student who recently arrived in Taiwan, said her
Mandarin has improved significantly since she began learning on TutorMing, which
is accessible round-the-clock and has no location restrictions.</P>
      <P>"Most of all, it's inexpensive at only US$15 per hour," she said.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported Thursday that it is closely monitoring

      <P>The meteorologists said it was still too early to speculate on whether Linfa
will make a direct hit on Taiwan in the coming few days.</P>
      <P>"If it moves a little north, then Taiwan's central and southern areas will
experience torrential rain in the coming few days, but if it moves a little
south, it might sweep through the Bashi Channel and spare Taiwan altogether,"
they forecast.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to return to positive
in September in tandem with the United States, Morris Chang,  chairman and CEO
of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>The U.S. economy would experience its worst recession in the third quarter, and
its GDP would turn positive in September, according to Chang, the chairman of
the world's largest contract chipmaker, who also forecasted the global economy
will begin to recover in 2010.</P>
      <P>While giving his outlook for the semiconductor industry for the third quarter,
Chang said that the road to recovery will not be straight and smooth, but could
be a bumpy one. However, he maintained his optimistic forecast that Q3 will be
better than Q2.</P>
      <P>Touching on his reassumption of the post as TSMC CEO earlier in the month, Chang
said that the company's CEO serves as a coordinator to connect with clients,
investors and company personnel and his main task is to collaborate with company
colleagues on meeting business demand. Describing himself as an extroverted CEO,
Chang said he will strive to fulfill the task.</P>
      <P>Talking about TSMC's future goals, Chang said the company will focus on
improving its techniques, adding that despite its business turnover being lower
than that of last year, the funds allocated for research and development this
year were more than that of last year, and the amount of expenditures budgeted
for this year was on par with last year.</P>
      <P>TSMC will also upgrade its production capacity to meet client demand, including
demand that comes in the form of rush orders, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the company will strengthen partnerships with clients in an attempt to
create a win-win situation for both sides, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local astronomer said Thursday that July 22 will mark the century's longest
and most spectacular total solar eclipse.</P>
      <P>Sun Wei-hsin, a professor at National Taiwan University's (NTU's) Graduate
Institute of Astrophysics, made the announcement at a news conference hosted by
the Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC).</P>
      <P>Noting that the United Nations has designated 2009 as the International Year of
Astronomy, Sun said more than 140 countries around the world have been
sponsoring  activities  to promote scientific and astronomical education during
the year.</P>
      <P>"One of the most fascinating activities this year will be observing the upcoming
total solar eclipse, " Sun said, adding that people should not miss the
opportunity to witness the event.</P>
      <P>The solar eclipse will be total through a narrow corridor stretching from
northern India, eastern Nepal, northern Bangladesh, Bhutan, the northern tip of
Myanmar, central China and a narrow ribbon of the Pacific Ocean that includes
the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, Sun said, adding that the eclipse will also
be partially visible in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This solar eclipse will be the longest total eclipse to occur in the 21st
Century, " Sun went on.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, total solar eclipses are rare and only 28 percent of the
average 238 eclipses that occur each century are total eclipses.</P>
      <P>"This means that a total solar eclipse appears once every one-and-a-half years,
" Sun said, adding that it takes an average of 450 years for a total solar
eclipse to be visible at the same location twice.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the last total solar eclipse was seen around the northern port city
of Keelung in 1941 and the next one is expected to be visible near the Hengchun
peninsula in the south in 2070, Sun said.</P>
      <P>"Local people will be able to see an 'almost total' annular partial eclipse July
22, " Sun said, adding that Taiwan people won't be able to see such a similar
scene until 2046.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the ancient Chinese have used beautiful and poetic terms to
describe the five stages of a total solar eclipse, Sun said many Chinese people
are enthusiastically waiting for the arrival of the rare astronomical event.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the NSC is collaborating with the Ministry of Education, Academia
Sinica and the Council for Cultural Affairs to organize a series of outdoor
activities this summer to inspire local interest in astronomy.</P>
      <P>These activities will include a lights-down campaign that will be held June 21
in which local people will be encouraged to turn off lights and go outdoors to
observe the skies.</P>
      <P>In July, a series of astronomy education camps will be organized for youngsters
from Taiwan and other Asia-Pacific countries. In addition,  a science festival
will take place Aug. 8 through mid-September to boost astronomical education.</P>
      <P>In related news,  prospective participants in an astronomy education  program
organized  by NTU's Graduate  Institute  of Astrophysics     can     register

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan needs to do more to fight human trafficking: U.S. report</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 18 (CNA)
06/18/09  20:38:16
(By Roger Chou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made some progress in combating human trafficking over the past year,
but should do much more, including extending labor protections to all categories
of workers to prevent labor trafficking, according to the just-released 2009
U.S. Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Report.</P>
      <P>The annual report placed Taiwan in Tier 2 ranking, which is for governments that
are making significant efforts to meet the minimum standards for eliminating
trafficking prescribed by the U.S. law that guides anti-human trafficking
efforts - the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.</P>
      <P>Governments that fully comply are placed in Tier 1. Governments that do not
fully comply with the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts
to do so are placed in Tier 3.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan authorities made noticeable progress during the reporting period by
passing a new anti-trafficking law,  bolstering law enforcement efforts, and
approving a budget plan of US$14.8 million for victim protection measures," the
report acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Trafficked victims - including men, women and children - are usually brought to
Taiwan for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Most trafficking victims are workers from rural areas of Vietnam, Thailand,
Indonesia, and the Philippines. They are employed through recruitment agencies
and brokers to perform low-skilled work in Taiwan's construction, fishing, and
manufacturing industries, or to work as domestic helpers.</P>
      <P>"Many of these workers fall victim to labor trafficking by unscrupulous brokers
and employers, who force workers to perform work outside the scope of their
contract and often under exploitative conditions, " the report said, which is
available online.</P>
      <P>Some women and girls from China and Southeast Asian countries are trafficked  to
Taiwan through fraudulent  marriages,  deceptive employment offers, and illegal
smuggling for sexual exploitation and forced labor, the report found.</P>
      <P>It said many migrant workers are charged job placement and service fees up to
the equivalent of US$14,000, some of which are unlawful.</P>
      <P>The report added that this results in substantial debt for the workers that
unscrupulous labor brokers or employers may use as a coercive tool to subject
the workers to involuntary servitude.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign workers remain vulnerable to trafficking because legal
protections, oversight by authorities and enforcement efforts are currently
inadequate, " said the report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's regulations currently allow employers to implement a system of "forced
savings, " whereby employers deduct up to 30 percent of a foreign worker's
monthly salary to be placed in a bank account in the worker's name, but
inaccessible to the worker, the report said. This system has facilitated
trafficking, it said.</P>
      <P>The report cited NGOs saying that immigration, police and local law enforcement
officials continue to view trafficking victims as runaways or criminals,
resulting in some victims being penalized rather than assisted.</P>
      <P>In addition to recommending that Taiwan extend labor protections to all
categories of workers, the report also suggested that Taiwan implement its new
comprehensive anti-trafficking law and effectively carry out its victim and
witness protections so that victims are not penalized for acts committed as a
direct result of being trafficked, which would encourage them to seek help.</P>
      <P>It also suggested Taiwan increase police efforts to investigate trafficking
crimes and to identify trafficking victims, and improve cooperation with
governments of labor source countries on trafficking investigations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Immigration Agency (NIA), which did not have a direct response
to the findings of the report, said Thursday that Taiwan has remained on Tier 2
in the annual report for three consecutive years. It said Japan and Singapore
also received Tier 2 ranking.</P>
      <P>The agency said Taiwan was placed on Tier 2 Watch List in 2006 and upgraded to
Tier 2 the next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) announced  Thursday  that it has smashed a
large-scale  human trafficking ring involving suspects from Taiwan, Hong Kong,
China and the United States.</P>
      <P>The cross-border human smuggling gang is the largest ever uncovered in Taiwan in
collaboration with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a spokesman for the
NIA's Border Affairs Corps told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Seventy-four Taiwanese suspects of the ring were turned over to the Taoyuan
Prosecutors Office for further investigation,  the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the initial investigation, a Chinese man surnamed Wang was the
mastermind of the ring, which helped Chinese women obtain passports of the
Republic of China altered with their photos. The fake passports were then used
to apply for valid U.S. visas so that the women could enter the United States
using the forged passports.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese accomplice surnamed Yang was allegedly responsible for swindling
local young girls' ID documents from their parents, mainly in eastern Taiwan's
Hualien County. And a tour agency manager identified as Liao used the documents
to apply for ROC passports and for U.S. visas, which were later doctored with
photos of young Chinese women.</P>
      <P>NIA officials said Liao was able to obtain genuine ROC passports and valid U.S.
visas for Chinese women seeking to smuggle into the United States, as the Taipei
office of the American Institute in Taiwan does not require Taiwanese applicants
younger than 14 years old to undergo an interview.</P>
      <P>After Liao got the passports, someone else would take them to Hong Kong, where
Taiwanese women hired by the gang would accompany these Chinese women to travel
to the United States by serving as a pseudo companion.</P>
      <P>More than 30 Taiwanese women,  some of whom were college lecturers, former
flight attendants and nurses, were employed to accompany the Chinese women, and
were paid US$1,000 to US$1,500 in reward for each trip. Some of these Taiwanese
women claimed to have no knowledge about the scheme.</P>
      <P>Citing information provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the
corps said under the fraudulent scheme, more than 40 Chinese women have
successfully entered the United States using the forged ROC passports.</P>
      <P>Each of these Chinese women paid US$60,000 to US$70,000 to be smuggled to the
United States, and the U.S. authorities strongly suspect that they might be
illegally engaged in prostitution in the country, the corps said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hualien County police authorities said they have launched an in-depth
investigation into the case, because they suspect that personal data of young
girls at some local aboriginal villages were illegally sold to criminal
elements.</P>
      <P>The indigenous girls' families said they were fooled into thinking the people
who took their daughter's documents would help their family apply for government
subsidies.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou officiated Thursday at the inauguration of a new vaccine
facility in central Taiwan run by Adimmune Corp. that is capable of producing
vaccines against the influenza A(H1N1) strain.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inauguration, Ma said Taiwan is one of just 11 countries in the
world capable of producing vaccine for swine flu and he added that it is
important that Taiwan, as a member of the international community, can and will
share the vaccine with other countries that need it in the face of the swine flu
pandemic.</P>
      <P>Immediately after its inauguration, Adimmune's new plant in Tantzu, Taichung
County will ramp up its production to meet an order placed by the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) for 5 million doses of influenza A(H1N1) vaccine, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He said that flu, although a common ailment, should never be taken lightly,
pointing out that in 1918, 20 million people were killed in a Spanish flu
pandemic, a figure equal to the World War 1 casualties of 10 nations.</P>
      <P>He also gave the thumbs-up to Adimmune Corp. Chairman Chan Chi-hsien, who was
elected chairman of the company only last year but streamlined its finances in a
mere two months.</P>
      <P>Soon after that, he said, Chan, a former DOH minister, then instigated planning
for the new plant and solicited investment from the government to facilitate
construction, making it possible for Taiwan to pitch in with the global
production of A(H1N1) vaccine in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that although the flu infections have been declared by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as a level-six pandemic -- the highest level on the WHO scale
-- the situation is much milder than previously anticipated thanks to concerted
efforts by countries around the world and heightened vigilance against the
disease.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan, one of only 11 countries capable of producing A(H1N1)
vaccine, is now among the countries that are most advanced in terms of
biotechnological research and applications.</P>
      <P>Adimmune Corp., the largest vaccine-producing company in Asia, has a maximum
annual capacity of 30 million doses of vaccine produced at its Miaoli plant and
Tantzu plant.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's only human vaccine manufacturer, Adimmune Corp. has recently received
seed viruses for production provided by Australia, Britain and the United
States.</P>

NT$1 million or sentences of up to a year.</P>
      <P>Anyone who spots cases involving animal abuse can report them to city or county
animal protection authorities, Hsu said, adding that if a case is considered a
danger to public security, it should be reported to the closest police station.</P>
      <P>In the latest alleged animal abuse case, a pet dog raised by a 78-year-old woman
in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County was shot dead by the military last weekend
after the animal intruded onto a runway at the Chiayi air base.</P>
      <P>The owner said she was not convinced her dog would have intruded into the off-
limits area because it was a pet and not a stray.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi county animal disease quarantine bureau said it had launched an
investigation into the case and added that if air base staff randomly shot the
animal, they will be fined.</P>
      <P>An air force officer visited the dog's elderly owner a day earlier to apologize
for the killing. According to the officer, pilots were conducting landing and
takeoff training when the dog intruded onto the runway.</P>
      <P>"As it was an emergency situation, a non-commissioned officer shot the dog, "
the officer explained, adding that his colleague was doing so in line with air
force standard operating procedures to ensure flight safety.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dashu township in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County has increased exports of
its famous Jade Purse lychees to Japan this year, following a good crop over the
past month, said the town's farmers association Thursday.</P>
      <P>Dashu township has harvested about 18,000 metric tons of Jade Purse lychees over
the past month, and some 30 metric tons of the fruit has been exported to Japan,
six times the volume last year, association officials said.</P>
      <P>Dashu growers were originally slated to provide 200 metric tons of the fresh
fruit to Japan buyers, who offered to purchase it through the farmers
association at NT$80-NT$90 (US$2.5) per kilogram.</P>
      <P>But local farmers were only able to supply 30 metric tons, because it is
difficult to produce the fruit in bulk over a short period, the farmers
association officials explained.</P>
      <P>Lychees for export to Japan must meet strict quarantine standards and must be
labeled with a detailed production profile.</P>
      <P>Lychees, mangoes and pineapples are popular summer fruit in Taiwan, and are
mainly grown in the Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas in the south.</P>
      <P>Japan is the No. 1 overseas market for Taiwan's agricultural and farm product
exports. In 2008, Taiwan fruit shipments to Japan reached US$22.72 million,
accounting for 54 percent of the country's total fresh fruit exports that year,
according to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen has said
that it is not appropriate to write the goal and timetable for cutting the
country's greenhouse gas emissions into legislation before international
consensus is reached on this issue.</P>
      <P>Shen, who was speaking at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, was referring to adraft
bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The bill has yet to pass the
Legislative Yuan in the current session because legislators across party lines
hope it will be discussed only after new standards for emissions are set at the
United Nations Climate Change Conference slated for December in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jyng-ping had previously voiced similar views.</P>
      <P>Environmental groups, however, have called for including the county's goal and
timeframe of emission reduction into the draft bill.</P>
      <P>In response to the group's demands, Shen said at the Cabinet meeting that
emission reduction issues have been listed in the Executive Yuan's guidelines on
sustainable energy and that it is not appropriate to write them into law before
an international agreement is reached.</P>
      <P>Doing so would mean Taiwan would have less flexibility in international
negotiations on emissions control, Shen said.</P>
      <P>As for a proposal by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party to enact an
energy tax bill, Shen agreed it should be given a higher priority.</P>
      <P>Many European countries would take into account the overall imposition of carbon
and energy taxes, as well as a cap on greenhouse gas emissions, while enacting
relevant laws, Shen said. This approach can serve as a reference for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He further explained that if enterprises impose a high carbon tax for emitting
high volumes of carbon dioxide emissions, that would influence their
international competitiveness. Therefore, Shen said, in most European countries,
a carbon tax is only part of a broad-based energy tax aimed at encouraging
individuals to save energy, accounting for only 10 percent-20 percent of the
total.</P>
      <P>A carbon trading approach would be more effective in forcing major polluters to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he added.</P>
      <P>Shen also said the EPA hopes the Executive Yuan would soon submit the energy tax
draft bill to the Legislative Yuan to allow it to be reviewed along with the
greenhouse gas reduction draft act so that both can be passed in the next
session.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Immigration authorities announced Thursday that they have smashed the largest-
ever human smuggling ring in Taiwan's history, a case that involved over 50
Chinese children who were taken to the United States using fake documents
obtained from Taiwanese parents and accompanied by a Taiwanese chaperone.</P>
      <P>Members of the human trafficking gang swindled local children's ID documents
from their parents and used them to apply for Republic of China passports which
were later doctored with photos of the Chinese children, according to the Border
Affairs Corps of the National Immigration Agency.</P>
      <P>Ring members then used these forged passports to apply for U.S. visas. Once they
got the visas in Taiwan, they took the fake passports to Hong Kong, where the
fake passport holders, mainly underage children from China, would use them to
travel to the United States, accompanied by one of several Taiwanese women hired
by the gang to serve as a pseudo parent or guardian for the child to dupe U.S.
immigration officials.</P>
      <P>These Taiwanese women, aware or unaware of the scheme, were paid US$1,000 to
US$1,500 in reward for each trip.</P>
      <P>Under the fraudulent scheme, more than 50 Chinese children, all underage girls,
have successfully entered the United States using the fake ROC passports, the
corps said.</P>
      <P>A total of 74 Taiwanese suspects allegedly involved in the smuggling operation
have been handed over to the Taoyuan Prosecutors Office for further
investigation, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>The corps said it tracked down the ring after analyzing clues from scores of
cases which seemed irrelevant on the surface. It finally solved the case

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's economy likely to shrink 3.46% in 2009: Academia Sinica</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to contract by 3.46 percent --
the worst in history -- in 2009, due to the prolonged recovery process of the
global economy, the Academic Sinica forecasted Thursday.</P>
      <P>The projection, however, is more optimistic than the official projection of
-4.25 percent, released on May 21 by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>According to the Sinica's Institute of Economics, Taiwan is expected to
gradually get out of the worst period for its economy later this year and move
slowly toward recovery.</P>
      <P>While government investment will be the key to Taiwan's economic recovery, there
are uncertainties such as international commodity and oil prices, recovery in
the global economy, Taiwan's economic ties with China, and the development of
the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, the institute said.</P>
      <P>It predicted that in 2009, the real private consumption will likely post a 0.26
percent increase, reversing the negative growth of -0.3 percent recorded last
year.</P>
      <P>However,  with businesses'  demand for equipment  expansion remaining weak, the
contraction in real private-sector investment is expected to widen from -13.28
percent in 2008 to -23.97 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>The decline in exports of goods and services will deepen from -0.03 percent in
2008 to -13.97 percent in 2009, while the fall in imports will broaden from
-3.98 percent in 2008 to -17.41 percent.</P>
      <P>The slowing commodity demand will be reflected in the wholesale price index,
which is expected to drop by 7.46 percent in 2009. The consumer price index,
meanwhile, is likely to decline 0.19 percent, the institute said.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) and a local enterprise TutorABC signed a joint
venture Thursday to tap into the global Chinese language learning market via the
world's first real-time interactive online Mandarin learning platform.</P>
      <P>NTU President Lee Si-chen signed a contract with TutorABC Chairman Yang Cheng-
tah Thursday, committing to an expansion of the platform known as TutorMing.</P>
      <P>The joint venture is aimed at meeting a growing demand for Chinese-language
study  and making  inroads  into  the global Chinese-language market that is
expected to be worth NT$2 trillion (US$62.5 billion) in the next five years,
they said.</P>
      <P>At signing ceremony, Lee said that in light of the fact that Chinese language
learning has become a major trend of the 21st century and the shortage of
Mandarin teachers will become more acute in the future, the NTU is collaborating
with TutorABC to expand TutorMing.</P>
      <P>TutorMing  employs a type of voice recognition  technology developed by NTU
under the leadership of professor Lee Lin-shan.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that through the TutorMing online Chinese-learning program, Taiwan
would be able to send Chinese-learning tools to every corner of the world where
Chinese teachers are not available in person," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the ceremony, Yang said TutorABC was the world's first
technology consultancy enterprise to develop the online intelligent learning
system Smart Enterprise Suites, and to provide real-time, interactive, tailored
content with accurate efficacy tracing.</P>
      <P>Yang said currently TutorABC provides a total of 40,000 hours of online English
teaching sessions for some 80,000 students per week, with teachers from 56
cities in 29 countries.</P>
      <P>He forecast a huge growth in demand for Chinese language classes, citing China's
forecast that by 2010, about 100 million non-Chinese speaking people will be
learning Mandarin. He also cited a U.S. estimate that by 2015, some 750,000
American middle school students will be learning Mandarin.</P>
      <P>"Based on these estimates, the global business opportunities linked to Chinese
learning and teaching are expected to top NT$2 trillion in the next five years,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The global demand for Chinese teachers will grow to 500,000 in the next few
years, five times the current number of 100,000, he predicted.</P>
      <P>"TutorABC hopes to employ 100,000 Chinese teachers in the next few years, which
would in turn generate NT$1 billion in business opportunities," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the expansion of TutorMing will provide a golden opportunity for
Taiwanese teachers who have been unemployed for the past few years due to over
supply.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese teachers are generally better Mandarin teachers than those from China
and other Chinese-speaking communities throughout the world because they have a
global perspective, online and digital skills, and a lively teaching style," he
said.</P>
      <P>Sergey Redkin, a Russian working in Taiwan, said at the ceremony that he had had
trouble with Mandarin tongue twisters even after years of Chinese-language
study, but that has changed since he has been taking Chinese classes on
TutorMing.</P>
      <P>Janelle Harrington, a U.S. student who recently arrived in Taiwan, said her
Mandarin has improved significantly since she began learning on TutorMing, which
is accessible round-the-clock and has no location restrictions.</P>
      <P>"Most of all, it's inexpensive at only US$15 per hour," she said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to return to positive
in September in tandem with the United States, Morris Chang,  chairman and CEO
of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>The U.S. economy would experience its worst recession in the third quarter, and
its GDP would turn positive in September, according to Chang, the chairman of
the world's largest contract chipmaker, who also forecasted the global economy
will begin to recover in 2010.</P>
      <P>While giving his outlook for the semiconductor industry for the third quarter,
Chang said that the road to recovery will not be straight and smooth, but could
be a bumpy one. However, he maintained his optimistic forecast that Q3 will be
better than Q2.</P>
      <P>Touching on his reassumption of the post as TSMC CEO earlier in the month, Chang
said that the company's CEO serves as a coordinator to connect with clients,
investors and company personnel and his main task is to collaborate with company
colleagues on meeting business demand. Describing himself as an extroverted CEO,
Chang said he will strive to fulfill the task.</P>
      <P>Talking about TSMC's future goals, Chang said the company will focus on
improving its techniques, adding that despite its business turnover being lower
than that of last year, the funds allocated for research and development this
year were more than that of last year, and the amount of expenditures budgeted
for this year was on par with last year.</P>
      <P>TSMC will also upgrade its production capacity to meet client demand, including
demand that comes in the form of rush orders, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the company will strengthen partnerships with clients in an attempt to
create a win-win situation for both sides, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local astronomer said Thursday that July 22 will mark the century's longest
and most spectacular total solar eclipse.</P>
      <P>Sun Wei-hsin, a professor at National Taiwan University's (NTU's) Graduate
Institute of Astrophysics, made the announcement at a news conference hosted by
the Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC).</P>
      <P>Noting that the United Nations has designated 2009 as the International Year of
Astronomy, Sun said more than 140 countries around the world have been
sponsoring  activities  to promote scientific and astronomical education during
the year.</P>
      <P>"One of the most fascinating activities this year will be observing the upcoming
total solar eclipse, " Sun said, adding that people should not miss the
opportunity to witness the event.</P>
      <P>The solar eclipse will be total through a narrow corridor stretching from
northern India, eastern Nepal, northern Bangladesh, Bhutan, the northern tip of
Myanmar, central China and a narrow ribbon of the Pacific Ocean that includes
the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, Sun said, adding that the eclipse will also
be partially visible in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This solar eclipse will be the longest total eclipse to occur in the 21st
Century, " Sun went on.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, total solar eclipses are rare and only 28 percent of the
average 238 eclipses that occur each century are total eclipses.</P>
      <P>"This means that a total solar eclipse appears once every one-and-a-half years,
" Sun said, adding that it takes an average of 450 years for a total solar
eclipse to be visible at the same location twice.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the last total solar eclipse was seen around the northern port city
of Keelung in 1941 and the next one is expected to be visible near the Hengchun
peninsula in the south in 2070, Sun said.</P>
      <P>"Local people will be able to see an 'almost total' annular partial eclipse July
22, " Sun said, adding that Taiwan people won't be able to see such a similar
scene until 2046.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the ancient Chinese have used beautiful and poetic terms to
describe the five stages of a total solar eclipse, Sun said many Chinese people
are enthusiastically waiting for the arrival of the rare astronomical event.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the NSC is collaborating with the Ministry of Education, Academia
Sinica and the Council for Cultural Affairs to organize a series of outdoor
activities this summer to inspire local interest in astronomy.</P>
      <P>These activities will include a lights-down campaign that will be held June 21
in which local people will be encouraged to turn off lights and go outdoors to
observe the skies.</P>
      <P>In July, a series of astronomy education camps will be organized for youngsters
from Taiwan and other Asia-Pacific countries. In addition,  a science festival
will take place Aug. 8 through mid-September to boost astronomical education.</P>
      <P>In related news,  prospective participants in an astronomy education  program
organized  by NTU's Graduate  Institute  of Astrophysics     can     register

      <P>Taiwan has made some progress in combating human trafficking over the past year,
but should do much more, including extending labor protections to all categories
of workers to prevent labor trafficking, according to the just-released 2009
U.S. Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Report.</P>
      <P>The annual report placed Taiwan in Tier 2 ranking, which is for governments that
are making significant efforts to meet the minimum standards for eliminating
trafficking prescribed by the U.S. law that guides anti-human trafficking
efforts - the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.</P>
      <P>Governments that fully comply are placed in Tier 1. Governments that do not
fully comply with the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts
to do so are placed in Tier 3.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan authorities made noticeable progress during the reporting period by
passing a new anti-trafficking law,  bolstering law enforcement efforts, and
approving a budget plan of US$14.8 million for victim protection measures," the
report acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Trafficked victims - including men, women and children - are usually brought to
Taiwan for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Most trafficking victims are workers from rural areas of Vietnam, Thailand,
Indonesia, and the Philippines. They are employed through recruitment agencies
and brokers to perform low-skilled work in Taiwan's construction, fishing, and
manufacturing industries, or to work as domestic helpers.</P>
      <P>"Many of these workers fall victim to labor trafficking by unscrupulous brokers
and employers, who force workers to perform work outside the scope of their
contract and often under exploitative conditions, " the report said, which is
available online.</P>
      <P>Some women and girls from China and Southeast Asian countries are trafficked  to
Taiwan through fraudulent  marriages,  deceptive employment offers, and illegal
smuggling for sexual exploitation and forced labor, the report found.</P>
      <P>It said many migrant workers are charged job placement and service fees up to
the equivalent of US$14,000, some of which are unlawful.</P>
      <P>The report added that this results in substantial debt for the workers that
unscrupulous labor brokers or employers may use as a coercive tool to subject
the workers to involuntary servitude.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign workers remain vulnerable to trafficking because legal
protections, oversight by authorities and enforcement efforts are currently
inadequate, " said the report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's regulations currently allow employers to implement a system of "forced
savings, " whereby employers deduct up to 30 percent of a foreign worker's
monthly salary to be placed in a bank account in the worker's name, but
inaccessible to the worker, the report said. This system has facilitated
trafficking, it said.</P>
      <P>The report cited NGOs saying that immigration, police and local law enforcement
officials continue to view trafficking victims as runaways or criminals,
resulting in some victims being penalized rather than assisted.</P>
      <P>In addition to recommending that Taiwan extend labor protections to all
categories of workers, the report also suggested that Taiwan implement its new
comprehensive anti-trafficking law and effectively carry out its victim and
witness protections so that victims are not penalized for acts committed as a
direct result of being trafficked, which would encourage them to seek help.</P>
      <P>It also suggested Taiwan increase police efforts to investigate trafficking
crimes and to identify trafficking victims, and improve cooperation with
governments of labor source countries on trafficking investigations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Immigration Agency (NIA), which did not have a direct response
to the findings of the report, said Thursday that Taiwan has remained on Tier 2
in the annual report for three consecutive years. It said Japan and Singapore
also received Tier 2 ranking.</P>
      <P>The agency said Taiwan was placed on Tier 2 Watch List in 2006 and upgraded to
Tier 2 the next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) announced  Thursday  that it has smashed a
large-scale  human trafficking ring involving suspects from Taiwan, Hong Kong,
China and the United States.</P>
      <P>The cross-border human smuggling gang is the largest ever uncovered in Taiwan in
collaboration with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a spokesman for the
NIA's Border Affairs Corps told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Seventy-four Taiwanese suspects of the ring were turned over to the Taoyuan
Prosecutors Office for further investigation,  the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the initial investigation, a Chinese man surnamed Wang was the
mastermind of the ring, which helped Chinese women obtain passports of the
Republic of China altered with their photos. The fake passports were then used
to apply for valid U.S. visas so that the women could enter the United States
using the forged passports.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese accomplice surnamed Yang was allegedly responsible for swindling
local young girls' ID documents from their parents, mainly in eastern Taiwan's
Hualien County. And a tour agency manager identified as Liao used the documents
to apply for ROC passports and for U.S. visas, which were later doctored with
photos of young Chinese women.</P>
      <P>NIA officials said Liao was able to obtain genuine ROC passports and valid U.S.
visas for Chinese women seeking to smuggle into the United States, as the Taipei
office of the American Institute in Taiwan does not require Taiwanese applicants
younger than 14 years old to undergo an interview.</P>
      <P>After Liao got the passports, someone else would take them to Hong Kong, where
Taiwanese women hired by the gang would accompany these Chinese women to travel
to the United States by serving as a pseudo companion.</P>
      <P>More than 30 Taiwanese women,  some of whom were college lecturers, former
flight attendants and nurses, were employed to accompany the Chinese women, and
were paid US$1,000 to US$1,500 in reward for each trip. Some of these Taiwanese
women claimed to have no knowledge about the scheme.</P>
      <P>Citing information provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the
corps said under the fraudulent scheme, more than 40 Chinese women have
successfully entered the United States using the forged ROC passports.</P>
      <P>Each of these Chinese women paid US$60,000 to US$70,000 to be smuggled to the
United States, and the U.S. authorities strongly suspect that they might be
illegally engaged in prostitution in the country, the corps said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hualien County police authorities said they have launched an in-depth
investigation into the case, because they suspect that personal data of young
girls at some local aboriginal villages were illegally sold to criminal
elements.</P>
      <P>The indigenous girls' families said they were fooled into thinking the people
who took their daughter's documents would help their family apply for government
subsidies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou officiated Thursday at the inauguration of a new vaccine
facility in central Taiwan run by Adimmune Corp. that is capable of producing
vaccines against the influenza A(H1N1) strain.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inauguration, Ma said Taiwan is one of just 11 countries in the
world capable of producing vaccine for swine flu and he added that it is
important that Taiwan, as a member of the international community, can and will
share the vaccine with other countries that need it in the face of the swine flu
pandemic.</P>
      <P>Immediately after its inauguration, Adimmune's new plant in Tantzu, Taichung
County will ramp up its production to meet an order placed by the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) for 5 million doses of influenza A(H1N1) vaccine, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He said that flu, although a common ailment, should never be taken lightly,
pointing out that in 1918, 20 million people were killed in a Spanish flu
pandemic, a figure equal to the World War 1 casualties of 10 nations.</P>
      <P>He also gave the thumbs-up to Adimmune Corp. Chairman Chan Chi-hsien, who was
elected chairman of the company only last year but streamlined its finances in a
mere two months.</P>
      <P>Soon after that, he said, Chan, a former DOH minister, then instigated planning
for the new plant and solicited investment from the government to facilitate
construction, making it possible for Taiwan to pitch in with the global
production of A(H1N1) vaccine in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that although the flu infections have been declared by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as a level-six pandemic -- the highest level on the WHO scale
-- the situation is much milder than previously anticipated thanks to concerted
efforts by countries around the world and heightened vigilance against the
disease.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan, one of only 11 countries capable of producing A(H1N1)
vaccine, is now among the countries that are most advanced in terms of
biotechnological research and applications.</P>
      <P>Adimmune Corp., the largest vaccine-producing company in Asia, has a maximum
annual capacity of 30 million doses of vaccine produced at its Miaoli plant and
Tantzu plant.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's only human vaccine manufacturer, Adimmune Corp. has recently received
seed viruses for production provided by Australia, Britain and the United
States.</P>

      <P>Anyone caught abusing stray cats or dogs can be slapped with heavy fines or can
be sentenced to a maximum one-year prison term, a Council of Agriculture (COA)
official said Thursday in response to a spate of reports of animal abuse in
recent weeks.  Hsu Kuei-sen,  director of the COA's Animal Industry Department,
pointed out that the Animal Protection Act prohibits maltreatment or abuse of
animals, with violators facing fines ranging between NT$100,000 (US$3,030) and
NT$1 million or sentences of up to a year.</P>
      <P>Anyone who spots cases involving animal abuse can report them to city or county
animal protection authorities, Hsu said, adding that if a case is considered a
danger to public security, it should be reported to the closest police station.</P>
      <P>In the latest alleged animal abuse case, a pet dog raised by a 78-year-old woman
in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County was shot dead by the military last weekend
after the animal intruded onto a runway at the Chiayi air base.</P>
      <P>The owner said she was not convinced her dog would have intruded into the off-
limits area because it was a pet and not a stray.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi county animal disease quarantine bureau said it had launched an
investigation into the case and added that if air base staff randomly shot the
animal, they will be fined.</P>
      <P>An air force officer visited the dog's elderly owner a day earlier to apologize
for the killing. According to the officer, pilots were conducting landing and
takeoff training when the dog intruded onto the runway.</P>
      <P>"As it was an emergency situation, a non-commissioned officer shot the dog, "

highest importance. A gentleman who has valor, but is without a knowledge and
love of what is right, is likely to commit a crime. A common man who has
courage, but is without the knowledge and love of what is right, is likely to
become a robber."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan trains Afghan nurses</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19 (CNA)
06/19/09  14:38:37
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Afghan nurses attending a nursing training program in Taiwan said
recently that they will become much more skilled and able to provide better care
for patients in their country by learning from Taiwan's advanced nursing skills,
standardized systems and modern facilities.</P>
      <P>Hossin Dad, Hakima Sadat, Abdul Amid -- three of the 10 nurses who are being
trained in Taipei's Tri-Service General Hospital, made the remarks in an
interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>"We hope that by coming to Taiwan, we can gain more knowledge, skills and
experience and apply what we learn here to help our people," said Hossin, a
pediatric nurse and the group's leader.</P>
      <P>Despite the steady deterioration  of Afghanistan's  medical infrastructure, the
nurses believe their pioneering mission to Taiwan is of great importance for the
country.</P>
      <P>"We are being trained for the future, " Hossin said. "Although we don't have
modern equipment or standardized nursing administration at the moment, we are
readying ourselves for a time when these facilities will be available," he
added.</P>
      <P>The training program was initiated by Sima Samar, founder of Afghanistan's non-
profit Shuhada Organization, which operates clinics and hospitals in Afghanistan
and Pakistan dedicated to the provision of health care to Afghan women and
girls.</P>
      <P>After winning the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy's (TFD's) Asia Democracy and
Human Rights Award last December, Samar wrote to the NGO Affairs Committee under
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry and expressed hope that the country's non- government
organizations can provide help to improve Afghanistan's medical environment.</P>
      <P>The three-month nurse training program -- the first of its kind --  was then
launched  by the Taiwan  Nurses Association  in collaboration with the Foreign
Ministry, the Cabinet-level Department of Health and the government-funded TFD.</P>
      <P>The nurses arrived in Taiwan June 5 and started their clinical training at the
Tri-Service General hospital June 10, learning about maternal and child health,
wound care, emergency medical treatment, community health care and nursing
administration.</P>
      <P>Speaking about the poor medical situation  in Afghanistan, pediatric nurse Abdul
said his hospital does not have enough beds, nurses,  doctors,  modern equipment
or a standard system for patient-care and that they sometimes even have to put
four children in one bed.</P>
      <P>"I hope the Taiwanese government can help our country by allowing more doctors
and nurses to receive training here," Abdul said.</P>
      <P>"The program is a pioneering  start for bilateral medical cooperation," he
added.</P>
      <P>Hakima, who works as a midwife and nurse in obstetrics and gynecology, said that
over the past week, the Tri-Service General Hospital has offered a lot of
different training and courses according to their specific fields and that she
felt she gained a lot of additional knowledge about patient-care.</P>
      <P>Weng Min-hsueh, a supervisor of the hospital's Department of Nursing said the
hospital has not only tailored training courses in various medical fields such
as surgery, anesthesiology and pediatrics specifically for the Afghan nurses,
but is also teaching them how to use the Internet and computers to do work-
related research.</P>
      <P>They will also benefit from the hospital's resources for treating the war
injuries common in Afghanistan as a result of the decades of conflict there, she
added.</P>
      <P>Afghanistan has suffered continuous civil war, in addition to foreign
intervention, since the 1970s, and Hossin, Abdul and Hakima all have their own
stories about life in the war-torn country.</P>
      <P>Abdul, who comes from Bamyan Province in central Afghanistan, said that the
Taleban regime destroyed his hometown and that he lost everything, including his
cousin, during the conflict.</P>
      <P>However, he said he has not told his five children about his tragic past because
he does not want them to carry the burden of hatred and hopes that Afghanistan
will achieve peace step-by-step.</P>
      <P>Speaking about their impressions of Taiwan, the three nurses said with one voice
that before coming to the country, they had no idea what Taiwan is like, apart
from its geographic location on the map and seeing the landmark Taipei 101
building on television.</P>
      <P>After spending one week in Taipei, they were amazed at how advanced and modern
the city is and have taken time out of their busy training program to look
around and see the sights.</P>
      <P>Having visited places such as Taipei 101, Kuantu Temple, Taipei City Zoo, the
Shihlin night market and the Grand Hotel, Hakima said she was particularly
impressed by the scale of a supermarket they visited, pointing out that they do
not have similar things in her hometown.</P>
      <P>Hossin said he was deeply touched by the hospitality of the Taiwanese people,
who have treated him like a true friend despite the thousands of miles between
Taiwan and Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>"We will bring back to our country not only medical skills and experience, but
also many beautiful pictures and precious memories," Abdul said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On the opposition's drive for ECFA referendum</P>
      <P>On the issue of holding a referendum on the signing of an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, all the officials in President Ma Ying-
jeou's administration say that "it has nothing to do with sovereignty or
politics and there is no need for a referendum." We want to tell President Ma:
you are wrong, terribly wrong.</P>
      <P>Ma has reiterated on many occasions that "Taiwan's future should be decided by
Taiwan's 23 million people, " but he is now attempting to sign an ECFA with
China based on the "one China" framework, without the consent of the Taiwanese
people. Isn't this against the international human rights covenants that he
signed recently?</P>
      <P>Therefore, in promoting a referendum on ECFA, the opposition must break through
the shackles of the Referendum Act and make the referendum a "new civic
movement, " in order to safeguard the well-being of the Taiwanese people and
offer Ma a lesson on "popular sovereignty."</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: On organ donation</P>
      <P>A 48-year-old man has donated his kidney and part of his liver to his wife over
the last seven years.</P>
      <P>At a time when the divorce rate is higher than the marriage rate, it is rare for
any husbands and wives to help and support each other so much so that they would
sacrifice their organs.</P>
      <P>Those who live in impoverished countries and are forced to sell their organs for
a living deserve our sympathy. And those who sign a donor card to indicate their
wish to donate their organs after death are admirable. It is even more rare and
commendable for those who donate parts of their organs to others in need while
they are alive, without asking for reward.</P>
      <P>China Times: On the reasons for dropping legal action</P>
      <P>As the largest shareholder of the China Times Group, Want Want Group Chairman
Tsai Eng-meng has the right to seek justice for the humiliation he suffered as a
result of recent defamation (speculation that the Want Want Group is backed by
China) . Tsai can choose to exercise this right but he can also choose not to.</P>
      <P>It was his choice to enter the media sector and shoulder the social
responsibility. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Sometimes,
making the decision not to uphold one's rights is also a kind of social
responsibility.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On Taiwan's economic development</P>
      <P>A recent decision by MSCI Inc. to place Taiwan's markets under review for a
possible upgrade to "developed" status has brought surprising joy to many
people. At the same time, it is sad that Taiwan is the last of Asia's four
little dragons to be included on the list.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan was wasting its energy on politics over the past 10 years,  South
Korea quickly passed Taiwan and many developing countries were catching up. In
these 10 years, Taiwan's global ranking in terms of good exports dropped from
14th to 18th, while its ranking for service exports declined from 18th to 28th.</P>
      <P>When we took the plunge into politics, we brought tremendous disaster to our
economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Variables exist in swine flu vaccine production: Adimmune</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The price of a planned domestically developed vaccine against the influenza
A(H1N1) virus, better known as swine flu, will be competitive compared to
imported vaccines, but variables still exist in the development process,
Adimmune Corp. said Thursday.</P>
      <P>While inaugurating its new plant in Taichung County, central Taiwan, the
management of Adimmune Corp. -- the only company in Taiwan qualified to mass
produce the A(H1N1) vaccine -- said the price of the domestically developed
vaccine could be controlled to remain as low US$10 per dose, compared to 10
euros or US$15-US$20 per dose for counterparts quoted on the international
pharmaceuticals market.</P>
      <P>Adimmune has received vials of the virus strain for vaccine production from four
World Health Organization (WHO) -authorized labs in Australia, Britain and the
United States but has yet to decide which strain to use for domestic
development, said Ignatius Wei, deputy CEO and president of Adimmune.</P>
      <P>Adimmune will produce the vaccine based on chicken embryos, said Chang Chin-
chuan, vice president of the company.</P>
      <P>A total of 8 million chicken eggs meeting a specific set of requirements that
were sourced domestically since last year will be used to produce the vaccine,
Chang said, adding that some 10 million doses are expected to be produced
between July and September this year.</P>
      <P>The company is planning to place orders for additional chicken eggs for medical
use from abroad, at a unit price of NT$18-NT$20, he added.</P>
      <P>"At issue is the fact that Adimmune has not yet conducted animal or human trials
on the A(H1N1) vaccine and nobody in the world knows so far whether one dose is
enough to contain the infection or allow the patient to produce enough
antibodies," he went on.</P>
      <P>"If it requires two doses to make the vaccination effective, Adimmune will be
forced to ramp up production to meet the orders placed by the Department of
Health," he added.</P>
      <P>According to DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan, the Centers for Disease Control will
authorize an open bid at the end of June for Taiwan's purchases of 5 million
doses of the vaccine from overseas.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he predicted that global demand will exceed supply as the vaccine
is in high demand worldwide since swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently one of only 11 countries capable of producing A(H1N1)
vaccine.</P>
      <P>Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's only human vaccine manufacturer and the largest
vaccine-producing company in Asia, has a maximum annual capacity of 30 million
doses of vaccine.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's installed wind power capacity is expected to increase to 980,000
kilowatts by 2010, under a new government policy to develop green energy, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The capacity will continue to rise over the next 15 years, to reach 1.48 million
kilowatts by 2015 and 3 million kilowatts by 2025, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>In 2008, installed wind power capacity in Taiwan reached 358,000 kilowatts,
making the country the world's 23rd largest producer of wind power, according to
the CEPD.</P>
      <P>The council noted that wind power is one of the most important types of
renewable energy and that its development is encouraged by many countries around

    <HEADLINE>Workers entitled to paid 'typhoon days': CLA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Workers in Taiwan now are eligible to paid "typhoon breaks" whenever local
governments declare schools and government office closed, the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>In the event of a typhoon, flood or strong earthquake, office and factory
workers could take the day off with pay, once the local governments close
schools and government offices, the CLA announced.</P>
      <P>If employees are asked to work on "typhoon days, " they should be paid overtime
and given transportation and other allowances, in addition to their daily wages,
CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>However, workers should be allowed to stay at home on government declared
typhoon days, as they could be injured while traveling to and from work, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>Generally, employees of private companies are usually required to work on
officially declared typhoon days, once they cannot produce evidence to prove
that their personal safety would be jeopardized on their way to and from work.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the 1111 Job Bank in August 2008, closure for
one day due to a typhoon could lead to an average loss of NT$593,100 (US$18,500)
for private enterprises.</P>
      <P>However, the online survey on typhoon breaks conducted among private enterprises
showed that 80.65 percent of the respondent companies said they usually adhere
to the government's announcements for closure during typhoons, while 19.35
percent said they do not.</P>
      <P>Among  the companies  that said they did not follow  the government's lead on
typhoon days, 10.67 percent said they did their own evaluation of the severity
of the storm before deciding whether or not to give their employees a day off,
and 8.68 percent said some of their staff were given the day off while others
are expected to work, depending on their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>Direct charter flight service between Taiwan and Hunan capital Changsha will be
expanded from the current one flight per week to eight flights per week in July,
an official from China's Hunan province said Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hunan province's Vice Governor Gan Lin, in Taiwan to promote travel exchanges,
said the decision was made after planning for a cross-Taiwan Strait forum on
economic, trading and cultural issues between Taiwan's  Kuomintang  and China's
Communist  Party was completed.</P>
      <P>The annual forum, set to take place in Changsha on July 11-12, is the fifth of
its kind.</P>
      <P>Taipei-Changsha flight services were launched Jan. 15, with China's Xiamen
Airlines operating one flight per week.</P>
      <P>In July, the carrier will add one more flight on the route while Guangzhou-based
China Southern Airlines, and Taiwan's China Airlines and TransAsia Airways will
all offer two flights per week between the destinations, Gan said.</P>
      <P>Among the main attractions in Hunan province is its natural forest park,
Zhangjiajie, listed as one of the world's natural legacies.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from Hunan provincial travel authorities, the number of
Taiwanese visitors to the southern China province reached 164,000 in 2008, 11.3
percent more than a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of 2009, 86,000 Taiwanese visited Hunan, 7.7 percent
higher compared with the same period a year ago, statistics show.</P>

      <P>The number of men of draft age totals 174,772 this year, up 7.81 percent from
2008, according to a report released Friday by the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The figure saw five straight years of decline from 2001 to 2005 owing to the
drop in Taiwan's birth rate. After a slight growth in 2006 and an abrupt rise in
2007, a 10.71 percent plunge was recorded in 2008, the MOI said.</P>
      <P>Of all men reaching draft age this year, 141,581, or 81 percent cannot accept
conscription. The most common reason -- given by 93.8 percent of them -- is that
they are still studying.</P>

      <P>The Central Epidemics Command Center reported Friday two more cases of imported
swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1), raising the total number of
confirmed cases to 60.</P>
      <P>The center said the patients are two female students, 14 and 21 years old, who
returned home from California. One of them developed swine flu symptoms after
her return to Taiwan, while the other was found to have a fever upon arrival at
the Taiwan airport.</P>
      <P>There were no signs of swine flu symptoms among members of the students'
families, the center said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, one of the two indigenous cases of swine flu in Taiwan has not yet
fully recovered, the center added.</P>
      <P>Although community outbreaks of swine flu were reported in Hong Kong and
Thailand, Taiwan has no plan to revise its pandemic alert level or to upgrade
its yellow travel advisory for the two countries, the center said.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization on June 11 raised its global swine flu alert to
level 6, which is the highest on the scale.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council spokesman Liu Teh-shun reminded people traveling to or

the council's Hong Kong office and the Taiwan Department of Health will keep a
close watch on swine flu developments in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Effective Wednesday, Hong Kong health authorities confirmed 13 imported and 40
locally contracted swine flu cases, bringing to nearly 200 the total number of

      <P>Taiwan will host a National Basketball Association (NBA) game for the first time
when the Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers play an exhibition game at Taipei
Arena Oct. 8, a breakthrough for a country in which the NBA has a devoted
following.</P>
      <P>NBA China CEO Tim Chen, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, Sports Affairs Council
Minister  Tai Hsia-ling  and Chinese Taipei Basketball Association Chairman Wang
Jen-tar were on hand when the announcement was made, with Chen describing the
game as the "best gift" for the long-term support of Taiwanese NBA fans.</P>
      <P>"Oct. 8 will become a historic day for the NBA and millions of local fans in
Taiwan. We are honored to present two of the best NBA teams to Taiwanese fans,
who are full of passion for the game," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taipei will become the 8th Asian city to host an NBA exhibition or regular
season game. Tokyo, Yokohoma and Saitama hosted six regular season two-game
series between 1990 and 2003,  while exhibitions have been held in recent years
in Beijing, Guangzhou, Macau, and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Tai said 2009 was a year of sports for Taiwan, as the NBA exhibition game joins
the World Games scheduled to be held in Kaohsiung in July and the Deaflympics in
Taipei in September as marquee events.</P>
      <P>Hau said Taipei was honored to be chosen to host an NBA game.</P>
      <P>"The Taipei City government will use all administrative resources to make the
game a great success," the Taipei mayor said.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, a series of NBA-related activities, including the
NBA Cares program that promotes social responsibility and community charity,
will be held before the game between the Nuggets and Pacers is contested in the
12,874-seat Taipei Arena.</P>
      <P>Led by two-time NBA All-Star Carmelo Anthony and 2004 NBA Finals MVP Chauncey
Billups, the Nuggets provided a strong challenge to the Los Angeles Lakers
before being ousted by the eventual NBA champion in the 2009 Western Conference
Championship.</P>
      <P>The rebuilding Pacers finished ninth in the NBA's Eastern Conference in the
2008-2009 season, three games out of a playoff spot. They are led by Danny
Granger, who won the 2008-2009 NBA Most Improved Player Award, and point guard
T.J. Ford.</P>
      <P>Tickets for the game, one of only two NBA games to be played in Asia this year,
will go on sale June 22 exclusively for Cathay United Bank credit card holders
at www.allgenki.net/ticket before being opened to everyone on June 25.</P>
      <P>The organizers said ticket prices will range from NT$800-7,500 (US$24-228) to
satisfy all kinds of NBA fans in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung County began a search for 21 elementary school and kindergarten
teachers Friday that attracted 5,100 applicants.</P>
      <P>The selection process will last three days, with applicants to face
qualification exams in July, the local government said.</P>
      <P>One applicant submitting her resume to the county government said she hopes she
can pass the tests to become a full-time teacher after having served as a
substitute teacher for over 10 years.</P>
      <P>The last time the southern Taiwan county hired elementary school teachers was in
2003. There have been no openings since then due to a declining birth rate that
has led to fewer public elementary school and kindergarten classes.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Education statistics, 38,413 people with teaching
certificates took national examinations in 2008 to fill public elementary school
teaching openings in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Only 2,857 people, or 7.4 percent of the applicants, passed the tests. The 7.4
percent success rate was down from an 8.6 percent success rate in 2007, the

      <P>A piece of installation art featuring hundreds of discarded statues and images
of deities from Taiwan is currently being exhibited at Musee Guimet in Paris,
part of the museum's efforts to attract new visitors through the introduction of
exotic works.</P>
      <P>The piece, dubbed God Pound, was created by Taiwanese artist Peng Hung-chih and
symbolizes the special cultural phenomenon in Taiwan where people throw away
statues of deities as easily as they abandon their pets under certain
circumstances,  said Chen Chih-cheng, director of the Taiwan Cultural Center in
Paris.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Jacques Gies, the French museum's new curator, was fascinated
by Peng's installation work when he first saw it while touring a Taiwanese
contemporary art exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts near the renowned Louvre
museum recently.</P>
      <P>Gies then invited Peng to exhibit the work in the museum, consistent with Gies'
efforts to promote "dialogue" between classic and contemporary works since
assuming office not long ago and attract a new generation of visitors, Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>Peng's installation art work consists of 606 deserted statues and
representations of deities lining the museum's atrium to form a spectacular
sight, but the statues all face a video screen playing a documentary in which a
dog narrates the story of the icons being worshipped in temples one day and
dumped like waste the next.</P>
      <P>Chen said the piece embodies the similarity between the fates of stray dogs and
scrapped deity statues, and hopes to inspire visitors to think about the meaning
of consumerism and significance of faith in people's lives.</P>
      <P>All of the statues were disinfected and treated for pests before being put on
display, Chen said, adding that the exhibition will run until Oct.19.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday Taiwan still needs help from the United
States in defending its national security even if once tense relations with
China have grown more relaxed since he took power in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Ma made the statement during a meeting with visiting U.S. scholars, including
former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susan Shirk.</P>
      <P>The visitors expressed concern over Washington's role in the Taiwan Strait and
over the development of Taiwan-China relations, but Ma contended that changes in
cross-strait ties over the past year were beneficial to Taiwan, China and the
U.S.</P>
      <P>Despite the improvement in relations, however, Taiwan still needs U.S. help in
safeguarding national security, Ma said, reiterating his desire to continue to
maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma also reiterated his call for a "diplomatic truce" between Taiwan
and China, saying he would not block moves by Taiwan's diplomatic allies move to
pursue economic relations with China.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is actively trying to improve cross-strait ties and expand its
relations with diplomatic allies, it is also working to maintain good relations
with old friends Japan and the U.S. and find a good balance among all of its
relations, the president said.</P>
      <P>Shirk described Ma's cross-strait policy as practical and said she was deeply
impressed by the progress made in cross-strait ties over the past year.</P>

      <P>The paper further said the ADIC-designed jet fighters will be equipped with twin

      <P>U-Theatre, a renowned Taipei-based drumming group, serves as a good example of
Taiwan's "soft power, " as it has bridged the cultural gap between Taiwan and
Israel, the top Israeli envoy to Taiwan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Raphael Gamzou,  representative of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei (ISECO) , made the remarks in a press release in light of the fact that
Nimroda Markin, a retired Israeli psychotherapist, is visiting Taiwan to find
out more about the cultural treasures of the country after being struck by
U-Theatre performances in Israel.</P>
      <P>"This is an amazing example of the ability of art and culture to build bridges
between peoples from different backgrounds, " Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>"It is also an amazing example of the impact of Taiwan soft power as an
incentive to discover the island, its treasures and the treasures of this
society and its culture," he added.</P>
      <P>U-Theatre was invited to tour Israel through efforts by the ISECO and by the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Tel Aviv, including a major opening
performance at the Israel Spring Festival last March.</P>
      <P>According to the ISECO, Markin purchased tickets for the first performance in
northern Israel and was so amazed by the drummers that she decided to purchase
tickets for the next show in a different venue 150 km from her hometown.</P>
      <P>Her attendance at the second performance did not diminish the impact of her
first experience, but rather, she found it was still not sufficient and
therefore made up her mind to find out more about the group, its culture and its
country, the press release stated.</P>
      <P>Markin, who had never visited Asia before, traveled thousands of miles to Taiwan
two weeks ago, where she was allowed to join the U-Theatre performers in
rehearsals and in a variety of different activities.</P>
      <P>The ISECO is scheduled to hold a tea party in collaboration with U- Theatre's
Artistic Director Liu Rou-yu for Markin June 22, in which she will share her
experience of the group and the discoveries she has made in Taiwan, the
statement said.</P>

      <P>A piece of installation art featuring hundreds of discarded statues and images
of deities from Taiwan is currently being exhibited at Musee Guimet in Paris,
part of the museum's efforts to attract new visitors through the introduction of
exotic works.</P>
      <P>The piece, dubbed God Pound, was created by Taiwanese artist Peng Hung-chih and
symbolizes the special cultural phenomenon in Taiwan where people throw away
statues of deities as easily as they abandon their pets under certain
circumstances,  said Chen Chih-cheng, director of the Taiwan Cultural Center in
Paris.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Jacques Gies, the French museum's new curator, was fascinated
by Peng's installation work when he first saw it while touring a Taiwanese
contemporary art exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts near the renowned Louvre
museum recently.</P>
      <P>Gies then invited Peng to exhibit the work in the museum, consistent with Gies'
efforts to promote "dialogue" between classic and contemporary works since
assuming office not long ago and attract a new generation of visitors, Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>Peng's installation art work consists of 606 deserted statues and
representations of deities lining the museum's atrium to form a spectacular
sight, but the statues all face a video screen playing a documentary in which a
dog narrates the story of the icons being worshipped in temples one day and
dumped like waste the next.</P>
      <P>Chen said the piece embodies the similarity between the fates of stray dogs and
scrapped deity statues, and hopes to inspire visitors to think about the meaning
of consumerism and significance of faith in people's lives.</P>
      <P>All of the statues were disinfected and treated for pests before being put on
display, Chen said, adding that the exhibition will run until Oct.19.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday Taiwan still needs help from the United
States in defending its national security even if once tense relations with
China have grown more relaxed since he took power in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Ma made the statement during a meeting with visiting U.S. scholars, including
former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susan Shirk.</P>
      <P>The visitors expressed concern over Washington's role in the Taiwan Strait and
over the development of Taiwan-China relations, but Ma contended that changes in
cross-strait ties over the past year were beneficial to Taiwan, China and the
U.S.</P>
      <P>Despite the improvement in relations, however, Taiwan still needs U.S. help in
safeguarding national security, Ma said, reiterating his desire to continue to
maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma also reiterated his call for a "diplomatic truce" between Taiwan
and China, saying he would not block moves by Taiwan's diplomatic allies move to
pursue economic relations with China.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is actively trying to improve cross-strait ties and expand its
relations with diplomatic allies, it is also working to maintain good relations
with old friends Japan and the U.S. and find a good balance among all of its
relations, the president said.</P>
      <P>Shirk described Ma's cross-strait policy as practical and said she was deeply
impressed by the progress made in cross-strait ties over the past year.</P>
      <P>Shirk, an expert on Chinese politics, was invited to attend an international
academic symposium organized  by National Taiwan University's Center for China

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is still working on plans to acquire a
new generation of military aircraft, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Yu Sy-tue was responding to a newspaper report that the
state-run Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (ADIC) has designed a new
generation of jet fighters that cater to the military's special needs.</P>
      <P>According to the China Times report, the ADIC has completed the design of the
new military aircraft with assistance from Russian experts in the field.</P>
      <P>In the process, the Taipei-based daily said, the ADIC had sent people to Russia
to consult with Russian strategists and engineers on the design of the new
fighter.</P>
      <P>The paper further said the ADIC-designed jet fighters will be equipped with twin
engines and will be capable of taking off and landing over short distances.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Yu said the military is planning the acquisition of a
new generation of jet fighters.</P>
      <P>"The military will take into account the changing international strategic
environment, enemy threat, government finances, development trends in jet
fighters and the possibility of acquiring them while working on new aircraft
acquisition plans," Yu explained.</P>
      <P>He would not divulge details,  however, on the military's acquisition and
reasearch plans.</P>
      <P>Instead, Yu said, jet fighters with short take-off and landing requirements,
stealth qualities and beyond-vision combat functions are all features that meet
the military's future combat requirements.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan chapter of Democrats Abroad, the official Democratic Party
organization for the millions of Americans living outside the United States,
announced Saturday in a press release that Democrats Abroad Taiwan (DAT) has
been approved as the organization's new country committee.</P>
      <P>Officially established May 26, the press release said the DAT's current
executive committee consists of five enthusiastic leaders, including John
Eastwood, a law firm partner who serves as DAT chairman, and Justine Chen, a
senior policy researcher who serves as DAT vice chairwoman.</P>
      <P>Other DAT members are Michael Turton,  who serves as DAT secretary, Josh Davis,
an MBA student at National Sun Yat-sen University who is DAT treasurer, and
David Bell, a graduate student in Chinese history at National Taiwan University
who serves as DAT counsel, it added.</P>
      <P>Christine Schon Marques, international chairwoman of Democrats Abroad, said in
the press release that members of the organization are pleased to welcome the
establishment of DAT.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's technology sector makes it home to many Americans, and in fact, many
Democrats living abroad," Marques said.</P>
      <P>"We know that under John Eastwood's leadership, DAT will bring a great deal of
energy and enthusiasm to the entire organization and will help expand the number
of Democrats in Congress in 2010, " she added.</P>
      <P>According to Eastwood, in the days right after the U.S. went into Iraq, anyone
who expressed serious concerns about where the country was going would get their
patriotism questioned.</P>
      <P>"Although Democrats Abroad had previously been active in Taiwan, we had to start
over in those difficult years," Eastwood said.</P>
      <P>Through organizing social events, Eastwood went on, he and like-minded friends
living in Taiwan created a safe place for fellow Americans to talk about what
was happening to their country and it was when the Democrats took Congress back
in 2006 that they began having some real momentum to further expand the scale of
the activities.</P>
      <P>Eastwood worked with longtime member Tammy Turner to organize events and provide
overseas-voting information to fellow Democrats through the 2004, 2006, and 2008
elections. The effort was furthered when Bell and Cynthia Teeters joined forces
with other Democrats for the start- up efforts to establish DAT.</P>
      <P>Democrats Abroad has committees throughout Europe, the U.S., the Middle East,
Africa, Asia and the Antipodes. These country committees keep Americans abroad
informed of their rights and help them participate in the U.S. political
process.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Artist Village (TAV) , a non- government organization in the nation's
capital, launched its 2010 Artist-in-Residence (AIR) Taipei Open Call for both
international and local artists to submit projects related to art and culture,
the creative  industry  and  interdisciplinary  and  business-art collaboration,
according to a TAV press statement released Saturday.</P>
      <P>Residence projects in three categories are requested for 2010 -- individual
artists  or  teams,  the  creative  industry  and interdisciplinary and
business-art collaboration -- according to the TAV, which added that applicants
must have a minimum of three years' experience or professional practice, while
students, as well as AIR grantees from 2007 and 2008, are not eligible to apply.</P>
      <P>Applications and portfolios including up to a maximum of six pieces of work
submitted on a PC-compatible CD-ROM or DVD or VCD from the last two years of the
artist's work, or an excerpt from six pieces of work, should be presented in
English and sent by post, it added.</P>
      <P>Other than the international open call for artists of any nationality, the
competitive category of international artists-in- residence, will continue the
"New Immigrants Taiwan" project for Southeast Asian artists, as well as the
"Artists from Sister Cities of Taipei, " which was introduced last year,
according to the press release.</P>
      <P>"Through these projects, we wish to make art as the bridge connecting Taipei
with cities worldwide," the TAV said.</P>
      <P>The application deadline for both domestic and international programs is July
31, and decisions on the successful applicants will be  announced  by  October
on  the  TAV  Web  site  at http://www.artistvillage.org.</P>
      <P>Established in 2001, the TAV sees exchanges between local and international
talent as its most important mission and it has taken a leading role in
providing a platform for international artists and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>In January 2008, with the aim of offering a greater space for cross- cultural
and interdisciplinary dialogue, the AIR Program was expanded to AIR Taipei,
encompassing not only the TAV in downtown Taipei  but also Grass Mountain
Artist Village,  located  in Yangmingshan National Park.</P>
      <P>As of August 2008, 200 international artists from 35 countries had stayed at TAV
as artists-in-residence, while nearly 80 Taiwanese artists had also participated
in AIT programs abroad.</P>

      <P>A dance rendition of the story of legendary Chinese goddess Nu Wa created by
Germany-based Taiwanese dancer-choreographer Sun Shang-chi will premiere in the
Avignon Off Festival in southern France July 8.</P>
      <P>Sun said Friday that Nu Wa, who legend says created mankind, symbolizes the
human imagination of nature and the universe.</P>
      <P>"I intend to search for the metaphor of the human body through the dance, as
well as the origin of human language, literature, rhythm and music, " Sun said,
adding that the dance is infused with Oriental mythology.</P>
      <P>The dance features interaction between two dancers and a pianist, the 32-year-
old dancer-choreographer went on.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, the background music was composed by Taiwanese composer Shih
Pei-yu, who is doing a doctoral program in Britain.</P>
      <P>German pianist Andreas Kern will not only play the score of Nu Wa but will also
improvise with the two dancers -- Sun himself and Nefeli Skarmea, a Greek female
dancer.</P>
      <P>Skarmea, who collaborated with Sun in the Nuremberg Modern Dance Theatre for
many years, praised Sun as an outstanding dancer and talented choreographer with
a unique style.</P>
      <P>Sun received financial support from Taiwan's Council for Cultural Affairs, the

creating Nu Wa.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-cheng, director of the Taiwan Culture Center in Paris, noted that few
Taiwanese choreographers have been able to edge into the European dance arena --
known as a Mecca for modern dance.</P>
      <P>"It is an extraordinary achievement for Sun to have emerged in Europe as an up-

      <P>A ceremony was held Saturday in southern Taiwan to inaugurate the country's
first commercial-grade high concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) solar power
system, which will have a total installed capacity of one megawatt once the
construction project is completed.</P>
      <P>The inauguration marked the first-stage operation of the system, located in the
Liuying Environment Science and Technology Park in Tainan County. At present, it
can generate 100 kilowatts of clean electricity per hour.</P>
      <P>Eric Tsai, general manager of the Taipei-based Advanced Renewable Energy Inc.
(AREi) , which is cooperating with the Tainan county government in developing
solar energy, said at the ceremony that 14 HCPV devices have been installed to
achieve an annual output of 190,000 kWh per year.</P>
      <P>In the future, the company will install other planned facilities to enable power
generation of 900 kilowatts per hour, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said that through a grid system, the clean power from the facility
will be provided for the use of AREi's photovoltaic research center at the
science park.</P>
      <P>Any additional power will be sold to the state-run Taiwan Power Company, he
noted.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the cost of constructing a HCPV solar power system is much
more than that of building a traditional solar power system, but requires 50
percent less land.</P>
      <P>The company is expected to earn its investment back in less than 14 years,
thanks to the passage of the Renewable Energy Development Act, which allows
government subsidies for private companies involved in the development of clean
energy.</P>

preparations being made for disaster prevention amid the approach of tropical
storm Linfa.</P>
      <P>Chiu issued the directive that southern Taiwan, as well as the outlying islands
of Kinmen and Penghu, be fully alerted over possible flooding after the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) reported that the storm was expected to bring heavy rain to
southwestern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>He also ordered the Government Information Office to warn the public to refrain
from visiting beaches and avoid outdoor activities during the storm.</P>

      <P>Chuang had a happy childhood and had big, beautiful eyes that led to her
nickname "big-eye girl."</P>
      <P>Upon reaching the age of 13, however, she began to experience a decline  in her
vision and was later diagnosed  with macular degeneration.</P>
      <P>Her parents took her on a desperate search for a cure that included trips to
Japan and the United States, as well as a range of alternative therapies and
folk remedies that contained grotesque ingredients such as centipede legs, bat
guano and chicken gall.</P>
      <P>They grasped at every hope, but on each occasion, their hopes were shattered,
which made Chuang worry that her parents would go broke on her account.</P>
      <P>Her parents' support touched her deeply and gave her the courage to live as
fully and passionately as she can.</P>
      <P>"I did not want my father and mother to put the blame on themselves and think
that my vision problems were their fault, " Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Because of the disease, she encountered numerous frustrations in her daily life,
once showing her disability certificate to a bus driver in order to get a
discount, only to be rejected because she did not "look" disabled.</P>
      <P>Not being able to see clearly, she also had the experience of treading on a
puppy by accident when walking on campus, while in class, she had to use a
telescope to see the teachers' writing on the blackboard and a microscope to
read her books.</P>
      <P>Writing computer programs involved the help of a closed circuit television
system with her face close to the monitor. Work that would usually take her
classmates seven hours to complete would often take her four times as long.</P>
      <P>She kept telling herself to keep going because "if I give up on myself, no-one
in the world can save me."</P>
      <P>Having gained admission to a master's program in computer science at NTHU,
Chuang said she will continue working toward her goal of improving the design of
audio books from the user's perspective.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that at present, users of audio books have to listen from the
beginning and cannot browse back and forth freely. In addition, existing
products do not allow users to underline or bookmark passages they think are
important, which is a major inconvenience.</P>
      <P>Chuang said she hopes her story will remind others to value what they have and
encourage them to seek to fulfill their wishes whenever they can.</P>
      <P>"You never know. If you don't do it now, you may not have the chance to do so
later," she pointed out.</P>

      <P>China's positive response to Taiwan's call for a truce among expatriates from
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will contribute  to the peaceful  development
of cross-strait relations, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>KMT Deputy Secretary-General Chang Jung-kung made the remarks after Wang Yi,
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State Council, said in Los
Angeles the previous day that the once-strained cross-strait relations have
taken a historic turn for the better over the past year.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wang said at a meeting with Chinese expatriate community
leaders at China's Consulate General in Los Angeles that the concept of "a truce
and no attrition of resources" on the diplomatic front can also be applied to
the expatriate front.</P>
      <P>From now on, Wang continued, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should stop
their confrontation in dealing with expatriate affairs.</P>
      <P>"Wang's statements mark the latest expression of China's attitude toward
expatriate affairs," Chang said, adding that his remarks also symbolize
Beijing's positive response to President Ma Ying-jeou's recent appeal for a
truce between Taiwanese and Chinese expatriate groups.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has benefited from the cross-strait diplomatic truce over the
past year, Chang said the two sides of the strait should expand this
conciliatory approach to expatriate front.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China once engaged in a diplomatic tug-of-war in which both sides
often had to spend huge amounts of their national resources to lure diplomatic
allies. Since Ma assumed office in May 2008, he has advocated a "modus vivendi"
diplomatic strategy to pave the way for a cross-strait diplomatic truce.</P>
      <P>"This kind of detente  should  be extended  to expatriate communities around the
world, " Chang said, adding that the goodwill strategy would spare overseas
people of Chinese descent from taking sides and could instead promote exchanges
and harmony between expatriate groups, as well as cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the decades-old cross-strait confrontation on the expatriate
front has a very complex background, Chang said he believes the hostility can be
gradually resolved in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>"Both sides could start by shelving disputes and forging mutual trust, gradually
working more and more closely together to sort out measures for peaceful co-
existence, " Chang said, adding that such a truce would help create a win-win
situation for both sides.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Saturday that he supports the idea of focusing on
tourism in general, allowing the casino trade to play more of a supplementary
role, in the development of the outlying islands of the Penghu archipelago.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when he toured the outlying county's city of Magong
during which he visited the airport and harbor, as well as listening to a
briefing prepared by the Penghu county government.</P>
      <P>Among those accompanying  him were Penghu Magistrate  Wang Chien-fa, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo, Tourism Bureau Director-General
Janice Lai, Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min and Legislator Lin Ping-
kuan of the opposition Non-partisan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Liu said his visit was aimed at learning "how to develop Penghu's tourism, and
not just seeing how it is going to build casinos."</P>
      <P>The legislature passed a draft amendment to a statute governing the development
of the country's outlying islands in January, paving the way for legalizing
gambling on the outlying islands, including the Penghu group.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that a draft bill on gambling management and complementary
measures drawn up by related government agencies will be ready by the end of the
year, adding that "whatever the results of a referendum by Penghu residents on
the casinos, the preparations will not be done in vain."</P>
      <P>The casino plan for Penghu will require "yes" votes from over half of the total
ballots cast in the referendum.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that to develop the county's tourism,  the renovation and
expansion of facilities such as the harbor and airport will be crucial, and he
asked the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to take the matter in
hand.</P>
      <P>Mao noted that the No. 1 wharf length at Magong Harbor will be expanded from the
present 126 meters to 190 meters by the end of the year, which will allow it to
accept moorings by large cruisers up to 40,000 tons upon its completion.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's travel agencies, who still have not recovered from the global financial
storm, have been left reeling even further with the World Health Organization
declaration of a global pandemic of the A(H1N1) influenza virus, which has
frightened many local people into avoiding foreign travel.</P>
      <P>According to the latest Tourism Bureau statistics, only a few first-stop
overseas destinations such as South Korea, Britain, Palau and Australia, enjoyed
growth in the number of travelers from Taiwan in May thanks to the incentives
that included favorable exchange rates, visa free privileges and convenient
flight services.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese travelers to Japan, which attracts over 1 million
Taiwanese visitors each year, had only 80,382 visits by this group in May,
marking a drop of 35.41 percent from the same month of the previous year, the
statistics show.</P>
      <P>In the case of Thailand, visitors from Taiwan in May fell by 36.4 percent
compared with the same month of last year, while the number of Taiwanese
travelers to the United States fell by 33.63 percent.</P>
      <P>All those countries had reported increasing numbers of A(H1N1) infections over
the past month.</P>
      <P>The statistics  also show the overall number of travelers departing Taiwan in
May registered a drop of 13.28 percent.</P>
      <P>Local travel agents have predicted an even worse situation in the upcoming
summer break, but anticipated significant growth in the number of people

      <P>Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung inspected the Central Emergency Operations Center
(CEOC) in Taipei County's Sindian City Saturday to see at first-hand the
preparations being made for disaster prevention amid the approach of tropical
storm Linfa.</P>
      <P>Chiu issued the directive that southern Taiwan, as well as the outlying islands
of Kinmen and Penghu, be fully alerted over possible flooding after the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) reported that the storm was expected to bring heavy rain to
southwestern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>He also ordered the Government Information Office to warn the public to refrain
from visiting beaches and avoid outdoor activities during the storm.</P>
      <P>The CWB had already released a sea warning for shipping and had reported earlier
in the day that the outer rim of the storm was expected to bring heavy rain or
extremely heavy rain to southern and southeastern parts of Taiwan, with other
areas receiving downpours in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>At 5: 30 p.m., Linfa was centered 380 km west-southwest of Oluanbi, Taiwan's
southernmost tip, packing maximum sustained winds of 101 kph and moving north-
northeast at 10 kph toward the Taiwan Strait, according to bureau data.</P>
      <P>The storm was expected to be 160 km west-southwest of the Penghu Islands off
southwestern Taiwan at 5 p.m. the next day.</P>
      <P>The bureau urged shipping in the Taiwan Strait, Bashi Channel and waters
surrounding the Pratas Islands to take precautions against heavy weather.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said vegetable
supplies were sufficient and normal, noting that the average wholesale price at
the Taipei market was within the normal range at NT$20.3 per kg earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>The COA urged farmers to prepare for the storm and advised them to get their
ripe crops harvested as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In the eastern county of Hualien, police stationed at the scenic Taroko National
Park began evacuating hikers from mountains in the park despite clear skies and
no signs of Linfa's approach.</P>
      <P>The police also rejected many applications for permits to enter restricted
mountain areas that same day out of safety concerns.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's travel agencies, who still have not recovered from the global financial
storm, have been left reeling even further with the World Health Organization
declaration of a global pandemic of the A(H1N1) influenza virus, which has
frightened many local people into avoiding foreign travel.</P>
      <P>According to the latest Tourism Bureau statistics, only a few first-stop
overseas destinations such as South Korea, Britain, Palau and Australia, enjoyed
growth in the number of travelers from Taiwan in May thanks to the incentives
that included favorable exchange rates, visa free privileges and convenient
flight services.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese travelers to Japan, which attracts over 1 million
Taiwanese visitors each year, had only 80,382 visits by this group in May,
marking a drop of 35.41 percent from the same month of the previous year, the
statistics show.</P>
      <P>In the case of Thailand, visitors from Taiwan in May fell by 36.4 percent
compared with the same month of last year, while the number of Taiwanese
travelers to the United States fell by 33.63 percent.</P>
      <P>All those countries had reported increasing numbers of A(H1N1) infections over
the past month.</P>
      <P>The statistics  also show the overall number of travelers departing Taiwan in
May registered a drop of 13.28 percent.</P>
      <P>Local travel agents have predicted an even worse situation in the upcoming
summer break, but anticipated significant growth in the number of people
embarking on domestic tours.</P>

      <P>Only 64 out of several hundred petty criminals had been released from prison
before noon Saturday under a new ruling by the Justices of the Constitutional
Court that allows those who have been given terms of longer than six months for
several petty convictions to pay fines in lieu of spending time behind bars.</P>
      <P>The grand justices issued the new ruling a day earlier, under which those who
are serving time in prisons and meet the new requirements could apply for
release from Saturday.</P>
      <P>As the grand justices did not give any grace period for implementation of the
new ruling, local prosecutors decided to allow those who meet the requirements
for release to walk out of prison gates even before judges determine the amount
of fines they would have to pay.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Justice (MOJ) statistics, 1,802 prison inmates are
eligible to apply for early release by paying fines.</P>
      <P>As of noon Saturday, 64 of the 768 applicants had been released. Among them,
only 29 had paid fines, with the rest promising to pay later.</P>
      <P>If they fail to make payments as scheduled, they will have to return to jails
and serve out their terms or be put on the wanted list, prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>Prison sources said some inmates show no interest in early release because they
are too poor to pay fines.</P>
      <P>The new measure for petty criminals to regain freedom by paying fines  became

the Criminal Code that prohibited those who had been given terms of longer than

      <P>Local governments of Taiwan's outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matzu
announced office and school closures Sunday after the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) issued a land warning for tropical storm Linfa.</P>
      <P>The first tropical storm to hit Taiwan this year, Linfa has also grounded air
and shipping services between Taiwan proper and the three island groups.</P>

Kinmen, moving in a north-northeasterly direction toward China at a speed of 20
kph.</P>
      <P>Packing maximum sustained winds of up to 90 kph, Linfa, this year's third
tropical storm to form in the West Pacific region, was expected to trigger
extremely heavy rain in areas from central to southern Taiwan, CWB
meteorologists said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A foreign oil tanker ran aground off the southern county of Pingtung late
Saturday, but temporarily posed no threat of an oil spill, the Pingtung County
Environmental Protection Bureau said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Colombo Queen, a 497-ton tanker registered in the Union of Comoros, an
island nation in the Indian Ocean, went aground about 50 meters off Pingtung's
scenic Jialeshuei coastal park amid strong winds and heavy seas whipped up by
approaching tropical storm Linfa.</P>
      <P>According to the National Rescue Command Center, the tanker, carrying 39,000
liters of fuel oil and nine crew members, sent out distress signals at around 8
p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>The command center alerted rescue teams in Kaohsiung  and Pingtung, but rescue
helicopters in those two counties were unable to fly because of the bad weather.</P>
      <P>The command center then called a Coast Guard Administration (CGA) unit in the
eastern county of Taitung, where winds and waves were lighter, as the tropical
storm was sweeping toward the Taiwan Strait to the west of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Upon reaching the area in the early hours of Sunday, the CGA patrol boat found
the stranded oil tanker but could not spot any of the crew, who had abandoned
ship, in the pitch darkness.</P>
      <P>The patrol boat itself was taking a heavy pounding, but just before it gave up
the search, a bolt of lightning struck, providing a flash of light that was
enough for the rescuers to spot a life raft with all nine men aboard, about
three nautical miles from the grounded tanker, a CGA official said.</P>
      <P>Aung Win, the Burmese captain of the Colombo Queen, said he had tried to steer
the tanker away from the coast but the winds were so strong that the vessel was
blown toward Taiwan and the engine finally gave out.</P>
      <P>"Thank Taiwan and thank Allah," Aung Win said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in Pingtung, county officials were meeting over fears that the
stranded tanker might cause an ecological calamity to the Pingtung coast similar
to a disastrous oil spill in January, 2001, when the Greek-registered bulk
carrier Amorgos ran aground off the coast of Pingtung's Kenting National Park,
spilling roughly 1,150 tons of fuel oil into the water.</P>
      <P>Three kilometers of coastline, from the Lungkeng Ecological Preserve to the
rocky cliffs at Oluanpi, were seriously polluted.</P>
      <P>The ensuing clean-up work among the coral reefs, carried out be local residents
and 1,600 military personnel, was extremely difficult and it took six years for
the 60-hectare Lungkeng Ecological Preserve to recover, as well as years of
fighting in international courts for Taiwan to get any compensation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Department of Health to procure mobile clinics for remote areas</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will acquire six more mobile clinics to extend
the reach of health care services into remote areas of the country, paying for
the vehicles with the revenues from the increased health surcharge on
cigarettes, a DOH official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Anticipating that the government's tax revenues from a hike in the surcharge on
cigarettes from June 1 will top NT$30 billion per year, DOH Minister Yeh Chin-
chuan instructed that a portion of the revenues should be used to provide
medical treatment for residents in remote mountainous and outlying areas,
according to Shih Chung-liang, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Medical
Affairs.</P>
      <P>As a result, 4 percent of the anticipated additional revenues -- an estimated
NT$900 million -- will be used for areas lacking medical resources, Shih added.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that people in remote areas, including 30 rural mountainous
townships and 18 outlying islands, have poor access to health services, the DOH
has been making efforts on three fronts -- providing free vaccines,
strengthening recruitment and training for medical professionals, and improving
medical care quality at hospitals in the areas -- Shih noted.</P>
      <P>Another important task of the agency is improving the delivery of health care to
remote areas. Under an integrated program for medical treatment consultation,
the DOH has been collaborating with regional and larger hospitals to dispatch
physicians to provide medical services in such areas on a regular basis,
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Taian township in the northern county of Miaoli, as well as Heping township and
Lishan township in the central county of Taichung have the most pressing need
for mobile clinics, said Lo Wen-min of the Bureau of Nursing and Health Services
Development under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The DOH plans to purchase 11 dentist chairs and six vehicles that will be
equipped with different types of equipment, including X-ray, ultrasound and
cancer detection facilities, dependent on the needs of the residents they will
serve, Lo added.</P>

      <P>Nine postgraduate students left Taipei City Sunday on a marathon road run from
northern Taiwan to the south aimed at getting a better idea of the land in which
they live.</P>
      <P>The students from National Taiwan University and National Taiwan University of
Science and Technology hit the road at 5 a.m., heading south toward Taoyuan,
where they were to continue their trek down Taiwan's western corridor to the
southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Before they reach Kaohsiung -- a journey they estimate will take eight days --
the students will jog through the counties of Hsinchu, Miaoli, Taichung,
Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan, in that order, said Chen Yi-an, who is the
public relations officer for the trek.</P>
      <P>"The journey could possibly  take longer than eight days, depending upon the
health of the trekkers," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Of the nine students, three will be jogging the whole way, while the others will
spend some time jogging, riding bicycles and motorcycles while documenting the
activity, taking care of liaison affairs and transporting luggage and supplies,
Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to itinerary of the trek, the students will pass through 60 townships
on the west coast, traveling an average 40km-50km each day. The group will rest
at around noon every day for lunch and to meet with the locals.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level National Youth Commission, sponsor of the activity, welcomes
members of the public to join the nine students by running alongside them,
taking pictures of them, or offering them accommodation.</P>

of young performers in the world, will team up with Taiwanese pianist Hu Chih-
long for a concert slated for July 18 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Goto, who is a physics major at Harvard University, is the younger bother of
Midori Goto, a violinist considered a national treasure in Japan.</P>
      <P>This will be Goto's second performance in Taiwan, having toured Taiwan, Hong

      <P>Love changes everything.</P>
      <P>When Rosel Be earned her bachelor's  degree from National Kaohsiung University
Saturday, the Philippines native understood fully what those three simple words
mean.</P>
      <P>Be's journey to love began in 1999, when she had to stop her life as a
university freshman to earn her own living because her family could no longer to
afford to pay for her studies.</P>
      <P>She managed to land a job at an electronics factory in Nantzih, in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, but sent the bulk of her meager salary back home to her
family every month, leaving her with very little for herself.</P>
      <P>Her dream of one day finishing her university studies became more and more
remote, giving way to thoughts about how she would earn enough money to improve
her family's livelihood when her three-year contract in Taiwan expired.</P>
      <P>However, Be met a Taiwanese engineer at her factory named Chu Yung-ren, who
encouraged her to pursue her dream and offered her sympathy when she plunged
into depression.</P>
      <P>The friendship developed into a relationship, so that when she was ready to pack
and leave Taiwan at the end of her contract, Chu popped the question and instead
of leaving, Be stayed on in Taiwan as Chu's wife.</P>
      <P>Driven by her desire to finish college, she enrolled in the Department of
Western Languages and Literature at National Kaohsiung University and immersed
herself in her studies.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, she graduated summa cum laude and was admitted to the Graduate
Institute of Foreign Languages and Literature at National Sun Yat-Sen
University, also in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Be, who still does not have a thorough command of mandarin Chinese, threw
herself into her husband's arms after receiving her diploma at the commencement
ceremony, saying that she owed her husband any glory she earned at the
university.</P>
      <P>Now she is looking forward to her graduate studies, with high hopes that she
will be able to land a teaching job after earning her master's degree.</P>

Kinmen, moving in a north-northeasterly direction toward China at a speed of 20
kph.</P>
      <P>Packing maximum sustained winds of up to 90 kph, Linfa, this year's third

    <TEXT>
      <P>A foreign oil tanker ran aground off the southern county of Pingtung late
Saturday, but temporarily posed no threat of an oil spill, the Pingtung County
Environmental Protection Bureau said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Colombo Queen, a 497-ton tanker registered in the Union of Comoros, an
island nation in the Indian Ocean, went aground about 50 meters off Pingtung's
scenic Jialeshuei coastal park amid strong winds and heavy seas whipped up by
approaching tropical storm Linfa.</P>
      <P>According to the National Rescue Command Center, the tanker, carrying 39,000
liters of fuel oil and nine crew members, sent out distress signals at around 8
p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>The command center alerted rescue teams in Kaohsiung  and Pingtung, but rescue
helicopters in those two counties were unable to fly because of the bad weather.</P>
      <P>The command center then called a Coast Guard Administration (CGA) unit in the
eastern county of Taitung, where winds and waves were lighter, as the tropical
storm was sweeping toward the Taiwan Strait to the west of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Upon reaching the area in the early hours of Sunday, the CGA patrol boat found
the stranded oil tanker but could not spot any of the crew, who had abandoned
ship, in the pitch darkness.</P>
      <P>The patrol boat itself was taking a heavy pounding, but just before it gave up
the search, a bolt of lightning struck, providing a flash of light that was
enough for the rescuers to spot a life raft with all nine men aboard, about
three nautical miles from the grounded tanker, a CGA official said.</P>
      <P>Aung Win, the Burmese captain of the Colombo Queen, said he had tried to steer
the tanker away from the coast but the winds were so strong that the vessel was
blown toward Taiwan and the engine finally gave out.</P>
      <P>"Thank Taiwan and thank Allah," Aung Win said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in Pingtung, county officials were meeting over fears that the
stranded tanker might cause an ecological calamity to the Pingtung coast similar
to a disastrous oil spill in January, 2001, when the Greek-registered bulk
carrier Amorgos ran aground off the coast of Pingtung's Kenting National Park,
spilling roughly 1,150 tons of fuel oil into the water.</P>
      <P>Three kilometers of coastline, from the Lungkeng Ecological Preserve to the
rocky cliffs at Oluanpi, were seriously polluted.</P>
      <P>The ensuing clean-up work among the coral reefs, carried out be local residents
and 1,600 military personnel, was extremely difficult and it took six years for
the 60-hectare Lungkeng Ecological Preserve to recover, as well as years of
fighting in international courts for Taiwan to get any compensation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Department of Health to procure mobile clinics for remote areas</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will acquire six more mobile clinics to extend
the reach of health care services into remote areas of the country, paying for
the vehicles with the revenues from the increased health surcharge on
cigarettes, a DOH official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Anticipating that the government's tax revenues from a hike in the surcharge on
cigarettes from June 1 will top NT$30 billion per year, DOH Minister Yeh Chin-
chuan instructed that a portion of the revenues should be used to provide
medical treatment for residents in remote mountainous and outlying areas,
according to Shih Chung-liang, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Medical
Affairs.</P>
      <P>As a result, 4 percent of the anticipated additional revenues -- an estimated
NT$900 million -- will be used for areas lacking medical resources, Shih added.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that people in remote areas, including 30 rural mountainous
townships and 18 outlying islands, have poor access to health services, the DOH
has been making efforts on three fronts -- providing free vaccines,
strengthening recruitment and training for medical professionals, and improving
medical care quality at hospitals in the areas -- Shih noted.</P>
      <P>Another important task of the agency is improving the delivery of health care to
remote areas. Under an integrated program for medical treatment consultation,
the DOH has been collaborating with regional and larger hospitals to dispatch
physicians to provide medical services in such areas on a regular basis,
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Taian township in the northern county of Miaoli, as well as Heping township and
Lishan township in the central county of Taichung have the most pressing need
for mobile clinics, said Lo Wen-min of the Bureau of Nursing and Health Services
Development under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The DOH plans to purchase 11 dentist chairs and six vehicles that will be
equipped with different types of equipment, including X-ray, ultrasound and
cancer detection facilities, dependent on the needs of the residents they will
serve, Lo added.</P>

Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan, in that order, said Chen Yi-an, who is the

      <P>"The journey could possibly  take longer than eight days, depending upon the
health of the trekkers," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Of the nine students, three will be jogging the whole way, while the others will
spend some time jogging, riding bicycles and motorcycles while documenting the
activity, taking care of liaison affairs and transporting luggage and supplies,

      <P>Japanese violinist Ryu Goto, who at the age of 21 is listed in the top echelon
of young performers in the world, will team up with Taiwanese pianist Hu Chih-
long for a concert slated for July 18 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Goto, who is a physics major at Harvard University, is the younger bother of
Midori Goto, a violinist considered a national treasure in Japan.</P>
      <P>This will be Goto's second performance in Taiwan, having toured Taiwan, Hong
Kong and China last year, according to Fan Man-nong, chairwoman of the
International New Aspect Cultural and Educational Foundation, which is
organizing the concert.</P>
      <P>He will perform pieces by Bach and Beethoven, Fan said.</P>
      <P>Describing him as a gifted and versatile young performer, Fan counted off
several of Goto's impressive achievements, including making his concert debut at
the age of seven in Japan.</P>
      <P>At the age of 13, he appeared in an unprecedented series of 10 sold-out recitals
at the Casals Hall in Tokyo. Since then, he has emerged as a soloist with a
number of international orchestras, including the Dallas and Washington national
symphonies in the United States, as well as the London Philharmonic Orchestra.</P>
      <P>His eponymous debut CD, released in 2005, was the best-selling classical album
in Japan for that year, Fan said, adding that his frequent appearances on TV
have made the New York-born violinist particularly well-known in Japan.</P>
      <P>Hu, 27, is a native of Taiwan who received a Master's Degree in Music from
Taipei National University of the Arts and has won prizes in many international
competitions, including the National Taipei Concert Hall Arising Stars and the
prestigious Chi-Mei Artist Award. He is currently on the faculty of East
Tennessee State University and has performed throughout Europe, Asia and the
United States.</P>

      <P>Love changes everything.</P>
      <P>When Rosel Be earned her bachelor's  degree from National Kaohsiung University
Saturday, the Philippines native understood fully what those three simple words
mean.</P>
      <P>Be's journey to love began in 1999, when she had to stop her life as a
university freshman to earn her own living because her family could no longer to
afford to pay for her studies.</P>
      <P>She managed to land a job at an electronics factory in Nantzih, in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, but sent the bulk of her meager salary back home to her
family every month, leaving her with very little for herself.</P>
      <P>Her dream of one day finishing her university studies became more and more
remote, giving way to thoughts about how she would earn enough money to improve
her family's livelihood when her three-year contract in Taiwan expired.</P>
      <P>However, Be met a Taiwanese engineer at her factory named Chu Yung-ren, who
encouraged her to pursue her dream and offered her sympathy when she plunged
into depression.</P>
      <P>The friendship developed into a relationship, so that when she was ready to pack
and leave Taiwan at the end of her contract, Chu popped the question and instead
of leaving, Be stayed on in Taiwan as Chu's wife.</P>
      <P>Driven by her desire to finish college, she enrolled in the Department of
Western Languages and Literature at National Kaohsiung University and immersed
herself in her studies.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, she graduated summa cum laude and was admitted to the Graduate
Institute of Foreign Languages and Literature at National Sun Yat-Sen
University, also in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Be, who still does not have a thorough command of mandarin Chinese, threw
herself into her husband's arms after receiving her diploma at the commencement
ceremony, saying that she owed her husband any glory she earned at the
university.</P>
      <P>Now she is looking forward to her graduate studies, with high hopes that she
will be able to land a teaching job after earning her master's degree.</P>

between the members of a man's family, how is it right for a man to ignore the
duties he owes to his sovereign and country?"</TEXT>

      <P>The first Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan for medical purposes checked into
four medical centers around the country Monday for physical examinations.</P>
      <P>Five of the 30 Chinese tourists in the group from Guangzhou received health
checks at Cathay General Hospital in Taipei City, while the others had physical
examinations done at Shin Kong Wu Ho Su Memorial Hospital in Taipei, Changhua
Christian Hospital in central Taiwan and Kaohsiung Medical University Chung Ho
Memorial Hospital in the south.</P>
      <P>The health checks were carried out with the use of high-tech diagnostic
procedures such as position emission tomography (PET) , magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) , which can detect cancers as
well as brain and heart problems.</P>
      <P>A thirty-year-old woman surnamed Cao said she joined the medical tourism group
with her husband, a professional athlete, because she had learned that health
care standards in Taiwan were higher than on the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>The reports have proved true, she said, adding that she was impressed with the
examinations.</P>
      <P>"The medical facilities  are cutting-edge  and the medical personnel are kind,"
she said.</P>
      <P>The tourists, who arrived in Taiwan Sunday, were the first group from China to
visit Taiwan for medical tourism since the government gave permission last July
for significantly larger numbers of Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They were also the first Chinese tourists since then to visit Taiwan for the
three-fold purpose of medical care, spa treatment, and sightseeing, according to
Zhang Yen, one of the visitors who owns an international trading company that
specializes in the export of jeans.</P>
      <P>Zhang and several others in the group booked into an upscale spa resort in
Taipei's Xinyi District within hours of their arrival in Taiwan Sunday.</P>
      <P>Zhang said she very much enjoyed the treatment at the resort, which she said
offered a completely different experience from those in Japan or Thailand.</P>
      <P>A woman surnamed Tan, who works in Guangzhou's financial service sector, said
Taiwan's spas are on a par with Japan's, and come at a lower price.</P>
      <P>"They're highly competitive, " she said."I would visit Taipei more frequently
for the joy of the spa treatments if there were more direct flights for
Guangzhou to Taipei," she said.</P>
      <P>The group's travel route was from Guangzhou to Hong Kong by highway bus and then
to Taiwan by plane, she noted.</P>
      <P>The visitors also toured the bustling Hsimending  business district in Taipei
City's western suburb Sunday afternoon, where they had rice noodles with duck,
cold pot-stewed duck tongues, and other local delicacies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New AIT compound will mirror U.S.-Taiwan relations: director</HEADLINE>

      <P>The building of a new office compound for the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
will reflect the continuum of broader relations between Taiwan and the United
States and will become a focal point of everything that is beneficial to
bilateral ties, AIT Taipei Office Director Stephen M. Young said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The new AIT building that will one day stand on this site will weave together
these various strands of our complex, productive, and friendly relationship,"
Young said at a dedication ceremony for the site of the new AIT compound.</P>
      <P>"I am proud to say that on this site we will be building a 21st century complex
that embodies America's 21st century relationship with Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Young, the proposal to build a new AIT compound was initiated more
than 10 years ago, but it has taken time for the project to finally get off the
ground.</P>
      <P>The de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan attributed the launch of the project to
the long-term partnership and cooperation between his office and the Taipei City
government, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
Council of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Administration and many
others.</P>
      <P>"I can leave here feeling that I've done my job," said Young, who is due to
vacate the post soon.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said at the ceremony that the fact that the
U.S. is the first country to build a de facto embassy compound in Taiwan, in the
absence of formal diplomatic relations, is of great symbolic importance and
turns a new page in bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>"We hope that U.S.-Taiwan relations will continue to develop on the existing
foundations into an even more solid one and that more high-level U.S. officials,
including members of Congress, will be able to visit Taiwan in the future," Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, secretary-general of the National Security Council, said that the U.S.
has been a most cordial and supportive friend of Taiwan's over the past 60 years
and that the construction of a new AIT office compound is a declaration that
bilateral relations remain steady on the solid foundation of "mutual trust."</P>
      <P>Noting that the building project is being implemented as a result of the hard
work of previous and incumbent administrations of Taiwan and the U.S., a former
top Taiwanese envoy to the U.S. Joseph Wu said that it symbolizes a more
permanent relationship between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The AIT said the US$170 million compound will include an office building of
approximately 14,000 square meters, a parking area and ancillary structures. All
of the AIT's Taipei offices, including the American Cultural Center, the
Commercial Section, the Chinese Language and Area Studies School, and the
Agricultural Trade Office, will be located for the first time at a single site,
it added.</P>
      <P>The 6.5 hectare site, which has been leased to the AIT for 99 years, is within
walking distance of the Neihu stop of Taipei's Neihu MRT line, which is
scheduled to begin operations July 4.</P>
      <P>In the preparatory stages of the project, a rear access road, which was started
in March, will be completed in six to nine months. The first phase of the
project will involve clearing and grading of the site, and the new office
building will be constructed in the second phase.</P>
      <P>Weston Solutions, Inc. of West Chester, Pennsylvania has been awarded the
US$54.4 million contract for phase one, while the contract for phase two has not
yet been awarded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government measures that have been in place for nearly a year to encourage
people to save power will be further expanded July 1, Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs John C.C. Deng announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Deng said at a news conference that household users who have achieved a drop in
power consumption for two consecutive years and a power-saving rate of more than
20 percent in the past two years will be entitled to greater discounts on their
power bills.</P>
      <P>The discounts will be expanded from the current range of between 5 percent and
20 percent to between 10 percent and 30 percent, Deng said.</P>
      <P>The ministry began the original measures last July, since which time the country
had as of May 31 saved 4.2 billion kWh in terms of power consumed, a volume that
surpassed the total one-year power consumption  of all  household  users  in
Kaohsiung,  Taiwan's second-largest city, according to the state-run Taiwan
Power Company (Taipower).</P>
      <P>During the period, Taipower saved NT$18.8 billion (US$570.7 million in fuel
costs and helped cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 2.66 million tons.</P>
      <P>The money the household users of electricity saved under the energy-saving
initiative measures reached NT$14.2 billion during the 10-month period, NT$5.9
billion of which was used to cover the discounts to the public, Taipower said.</P>
      <P>The company assessed that the expanded measures will help save 3.8 billion kWh
in the coming year and will help household users save a combined NT$12.8 billion
on their electricity bills, of which NT$8.3 billion will be used to cover the
discounts under the expanded program.</P>
      <P>It added that the company itself will save NT$12.4 billion in fuel costs and
will cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2.39 million tons.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: Ma's risky unilateralism</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susan Shirk said China is
reinforcing President Ma Ying-jeou's leadership in Taiwan by unveiling a series
of policies favorable to the island.</P>
      <P>It is no surprise that China would employ this trick, but Taiwan should guard
against becoming a political satellite of China. Taiwan should do this by
engaging not just with China, but also with other powers.</P>
      <P>China Times: How can a referendum be held on the proposed trade pact with China
when it only an outline?</P>
      <P>The trade pact with China proposed by Ma's administration is to be completed in
two phases, but the initial phrase, to be concluded by year end or early next
year, is nothing but a outline, which is like a list of the chapters of a book.</P>
      <P>What matters is the details of each chapter, which would take years to develop,
as the Ma administration has admitted.</P>
      <P>Since the proposed pact is devoid of any details in the initial phrase, how
could it be put to a referendum? Is the DPP's call for a referendum another
attempt to block any contact with China, and if it is, how is this different
from blind isolation of the country in the international community?</P>
      <P>United Daily News: DPP should press Beijing over proposed trade pact</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party should push Beijing into promising
to help Taiwan forge free trade pacts with other countries rather than try to
thwart the ruling KMT's plan to clinch trade agreements with China.</P>
      <P>With ten free trade partners under its belt, China is set to sign agreements
with another ten countries in the near future. The DPP is trying to blunt
Taiwan's competitive edge in the Chinese market against these countries by
opposing the planned trade pact between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>You have to open your market to your partners if you want to gain access to
theirs, and opening is the order of the day. The DPP cannot buck the trend by
fooling its supporters into believing that Taiwan would fare better without the
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: Plan for joint editing of dictionary by Taiwan and China is a
plot to transform Taiwanese into Chinese.</P>
      <P>President Ma's proposal for Taiwan and China to jointly edit a Chinese
dictionary is another indication, along with his calls for China and Taiwan to
adopt the same written Chinese characters, of his scheme to brainwash Taiwanese
into becoming Chinese.</P>
      <P>Written language has always been a tool for rulers, and this explains why Qin
Shi Huang wanted to adopt a single form of writing when he conquered other six
states in China, and why the Communist Party of China proclaimed as official the
use of simplified Chinese characters.</P>
      <P>Now, the Ma administration's efforts to introduce to Taiwanese the idea of using
simplified Chinese is a step toward reunification with China.</P>
      <P>Once Ma carries  out this  scheme,  his goal of Taiwan's reunification with
China will be achieved.</P>

      <P>The arrival of a 30-member medical tour group from China Sunday marks a
milestone in medical tourism development across the Taiwan Strait and is poised
to create a new business niche, a corporate source said Monday.</P>
      <P>The group from the Chinese city of Guangzhou for a six-day medical  tour is
expected  to open  an era for new business opportunities for Taiwan, although it
could also lead to cutthroat competition among relevant businesses in the
tourism, medical and insurance sectors, said Hung Zi-jen, vice president of the
Shin Kong Medical Club.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, thanks to the assistance of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council, the Guangzhou-based Zion Health Club, which is a subsidiary
of the Women's World Spa Resort Group -- a Taiwanese-financed company that has
at least 600,000 members around China -- reached an agreement in March with 13
medical centers and hospitals in Taiwan to organize medical tourism groups from
China for three-fold purpose of medical care, spa treatment and sightseeing.</P>
      <P>The first tour group members checked into four medical centers around the
country Monday for physical examinations.</P>
      <P>Five of the 30-strong group received health checks at Cathay General Hospital in
Taipei City, while the others had their physical examinations at Shin Kong Wu Ho
Su Memorial Hospital in Taipei, Changhua Christian Hospital in central Taiwan
and Kaohsiung Medical University Chung Ho Memorial Hospital in the south.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait charter flights set to be increased to regular daily flights,
later this year, Hung said he is confident that Taiwan is capable of
capitalizing on the golden opportunity offered by medical tourism, taking full
advantage of its many signature tourist attractions and high-quality medical
services.</P>

      <P>Two rabbit rescue organizations have urged the Taipei city government to adopt a
more active approach toward dealing with the problem of abandoned animals other
than cats and dogs.</P>
      <P>In response to the call, Yen I-feng, director of the Taipei Municipal Institute
for Animal Health, vowed to further cooperate with animal organizations to stop
people abandoning their pets.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks Monday following a campaign initiated a day earlier by the
Taipei Rabbit Society and a rabbit adoption Web site.</P>
      <P>At a function Sunday that was part of the campaign, a group of "bunny girls" --
volunteers from the two groups, along with Taipei City Councilor Wu Ssu-yao,
dressed up like Playboy bunnies -- promoted an "I love rabbits " campaign,
displaying abandoned pet rabbits that had been rescued from city streets.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that rabbits kept as pets carry and transmit fewer zoonotic diseases
than cats and dogs and noted that they require relatively smaller living space
than cats or dogs. She therefore asked the institute to extend the seven-day
limit for killing unwanted rabbits.</P>
      <P>Yen emphasized that animals should be treated equally without discrimination and
condemned owners who dump their pets. He also vowed to cooperate further with
animal protection groups to stop people abandoning animals.</P>

      <P>The daughter and son-in-law of former President Chen Shui-bian admitted Monday
that they gave false testimony over the past two years during investigations
into the ex-first family's alleged corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu and her husband, Chao Chien-ming, admitted in court that they gave
false testimony on various occasions to prosecutors and judges regarding the
case involving their mother, Wu Shu-jen, and her claims for reimbursements
totalling NT$14.8 million (US$451,219) from her husband's special state affairs
funds using invoices she took from other people, according to the Taipei
District Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors, however, declined to divulge the identity of the individual or
individuals Chao and Chen named as having instructed them to lie.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office decided
in mid-May to list the couple as defendants, as well as Chen's younger brother
Chen Chih-chung, after discovering that the three gave different accounts during
investigations into the false reimbursement case.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu was indicted June 3, making her the final member of the scandal-
embroiled ex-first family to be indicted on corruption and money laundering
charges.</P>
      <P>She was listed June 5 as a person whose movements in relation to attempted
overseas travel should be monitored by prosecutors, a step below an outright
travel ban.</P>
      <P>All 14 of the other people in the family, including former President Chen Shui-
bian, his wife Wu Shu-jen, their son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching, have been indicted since 2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Polaris Research Institute adjusted its economic forecast for
Taiwan Monday, predicting that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) will
shrink 4.6 percent in 2009, instead of 4.8 percent it had previously forecast.</P>
      <P>The economic outlook was the most pessimistic among the forecasts issued by
economic research institutes in Taiwan, including the government Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics which predicted in May a GDP
contraction of 4.25 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica predicted a drop of 3.46 percent, while the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research forecast a slight shrinkage of 0.11 percent.</P>
      <P>Polaris President Liang Kuo-yuan released the latest forecast at a press
conference,  saying that while "Taiwan's  economy  is improving, " it is doing
so on a small scale because there are still negative factors affecting its
recovery, such as a decrease in foreign orders.</P>
      <P>However, Liang forecast that the economy will record growth of 3.87 percent in
the fourth quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he raised the consumers' price index growth forecast to "-0.78
percent" for 2009 due to increases in the price of raw material on the
international market recently.</P>
      <P>The value of the New Taiwan dollar will average NT$33.4 against the greenback in
2009, Liang said.</P>
      <P>While the improved cross-Taiwan Strait ties will help attract foreign investment
to support the Taiwan dollar's exchange rate, a drastic appreciation is not
likely this year as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board may raise interest rate to
back the greenback, according to Liang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reaffirmed Monday that Taiwan's planned trade pact with
China is simply an economic matter and will not touch on the independence or the
unification issue or undermine Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China should ink an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
to avoid Taiwan's marginalization in East Asia, as a free trade agreement (FTA)
among China and the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) is set to take effect next January, " Ma said in a meeting with Yasuo
Hayashi, chairman of Japan's External Trade Organization, at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>"We feel it necessary to open the talks with China as quickly as possible, in
view of the China-ASEAN FTA, which will allow zero tariffs on exports from
either side and thus greatly hurt Taiwan's competitiveness," the president said.</P>
      <P>The results of recent surveys showed that some 60 percent of the Taiwan people
endorsed the government's efforts to clinch an ECFA with China, he noted.</P>
      <P>"The government will continue to give the people a clear explanation of the ECFA
in order to win even greater public support for it," Ma said in response to
questions from Hayashi.</P>
      <P>In framing  his questions,  Hayashi  citied the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) concerns over the possibility that the proposed pact
would compromise  Taiwan's  independent statehood.</P>
      <P>"It is critical that people understand the importance of the ECFA, as it will
lead to a normalization of cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic activity and
pave the way for similar negotiations with other countries," the president said.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan and China fail to put an ECFA in place, Taiwan's petrochemical, car
accessory, machinery and textile exports to China will be hit with custom duties
of 10 to 15 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>If these industries cannot survive in Taiwan and are forced to relocate to China
or the ASEAN states in search of lower costs, this would result in 100,000 job
losses in Taiwan, Ma said, citing estimates by economic research institutes.</P>
      <P>The government-related Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) works to
promote mutual trade and investment between Japan and the rest of the world.
Originally established in 1958 to promote Japanese exports abroad, JETRO's focus
has shifted toward promoting foreign direct investment in Japan and helping
small to medium size Japanese firms maximize their global export potential.</P>

belief that medical-related  businesses are least affected by economic
downturns.</P>
      <P>A large number of respondents - 43.96 percent - also said they would choose this
field because medical businesses have bright prospects, while 25.66 percent of
the people surveyed said they personally possess (medical-)related skills and

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate surged to 5.82 percent in May, the highest level
since the government began compiling jobless figures in 1978, according to
statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless people increased to 633,000 in May -- also a record high
since 1978, representing a growth of 8,000 jobless people from the previous
month, said Huang Chien-chung, the deputy chief of the DGBAS' fourth division.</P>
      <P>Huang attributed the increase in unemployment  to graduate students seeking jobs
after graduating recently.</P>
      <P>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for May stood at 5.84 percent, up 0.07
percentage points from the level in April. It marked the 14th consecutive month
that Taiwan's jobless rate has been rising, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The average jobless rate in the first five months of the year recorded was 5.69
percent, which also represented the highest level since 1978, the DGBAS
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang pointed out that the number of the employees in the industrial
and services sectors amounted to 6.28 million people at the end of April, posing
a decline of 15,000, or 0.24 percent, from the previous month.</P>
      <P>This also marked a drop in the number of jobs in these two sectors for the
eighth consecutive month since last September, Huang added.</P>
      <P>The industrial and service sectors were the hardest hit by the economic
downturn, which caused Taiwan's economy to contract by a record 10.24 percent in

      <P>Cultural exchanges between Taiwan and Israel is the perfect tool to not only
serve as a bridge between the people of both sides but also to promote Taiwan's
international profile, the top Israeli envoy to Taiwan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Raphael Gamzou,  representative of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei (ISECO) , made the remarks at a tea party for Nimroda Markin, a retired
Israeli psychotherapist who is visiting Taiwan to experience first-hand the
cultural treasures of the country after being stuck by performances in Israel by
U-Theatre, a renowned Taipei-based drumming group.</P>
      <P>"Good cultural events are sometimes more powerful and effective than the words
of a good diplomat," Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>"This is a perfect example of how Taiwan's image is improved through cultural
exchanges," he added.</P>
      <P>Markin, who had never visited Asia before, traveled thousands of miles to Taiwan
two weeks ago, where she was allowed to join the U-Theatre performers in
rehearsals and vipassana activities, having been starstruck by the troupe and
its act when it performed in Israel last year.</P>
      <P>U-Theatre was invited to tour Israel through efforts by the ISECO and by the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Tel Aviv, including a major opening
performance at the Israel Spring Festival last March.</P>
      <P>Describing the U-Theatre's performances as "magic on the stage" and the "sound
of life, " Markin said she was left "speechless and breathless" after seeing
them and decided immediately that she had to see with her own eyes the country
and people that nurtured such spiritual performances.</P>
      <P>"I kept asking myself what is it that moves me so deeply? It is the sense of
holiness of life," Markin said.</P>
      <P>"We Israelis might know how to respect the dead but we don't know how to respect
life enough," she added.</P>
      <P>Markin, who turned 70 in May, said that coming to Taiwan was a birthday present
to herself and that the unique country, as well as its extremely friendly
people, have owned her heart completely.</P>
      <P>She has found Taiwan to be not only a combination of simplicity and
sophistication but also a modern place with a touch of the West, so good that
even the sound of the language is pleasant.</P>
      <P>"I feel I am being treated as a guest rather than as a tourist or foreigner, "
according to Markin, who added that the smiles and sincerity of the Taiwanese
people and the discoveries of her stay in Taiwan are the best souvenirs for her
family in Israel.</P>
      <P>Scheduled to return to Israel in three days, Markin also said she had decided to
learn Chinese and that she can't wait to come back to Taiwan in the near future.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's tourist market has good potential and the number of Taiwanese travelers
visiting Alaska is growing steadily despite the economic downturn, said the
trade representative of the Taipei-based State of Alaska Office Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors from Taiwan to Alaska is pretty steady, some growth but
very steady, given that there is some decline in other markets, Erick Kish told
the Central News Agency at a news conference to launch Japan Airlines (JALs)
summer aurora viewing tours to Fairbanks, Alaska.</P>
      <P>An average of 5,000 people travel from Taiwan to Alaska annually. While most of
them join cruises, a growing number of travelers are taking advantage of China
Airlines' direct flights to Anchorage, according to Kish.</P>
      <P>With the launch of the JAL aurora tours,  Kish expressed confidence that more
Taiwanese people will choose to visit Alaska.</P>
      <P>Hiroshi Yamato, JAL Taiwan director of passenger sales, said on the same
occasion that last December Taiwan became the first country to which JAL
extended its charter service to Fairbanks. That service received great response
from Taiwanese customers, he said.</P>
      <P>This summer, JAL will offer five charter flights, leaving on Aug. 17, 22, 27 and
Sept. 1, 7 from Taipei to Fairbanks via Tokyo, and more seats will be given to
Taiwanese tourists if the demand continues to grow, Yamato added.</P>
      <P>According to the State of Alaska Office, August and September are the best times
to visit Alaska because the weather is pleasantly cool then and there are many
clear nights, which are perfect for viewing aurora borealis, or northern polar
lights.</P>
      <P>In addition, visitors to Alaska at that time can choose from a wider variety of
activities than if they were to visit in the winter. These include wildlife
viewing, glacier cruise tours, airplane and helicopter tours, river rafting and
biking, the Office said.</P>
      <P>The  State  of Alaska  Office  in Taiwan  is an official representative office
of the Alaska state government that promotes tourism, trade, investment and
educational exchanges between the two sides.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's filmmaking industry should join hands with its Chinese counterpart to
explore the global market, T. C. Guo, chairman of the Taipei-based Central
Motion Pictures Corp. (CMPC), said Monday.</P>
      <P>Although cooperation in this regard between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
has been halted over the past decades due to political factors, Guo said
cooperating with Chinese filmmakers will be an unavoidable trend for the local
industry, especially if it wants to go international.</P>
      <P>Although Guo said the popular Taiwan blockbuster "Cape No. 7" -- a locally
produced movie shot in Kenting, a beach resort in southern Taiwan's Pingtung
County -- seemed to help inject a new lease on life in Taiwan's filmmaking
industry, Taiwan's filmmakers, including the CMPC, should collaborate with the
Chinese side to explore new horizons.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's talent pool and China's huge and fast-growing market are complementary
and can give a boost to Taiwan's filmmaking industry, "he suggested.</P>
      <P>The CMPC has also began contacting Chinese filmmakers in its initial efforts to
move toward that goal, Guo told a news conference prior to a ceremony held at
the Government Information Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>In the ceremony presided over by GIO Minister Su Jun-pin, Guo, on behalf of the
CMPC, was to hand over a total of 947 old documentaries and movies to the GIO's
Chinese Taipei Film Archive for conservation.</P>
      <P>The old movies and documentaries were produced by the CMPC over the past 55
years.</P>
      <P>In line with the government  policy  designating  cultural innovation as one of
Taiwan's six promising industries, Guo said he plans to make the CMPC's Culture
City in the city's outskirts into a cultural innovation park.</P>
      <P>Many CMPC pictures were shoot in its Culture City in the Shilin district when
the company enjoyed a booming business during the 1960s-1970s.</P>
      <P>Guo said it is his mission to push the CMPC to assume a bigger role in Taiwan's
filmmaking history despite the fact that it used to be an enterprise run by the
Kuomintang (KMT) and is saddled with historical burden.</P>
      <P>Guo, a prominent businessman, is the chairman of Foxlink -- a leading developer
and manufacturer of communication devices, computers and consumer electronics.
He took over the CMPC's helm after acquiring a 42 percent stake of the
filmmaking company from the KMT-owned Central Investment Corp. in 2007.</P>

while the Tseng Wen Reservoir, which straddles Chiayi and Tainan counties,
received about 16 million cubic meters of rainwater, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The northern part of Taiwan was not so lucky, Wu said, as precipitation in the
region fell far short of expectations. The water storage rate of Shihmen
Reservoir, located in between Taoyuan and Hsinchu counties, only increased to
44.84 percent.</P>
      <P>"Drought conditions still exist," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Council of Agriculture said
Monday that vegetable supplies around the island were normal and appeared not to
have been affected by the tropical storm.</P>
      <P>That means post-storm vegetable prices should remain stable, the agency said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to ask that oil used in fast food chains be monitored</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will ask local health bureaus to monitor the
frying oil used in fast food outlets after spot checks found that some big name
chains did not change the oil on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Liu Fang-ming, a DOH food safety official, said Monday that Taipei County
consumer protection officials found in spot inspections of fast found
restaurants such as McDonald's, KFC, Napoli Pizza, and Domino's Pizza on Sunday
that one only changed the oil twice a week or partially.</P>
      <P>The officials worried that the continued use of frying oil at high temperatures
would result in the release of carcinogenic substances, thus posing a health
hazard to consumers.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the DOH will ask local health officials to "include the checking
of frying oil as one of the priorities in monitoring food safety."</P>
      <P>But he also acknowledged that the DOH could only ask officials to use their own
eyes to "check the condition of the oil" and that it did not have the authority
to regulate restaurants on how often they should use fresh oil.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that restaurants' procedures on oil vary due to the method of cooking
and the frequency of its use.</P>
      <P>At present, no law exists stipulating how often virgin oil should be used.
Officials can only determine if the texture of the oil has become unhealthy by
viewing its color, foam formation and turbidity.</P>
      <P>Health authorities can, however, slap a fine between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000 on
food operators if they notice the cooking oil has turned and failed to improve.</P>
      <P>After Sunday's raids, Liu said he believed fast food restaurants will "more
diligently change their frying oil, and that officials will probably not find
anything for the time being."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that fast food operators presently filter the used oil and mix it
with new oil for reuse.</P>
      <P>"The DOH will continue to communicate with the food vendors to work out a
solution to the problem," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma set to depart June 29 for another diplomatic tour</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is set to depart next Monday on another diplomatic tour
that will take him to three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America --
Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras, an official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of President Ma's upcoming Central America tour is to attend
the inauguration of Panama's president-elect, Ricardo Martinelli, in Panama City
July 1, " said Javier Hou, vice minister of foreign affairs, at a Presidential
Office news conference.</P>
      <P>It will be Ma's second trip to the region this year. He concluded a three-leg
Central America tour June 4, during which he attended El Salvador President
Mauricio Funes's inaugural ceremony and visited two neighboring allies -- Belize
and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending Martinelli's inauguration, Ma will hold talks with
senior officials of the new Panamanian government, tour the Panama Canal, give
interviews to international news media and meet with Taiwanese community leaders
during his stay in Panama, Hou said.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching will accompany Ma on the June 29-July 7 diplomatic
tour as she did on the president's last trip, Hou said, adding that Chow will
visit a charity organization led by the new Panamanian first lady.</P>
      <P>Following his trip to Panama, Ma will travel to Nicaragua where Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega will drive Ma to the hub of a bilateral technological
cooperation project, which will allow Ma to have direct contact with Nicaraguan
citizens.</P>
      <P>Ma will also attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a large-scale trade fair to be
held in Nicaragua July 1-5, in which many Taiwanese companies will exhibit their
latest products, Hou said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that Ma's cancellation of a planned meeting with Ortega in San
Salvador early this month had not had any impact on relations between Taipei and
Managua.</P>
      <P>During the Nicaragua visit, first lady Chow will visit the local branch of the
World Vision -- a Christian chairty dedicated to help disadvantaged people
around the world -- and a disabled children's development center.</P>
      <P>On the third and last leg of his tour, Ma will visit Honduras, where he will
deliver a speech at the Honduran parliament and visit the site of a Taiwan-
Honduras cooperative project.</P>
      <P>Ma will make a transit stop in San Francisco en route to Panama and will stop in
Hawaii on his way home.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with the United States, Ma
has consistently kept a low profile and refrained from leaving the hotels where
he was staying during his previous layovers.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Ma is likely to walk out of his hotel during his forthcoming
visit in Hawaii and may even hold a seminar with think tank scholars there.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, would not confirm the reports,
however, saying instead that Ma's main principle is to "make things simple."</P>
      <P>"Making a transit stop is our top goal and it remains uncertain whether there
will be any activities outside the hotel," Wang added.</P>
      <P>Accompanying Ma will be a 129-member delegation, composed of government
officials, legislators, industry exeuctives, academics, university presidents,
local government chiefs,  charity group executives and performing artists.</P>
      <P>Some 40 local journalists will be on hand to cover Ma's third diplomatic journey
since he assumed office in May 2008, Hou added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lu swept aside by Federer at Wimbledon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Having won a total of one match since early May, Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun figured to
be an unlikely candidate to upset world No. 2 Roger Federer in the opening match
on center court of this year's Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>But the world No. 65 never held back during the 105-minute match, playing
aggressively and trying to put pressure on Federer whenever he could before
falling in 105 minutes, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2.</P>
      <P>"He was tough and he hit some really good shots," Federer said of his game
opponent.</P>
      <P>"I knew the danger today. He's beaten good players in the past... That was a
tough first set. He actually remained tough throughout the match, which was good
to see, in a way."</P>
      <P>Lu, playing at Wimbledon for the sixth time, had been sidetracked by a viral
infection since winning a Challenger event in Israel the second week of May.</P>
      <P>His grass court preparation consisted of two defeats and a victory over a
British player ranked No. 493 in the world, not exactly an inspiring track
record one would hope for ahead of a match against Federer on perhaps his
favorite court in the world.</P>
      <P>Lu showed some toughness early, saving four break points in the second game of
the match and actually taking a 3-2 lead in the first set when he broke
Federer's serve.</P>
      <P>But Federer immediately returned the favor, and the two players stayed on serve
until the final game of the set.</P>
      <P>Lu had a chance to set up game point with a relatively simple drop volley, but
could not push it over the net, and then he netted a backhand to give Federer
the first set, 7-5.</P>
      <P>Whatever tension may have existed seemed to evaporate after that game, and early
Federer breaks in the second and third sets only added to the seeming
inevitability of a victory for the Swiss.</P>
      <P>As the match wore on, Federer's superior shot-making skills and serve became
more assertive, and his almost effortless footwork often left him in control of
the points, sending Lu chasing balls around the court or forcing him to rush to
keep up with rapidly returned shots.</P>
      <P>The world No. 2, gunning for an all-time best 15th grand slam title at
Wimbledon, only lost 10 points on serve in the final two sets, giving Lu little
chance to reassert himself.</P>
      <P>Despite the straight set defeat, Lu played at a relatively high level, making
only 11 unforced errors (to Federer's 10) , including only four in the first two
sets, and he got nearly 70 percent of his first serves in, an unusually high
percentage for the 25-year-old.</P>
      <P>With the defeat of Lu, whose best showings at Wimbledon came in 2004 and 2005
when he reached the second round, Taiwan had one player left in a main singles
draw at this year's Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>Out of action for a good part of 2009 recovering from injury, Chan Yung-jan was
to play 12th-seed Marion Bartoli of France later Monday in a first round women's
singles match.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More medical tourism groups from China to come</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several medical tour groups from China will come to Taiwan in the latter part of
the year, the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Secretary-General Walter Yeh said more groups were likely to come
a day after the first 30-member medical tour group arrived from China for a six-
day visit.</P>
      <P>The first tour group members checked into four medical centers around the
country Monday for physical examinations.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the assistance of the TAITRA, the Guangzhou-based Zion Health Club
reached an agreement in March with 13 medical centers and hospitals in Taiwan to
organize medical tourism groups from China for the three-fold  purpose  of
medical care,  spa treatment  and sightseeing.</P>
      <P>Zion Health Club is a subsidiary of the Women's World Spa Resort Group -- a
Taiwanese-financed company that has at least 600,000 members around China.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that since last June to mid-June this year, the TAITRA has assisted 698
Chinese people to come to Taiwan for medical treatment and among them, 228 were
for physical check-ups.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai, chairperson of Guangzhou's Women's World, said that after the first
group, the next group of 50 members is scheduled to arrive in late August.</P>
      <P>"There will be five or six such groups to arrive by next Chinese New Year," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>TAITRA officials said Taiwan's advanced medical facilities and high standard of
medical professionals have attracted the medical tour groups.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that one such group from the West Coast of the United States and
two such groups from the East Coast, as well as several Chinese groups will
arrive in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>With Chinese tourists  coming from relatively  high income brackets, if each of
them spend NT$200,000 in Taiwan, coupled with the group fee of NT$60,000 and the
full physical fee of NT$20,000, then the first Chinese medical tour group could
inject NT$8.4 million into the local economy, TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the amount was not too high initially, it would
definitely grow given the marked improvement in relations between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>The TAITRA is scheduled to organize a group to visit northeastern China's Dalian
and Qingdao this October to promote Taiwan's medical tourism.</P>

      <P>The arrival of a 30-member medical tour group from China Sunday marks a
milestone in medical tourism development across the Taiwan Strait and is poised
to create a new business niche, a corporate source said Monday.</P>
      <P>The group from the Chinese city of Guangzhou for a six-day medical  tour is
expected  to open  an era for new business opportunities for Taiwan, although it
could also lead to cutthroat competition among relevant businesses in the
tourism, medical and insurance sectors, said Hung Zi-jen, vice president of the
Shin Kong Medical Club.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, thanks to the assistance of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council, the Guangzhou-based Zion Health Club, which is a subsidiary
of the Women's World Spa Resort Group -- a Taiwanese-financed company that has
at least 600,000 members around China -- reached an agreement in March with 13
medical centers and hospitals in Taiwan to organize medical tourism groups from
China for three-fold purpose of medical care, spa treatment and sightseeing.</P>
      <P>The first tour group members checked into four medical centers around the
country Monday for physical examinations.</P>
      <P>Five of the 30-strong group received health checks at Cathay General Hospital in
Taipei City, while the others had their physical examinations at Shin Kong Wu Ho
Su Memorial Hospital in Taipei, Changhua Christian Hospital in central Taiwan
and Kaohsiung Medical University Chung Ho Memorial Hospital in the south.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait charter flights set to be increased to regular daily flights,
later this year, Hung said he is confident that Taiwan is capable of
capitalizing on the golden opportunity offered by medical tourism, taking full
advantage of its many signature tourist attractions and high-quality medical
services.</P>

      <P>Two rabbit rescue organizations have urged the Taipei city government to adopt a
more active approach toward dealing with the problem of abandoned animals other
than cats and dogs.</P>
      <P>In response to the call, Yen I-feng, director of the Taipei Municipal Institute
for Animal Health, vowed to further cooperate with animal organizations to stop
people abandoning their pets.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks Monday following a campaign initiated a day earlier by the
Taipei Rabbit Society and a rabbit adoption Web site.</P>
      <P>At a function Sunday that was part of the campaign, a group of "bunny girls" --
volunteers from the two groups, along with Taipei City Councilor Wu Ssu-yao,
dressed up like Playboy bunnies -- promoted an "I love rabbits " campaign,
displaying abandoned pet rabbits that had been rescued from city streets.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that rabbits kept as pets carry and transmit fewer zoonotic diseases
than cats and dogs and noted that they require relatively smaller living space
than cats or dogs. She therefore asked the institute to extend the seven-day
limit for killing unwanted rabbits.</P>
      <P>Yen emphasized that animals should be treated equally without discrimination and
condemned owners who dump their pets. He also vowed to cooperate further with
animal protection groups to stop people abandoning animals.</P>

      <P>The daughter and son-in-law of former President Chen Shui-bian admitted Monday
that they gave false testimony over the past two years during investigations
into the ex-first family's alleged corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu and her husband, Chao Chien-ming, admitted in court that they gave
false testimony on various occasions to prosecutors and judges regarding the
case involving their mother, Wu Shu-jen, and her claims for reimbursements
totalling NT$14.8 million (US$451,219) from her husband's special state affairs
funds using invoices she took from other people, according to the Taipei
District Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors, however, declined to divulge the identity of the individual or
individuals Chao and Chen named as having instructed them to lie.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office decided
in mid-May to list the couple as defendants, as well as Chen's younger brother
Chen Chih-chung, after discovering that the three gave different accounts during
investigations into the false reimbursement case.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu was indicted June 3, making her the final member of the scandal-
embroiled ex-first family to be indicted on corruption and money laundering
charges.</P>
      <P>She was listed June 5 as a person whose movements in relation to attempted
overseas travel should be monitored by prosecutors, a step below an outright
travel ban.</P>
      <P>All 14 of the other people in the family, including former President Chen Shui-
bian, his wife Wu Shu-jen, their son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching, have been indicted since 2006.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Polaris Research Institute adjusted its economic forecast for
Taiwan Monday, predicting that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) will
shrink 4.6 percent in 2009, instead of 4.8 percent it had previously forecast.</P>
      <P>The economic outlook was the most pessimistic among the forecasts issued by
economic research institutes in Taiwan, including the government Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics which predicted in May a GDP
contraction of 4.25 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica predicted a drop of 3.46 percent, while the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research forecast a slight shrinkage of 0.11 percent.</P>
      <P>Polaris President Liang Kuo-yuan released the latest forecast at a press
conference,  saying that while "Taiwan's  economy  is improving, " it is doing
so on a small scale because there are still negative factors affecting its
recovery, such as a decrease in foreign orders.</P>
      <P>However, Liang forecast that the economy will record growth of 3.87 percent in
the fourth quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he raised the consumers' price index growth forecast to "-0.78
percent" for 2009 due to increases in the price of raw material on the
international market recently.</P>
      <P>The value of the New Taiwan dollar will average NT$33.4 against the greenback in
2009, Liang said.</P>
      <P>While the improved cross-Taiwan Strait ties will help attract foreign investment
to support the Taiwan dollar's exchange rate, a drastic appreciation is not
likely this year as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board may raise interest rate to
back the greenback, according to Liang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reaffirmed Monday that Taiwan's planned trade pact with
China is simply an economic matter and will not touch on the independence or the
unification issue or undermine Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China should ink an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
to avoid Taiwan's marginalization in East Asia, as a free trade agreement (FTA)
among China and the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) is set to take effect next January, " Ma said in a meeting with Yasuo
Hayashi, chairman of Japan's External Trade Organization, at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>"We feel it necessary to open the talks with China as quickly as possible, in
view of the China-ASEAN FTA, which will allow zero tariffs on exports from
either side and thus greatly hurt Taiwan's competitiveness," the president said.</P>
      <P>The results of recent surveys showed that some 60 percent of the Taiwan people
endorsed the government's efforts to clinch an ECFA with China, he noted.</P>
      <P>"The government will continue to give the people a clear explanation of the ECFA
in order to win even greater public support for it," Ma said in response to
questions from Hayashi.</P>
      <P>In framing  his questions,  Hayashi  citied the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) concerns over the possibility that the proposed pact
would compromise  Taiwan's  independent statehood.</P>
      <P>"It is critical that people understand the importance of the ECFA, as it will
lead to a normalization of cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic activity and
pave the way for similar negotiations with other countries," the president said.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan and China fail to put an ECFA in place, Taiwan's petrochemical, car
accessory, machinery and textile exports to China will be hit with custom duties
of 10 to 15 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>If these industries cannot survive in Taiwan and are forced to relocate to China
or the ASEAN states in search of lower costs, this would result in 100,000 job
losses in Taiwan, Ma said, citing estimates by economic research institutes.</P>
      <P>The government-related Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) works to
promote mutual trade and investment between Japan and the rest of the world.
Originally established in 1958 to promote Japanese exports abroad, JETRO's focus
has shifted toward promoting foreign direct investment in Japan and helping
small to medium size Japanese firms maximize their global export potential.</P>

      <P>When asked why, 44.91 percent of the respondents cited as the top reason their
belief that medical-related  businesses are least affected by economic
downturns.</P>
      <P>A large number of respondents - 43.96 percent - also said they would choose this
field because medical businesses have bright prospects, while 25.66 percent of
the people surveyed said they personally possess (medical-)related skills and
knowledge.</P>
      <P>Some 36.6 percent of the respondents said they would work in hospitals and
general medical institutions; while 31.89 percent said they  prefer

      <P>Taiwan's share prices rose back above the 6,300 mark Monday to finish higher for
the second consecutive trading day, with the weighted index, the market's key
barometer, rising 110.06 points, or 1.76 percent, to close at 6,341.21.</P>
      <P>Following losses on Wall Street the previous Friday, the local bourse opened at
6,256.38 and dropped to 6,193.09 at one point before rising to the day's high of
6348.74.</P>
      <P>A total of 3.51 billion shares changed hands on turnover of NT$95.55 billion
(US$2.90 billion) , an increase of NT$12.58 billion over the previous session.</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories gained ground, with textile issues moving up
the most at 4.5 percent. Construction stocks rose 3 percent, paper and pulp
issues gained 2.7 percent, machinery and electronics shares were up 2.5 percent,
foodstuff issues rose 0.9 percent, cement shares advanced 0.7 percent, banking
and financial shares advanced 0.4 percent, and plastics and chemicals shares

      <P>Foreign institutional investors were net buyers of NT$3.13 billion in shares.</P>
      <P>The market was buoyed by a strong showing among flat panel display makers due to
soaring demand for television products, with HannStar Display Corp. and Innolux
Display Corp. both rising by the maximum daily limit of 7 percent.</P>
      <P>An investment analyst at Dah Chang Securities Co. said that as the Taiwan Stock
Exchange rose above the five-day moving average but was still below the 10-day
moving average of 6,353, the market would probably not drop below the
6,350-point level.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate surged to 5.82 percent in May, the highest level
since the government began compiling jobless figures in 1978, according to
statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless people increased to 633,000 in May -- also a record high
since 1978, representing a growth of 8,000 jobless people from the previous
month, said Huang Chien-chung, the deputy chief of the DGBAS' fourth division.</P>
      <P>Huang attributed the increase in unemployment  to graduate students seeking jobs
after graduating recently.</P>
      <P>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for May stood at 5.84 percent, up 0.07
percentage points from the level in April. It marked the 14th consecutive month
that Taiwan's jobless rate has been rising, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The average jobless rate in the first five months of the year recorded was 5.69
percent, which also represented the highest level since 1978, the DGBAS
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang pointed out that the number of the employees in the industrial
and services sectors amounted to 6.28 million people at the end of April, posing
a decline of 15,000, or 0.24 percent, from the previous month.</P>
      <P>This also marked a drop in the number of jobs in these two sectors for the
eighth consecutive month since last September, Huang added.</P>
      <P>The industrial and service sectors were the hardest hit by the economic
downturn, which caused Taiwan's economy to contract by a record 10.24 percent in
the first quarter and exports to plunge by as much as 30 percent in recent
months.</P>

      <P>Cultural exchanges between Taiwan and Israel is the perfect tool to not only
serve as a bridge between the people of both sides but also to promote Taiwan's
international profile, the top Israeli envoy to Taiwan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Raphael Gamzou,  representative of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei (ISECO) , made the remarks at a tea party for Nimroda Markin, a retired
Israeli psychotherapist who is visiting Taiwan to experience first-hand the
cultural treasures of the country after being stuck by performances in Israel by
U-Theatre, a renowned Taipei-based drumming group.</P>
      <P>"Good cultural events are sometimes more powerful and effective than the words
of a good diplomat," Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>"This is a perfect example of how Taiwan's image is improved through cultural
exchanges," he added.</P>
      <P>Markin, who had never visited Asia before, traveled thousands of miles to Taiwan
two weeks ago, where she was allowed to join the U-Theatre performers in
rehearsals and vipassana activities, having been starstruck by the troupe and
its act when it performed in Israel last year.</P>
      <P>U-Theatre was invited to tour Israel through efforts by the ISECO and by the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Tel Aviv, including a major opening
performance at the Israel Spring Festival last March.</P>
      <P>Describing the U-Theatre's performances as "magic on the stage" and the "sound
of life, " Markin said she was left "speechless and breathless" after seeing
them and decided immediately that she had to see with her own eyes the country
and people that nurtured such spiritual performances.</P>
      <P>"I kept asking myself what is it that moves me so deeply? It is the sense of
holiness of life," Markin said.</P>
      <P>"We Israelis might know how to respect the dead but we don't know how to respect
life enough," she added.</P>
      <P>Markin, who turned 70 in May, said that coming to Taiwan was a birthday present
to herself and that the unique country, as well as its extremely friendly
people, have owned her heart completely.</P>
      <P>She has found Taiwan to be not only a combination of simplicity and
sophistication but also a modern place with a touch of the West, so good that
even the sound of the language is pleasant.</P>
      <P>"I feel I am being treated as a guest rather than as a tourist or foreigner, "
according to Markin, who added that the smiles and sincerity of the Taiwanese
people and the discoveries of her stay in Taiwan are the best souvenirs for her
family in Israel.</P>
      <P>Scheduled to return to Israel in three days, Markin also said she had decided to
learn Chinese and that she can't wait to come back to Taiwan in the near future.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's tourist market has good potential and the number of Taiwanese travelers
visiting Alaska is growing steadily despite the economic downturn, said the
trade representative of the Taipei-based State of Alaska Office Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors from Taiwan to Alaska is pretty steady, some growth but
very steady, given that there is some decline in other markets, Erick Kish told
the Central News Agency at a news conference to launch Japan Airlines (JALs)
summer aurora viewing tours to Fairbanks, Alaska.</P>
      <P>An average of 5,000 people travel from Taiwan to Alaska annually. While most of
them join cruises, a growing number of travelers are taking advantage of China
Airlines' direct flights to Anchorage, according to Kish.</P>
      <P>With the launch of the JAL aurora tours,  Kish expressed confidence that more
Taiwanese people will choose to visit Alaska.</P>
      <P>Hiroshi Yamato, JAL Taiwan director of passenger sales, said on the same
occasion that last December Taiwan became the first country to which JAL
extended its charter service to Fairbanks. That service received great response
from Taiwanese customers, he said.</P>
      <P>This summer, JAL will offer five charter flights, leaving on Aug. 17, 22, 27 and
Sept. 1, 7 from Taipei to Fairbanks via Tokyo, and more seats will be given to
Taiwanese tourists if the demand continues to grow, Yamato added.</P>
      <P>According to the State of Alaska Office, August and September are the best times
to visit Alaska because the weather is pleasantly cool then and there are many
clear nights, which are perfect for viewing aurora borealis, or northern polar
lights.</P>
      <P>In addition, visitors to Alaska at that time can choose from a wider variety of
activities than if they were to visit in the winter. These include wildlife
viewing, glacier cruise tours, airplane and helicopter tours, river rafting and
biking, the Office said.</P>
      <P>The  State  of Alaska  Office  in Taiwan  is an official representative office
of the Alaska state government that promotes tourism, trade, investment and
educational exchanges between the two sides.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's filmmaking industry should join hands with its Chinese counterpart to
explore the global market, T. C. Guo, chairman of the Taipei-based Central
Motion Pictures Corp. (CMPC), said Monday.</P>
      <P>Although cooperation in this regard between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
has been halted over the past decades due to political factors, Guo said
cooperating with Chinese filmmakers will be an unavoidable trend for the local
industry, especially if it wants to go international.</P>
      <P>Although Guo said the popular Taiwan blockbuster "Cape No. 7" -- a locally
produced movie shot in Kenting, a beach resort in southern Taiwan's Pingtung
County -- seemed to help inject a new lease on life in Taiwan's filmmaking
industry, Taiwan's filmmakers, including the CMPC, should collaborate with the
Chinese side to explore new horizons.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's talent pool and China's huge and fast-growing market are complementary
and can give a boost to Taiwan's filmmaking industry, "he suggested.</P>
      <P>The CMPC has also began contacting Chinese filmmakers in its initial efforts to
move toward that goal, Guo told a news conference prior to a ceremony held at
the Government Information Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>In the ceremony presided over by GIO Minister Su Jun-pin, Guo, on behalf of the
CMPC, was to hand over a total of 947 old documentaries and movies to the GIO's
Chinese Taipei Film Archive for conservation.</P>
      <P>The old movies and documentaries were produced by the CMPC over the past 55
years.</P>
      <P>In line with the government  policy  designating  cultural innovation as one of
Taiwan's six promising industries, Guo said he plans to make the CMPC's Culture
City in the city's outskirts into a cultural innovation park.</P>
      <P>Many CMPC pictures were shoot in its Culture City in the Shilin district when
the company enjoyed a booming business during the 1960s-1970s.</P>
      <P>Guo said it is his mission to push the CMPC to assume a bigger role in Taiwan's
filmmaking history despite the fact that it used to be an enterprise run by the
Kuomintang (KMT) and is saddled with historical burden.</P>
      <P>Guo, a prominent businessman, is the chairman of Foxlink -- a leading developer
and manufacturer of communication devices, computers and consumer electronics.
He took over the CMPC's helm after acquiring a 42 percent stake of the
filmmaking company from the KMT-owned Central Investment Corp. in 2007.</P>

      <P>Tropical storm Linfa spread rainfall throughout Taiwan while sweeping up the
Taiwan Strait over the weekend, but it apparently failed to alleviate drought
conditions in the northern part of the island.</P>
      <P>Water Resources Agency Deputy Director Wu Yueh-hsi said the storm -- the first
tropical storm to hit Taiwan this year -- significantly boosted central and
southern Taiwan's water supply to ease the potential of a looming drought there.</P>
      <P>Two reservoirs in the southern county of Tainan -- the Wushantou and Nan Hua --
accumulated a combined 30 million cubic meters of rainwater from the storm,
while the Tseng Wen Reservoir, which straddles Chiayi and Tainan counties,
received about 16 million cubic meters of rainwater, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The northern part of Taiwan was not so lucky, Wu said, as precipitation in the
region fell far short of expectations. The water storage rate of Shihmen
Reservoir, located in between Taoyuan and Hsinchu counties, only increased to
44.84 percent.</P>
      <P>"Drought conditions still exist," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Council of Agriculture said
Monday that vegetable supplies around the island were normal and appeared not to
have been affected by the tropical storm.</P>
      <P>That means post-storm vegetable prices should remain stable, the agency said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to ask that oil used in fast food chains be monitored</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will ask local health bureaus to monitor the
frying oil used in fast food outlets after spot checks found that some big name
chains did not change the oil on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Liu Fang-ming, a DOH food safety official, said Monday that Taipei County
consumer protection officials found in spot inspections of fast found
restaurants such as McDonald's, KFC, Napoli Pizza, and Domino's Pizza on Sunday
that one only changed the oil twice a week or partially.</P>
      <P>The officials worried that the continued use of frying oil at high temperatures
would result in the release of carcinogenic substances, thus posing a health
hazard to consumers.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the DOH will ask local health officials to "include the checking
of frying oil as one of the priorities in monitoring food safety."</P>
      <P>But he also acknowledged that the DOH could only ask officials to use their own
eyes to "check the condition of the oil" and that it did not have the authority
to regulate restaurants on how often they should use fresh oil.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that restaurants' procedures on oil vary due to the method of cooking
and the frequency of its use.</P>
      <P>At present, no law exists stipulating how often virgin oil should be used.
Officials can only determine if the texture of the oil has become unhealthy by
viewing its color, foam formation and turbidity.</P>
      <P>Health authorities can, however, slap a fine between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000 on
food operators if they notice the cooking oil has turned and failed to improve.</P>
      <P>After Sunday's raids, Liu said he believed fast food restaurants will "more
diligently change their frying oil, and that officials will probably not find
anything for the time being."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that fast food operators presently filter the used oil and mix it
with new oil for reuse.</P>
      <P>"The DOH will continue to communicate with the food vendors to work out a
solution to the problem," he said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is set to depart next Monday on another diplomatic tour
that will take him to three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America --
Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras, an official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of President Ma's upcoming Central America tour is to attend
the inauguration of Panama's president-elect, Ricardo Martinelli, in Panama City
July 1, " said Javier Hou, vice minister of foreign affairs, at a Presidential
Office news conference.</P>
      <P>It will be Ma's second trip to the region this year. He concluded a three-leg
Central America tour June 4, during which he attended El Salvador President
Mauricio Funes's inaugural ceremony and visited two neighboring allies -- Belize
and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending Martinelli's inauguration, Ma will hold talks with
senior officials of the new Panamanian government, tour the Panama Canal, give
interviews to international news media and meet with Taiwanese community leaders
during his stay in Panama, Hou said.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching will accompany Ma on the June 29-July 7 diplomatic
tour as she did on the president's last trip, Hou said, adding that Chow will
visit a charity organization led by the new Panamanian first lady.</P>
      <P>Following his trip to Panama, Ma will travel to Nicaragua where Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega will drive Ma to the hub of a bilateral technological
cooperation project, which will allow Ma to have direct contact with Nicaraguan
citizens.</P>
      <P>Ma will also attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a large-scale trade fair to be
held in Nicaragua July 1-5, in which many Taiwanese companies will exhibit their
latest products, Hou said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that Ma's cancellation of a planned meeting with Ortega in San
Salvador early this month had not had any impact on relations between Taipei and
Managua.</P>
      <P>During the Nicaragua visit, first lady Chow will visit the local branch of the
World Vision -- a Christian chairty dedicated to help disadvantaged people
around the world -- and a disabled children's development center.</P>
      <P>On the third and last leg of his tour, Ma will visit Honduras, where he will
deliver a speech at the Honduran parliament and visit the site of a Taiwan-
Honduras cooperative project.</P>
      <P>Ma will make a transit stop in San Francisco en route to Panama and will stop in
Hawaii on his way home.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with the United States, Ma
has consistently kept a low profile and refrained from leaving the hotels where
he was staying during his previous layovers.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Ma is likely to walk out of his hotel during his forthcoming
visit in Hawaii and may even hold a seminar with think tank scholars there.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, would not confirm the reports,
however, saying instead that Ma's main principle is to "make things simple."</P>
      <P>"Making a transit stop is our top goal and it remains uncertain whether there
will be any activities outside the hotel," Wang added.</P>
      <P>Accompanying Ma will be a 129-member delegation, composed of government
officials, legislators, industry exeuctives, academics, university presidents,
local government chiefs,  charity group executives and performing artists.</P>
      <P>Some 40 local journalists will be on hand to cover Ma's third diplomatic journey
since he assumed office in May 2008, Hou added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Having won a total of one match since early May, Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun figured to
be an unlikely candidate to upset world No. 2 Roger Federer in the opening match
on center court of this year's Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>But the world No. 65 never held back during the 105-minute match, playing
aggressively and trying to put pressure on Federer whenever he could before
falling in 105 minutes, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2.</P>
      <P>"He was tough and he hit some really good shots," Federer said of his game
opponent.</P>
      <P>"I knew the danger today. He's beaten good players in the past... That was a
tough first set. He actually remained tough throughout the match, which was good
to see, in a way."</P>
      <P>Lu, playing at Wimbledon for the sixth time, had been sidetracked by a viral
infection since winning a Challenger event in Israel the second week of May.</P>
      <P>His grass court preparation consisted of two defeats and a victory over a
British player ranked No. 493 in the world, not exactly an inspiring track
record one would hope for ahead of a match against Federer on perhaps his
favorite court in the world.</P>
      <P>Lu showed some toughness early, saving four break points in the second game of
the match and actually taking a 3-2 lead in the first set when he broke
Federer's serve.</P>
      <P>But Federer immediately returned the favor, and the two players stayed on serve
until the final game of the set.</P>
      <P>Lu had a chance to set up game point with a relatively simple drop volley, but
could not push it over the net, and then he netted a backhand to give Federer
the first set, 7-5.</P>
      <P>Whatever tension may have existed seemed to evaporate after that game, and early
Federer breaks in the second and third sets only added to the seeming
inevitability of a victory for the Swiss.</P>
      <P>As the match wore on, Federer's superior shot-making skills and serve became
more assertive, and his almost effortless footwork often left him in control of
the points, sending Lu chasing balls around the court or forcing him to rush to
keep up with rapidly returned shots.</P>
      <P>The world No. 2, gunning for an all-time best 15th grand slam title at
Wimbledon, only lost 10 points on serve in the final two sets, giving Lu little
chance to reassert himself.</P>
      <P>Despite the straight set defeat, Lu played at a relatively high level, making
only 11 unforced errors (to Federer's 10) , including only four in the first two
sets, and he got nearly 70 percent of his first serves in, an unusually high
percentage for the 25-year-old.</P>
      <P>With the defeat of Lu, whose best showings at Wimbledon came in 2004 and 2005
when he reached the second round, Taiwan had one player left in a main singles
draw at this year's Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>Out of action for a good part of 2009 recovering from injury, Chan Yung-jan was
to play 12th-seed Marion Bartoli of France later Monday in a first round women's
singles match.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several medical tour groups from China will come to Taiwan in the latter part of
the year, the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Secretary-General Walter Yeh said more groups were likely to come
a day after the first 30-member medical tour group arrived from China for a six-
day visit.</P>
      <P>The first tour group members checked into four medical centers around the
country Monday for physical examinations.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the assistance of the TAITRA, the Guangzhou-based Zion Health Club
reached an agreement in March with 13 medical centers and hospitals in Taiwan to
organize medical tourism groups from China for the three-fold  purpose  of
medical care,  spa treatment  and sightseeing.</P>
      <P>Zion Health Club is a subsidiary of the Women's World Spa Resort Group -- a
Taiwanese-financed company that has at least 600,000 members around China.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that since last June to mid-June this year, the TAITRA has assisted 698
Chinese people to come to Taiwan for medical treatment and among them, 228 were
for physical check-ups.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai, chairperson of Guangzhou's Women's World, said that after the first
group, the next group of 50 members is scheduled to arrive in late August.</P>
      <P>"There will be five or six such groups to arrive by next Chinese New Year," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>TAITRA officials said Taiwan's advanced medical facilities and high standard of
medical professionals have attracted the medical tour groups.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that one such group from the West Coast of the United States and
two such groups from the East Coast, as well as several Chinese groups will
arrive in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>With Chinese tourists  coming from relatively  high income brackets, if each of
them spend NT$200,000 in Taiwan, coupled with the group fee of NT$60,000 and the
full physical fee of NT$20,000, then the first Chinese medical tour group could
inject NT$8.4 million into the local economy, TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the amount was not too high initially, it would
definitely grow given the marked improvement in relations between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>The TAITRA is scheduled to organize a group to visit northeastern China's Dalian
and Qingdao this October to promote Taiwan's medical tourism.</P>

government and transferred diplomatic recognition to Beijing.

other reason than to show his personal purity of motive is one who breaks up one
of the greatest ties in the foundation of society. A good and wise man, on the
other hand, who enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to
be right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is well
aware of that."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>More medical tourism groups from China to come</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several medical tour groups from China will come to Taiwan in the latter part of
the year, the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Secretary-General Walter Yeh said more groups were likely to come
a day after the first 30-member medical tour group arrived from China for a six-
day visit.</P>
      <P>The first tour group members checked into four medical centers around the
country Monday for physical examinations.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the assistance of the TAITRA, the Guangzhou-based Zion Health Club
reached an agreement in March with 13 medical centers and hospitals in Taiwan to
organize medical tourism groups from China for the three-fold  purpose  of
medical care,  spa treatment  and sightseeing.</P>
      <P>Zion Health Club is a subsidiary of the Women's World Spa Resort Group -- a
Taiwanese-financed company that has at least 600,000 members around China.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that since last June to mid-June this year, the TAITRA has assisted 698
Chinese people to come to Taiwan for medical treatment and among them, 228 were
for physical check-ups.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai, chairperson of Guangzhou's Women's World, said that after the first
group, the next group of 50 members is scheduled to arrive in late August.</P>
      <P>"There will be five or six such groups to arrive by next Chinese New Year," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>TAITRA officials said Taiwan's advanced medical facilities and high standard of
medical professionals have attracted the medical tour groups.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that one such group from the West Coast of the United States and
two such groups from the East Coast, as well as several Chinese groups will
arrive in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>With Chinese tourists  coming from relatively  high income brackets, if each of
them spend NT$200,000 in Taiwan, coupled with the group fee of NT$60,000 and the
full physical fee of NT$20,000, then the first Chinese medical tour group could
inject NT$8.4 million into the local economy, TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the amount was not too high initially, it would
definitely grow given the marked improvement in relations between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>The TAITRA is scheduled to organize a group to visit northeastern China's Dalian
and Qingdao this October to promote Taiwan's medical tourism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lu swept aside by Federer at Wimbledon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Having won a total of one match since early May, Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun figured to
be an unlikely candidate to upset world No. 2 Roger Federer in the opening match
on center court of this year's Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>But the world No. 65 never held back during the 105-minute match, playing
aggressively and trying to put pressure on Federer whenever he could before
falling in 105 minutes, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2.</P>
      <P>"He was tough and he hit some really good shots," Federer said of his game
opponent.</P>
      <P>"I knew the danger today. He's beaten good players in the past... That was a
tough first set. He actually remained tough throughout the match, which was good
to see, in a way."</P>
      <P>Lu, playing at Wimbledon for the sixth time, had been sidetracked by a viral
infection since winning a Challenger event in Israel the second week of May.</P>
      <P>His grass court preparation consisted of two defeats and a victory over a
British player ranked No. 493 in the world, not exactly an inspiring track
record one would hope for ahead of a match against Federer on perhaps his
favorite court in the world.</P>
      <P>Lu showed some toughness early, saving four break points in the second game of
the match and actually taking a 3-2 lead in the first set when he broke
Federer's serve.</P>
      <P>But Federer immediately returned the favor, and the two players stayed on serve
until the final game of the set.</P>
      <P>Lu had a chance to set up game point with a relatively simple drop volley, but
could not push it over the net, and then he netted a backhand to give Federer
the first set, 7-5.</P>
      <P>Whatever tension may have existed seemed to evaporate after that game, and early
Federer breaks in the second and third sets only added to the seeming
inevitability of a victory for the Swiss.</P>
      <P>As the match wore on, Federer's superior shot-making skills and serve became
more assertive, and his almost effortless footwork often left him in control of
the points, sending Lu chasing balls around the court or forcing him to rush to
keep up with rapidly returned shots.</P>
      <P>The world No. 2, gunning for an all-time best 15th grand slam title at
Wimbledon, only lost 10 points on serve in the final two sets, giving Lu little
chance to reassert himself.</P>
      <P>Despite the straight set defeat, Lu played at a relatively high level, making
only 11 unforced errors (to Federer's 10) , including only four in the first two
sets, and he got nearly 70 percent of his first serves in, an unusually high
percentage for the 25-year-old.</P>
      <P>With the defeat of Lu, whose best showings at Wimbledon came in 2004 and 2005
when he reached the second round, Taiwan had one player left in a main singles
draw at this year's Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>Out of action for a good part of 2009 recovering from injury, Chan Yung-jan was
to play 12th-seed Marion Bartoli of France later Monday in a first round women's
singles match.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma set to depart June 29 for another diplomatic tour</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is set to depart next Monday on another diplomatic tour
that will take him to three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America --
Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras, an official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of President Ma's upcoming Central America tour is to attend
the inauguration of Panama's president-elect, Ricardo Martinelli, in Panama City
July 1, " said Javier Hou, vice minister of foreign affairs, at a Presidential
Office news conference.</P>
      <P>It will be Ma's second trip to the region this year. He concluded a three-leg
Central America tour June 4, during which he attended El Salvador President
Mauricio Funes's inaugural ceremony and visited two neighboring allies -- Belize
and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending Martinelli's inauguration, Ma will hold talks with
senior officials of the new Panamanian government, tour the Panama Canal, give
interviews to international news media and meet with Taiwanese community leaders
during his stay in Panama, Hou said.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching will accompany Ma on the June 29-July 7 diplomatic
tour as she did on the president's last trip, Hou said, adding that Chow will
visit a charity organization led by the new Panamanian first lady.</P>
      <P>Following his trip to Panama, Ma will travel to Nicaragua where Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega will drive Ma to the hub of a bilateral technological
cooperation project, which will allow Ma to have direct contact with Nicaraguan
citizens.</P>
      <P>Ma will also attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a large-scale trade fair to be
held in Nicaragua July 1-5, in which many Taiwanese companies will exhibit their
latest products, Hou said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that Ma's cancellation of a planned meeting with Ortega in San
Salvador early this month had not had any impact on relations between Taipei and
Managua.</P>
      <P>During the Nicaragua visit, first lady Chow will visit the local branch of the
World Vision -- a Christian chairty dedicated to help disadvantaged people
around the world -- and a disabled children's development center.</P>
      <P>On the third and last leg of his tour, Ma will visit Honduras, where he will
deliver a speech at the Honduran parliament and visit the site of a Taiwan-
Honduras cooperative project.</P>
      <P>Ma will make a transit stop in San Francisco en route to Panama and will stop in
Hawaii on his way home.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with the United States, Ma
has consistently kept a low profile and refrained from leaving the hotels where
he was staying during his previous layovers.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Ma is likely to walk out of his hotel during his forthcoming
visit in Hawaii and may even hold a seminar with think tank scholars there.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, would not confirm the reports,
however, saying instead that Ma's main principle is to "make things simple."</P>
      <P>"Making a transit stop is our top goal and it remains uncertain whether there
will be any activities outside the hotel," Wang added.</P>
      <P>Accompanying Ma will be a 129-member delegation, composed of government
officials, legislators, industry exeuctives, academics, university presidents,
local government chiefs,  charity group executives and performing artists.</P>
      <P>Some 40 local journalists will be on hand to cover Ma's third diplomatic journey
since he assumed office in May 2008, Hou added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opening Taiwan to U.S. beef in final stage of discussions: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States are currently conducting final negotiations on the
controversial issue of fully opening Taiwan's market to U.S. beef, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Both sides are engaged in intensive final discussions, said Harry Tseng,
director-general of MOFA's Department of North American Affairs, at regular
press briefing.</P>
      <P>Technical negotiations, he said, are being carried out by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs' Office of Trade Negotiations, the Council of Agriculture and
the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry is involved in the process, but I cannot comment on the
details,he added.</P>
      <P>Pressed on whether the issue could be resolved this year, Tseng said he is
optimistic over the timeline.</P>
      <P>The U.S. currently supplies 32 percent of Taiwan's beef, but under existing DOH
regulations, only boneless beef from cattle younger  than  30  months  of age,
produced  from  certified slaughterhouses and without high-risk items such as
brains and spinal cord marrow, can be imported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stephen M. Young, the top U.S. envoy to Taiwan, has repeatedly urged Taiwan
government to make a science-based decision on fully opening its market to U.S.
beef.</P>
      <P>All of Taiwan's scientific review and technical work indicates that U.S.  beef
does not pose a threat of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow
disease, Young has contended.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of BSE was diagnosed in Seattle. The
ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle
aged under 30 months, but the local government reimposed the ban two months
later when a second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wage data released by Taiwan's statistics bureau Monday showed that local
workers have had to confront a record decline in their nominal and real incomes
during the first four months of 2009.</P>
      <P>The average monthly income of local employees between January to April fell by a
record 8.54 percent year-on-year to NT$47,107, a Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The average regular monthly wage also contracted during the same period by a
record 3.04 percent to NT$35,488, according to Huang Chien-chung, deputy
director of the Fourth Bureau of the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>The average monthly wage includes regular wages (salary and fixed monthly
subsidies and bonuses) plus overtime, and other non-regular wages (performance
bonuses, year-end bonuses, and employee bonuses).</P>
      <P>Real monthly income and the real regular monthly wage, which take into account
the impact of inflation on wages, fell by 8.44 percent and 2.93 percent
respectively, Huang said, after the consumer price index declined 0.12 percent
during the first four months of the year.</P>
      <P>All four income measures posted the steepest four-month declines since they were
first compiled in 1980, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Nominal regular wages contracted by more than 2 percent every month between
November and April, the statistics also showed. They fell by 2.52 percent in
November, 3.41 percent in December, 4.63 percent in January, 2.56 percent in
February, 2.39 percent in March, and 2.56 percent in April.</P>
      <P>Huang attributed the persistent decline to the sagging commercial activity of
domestic manufacturers as a result of the global economic downturn.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lu picks up confidence and a new coach in loss to Federer</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun was swept aside in straight sets by world No. 2 Roger
Federer in a first round men's singles match at Wimbledon Monday, but he emerged
from the encounter with more confidence and a new coach.</P>
      <P>Lu, who had been struggling to recover from an energy-sapping virus since mid-
May, lost to the five-time Wimbledon champion 7-5, 6-3, 6-2 in 105 minutes, but
he told the Central News Agency afterwards that holding a 3-2 lead in the first
set despite a heavy bout of nerves left him more confident than ever.</P>
      <P>"It had a real motivating effect, because it made me understand that even
against a top player like Federer, I could still be competitive and fight to the
end, " Lu said. "To have a good showing against a heavyweight is not an
impossibility."</P>
      <P>Lu struggled for much of his career against top-ranked players before defeating
top 10 players Andy Murray in the Olympics in Beijing in 2008 and Argentine
David Nalbandian in the second round of this year's Australian Open.</P>
      <P>After Monday's match, even Federer came away impressed.</P>
      <P>"I thought he played excellent. He's a wonderful player. He has got a nice
forehand, a nice backhand, very sound game all around, " Federer said. "I knew
the danger today. He's beaten good players in the past."</P>
      <P>Although Lu said he learned a lot during the match and described playing him on
perhaps the biggest stage in men's tennis -- center court at Wimbledon -- as a
"special experience," it was not his dream draw.</P>
      <P>"When the draw first came out, I thought I was really unlucky because I really
felt comfortable on the grass surface. My coach told me beforehand that as long
as I didn't draw Federer, I had a chance against any of the other 126 players
entered."</P>
      <P>The loss to Federer meant Lu was eliminated from Wimbledon for the fourth time
in six tries, with his best showings second round finishes in 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>His best performance in a grand slam singles event came at this year's
Australian Open, when he reached the third round.</P>
      <P>Lu said his stamina was not 100 percent against Federer, as he only began
training in earnest 10 days ago after a blood test in England found everything
was normal, and that he still needs time to regain his prior level of
conditioning, but now he'll have extra incentive.</P>
      <P>Former Australian doubles great Mark Woodforde, who won 12 grand slam doubles
titles during his career, worked with Lu during the week prior to Wimbledon and
will travel with the 25-year-old Taiwanese over the next month to help him
during the U.S. hard court season.</P>
      <P>Woodforde, who along with Lu's regular coach Dirk Hordorff, helped Lu devise the
attacking strategy that paid some dividends against Federer, also used his
privileges as a member of Wimbledon to get Lu into the closely guarded center
court before the tournament began and get a feel for the intimidating arena.</P>
      <P>Having a former player with Woodforde's experience and knowledge of the game at
his side can only help Lu in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>While Lu made a respectable showing in the men's draw, compatriot Chan Yung-jan
showed she is still far from fully recovered following a two-month layoff due to
a left toe fracture.</P>
      <P>After falling to 12th seed Marion Bartoli of France 6-0, 6-0 in the first round
of the women's singles, Chan said that while her toe had recovered physically,
she had yet to overcome the psychological barrier of worrying about reinjuring
it and often moved too cautiously around the court.</P>
      <P>Her conditioning was also a long way from peak form after the layoff, making it
difficult to work through long points, she said.</P>
      <P>Her focus will now turn to doubles, where she will partner with Hungary's Agnes
Szavay.</P>

      <P>China has proposed Aug. 31 as the date for the launch of regularly scheduled
cross-Taiwan Strait flights, but Taiwan is hoping that the date could be brought
forward, a spokesman for the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) confirmed
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China have yet to decide on the start date for the 270 regular two-
way flights per week, " said Yeh Yung-ching, a CAA section chief who is in
charge of the matter.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a media report that the CAA and Taiwanese carriers have reached a
decision that the ticket prices for cross-strait flights will be lowered by
about 15 percent, Yeh said that the CAA simply urged the airlines to make some
price adjustments in response to widespread public complaints about the cost.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China reached an agreement in April, in their third round of
negotiations, to increase the number of cross-strait flights from the current
108 to 270 per week. But the two sides have yet to agree on a date for the
implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>Since direct air travel between Taiwan and China kicked off in July last year,
passenger loads on cross-strait charters have risen from 65 percent to an
average of 78.8 percent, CAA statistics showed.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:</P>
      <P>China Times: On DPP's push for ex-president's release</P>
      <P>Whether the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) can critically examine
the corruption case involving former President Chen Shui-bian poses a test for
the party's survival. Considered solely from a "pro-Chen" perspective, the DPP's
plan to launch a petition drive calling for Chen's release lacks the depth of
the human rights campaign that the party intends it to be.</P>
      <P>The DPP does not need to wait until the conclusion of Chen's court cases to
assess the rights and wrongs during his presidency. Chen himself confessed that
"I did things that are not permitted by law," immediately after his family's
money-laundering activities were exposed.</P>
      <P>Because of the DPP leadership's failure to make a quick decision to take a
critical stand against Chen and gain the moral high ground in the beginning,
Chen has now seized the initiative to regain his influence in the party.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On DPP's drive for ex-president's release</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's plan to launch a petition drive calling for the
release of former President Chen Shui-bian may help give vent to the resentment
of pro-independence hardliners, but the move is also demonstrates to the
mainstream public that Tsai and the DPP cannot get out of the mire surrounding
the issue of supporting and rescuing Chen.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan independence cause leads to a dead end, but Tsai dares not dump her
sweeteners to the "deep greens." The path of supporting Chen also leads to a
dead end, but again Tsai dares not discard her actions that pander to the "deep
greens."</P>
      <P>You cannot save the party if you choose to rescue Chen, and if you choose to
save the party, you cannot rescue Chen. Tsai Ing-wen, how can you take a track
that will lead the DPP to its doom?</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On status upgrades for selected localities</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior is set to review Tuesday the applications by seven
localities to have their status upgraded to special municipalities, and to make
a final decision by the end of the day. The process, however, is marred by
rumors that the successful applicants have been predetermined to facilitate the
ruling Kuomintang's political maneuvering for the year-end local elections.</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou,  which is a self-styled  team  of
social  elites,  is engaged  in various under-the-counter, illicit undertakings.
This is the main reason that the incident has triggered social furor.</P>
      <P>This type of public policy should adopt an open and transparent process of
consensus building, and should not involve the granting of private favors by a
minority of individuals behind closed doors. The decision-making process adopted
by Ma's administration is against the principles of a modern government and
gives the impression of being retrogressive.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: On the perjury investigation of ex-president's daughter</P>
      <P>The situation in which the children of former President Chen Shui-bian are
repeatedly summoned for questioning by prosecutors as part of the investigation
into Chen's corruption case is to a certain extent inconsistent with humane and
legal traditions.</P>
      <P>U.S. law allows a defendant's spouse to refuse to testify against the defendant,
while the continental legal system expands this exemption to cover close
relatives.</P>
      <P>The case does not only involve the deprivation of Chen's rights as a defendant,
but also highlights the uncivilized nature of the judicial system under which
children are compelled to testify against their parents.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that the government has come up with
several job creation programs to tackle the high unemployment rate recorded in
May.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks at a meeting of a local industrial and commerce association
the day after the government's statistics agency reported that Taiwan's
unemployment rate had surged to 5.82 percent in May, the highest level since the
government began compiling jobless figures in 1978.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed to the high unemployment figures in May to the number of new
graduates in the job market, and said that the data was in line with Council for
Economic Planning and Development's (CEPD's) projections.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has further projected that the unemployment rate will reach 6 percent
between June and September, he added.</P>
      <P>However, the unemployment situation will ease gradually as the government rolls
out its job matching plan for new university graduates and employers and many
other job creation programs, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with export orders picking up, the rate of decline in exports is
expected to continue to slow down, which in turn will prompt companies to expand
employment, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Liu's views, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming expressed
confidence that the rate of job losses will begin to abate between the end of
this year and early next year as the government phases in its four-year NT$500
billion major infrastructure projects from the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the job market has shown signs of improvement, as evidenced by the
fact that the number of employees placed on furlough in the country's export
zones has dropped from a peak of 26,000 in February to 2,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan must redefine China as its best market: economics minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said Tuesday that he sees China as
Taiwan's best market and Taiwan should therefore revise its perception of China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's best market opportunities are on mainland China; why should it fear
being tagged with the 'one China' label?" Yiin said in akeynote speech at the
ROC Council for Industrial and Commercial Development.</P>
      <P>In his speech, which focused on the prospects for the Taiwan economy in light of
the global changes, Yiin said the drivers of the global economy are weaker,
referring to developed countries such as Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Global Insight has forecast the global economy would contract by 2.6 percent in
2009, and that the U.S. and the Euro zone would see shrinkage in their economic
development this year as a result of the global financial storm, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>The less-developed Asian region would maintain its economic growth, due largely
to the economic rise of China, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the Global Insight economic forecast, China's gross domestic
product (GDP) will grow 6.9 percent in 2009, which is expected to lift the
global economy by some 0.5 percentage points, he said.</P>
      <P>China was listed as the world's third largest economic entity, but is actually
the second largest under the Purchasing Power Parity calculation system, he
noted.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan must redefine its position in relation to China, " he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, he noted, the Taiwan government's cross-strait focus is to open the
door to Chinese investments and to promote an Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The revision to the regulations to allow investments from China is expected to
take effect June 30, and from July 1 Taiwan will begin the work of trying to
attract Chinese capital, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>He added that the planned ECFA will cover three areas -- tariff-free exports,
the liberalization of the services sector, and an investment guarantee accord.
Under an early implementation agreement, some 1,000 product categories will be
included in the urgent tariff-free aspect of the trade pact, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>As for the other parts of the ECFA, it doesn't matter if it takes 10 years to
talk about them," he added.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been pushing for a trade pact with China in an effort
to avoid Taiwan's marginalization in East Asia, as a free trade agreement among
China and the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) is set to take effect next January.</P>
      <P>However, the ECFA proposal has been strongly opposed by the pro-independence
opposition parties, which have argued that it will compromise Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>

Tuesday, with the weighted index, the market's key barometer, losing 143.74

      <P>Following a 200-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average overnight,  the
local bourse opened low at 6,206.31 following government data showing that
Taiwan's unemployment rate surged to a record high of 5.82 percent in May. It
later rebounded to 6,262.29 and dropped to the day's low of 6,197.47.</P>
      <P>A total of 3.41 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$91.56

issues dropped 3.0 percent, banking and financial stocks lost 2.5 percent,
construction shares fell 2.1 percent, machinery and electronics issues dropped
1.9 percent, foodstuff shares lost 1.1 percent, and paper and pulp issues shed

      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,531 to 501,  with 133 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth NT$12.89 billion.</P>
      <P>Despite a lackluster performance on the Dow Jones industrial average, there were

7 percent daily maximum limit.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chen-chia, an analyst at the Cathay Securities Investment Trust Co.,
predicted that although there is little room for the Taiex to rise further in

the trade volume increases to more than NT$110 billion.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite robust competition among local governments for their cities or counties
to be upgraded to special municipalities, Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu said
Tuesday that one each should be established in northern, central and southern
Taiwan so as to achieve balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks after stating reasons why Taichung City and Taichung County
in central Taiwan should be merged into a special municipality, in a meeting of
a panel convened by Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi to review seven
similar applications from 11 local governments.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, Taoyuan County Magistrate Eric Chu,
Taitung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-
yuan, Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-
wen, Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih,
Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu and Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing
all presented their cases at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu said he is confident that the Taichung City and Taichung County application
would be approved, but added that it would give a boost to the country's overall
competitiveness if a municipality is formed in each of the three major regions.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside rampant rumors that it has been predetermined that Taichung City
and Taichung County will be merged into a special municipality, Hu said that
those allegations are unfair. He pointed out that one of President Ma Ying-
jeou's campaign promises was to establish "three municipalities and 15 counties"
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is concerned about the fact that most local governments seeking
an upgrade are eyeing bigger budgets and improved finances, Hu said that is an
issue that President Ma and the central government should examine, as many
localities have problems of revenue shortfalls.</P>
      <P>Special municipalities fall under the direct jurisdiction of the central
government and are entitled to have bigger budgets than other local governments.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, Liao said the panel's decisions would turn a new page in
Taiwan's development. The critical issue is how to boost  Taiwan's
international  competitiveness  through  the restructuring  of central
government functions and rezoning of administrative areas, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu said the proposed merger with
Kaohsiung  County is designed  to address  urgent development needs in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan not only has to compete with Japan and South Korea, but also faces
competition from China, particularly from southern China, Chen said. It is
therefore very important to sharpen the competitive edge of the greater
Kaohsiung area in southern Taiwan and strike a balance in development between
the north and south, she said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang said an upgrade of the Kaohsiung
area is urgently necessary and that 78 percent of the county's residents support
such a plan.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County complement each other, and a merger, backed
by an additional budget of NT$13 billion (US$393 million) , will definitely
boost regional competitiveness on a wide range of fronts, he said.</P>
      <P>However, if the Taichung area is merged first, Kaohsiung would be marginalized,
he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the agricultural counties of Yunlin and Chiayi are also seeking to
merge to facilitate development into an "agricultural municipality" that would
mean greater economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County has a population of over 720,000, while Chiayi County's is about
540,000. If they are merged,  the combined population will be some 1.26 million
people, which is in excess of the minimum 1 million specified for a special
municipality, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is expecting another breakthrough in its efforts to seek visa waiver
privileges from foreign countries, with evidence indicating that Ireland is soon
to announce visa-free entry for Taiwanese nationals, according to a senior
Taiwanese official familiar with the issue who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official told CNA that Ireland is set to grant 90-day visa-free privileges
to Taiwanese passport holders as soon as next week, adding that a formal
announcement will be made in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the matter, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Henry Chen said the
ministry is working hard on the issue.</P>
      <P>"Things are moving in a positive direction with regard to the matter," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government allows Republic of Ireland passport holders
30-day visa-free stays, which, on the principle of reciprocity, is expected to
be extended to 90 days if Ireland decides to grant 90-day visa-free stays for
Taiwanese visitors.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom, which started including Taiwan in its visa-waiver program
March 3, became the first major Western country to lift visa requirements for
Taiwanese citizens and has since spurred debate in other countries such as
Germany on the possibility of making similar moves.</P>
      <P>So far, the British visa-free treatment is the most favorable, allowing
Taiwanese passport holders traveling to Britain for the purpose of tourism,
business, short-term study or family visits visa-free status for up to six
months.</P>
      <P>According  to the Irish  government,  the number  of visa applications by
Taiwanese passport holders is around 1,200 per year.</P>
      <P>The fees for Irish visas are NT$2,700 (US$82) for a single-entry visa valid for
three months or NT$4,500 for a multiple-entry visa valid for a year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Progress reported in negotiations with U.S. on extradition pact</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  23 (CNA)
06/23/09  19:52:39

    <TEXT>
      <P>Progress has been made in Taiwan's negotiations with the United States on the
possibility of a bilateral extradition arrangement, Taiwan's representative to
Washington, Jason Yuan, said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Yuan, the U.S. administration took Taiwan's request for such a pact
seriously and responded with "good intentions."</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that the U.S. executive branch is unable to clinch a treaty
with Taiwan because of the lack of official ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In order to sidestep this obstacle, Yuan said, the U.S. administration has
joined hands with Taiwan to persuade Congress to come up with a bill that would
have the same effect as an extradition agreement.</P>
      <P>"It is a sign of the smooth communications  between  our representative office
and the U.S. administration, " Yuan went on, adding that Taipei used to have
difficulty even conveying its requests to the U.S. executive branch, far less
working with it.</P>
      <P>Although there are positive signs in the negotiations, there is red tape to
circumvent and Congress has many other bills pending enactment, Yuan continued.</P>
      <P>Just as Taiwan's requests for visa exemption privileges for its people when
visiting the United States, a bill with the effect as an extradition pact will
need time and patience, he said.</P>
      <P>"I do not want to mislead our people into believing that this could be achieved
any time soon," Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Owing to the lack of an extradition arrangement, many of Taiwan's most high-
profile fugitives are taking refuge in the United States, to the great chagrin
of the Taiwanese authorities, who are powerless to bring them to justice.</P>
      <P>Notable among these are Huang Fang-yen, who is alleged to have helped former
President Chen Shui-bian launder his money, as well as Ching Chi-ju, who is
reported to have duped the Foreign Ministry out of US$30 million, and Wang You-
theng who stands accused in Taiwan of bilking billions of dollars from a
business group he founded.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-hao, another business tycoon who is wanted for fraud in Taiwan,
embarrassed former President Chen Shui-bian during his run for re-election in
2004 by claiming at a news conference in California that he was one of Chen's
political contributors.</P>

      <P>The ambassadors for Taiwan's campaign to get Yushan or Jade Mountain chosen as
one of the world's natural wonders launched an around-the-island cycling tour
Tuesday as part of their efforts to promote the bid.</P>
      <P>During the 15 days leading up to the July 7 deadline for the second stage of
global online voting, the ambassadors will call on opinion leaders in the
business, religious, arts and cultural, and political sectors around Taiwan to
encourage them to take part in the vote and offer their support for Yushan,
according to the Yushan National Park Headquarters.</P>
      <P>The ambassadors  will  also visit  local  communities  and universities and
invite people they encounter to draw a picture or write an article based on
their impressions of Yushan, said Chen Lung-sheng, head of the park
headquarters.</P>
      <P>"Through thinking and perception covering different dimensions, we will be able
to highlight the uniqueness of Yushan and inspire more people to join the vote,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Coinciding with the cycling tour, a "vote wagon" is being sent around to allow
the public to cast their votes using the computer systems installed on the
vehicle, he said.</P>
      <P>The 3,952-meter mountain, the highest in Northeast Asia, has so far maintained
the top position in the "mountain, volcanoes" category in the second round of
voting for the world's new seven natural wonders being held by the Swiss-based
New7Wonders Foundation at www.new7wonders.com.</P>
      <P>Located on the boundaries of Chiayi, Nantou and Kaohsiung counties, Yushan is
known for its diverse wildlife and ecology. It is the only natural attraction
from Taiwan to make the list of contenders in any category.</P>
      <P>As of June 22, Africa's Kalahari Desert had taken the top position in the
"landscape, ice formations" category; Ecuador's Galapagos Islands in the
"islands" category; Serbia's Djavolja Varos in the "caves, rock formations,
valleys" category; South America's Amazon Rainforest in the "forest, national
parks, nature reserves" category; South America's Lake Titicaca in the "lakes,
rivers, waterfalls" category; and Vietnam's Ha Long Bay in the "seascape"
category.</P>
      <P>The top 11 sites chosen in each of the seven categories by July 7 will then be
reviewed by a panel of experts headed by Federico Mayor Zaragoza, former UNESCO
director-general, who will select three nominees in each category.</P>
      <P>The 21 nominees will be put to a final round of worldwide online voting in 2010
and 2011 to select the top seven natural wonders.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural and fishery exports in 2008 soared despite the global
recession, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said Tuesday at the opening of the
2009 Taipei International Food Show.</P>
      <P>While the global economy was suffering a downturn last year, Taiwan's farm and
seafood product exports still posted a 12.1 percent year-on-year growth to
NT$3.85 billion last year, Chiu said at the Nangang Exhibition Hall in Taipei,
where the food show is being held.</P>
      <P>Rice exports posted the largest growth among all exports of Taiwan's
agricultural and fishery products, up 10,647 percent year-on -year, followed by
groupers, up 1,221 percent; carrots, up 565 percent; Taiwan tilapia, up 30
percent; and vegetable soybeans, up 15.2 percent, Chiu said, citing statistics.</P>
      <P>Chiu was making a speech during the opening ceremony of the food show, where the
Taiwan Pavilion has been taking center stage.</P>
      <P>To showcase the freshness, safety and high quality of Taiwan's farm produce and
fishery products, the Council of Agriculture (COA) has been taking part in the
show by setting up the Taiwan Pavilion, which covers an area of 1,755 square
meters and brings together 83 local exhibitors, according to COA Minister Chen
Wu-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Pavilion comprises six sections, namely the Theme Section, Crop
Products Section, Fishery Products Section, Livestock Products Section,
Processed Food Section and Forest Products Section, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The pavilion displays a wide variety of agricultural products such as rice,
vegetables, mushrooms and processed food as well as fishery and livestock
products that got certificates of the Certified Agriculture Standard (CAS),
Critical Control Points (HACCP), or International Organization for
Standardization (IOS).</P>
      <P>A total of 826 exhibitors from 19 countries are taking part at the international
food show, which opened Tuesday and will run until June 26. The exhibits cover
an area of 14,690 square meters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>National park to stock endangered salmon parr in historic habitats</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Shei-Pa National Park Headquarters will hold a public activity June 26-27 in
which captive-bred Formosan landlocked salmon parr will be released into the
highly endangered fish's natural habitat.</P>
      <P>The public are welcome to attend the "taking young salmon home" activity, an
event that has taken place for the last two consecutive years, Liao Wu-yen,
director of the park headquarters' Wuling Station, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao said that 350 salmon parr -- juvenile salmon aged more than one year --
will be released in the Luoyehwei section of the Yousheng Creek, the Yikawan
section of the Dajia River and in the Sijielan Creek.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope the releases will allow people to spot the national
treasure in the rivers once again, and that the young fish will survive through
the summer typhoons. He noted in the past two years, only 1 percent of the
released parr are thought to have survived the annual typhoon season.</P>
      <P>The conservation measures are aimed at expanding the fishes breeding territory
in the wild. According to Liao, the number of Formosan landlocked salmon in the
wild is around 3,500, all of which live in the Cijiawan Creek in Wuling.</P>
      <P>The creek provides a stable environment for the delicate fish, Liao went on,
adding that the park authorities still want to establish wild breeding colonies
in other suitable areas.</P>
      <P>Formosan landlocked salmon were originally migratory fish that lived in the
frigid-temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere. During the breeding season,
they would swim upstream from the ocean to the upper reaches of the river where
they were born, where they would mate and spawn. After the eggs hatched, the
juvenile fish would return to the ocean, where they would grow to maturity
before returning to the river of their birth to repeat the cycle.</P>
      <P>Having evolved over many thousands of years to survive year-round in the fresh
water of Taiwan's remote river systems without migrating to the sea, the species
is now only found in Taiwan and was listed in 1984 as a precious natural
resource.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou received Richard C. Koo, the chief economist of Japan's
Nomura Research Institute, at the Presidential Office Tuesday, to take
professional guidance in efforts to lead Taiwan out of its recession.</P>
      <P>Koo, son of former senior adviser to the president, Koo Kuan-min, was invited by
a group of heavyweight Taiwanese business tycoons, including Chinatrust
Commercial Bank Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Koo, to visit Taiwan. He is Jeffrey
Koo's cousin.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, the economist renowned in both the United States and Japan told
Ma that the global recession triggered by the financial storm that occurred in
the U.S. last September has rarely happened in the global economic mechanism.</P>
      <P>The financial problems caused by the credit crisis have led to companies
devoting most of their resources to paying off their debts, even at a time when
interest rates are near zero. As more money is deposited in banks, it can no
longer flow through the market, the economist said, pointing out that the
situation stems the movement of funds, which further affects an economy's
economic growth.</P>
      <P>He called this phenomenon a "balance-sheet recession" and said he believes it is
behind the recession stagnation that has been hounding Japan for more than a
decade.</P>
      <P>To resolve the problem, he suggested that the government should launch long-term
investment projects to increase the flow of funds in and out of the market and
try to maintain the gross domestic production level.</P>
      <P>"This process takes a very long time, so the government should be patient," he
told Ma.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's planned visit to several countries in Central America
will be extended by one day, an aide to the president said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that Ma can meet with Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya
Rosales, he will arrive in that country July 4 rather than July 3 as initially
scheduled.</P>
      <P>The change was made to account for any possible delay in Zelaya's return to the
Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa from an overseas visit of his own, the anonymous
aide said.</P>
      <P>Although Zelaya had promised that he will return to Tegucigalpa before July 3,
Ma would prefer to delay his visit by one day to be on the safe side, the aide
said.</P>
      <P>As a result, Ma will stay in Panama July 1-3 -- one day longer than scheduled
originally -- and the date of his return to Taipei will therefore be postponed
by one day to July 8.</P>
      <P>Ma is set to depart June 29 for the visit to three of Taiwan's Central America
allies -- Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the trip is to attend the July 1 inauguration of Panamanian

      <P>Taiwan and the United States are currently conducting final negotiations on the
controversial issue of fully opening Taiwan's market to U.S. beef, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Both sides are engaged in intensive final discussions, said Harry Tseng,
director-general of MOFA's Department of North American Affairs, at regular
press briefing.</P>
      <P>Technical negotiations, he said, are being carried out by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs' Office of Trade Negotiations, the Council of Agriculture and
the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry is involved in the process, but I cannot comment on the
details,he added.</P>
      <P>Pressed on whether the issue could be resolved this year, Tseng said he is
optimistic over the timeline.</P>
      <P>The U.S. currently supplies 32 percent of Taiwan's beef, but under existing DOH
regulations, only boneless beef from cattle younger  than  30  months  of age,
produced  from  certified slaughterhouses and without high-risk items such as
brains and spinal cord marrow, can be imported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stephen M. Young, the top U.S. envoy to Taiwan, has repeatedly urged Taiwan
government to make a science-based decision on fully opening its market to U.S.
beef.</P>
      <P>All of Taiwan's scientific review and technical work indicates that U.S.  beef
does not pose a threat of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow
disease, Young has contended.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of BSE was diagnosed in Seattle. The
ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle
aged under 30 months, but the local government reimposed the ban two months
later when a second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wage data released by Taiwan's statistics bureau Monday showed that local
workers have had to confront a record decline in their nominal and real incomes
during the first four months of 2009.</P>
      <P>The average monthly income of local employees between January to April fell by a
record 8.54 percent year-on-year to NT$47,107, a Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The average regular monthly wage also contracted during the same period by a
record 3.04 percent to NT$35,488, according to Huang Chien-chung, deputy
director of the Fourth Bureau of the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>The average monthly wage includes regular wages (salary and fixed monthly
subsidies and bonuses) plus overtime, and other non-regular wages (performance
bonuses, year-end bonuses, and employee bonuses).</P>
      <P>Real monthly income and the real regular monthly wage, which take into account
the impact of inflation on wages, fell by 8.44 percent and 2.93 percent
respectively, Huang said, after the consumer price index declined 0.12 percent
during the first four months of the year.</P>
      <P>All four income measures posted the steepest four-month declines since they were
first compiled in 1980, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Nominal regular wages contracted by more than 2 percent every month between
November and April, the statistics also showed. They fell by 2.52 percent in
November, 3.41 percent in December, 4.63 percent in January, 2.56 percent in
February, 2.39 percent in March, and 2.56 percent in April.</P>
      <P>Huang attributed the persistent decline to the sagging commercial activity of
domestic manufacturers as a result of the global economic downturn.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will make public appearances in Hawaii in early July
during a transit stop on his way home from a state visit to Central America, the

      <P>"There will be some different activities for President Ma during his transit
stop in Hawaii, including public visits, said Harry Tseng, director-general of

      <P>While the press guidelines of the U.S. State Department remain unchanged --
Taiwanese media accompanying the president cannot report on his visits on U.S.

understandable on the part of the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>Tseng declined, however, to disclose the destinations that Ma would visit.</P>
      <P>Ma is set to depart next Monday on another diplomatic tour that will take him to
three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America -- Panama, Nicaragua and
Honduras.</P>
      <P>The president will make a transit stop in San Francisco en route to Panama and
will stop in Hawaii on his way home.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with the United States, Ma
has consistently kept a low profile and refrained from leaving the hotels where
he was staying during his previous layovers, making only phone calls or
receiving some members of the U.S. Congress.</P>
      <P>Hawaii might be the first time Ma makes a public appearance during similar
transit stops in the U.S.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lu picks up confidence and a new coach in loss to Federer</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun was swept aside in straight sets by world No. 2 Roger
Federer in a first round men's singles match at Wimbledon Monday, but he emerged
from the encounter with more confidence and a new coach.</P>
      <P>Lu, who had been struggling to recover from an energy-sapping virus since mid-
May, lost to the five-time Wimbledon champion 7-5, 6-3, 6-2 in 105 minutes, but
he told the Central News Agency afterwards that holding a 3-2 lead in the first
set despite a heavy bout of nerves left him more confident than ever.</P>
      <P>"It had a real motivating effect, because it made me understand that even
against a top player like Federer, I could still be competitive and fight to the
end, " Lu said. "To have a good showing against a heavyweight is not an
impossibility."</P>
      <P>Lu struggled for much of his career against top-ranked players before defeating
top 10 players Andy Murray in the Olympics in Beijing in 2008 and Argentine
David Nalbandian in the second round of this year's Australian Open.</P>
      <P>After Monday's match, even Federer came away impressed.</P>
      <P>"I thought he played excellent. He's a wonderful player. He has got a nice
forehand, a nice backhand, very sound game all around, " Federer said. "I knew
the danger today. He's beaten good players in the past."</P>
      <P>Although Lu said he learned a lot during the match and described playing him on
perhaps the biggest stage in men's tennis -- center court at Wimbledon -- as a
"special experience," it was not his dream draw.</P>
      <P>"When the draw first came out, I thought I was really unlucky because I really
felt comfortable on the grass surface. My coach told me beforehand that as long
as I didn't draw Federer, I had a chance against any of the other 126 players
entered."</P>
      <P>The loss to Federer meant Lu was eliminated from Wimbledon for the fourth time
in six tries, with his best showings second round finishes in 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>His best performance in a grand slam singles event came at this year's
Australian Open, when he reached the third round.</P>
      <P>Lu said his stamina was not 100 percent against Federer, as he only began
training in earnest 10 days ago after a blood test in England found everything
was normal, and that he still needs time to regain his prior level of
conditioning, but now he'll have extra incentive.</P>
      <P>Former Australian doubles great Mark Woodforde, who won 12 grand slam doubles
titles during his career, worked with Lu during the week prior to Wimbledon and
will travel with the 25-year-old Taiwanese over the next month to help him
during the U.S. hard court season.</P>
      <P>Woodforde, who along with Lu's regular coach Dirk Hordorff, helped Lu devise the
attacking strategy that paid some dividends against Federer, also used his
privileges as a member of Wimbledon to get Lu into the closely guarded center
court before the tournament began and get a feel for the intimidating arena.</P>
      <P>Having a former player with Woodforde's experience and knowledge of the game at
his side can only help Lu in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>While Lu made a respectable showing in the men's draw, compatriot Chan Yung-jan
showed she is still far from fully recovered following a two-month layoff due to
a left toe fracture.</P>
      <P>After falling to 12th seed Marion Bartoli of France 6-0, 6-0 in the first round
of the women's singles, Chan said that while her toe had recovered physically,
she had yet to overcome the psychological barrier of worrying about reinjuring
it and often moved too cautiously around the court.</P>
      <P>Her conditioning was also a long way from peak form after the layoff, making it
difficult to work through long points, she said.</P>
      <P>Her focus will now turn to doubles, where she will partner with Hungary's Agnes
Szavay.</P>

      <P>China has proposed Aug. 31 as the date for the launch of regularly scheduled
cross-Taiwan Strait flights, but Taiwan is hoping that the date could be brought
forward, a spokesman for the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) confirmed
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China have yet to decide on the start date for the 270 regular two-
way flights per week, " said Yeh Yung-ching, a CAA section chief who is in
charge of the matter.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a media report that the CAA and Taiwanese carriers have reached a
decision that the ticket prices for cross-strait flights will be lowered by
about 15 percent, Yeh said that the CAA simply urged the airlines to make some
price adjustments in response to widespread public complaints about the cost.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China reached an agreement in April, in their third round of
negotiations, to increase the number of cross-strait flights from the current
108 to 270 per week. But the two sides have yet to agree on a date for the
implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>Since direct air travel between Taiwan and China kicked off in July last year,
passenger loads on cross-strait charters have risen from 65 percent to an
average of 78.8 percent, CAA statistics showed.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:</P>
      <P>China Times: On DPP's push for ex-president's release</P>
      <P>Whether the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) can critically examine
the corruption case involving former President Chen Shui-bian poses a test for
the party's survival. Considered solely from a "pro-Chen" perspective, the DPP's
plan to launch a petition drive calling for Chen's release lacks the depth of
the human rights campaign that the party intends it to be.</P>
      <P>The DPP does not need to wait until the conclusion of Chen's court cases to
assess the rights and wrongs during his presidency. Chen himself confessed that
"I did things that are not permitted by law," immediately after his family's
money-laundering activities were exposed.</P>
      <P>Because of the DPP leadership's failure to make a quick decision to take a
critical stand against Chen and gain the moral high ground in the beginning,
Chen has now seized the initiative to regain his influence in the party.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On DPP's drive for ex-president's release</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's plan to launch a petition drive calling for the
release of former President Chen Shui-bian may help give vent to the resentment
of pro-independence hardliners, but the move is also demonstrates to the
mainstream public that Tsai and the DPP cannot get out of the mire surrounding
the issue of supporting and rescuing Chen.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan independence cause leads to a dead end, but Tsai dares not dump her
sweeteners to the "deep greens." The path of supporting Chen also leads to a
dead end, but again Tsai dares not discard her actions that pander to the "deep
greens."</P>
      <P>You cannot save the party if you choose to rescue Chen, and if you choose to
save the party, you cannot rescue Chen. Tsai Ing-wen, how can you take a track
that will lead the DPP to its doom?</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On status upgrades for selected localities</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior is set to review Tuesday the applications by seven
localities to have their status upgraded to special municipalities, and to make
a final decision by the end of the day. The process, however, is marred by
rumors that the successful applicants have been predetermined to facilitate the
ruling Kuomintang's political maneuvering for the year-end local elections.</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou,  which is a self-styled  team  of
social  elites,  is engaged  in various under-the-counter, illicit undertakings.
This is the main reason that the incident has triggered social furor.</P>
      <P>This type of public policy should adopt an open and transparent process of
consensus building, and should not involve the granting of private favors by a
minority of individuals behind closed doors. The decision-making process adopted
by Ma's administration is against the principles of a modern government and
gives the impression of being retrogressive.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: On the perjury investigation of ex-president's daughter</P>
      <P>The situation in which the children of former President Chen Shui-bian are
repeatedly summoned for questioning by prosecutors as part of the investigation
into Chen's corruption case is to a certain extent inconsistent with humane and
legal traditions.</P>
      <P>U.S. law allows a defendant's spouse to refuse to testify against the defendant,
while the continental legal system expands this exemption to cover close
relatives.</P>
      <P>The case does not only involve the deprivation of Chen's rights as a defendant,
but also highlights the uncivilized nature of the judicial system under which
children are compelled to testify against their parents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government has plans to deal with unemployment: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that the government has come up with
several job creation programs to tackle the high unemployment rate recorded in
May.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks at a meeting of a local industrial and commerce association
the day after the government's statistics agency reported that Taiwan's
unemployment rate had surged to 5.82 percent in May, the highest level since the
government began compiling jobless figures in 1978.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed to the high unemployment figures in May to the number of new
graduates in the job market, and said that the data was in line with Council for
Economic Planning and Development's (CEPD's) projections.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has further projected that the unemployment rate will reach 6 percent
between June and September, he added.</P>
      <P>However, the unemployment situation will ease gradually as the government rolls
out its job matching plan for new university graduates and employers and many
other job creation programs, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with export orders picking up, the rate of decline in exports is
expected to continue to slow down, which in turn will prompt companies to expand
employment, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Liu's views, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming expressed
confidence that the rate of job losses will begin to abate between the end of
this year and early next year as the government phases in its four-year NT$500
billion major infrastructure projects from the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the job market has shown signs of improvement, as evidenced by the
fact that the number of employees placed on furlough in the country's export
zones has dropped from a peak of 26,000 in February to 2,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan must redefine China as its best market: economics minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said Tuesday that he sees China as
Taiwan's best market and Taiwan should therefore revise its perception of China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's best market opportunities are on mainland China; why should it fear
being tagged with the 'one China' label?" Yiin said in akeynote speech at the
ROC Council for Industrial and Commercial Development.</P>
      <P>In his speech, which focused on the prospects for the Taiwan economy in light of
the global changes, Yiin said the drivers of the global economy are weaker,
referring to developed countries such as Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Global Insight has forecast the global economy would contract by 2.6 percent in
2009, and that the U.S. and the Euro zone would see shrinkage in their economic
development this year as a result of the global financial storm, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>The less-developed Asian region would maintain its economic growth, due largely
to the economic rise of China, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the Global Insight economic forecast, China's gross domestic
product (GDP) will grow 6.9 percent in 2009, which is expected to lift the
global economy by some 0.5 percentage points, he said.</P>
      <P>China was listed as the world's third largest economic entity, but is actually
the second largest under the Purchasing Power Parity calculation system, he
noted.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan must redefine its position in relation to China, " he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, he noted, the Taiwan government's cross-strait focus is to open the
door to Chinese investments and to promote an Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The revision to the regulations to allow investments from China is expected to
take effect June 30, and from July 1 Taiwan will begin the work of trying to
attract Chinese capital, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>He added that the planned ECFA will cover three areas -- tariff-free exports,
the liberalization of the services sector, and an investment guarantee accord.
Under an early implementation agreement, some 1,000 product categories will be
included in the urgent tariff-free aspect of the trade pact, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>As for the other parts of the ECFA, it doesn't matter if it takes 10 years to
talk about them," he added.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been pushing for a trade pact with China in an effort
to avoid Taiwan's marginalization in East Asia, as a free trade agreement among
China and the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) is set to take effect next January.</P>
      <P>However, the ECFA proposal has been strongly opposed by the pro-independence
opposition parties, which have argued that it will compromise Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices opened low and closed lower to fall below the 6,200 mark
Tuesday, with the weighted index, the market's key barometer, losing 143.74
points, or 2.26 percent, to close at 6,197.47.</P>
      <P>Following a 200-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average overnight,  the
local bourse opened low at 6,206.31 following government data showing that
Taiwan's unemployment rate surged to a record high of 5.82 percent in May. It
later rebounded to 6,262.29 and dropped to the day's low of 6,197.47.</P>
      <P>A total of 3.41 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$91.56
billion (US$2.78 billion).</P>
      <P>All the eight major stock categories lost ground, with cement stocks moving down
the most at 3.5 percent. Plastics and chemicals shares shed 3.4 percent, textile
issues dropped 3.0 percent, banking and financial stocks lost 2.5 percent,
construction shares fell 2.1 percent, machinery and electronics issues dropped
1.9 percent, foodstuff shares lost 1.1 percent, and paper and pulp issues shed
1.0 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,531 to 501,  with 133 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth NT$12.89 billion.</P>
      <P>Despite a lackluster performance on the Dow Jones industrial average, there were
500 stocks moving up in the local bourse, with 20 of which even rising by their
7 percent daily maximum limit.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chen-chia, an analyst at the Cathay Securities Investment Trust Co.,
predicted that although there is little room for the Taiex to rise further in
the short term, the market would likely hover between 6,400 and 6,500 in July if
the trade volume increases to more than NT$110 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Interior ministry reviewing special municipality applications</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
06/23/09  19:45:05
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite robust competition among local governments for their cities or counties
to be upgraded to special municipalities, Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu said
Tuesday that one each should be established in northern, central and southern
Taiwan so as to achieve balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks after stating reasons why Taichung City and Taichung County
in central Taiwan should be merged into a special municipality, in a meeting of
a panel convened by Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi to review seven
similar applications from 11 local governments.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, Taoyuan County Magistrate Eric Chu,
Taitung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-
yuan, Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-
wen, Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih,
Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu and Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing
all presented their cases at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu said he is confident that the Taichung City and Taichung County application
would be approved, but added that it would give a boost to the country's overall
competitiveness if a municipality is formed in each of the three major regions.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside rampant rumors that it has been predetermined that Taichung City
and Taichung County will be merged into a special municipality, Hu said that
those allegations are unfair. He pointed out that one of President Ma Ying-
jeou's campaign promises was to establish "three municipalities and 15 counties"
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is concerned about the fact that most local governments seeking
an upgrade are eyeing bigger budgets and improved finances, Hu said that is an
issue that President Ma and the central government should examine, as many
localities have problems of revenue shortfalls.</P>
      <P>Special municipalities fall under the direct jurisdiction of the central
government and are entitled to have bigger budgets than other local governments.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, Liao said the panel's decisions would turn a new page in
Taiwan's development. The critical issue is how to boost  Taiwan's
international  competitiveness  through  the restructuring  of central
government functions and rezoning of administrative areas, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu said the proposed merger with
Kaohsiung  County is designed  to address  urgent development needs in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan not only has to compete with Japan and South Korea, but also faces
competition from China, particularly from southern China, Chen said. It is
therefore very important to sharpen the competitive edge of the greater
Kaohsiung area in southern Taiwan and strike a balance in development between
the north and south, she said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang said an upgrade of the Kaohsiung
area is urgently necessary and that 78 percent of the county's residents support
such a plan.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County complement each other, and a merger, backed
by an additional budget of NT$13 billion (US$393 million) , will definitely
boost regional competitiveness on a wide range of fronts, he said.</P>
      <P>However, if the Taichung area is merged first, Kaohsiung would be marginalized,
he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the agricultural counties of Yunlin and Chiayi are also seeking to
merge to facilitate development into an "agricultural municipality" that would
mean greater economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County has a population of over 720,000, while Chiayi County's is about
540,000. If they are merged,  the combined population will be some 1.26 million
people, which is in excess of the minimum 1 million specified for a special
municipality, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expecting another breakthrough in its efforts to seek visa waiver
privileges from foreign countries, with evidence indicating that Ireland is soon
to announce visa-free entry for Taiwanese nationals, according to a senior
Taiwanese official familiar with the issue who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official told CNA that Ireland is set to grant 90-day visa-free privileges
to Taiwanese passport holders as soon as next week, adding that a formal
announcement will be made in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the matter, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Henry Chen said the
ministry is working hard on the issue.</P>
      <P>"Things are moving in a positive direction with regard to the matter," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government allows Republic of Ireland passport holders
30-day visa-free stays, which, on the principle of reciprocity, is expected to
be extended to 90 days if Ireland decides to grant 90-day visa-free stays for
Taiwanese visitors.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom, which started including Taiwan in its visa-waiver program
March 3, became the first major Western country to lift visa requirements for
Taiwanese citizens and has since spurred debate in other countries such as
Germany on the possibility of making similar moves.</P>
      <P>So far, the British visa-free treatment is the most favorable, allowing
Taiwanese passport holders traveling to Britain for the purpose of tourism,
business, short-term study or family visits visa-free status for up to six
months.</P>
      <P>According  to the Irish  government,  the number  of visa applications by
Taiwanese passport holders is around 1,200 per year.</P>
      <P>The fees for Irish visas are NT$2,700 (US$82) for a single-entry visa valid for
three months or NT$4,500 for a multiple-entry visa valid for a year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Progress reported in negotiations with U.S. on extradition pact</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  23 (CNA)
06/23/09  19:52:39
(By Jorge Liu and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Progress has been made in Taiwan's negotiations with the United States on the
possibility of a bilateral extradition arrangement, Taiwan's representative to
Washington, Jason Yuan, said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Yuan, the U.S. administration took Taiwan's request for such a pact
seriously and responded with "good intentions."</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that the U.S. executive branch is unable to clinch a treaty
with Taiwan because of the lack of official ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In order to sidestep this obstacle, Yuan said, the U.S. administration has
joined hands with Taiwan to persuade Congress to come up with a bill that would
have the same effect as an extradition agreement.</P>
      <P>"It is a sign of the smooth communications  between  our representative office
and the U.S. administration, " Yuan went on, adding that Taipei used to have
difficulty even conveying its requests to the U.S. executive branch, far less
working with it.</P>
      <P>Although there are positive signs in the negotiations, there is red tape to
circumvent and Congress has many other bills pending enactment, Yuan continued.</P>
      <P>Just as Taiwan's requests for visa exemption privileges for its people when
visiting the United States, a bill with the effect as an extradition pact will
need time and patience, he said.</P>
      <P>"I do not want to mislead our people into believing that this could be achieved
any time soon," Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Owing to the lack of an extradition arrangement, many of Taiwan's most high-
profile fugitives are taking refuge in the United States, to the great chagrin
of the Taiwanese authorities, who are powerless to bring them to justice.</P>
      <P>Notable among these are Huang Fang-yen, who is alleged to have helped former
President Chen Shui-bian launder his money, as well as Ching Chi-ju, who is
reported to have duped the Foreign Ministry out of US$30 million, and Wang You-
theng who stands accused in Taiwan of bilking billions of dollars from a
business group he founded.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-hao, another business tycoon who is wanted for fraud in Taiwan,
embarrassed former President Chen Shui-bian during his run for re-election in
2004 by claiming at a news conference in California that he was one of Chen's
political contributors.</P>

      <P>The ambassadors for Taiwan's campaign to get Yushan or Jade Mountain chosen as
one of the world's natural wonders launched an around-the-island cycling tour
Tuesday as part of their efforts to promote the bid.</P>
      <P>During the 15 days leading up to the July 7 deadline for the second stage of
global online voting, the ambassadors will call on opinion leaders in the
business, religious, arts and cultural, and political sectors around Taiwan to
encourage them to take part in the vote and offer their support for Yushan,
according to the Yushan National Park Headquarters.</P>
      <P>The ambassadors  will  also visit  local  communities  and universities and
invite people they encounter to draw a picture or write an article based on
their impressions of Yushan, said Chen Lung-sheng, head of the park
headquarters.</P>
      <P>"Through thinking and perception covering different dimensions, we will be able
to highlight the uniqueness of Yushan and inspire more people to join the vote,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Coinciding with the cycling tour, a "vote wagon" is being sent around to allow
the public to cast their votes using the computer systems installed on the
vehicle, he said.</P>
      <P>The 3,952-meter mountain, the highest in Northeast Asia, has so far maintained
the top position in the "mountain, volcanoes" category in the second round of
voting for the world's new seven natural wonders being held by the Swiss-based
New7Wonders Foundation at www.new7wonders.com.</P>
      <P>Located on the boundaries of Chiayi, Nantou and Kaohsiung counties, Yushan is
known for its diverse wildlife and ecology. It is the only natural attraction
from Taiwan to make the list of contenders in any category.</P>
      <P>As of June 22, Africa's Kalahari Desert had taken the top position in the
"landscape, ice formations" category; Ecuador's Galapagos Islands in the
"islands" category; Serbia's Djavolja Varos in the "caves, rock formations,
valleys" category; South America's Amazon Rainforest in the "forest, national
parks, nature reserves" category; South America's Lake Titicaca in the "lakes,
rivers, waterfalls" category; and Vietnam's Ha Long Bay in the "seascape"
category.</P>
      <P>The top 11 sites chosen in each of the seven categories by July 7 will then be
reviewed by a panel of experts headed by Federico Mayor Zaragoza, former UNESCO
director-general, who will select three nominees in each category.</P>
      <P>The 21 nominees will be put to a final round of worldwide online voting in 2010
and 2011 to select the top seven natural wonders.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural and fishery exports in 2008 soared despite the global
recession, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said Tuesday at the opening of the
2009 Taipei International Food Show.</P>
      <P>While the global economy was suffering a downturn last year, Taiwan's farm and
seafood product exports still posted a 12.1 percent year-on-year growth to
NT$3.85 billion last year, Chiu said at the Nangang Exhibition Hall in Taipei,
where the food show is being held.</P>
      <P>Rice exports posted the largest growth among all exports of Taiwan's
agricultural and fishery products, up 10,647 percent year-on -year, followed by
groupers, up 1,221 percent; carrots, up 565 percent; Taiwan tilapia, up 30
percent; and vegetable soybeans, up 15.2 percent, Chiu said, citing statistics.</P>
      <P>Chiu was making a speech during the opening ceremony of the food show, where the
Taiwan Pavilion has been taking center stage.</P>
      <P>To showcase the freshness, safety and high quality of Taiwan's farm produce and
fishery products, the Council of Agriculture (COA) has been taking part in the
show by setting up the Taiwan Pavilion, which covers an area of 1,755 square
meters and brings together 83 local exhibitors, according to COA Minister Chen
Wu-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Pavilion comprises six sections, namely the Theme Section, Crop
Products Section, Fishery Products Section, Livestock Products Section,
Processed Food Section and Forest Products Section, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The pavilion displays a wide variety of agricultural products such as rice,
vegetables, mushrooms and processed food as well as fishery and livestock
products that got certificates of the Certified Agriculture Standard (CAS),
Critical Control Points (HACCP), or International Organization for
Standardization (IOS).</P>
      <P>A total of 826 exhibitors from 19 countries are taking part at the international
food show, which opened Tuesday and will run until June 26. The exhibits cover
an area of 14,690 square meters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>National park to stock endangered salmon parr in historic habitats</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)

      <P>The Shei-Pa National Park Headquarters will hold a public activity June 26-27 in
which captive-bred Formosan landlocked salmon parr will be released into the
highly endangered fish's natural habitat.</P>
      <P>The public are welcome to attend the "taking young salmon home" activity, an
event that has taken place for the last two consecutive years, Liao Wu-yen,
director of the park headquarters' Wuling Station, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao said that 350 salmon parr -- juvenile salmon aged more than one year --
will be released in the Luoyehwei section of the Yousheng Creek, the Yikawan
section of the Dajia River and in the Sijielan Creek.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope the releases will allow people to spot the national
treasure in the rivers once again, and that the young fish will survive through
the summer typhoons. He noted in the past two years, only 1 percent of the
released parr are thought to have survived the annual typhoon season.</P>
      <P>The conservation measures are aimed at expanding the fishes breeding territory
in the wild. According to Liao, the number of Formosan landlocked salmon in the
wild is around 3,500, all of which live in the Cijiawan Creek in Wuling.</P>
      <P>The creek provides a stable environment for the delicate fish, Liao went on,
adding that the park authorities still want to establish wild breeding colonies
in other suitable areas.</P>
      <P>Formosan landlocked salmon were originally migratory fish that lived in the
frigid-temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere. During the breeding season,
they would swim upstream from the ocean to the upper reaches of the river where
they were born, where they would mate and spawn. After the eggs hatched, the
juvenile fish would return to the ocean, where they would grow to maturity
before returning to the river of their birth to repeat the cycle.</P>
      <P>Having evolved over many thousands of years to survive year-round in the fresh
water of Taiwan's remote river systems without migrating to the sea, the species
is now only found in Taiwan and was listed in 1984 as a precious natural
resource.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou received Richard C. Koo, the chief economist of Japan's
Nomura Research Institute, at the Presidential Office Tuesday, to take
professional guidance in efforts to lead Taiwan out of its recession.</P>
      <P>Koo, son of former senior adviser to the president, Koo Kuan-min, was invited by
a group of heavyweight Taiwanese business tycoons, including Chinatrust
Commercial Bank Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Koo, to visit Taiwan. He is Jeffrey
Koo's cousin.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, the economist renowned in both the United States and Japan told
Ma that the global recession triggered by the financial storm that occurred in
the U.S. last September has rarely happened in the global economic mechanism.</P>
      <P>The financial problems caused by the credit crisis have led to companies
devoting most of their resources to paying off their debts, even at a time when
interest rates are near zero. As more money is deposited in banks, it can no
longer flow through the market, the economist said, pointing out that the
situation stems the movement of funds, which further affects an economy's
economic growth.</P>
      <P>He called this phenomenon a "balance-sheet recession" and said he believes it is
behind the recession stagnation that has been hounding Japan for more than a
decade.</P>
      <P>To resolve the problem, he suggested that the government should launch long-term
investment projects to increase the flow of funds in and out of the market and
try to maintain the gross domestic production level.</P>
      <P>"This process takes a very long time, so the government should be patient," he
told Ma.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's planned visit to several countries in Central America
will be extended by one day, an aide to the president said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that Ma can meet with Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya
Rosales, he will arrive in that country July 4 rather than July 3 as initially
scheduled.</P>
      <P>The change was made to account for any possible delay in Zelaya's return to the
Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa from an overseas visit of his own, the anonymous
aide said.</P>
      <P>Although Zelaya had promised that he will return to Tegucigalpa before July 3,
Ma would prefer to delay his visit by one day to be on the safe side, the aide
said.</P>
      <P>As a result, Ma will stay in Panama July 1-3 -- one day longer than scheduled
originally -- and the date of his return to Taipei will therefore be postponed
by one day to July 8.</P>
      <P>Ma is set to depart June 29 for the visit to three of Taiwan's Central America
allies -- Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the trip is to attend the July 1 inauguration of Panamanian
President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in Panama City.</P>
      <P>Ma will be accompanied by first lady Chow Mei-ling, along with a 129-strong

      <P>Just days after tropical storm Linfa swept through the Taiwan Strait, another
storm is poised to approach Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) forecast
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tropical storm Nangka, the Malaysian name for jackfruit, formed over the
Philippines Tuesday. The weather bureau predicted that Nangka's outer rim will
affect Taiwan from Friday at the earliest.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, Nangka was located 1,000-plus
kilometers south of Taiwan, moving in a westerly direction toward the South
China Sea at a speed of 23 kph.</P>
      <P>The storm system is expected to turn north toward Taiwan after it reaches the
South China Sea area, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they forecast hot weather to persist Wednesday and Thursday, with
temperatures expected to reach 33 degrees Celsius in eastern and southeastern
Taiwan, 32 degrees in the north and south and 31 degrees in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Temperatures will be a little cooler for Taiwan's outlying islands, ranging
between 25-31 degrees, the weather bureau predicted.</P>
      <P>Matsu Island and the western and northeastern parts of Taiwan proper  are
expected  to  experience  occasional  showers  or thundershowers over the next
several days, they predicted.</P>
      <P>Linfa, this year's third tropical storm to form in the West Pacific region,
triggered heavy rainfall in central and southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The winner of the biggest undivided jackpot in Taiwan Super Lotto history has
donated nearly a quarter of his winnings to charity but also took some cash for
himself to get a taste of how the super wealthy live.</P>
      <P>The jackpot winner, whose name was not disclosed, donated NT$210 million of his
NT$937 million (US$28.5 million) haul to charity organizations last week,
lottery operator Taiwan Lottery Co. said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The winner, who has long devoted himself to social welfare, also decided to
experience the life of the super rich, withdrawing NT$2 million in cash "to use
the bills as a pillow."</P>
      <P>The company disclosed that the winner lives in Tainan County and usually buys
NT$100 to NT$300 worth of lottery tickets at a Tainan City lottery shop, which
has now sold five jackpot winning tickets.</P>
      <P>The winner said he usually picks numbers based on the birthdays of family
members, but this time he bought 12 tickets with numbers he picked and one
ticket with numbers selected randomly by a computer. The computer-generated
numbers turned out to be the winning ticket.</P>
      <P>After taxes, the jackpot amounted to NT$750 million, and NT$210 million of that
was distributed among 13 organizations, including the nonprofit Genesis Social
Welfare Foundation and the Tainan County government, Taiwan Lottery announced.</P>
      <P>The foundation said it had received NT$80 million, the largest single gift it
had been given in its history.</P>
      <P>Local media reported that the newly minted multimillionaire called the lottery
shop where he bought the winning ticket and declared then that he would donate
NT$200 million to charity, but the winner said he did not make such a call,
according to the lottery operator.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On the bickering over funding for World Games</P>
      <P>The long-time grievance between the pan-blues and pan-greens probably underlies
the recent bickering between the Kaohsiung City government and the Sports
Affairs Council over the funding of the World Games 2009, slated for July in the
port city.</P>
      <P>It is not easy for Taiwan,  which is excluded from most international
organizations, to win the right to host the games. We should stand united and
seize this opportunity to demonstrate Taiwan's civility, beauty and progress to
the world, rather than pointing our fingers at each other.</P>
      <P>The World Games, together with the 2009 Deaflympics to take place in September
in Taipei, provides the opportunity for Taiwan to try to break through regional,
political and psychological barriers. Let's come to a political truce in July
and make the World Games a glue that binds Taiwan together.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On the Ma administration's China policy</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said recently in the United
States that China and Taiwan have dealt with many bilateral political issues
over the past year, pointing to Taiwan's participation in the World Health
Assembly as an observer in May as an example. The remarks proved that President
Ma Ying-jeou was lying when he said the current interactions between the two
sides are non-political and do not involve the sovereignty issue.</P>
      <P>Wang was attempting to pass the message to the international community that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait have begun to discuss political issues and that
Taiwan has also accepted China as its "suzerain." Obviously, Ma is serious about
his "no independence" policy, but his "no unification" policy is fake.</P>
      <P>Ma's "no independence" policy is the same in substance as China's "anti-
independence" policy. They are both intended to topple Taiwan's status quo as an
independent country. While being insincere to the Taiwanese people, Ma is
faithfully carrying out China's scheme to annex Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: On the status upgrades for selected localities</P>
      <P>The recent decision by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou to upgrade
the status of several more localities to the level of special municipalities
under the direct control of the central  government  reflects  the  outdated
notion  of state centralization. We have never heard of any serious discussions
on whether the upgrades are favorable to regional development, land use
planning, the regional economies, administrative efficiency and the life of
local residents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the fact that Taipei County is allowed to be upgraded independently
without being first merged with Taipei City is the most suspicious part of the
decision. It is a blatantly political move aimed at postponing the election for
Taipei County magistrate so as to block a possible bid by opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) Su Tseng-chang, who would pose a strong challenge to
ruling Kuomintang incumbent, Chou Hsi-wei.</P>
      <P>China Times: On the DPP's accusation against China Times</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen has recently accused the China Times of damaging the
party's image by deliberately sensationalizing its reports about the fierce
competition among party heavyweights for the next chairmanship. Such unfounded
accusation is regrettable and incomprehensible.</P>
      <P>Isn't the DPP chairmanship race an issue open to public comment? Does the China
Times have to be stigmatized just because it differs with Tsai on how to rescue
her party, which is overshadowed by the corruption scandal involving former
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Tsai's professional background distinguishes her from other politicians. Thanks
to the expectations for her to become a leader who would draw neutral voters
closer to the DPP and lead the party on a different path, she was able to take
over the party helm smoothly after the DPP's defeat in the 2008 presidential
election. But Tsai is now taking steps backwards.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu said Wednesday that it is "simply natural" for her
to seek re-election after her southern port city received the green light a day
earlier to be merged with Kaohsiung County into a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with cable network SET TV, Chen said the merger
represents the beginning of new and greater responsibilities.</P>
      <P>"I will strive to win Kaohsiung residents' support with the outstanding
performance of my administrative team and will definitely come up with a
blueprint for the development of the Greater Kaohsiung area soon," she said.</P>
      <P>An ad hoc panel organized by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) approved Tuesday
the upgrading of Taipei County, Taichung City and Taichung County, and Kaohsiung
City and Kaohsiung County into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The panel's decision must be approved by the Executive Yuan to be implemented.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei welcomed the panel's decision
to allow Taipei County to be upgraded into a special municipality without having
to merge with Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Noting that the changed status implies greater responsibility and pressure, Chou
said he will help build the upgraded Taipei County -- to be renamed "New Taipei
City, " -- into a modern, civilized and international metropolis where
residents' quality of life will be significantly upgraded.</P>
      <P>If the MOI panel's decision is approved by the Executive Yuan, incumbent
Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei and
Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu will have their tenures prolonged for another year
until the heads of the newly formed special municipalities are elected in late
2010.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi said Wednesday that since the election
of the head of the new Taichung  special municipality will not be held until
next year, Hu will take his time in considering whether he will enter the race.</P>
      <P>"The decision will not be made until next year, " Hsiao quoted Hu as saying.</P>
      <P>A total of 11 counties and cities had applied to be upgraded to seven
municipalities.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the MOI panel rejected applications submitted by Taoyuan County,
Changhua County, Yunlin County and Chiayi County, and failed to reach a
unanimous decision on whether Tainan City and Tainan County  should  be merged
and upgraded  to a special municipality.</P>
      <P>The MOI said the Tainan issue will be referred to the Executive Yuan for a
decision.</P>
      <P>The panel's decisions were made by its members by consensus after a 15-hour
meeting and were announced by Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi at a news
conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No timetable for fully opening market to U.S. beef: health minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no timetable for fully opening Taiwan's market to U.S. beef, Department
of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Wednesday, although he noted that
the government is considering how best to open the doors.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks in response to media inquiries after Jason Yuan, Taiwan's
representative to the United States, confirmed the previous day that a
delegation from the U.S. Trade Representative office had talked with Taiwanese
officials on the issue during a recent visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two sides "engaged in delightful talks, " Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Harry Tseng, head of the Department of North American Affairs under
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also expressed optimism over the timeline for
market opening.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE, or mad cow disease) was diagnosed in Seattle. The ban was lifted in April
2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle aged under 30 months,
but the government reimposed the ban two months later when a second BSE case was
discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, limited to boneless
beef from cattle younger than 30 months of age, produced from certified
slaughterhouses and without high-risk items such as brains and spinal cords.</P>
      <P>Asked about the risk of consuming U.S. beef, Yeh admitted that the average
lifetime risk of contracting BSE through eating boneless beef is one in 7.18
trillion -- equivalent to the risk of being hit by lightning twice in a row.</P>
      <P>However, Yeh said that despite the trivial risk, some people are still hesitant
to eat beef out of health concerns.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, U.S. beef imports have been increased year-on-year.
At present, the U.S. supplies 32 percent of Taiwan's beef, with the rest coming
mainly from New Zealand and Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ireland will grant visa-free treatment to Taiwanese from July</HEADLINE>

      <P>Ireland will become the second European country after Britain to grant visa-free
treatment to visitors from Taiwan, beginning next month, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>From July 1, Taiwanese visiting Ireland for non-work purposes, including
tourism, business and visits to relatives and friends, will be able to enter
Ireland without a visa for a maximum stay of 90 days, the MOFA said in a press
release.</P>
      <P>This will make Ireland the second European country to offer the visa-exemption
privilege to Taiwan's passport holders,  sparing Taiwanese citizens NT$2,700
(US$82) for a single-entry visa and NT$4,500 for a multi-entry visa to that
country.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom offered visa-free treatment to Taiwanese starting in March
this year, allowing stays of up to six months, the MOFA noted.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry is hopeful that the measure will help lure more Taiwanese
to Ireland, which has not been a popular destination among local residents
because of the difficulty of getting a visa and the high cost of living there.</P>
      <P>Currently, some 200 Taiwanese students are studying in Ireland, and about 1,000
Taiwanese tourists visit that country per year, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Apart from Ireland and Britain, Taiwanese citizens also enjoy visa-free entry in
30 other countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the MOFA announced that a 30-day visa-free privilege for
visitors from Ireland to Taiwan will also be extended to 90 days, effective from
July 1, in efforts to bolster two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government began allowing Republic of Ireland passport holders 30-day
visa-free stays from April 1, 2003.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei-based Thailand Trade and Economic Office announced
Wednesday that it will continue to issue travel visas to Taiwanese tourists free
of charge until March 4, 2010.</P>
      <P>The Thai representative office began the free visa service in March in a bid to
attract more Taiwanese visitors to Thailand, which has been hard hit by the
global economic recession since late last year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices opened low but closed higher Wednesday,  with the weighted
index,  the market's key barometer, advancing 182.61 points, or 2.94 percent, to
close at 6,380.08.</P>
      <P>Rebounding from losses sustained the previous day, the local bourse opened at
6,230.76 and fluctuated between 6,511.97 and 6,191.63.</P>
      <P>A total of 5.01 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$127.98
billion (US$3.89 billion).</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories gained ground, with banking and financial
shares moving up the most at 6.4 percent. Cement stocks rose 5.1 percent,
textile stocks advanced 3.3 percent, construction issues were up 2.9 percent,

      <P>Meanwhile, shares in several finance, insurance and securities firms advanced by
the maximum daily limit of 7 percent and shares in some plastics and chemicals,
textile and cement firms also increased significantly, which the analysts said
was caused by the announcement by Fan Liqing, chairwoman of the Taiwan Affairs

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese research team has made a breakthrough in the development of DNA-
based vaccine patches that can replace invasive injections as a vaccine delivery
method, an academic source said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The research team leader, Wu Chang-jer, an associate professor at National
Taiwan Ocean University, said the DNA-based vaccine patch uses the skin's
liposomes as a transport vehicle to deliver vaccine into the body via a non-
invasive method.</P>
      <P>"It opens a new pathway in global vaccine applications -- in the future,
vaccinations against major epidemic diseases could be done via a small patch,
instead of injections using needles or via gene guns," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Although the cost of producing a DNA-based vaccine patch is about the same as a
regular dose of DNA-based vaccine, the patches are easier to apply, free from
the risk of needle contamination and more comfortable for the inoculation
receivers, he noted.</P>
      <P>The DNA vaccine patches, if approved for use on humans, could be used to deliver
vaccines against Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis C, dengue fever and even SARS
or influenza A(H1N1), Wu said.</P>
      <P>The research -- which also received contributions from Tseng Wen-chi, an
associate professor at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, and
Lee Tzung-lin, an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica's Genomics
Research Center -- was published May 4 in the international periodical Journal
of Controlled Release, marking the first research report in the world on DNA-
based vaccine patches, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>The newly developed patches have been referred to agencies in Taiwan as well as
in major countries around the world for patent rights, he went on.</P>
      <P>He said the patches will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and the
Food and Drug Administration as a new drug awaiting human trial, but forecast
that it will take at least 10 years before the patches can be used on humans.</P>
      <P>Wu quoted the Rabobank Group, a global financial services provider specializing
in food and agribusiness financing, as having reported that the vaccination
market is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.</P>
      <P>Global human vaccines commanded a market of US$10 billion in 2006, a figure that
it is estimated will have ballooned to US$30 billion by 2015, Wu quoted the
Rabobank as indicating.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>At a time when the prevalence of random violence by adolescents in today's
society has sparked editorial pieces in local newspapers bemoaning "the loss of
good morals, " the results of a survey released Wednesday give the lie to these
opinions and might come as a comfort to many.</P>
      <P>The survey results,  published by the Champions  Education Association, show
that most of the adolescents surveyed -- all of whom have received counselling
for one reason or another -- have a strong moral sense, which is evident from
their disapproval of behavior such as cheating and stealing.</P>
      <P>According to the results, 73 percent of the respondents would confront their
classmates directly or report them to their teachers if they discovered them
cheating in examinations.</P>
      <P>In the event of stealing by their classmates, the ratio of respondents who said
they would take similar action increased to 79 percent.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 80 percent and 83 percent of respondents said they would feel
guilty if they stole or cheated in examinations, respectively, while more than
75 percent said they would feel frightened or nervous.</P>
      <P>However, 5 percent said they would feel happy or ambivalent about the issues.</P>
      <P>The survey on adolescents' perceptions, feelings and responses to ethical
dilemmas was conducted by Lin Jyh-sheng, an assistant professor of education at
National Taiwan Ocean University, among 9,520 students from 48 junior high
schools around Taiwan. The students were drawn from a group of 59,430 students
who received counseling provided by the Champions Education Associations during
the first semester of the 2008-2009 academic year.</P>
      <P>The survey coincides with a high-profile public education program launched
recently by the Ministry of Education to promote good morals among the country's
citizens.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, for moral education to be effective, it is important for such
education to be integrated into daily life.</P>
      <P>In school, students should be guided to discuss and consider various
hypothetical situations to help them build their own moral values "so that good
morals are not reduced to mere slogans, " Lin said.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming on Wednesday touted the importance
of building globally popular Taiwanese brands, stressing that creating the
country's own brands is the key to Taiwan's sustainable growth in the world
marketplace.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the 2009 Taiwan International Branding Forum hosted
by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), Yiin
said Taiwan must make all-out efforts to build its own distinguished brands as a
way to tap the key to global industrial development.</P>
      <P>To serve that end, Yiin said, his ministry is driving a brand- building program
to help local brands go international, train qualified professionals and assist
enterprises to become global companies.</P>
      <P>In the past few decades, Taiwan has enjoyed economic success by focusing on
manufacturing for top brands through the OEM (original equipment manufacturing)
or ODM (original design manufacturing) models.</P>
      <P>But Yiin said local businesses should quickly turn to branding efforts to pursue
greater profits and survive.</P>
      <P>That is because developing countries such as China are quickly catching up to
Taiwan in terms of being able to manufacture for others cheaply and efficiently.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang echoed Yiin's views.</P>
      <P>"Only innovation and customized-design can create added value to products and
achieve sustainable growth through branding as Taiwan has lost its niche in
manufacturing," Wang told the forum.</P>
      <P>Currently, few Taiwanese brands are recognizable worldwide, other than a
handful, such as Acer and Asus. But if Taiwan were to have more globally well-
known brands, its companies could make more profits as profit margins tend to be
higher for brand owners than product or parts manufacturers.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Taiwanese companies have already begun making efforts in brand
promotion.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey, Wang said the value of Taiwan's top 10 brands
amounted to US$7.5 billion in 2008, up by 11.8 percent over the 2007 level. The
2008 value represented an increase of 111.5 percent compared to the figure
recorded in 2003, when the annual survey was launched for the first time, he
noted.</P>

      <P>The average age of local HIV carriers is getting ever-younger, with the
incidence rate rising fastest among male teens,  the non-profit  Taiwan AIDS
Foundation  cautioned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health, the foundation said the number of student
HIV carriers increased by 110 in 2007 and rose further by 156 in 2008.</P>

      <P>In the past, Lin said, 70 percent of HIV carriers were aged between 20 and 40.
The trend, however, has gradually changed in recent years, with more and more of
those in the 15-19 age group infected with the virus that causes AIDS.</P>
      <P>"This is a general world trend, as the AIDS prevention publicity campaign has
failed to catch up with the tendency that the average age of youngsters having
sex for the first time has dropped to 16, " Lin explained.</P>
      <P>He urged public health and education authorities to step up publicity efforts to
raise local teens' awareness of the risk of AIDS and the importance of safe sex.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the foundation's online surveys, 95 percent of
Internet respondents said they would be willing to take HIV tests, with
hospitals and public health centers their most favored places for such tests. In
addition, 20 percent said it would be acceptable for regular health checkups to
include HIV tests.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that 39 people tested HIV-positive at blood donation centers around
the country in the five months of this year.</P>
      <P>"The figure is relatively high, as the number of people who tested HIV-positive
at blood donation centers was 67 for the whole of last year, " Lin said, adding
that more efforts should be made to educate people not to misuse blood donation
as a method of free HIV testing.</P>
      <P>He also urged those who indulge in high-risk sexual activity or who have shared
syringes when abusing drugs to get tested for HIV within three months of taking
part in such activities.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan AIDS Foundation was established in 2005 to assist the government in
various programs for AIDS prevention and control, as well as to promote
international cooperation in combating AIDS.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will take steps to remodel the image of the
country's prisons as stereotypical dark, cold places of confinement and will go
even further to turn them into tourist attractions, Justice Minister Wang Ching-
feng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Penghu Prison on the Penghu archipelago in the Taiwan
Strait, Wang promised to lead an effort to modernize the country's prisons.</P>
      <P>She was at the prison for the closing ceremony of a drug rehabilitation program
for inmates, which included a skit, choir and Chi Gung performances, and an
exhibition of various art works by the prisoners.</P>
      <P>Addressing inmates who were soon to be released, Wang said she hopes they will
have a brand new start in life.</P>
      <P>The normally  heavily guarded  prison was opened to local officials, the media
and the public Wednesday in support of the MOJ's idea of turning Taiwan's jails
into tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Wang told the visitors that the MOJ will try to create a new image of the 24
jails around the country and will call them "cultural prisons" -- places of
hope.</P>
      <P>In addition, the people confined in such places should be referred to as
"students" instead of "inmates," she said.</P>
      <P>The visitors, led by Wang and the chief warden Chan Che-feng, toured the Penghu
Prison and looked at the farm work being done by the inmates.</P>
      <P>At one point, Wang tried on a pair of leg irons, which she said were very heavy
and uncomfortable.</P>
      <P>"I will never be bad," she said with a smile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cute clownfish could be rising star of Taiwan's aquaculture sector</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/24/09  20:50:32</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For thousands of years, clownfish lived undisturbed by man in coral reefs. But
when the 2003 Hollywood animated blockbuster "Finding Nemo" cast the world's
attention on the previously obscure species, the newfound stardom threatened the
clownfish's survival.</P>
      <P>Reef aquarium owners around the globe were suddenly desperate to add the bright
orange saltwater fish with the white stripe to their collection, just as Nemo
was added to a fish tank in a dentist's office in Australia.</P>
      <P>Wild clownfish were overharvested to satisfy surging demand, sending their
numbers plummeting.</P>
      <P>Even captive breeding programs, which some hope could replenish enough clownfish
to prevent their demise in the wild, have been woefully inadequate in curtailing
the species' dwindling numbers and damage done to its natural habitat.</P>
      <P>That may soon change,  however,  as a Taiwanese saltwater ornamental fish
research team has unlocked some of the mysteries surrounding the breeding
process and hopes that through the diffusion of the technology, the clownfish
trade will emerge as another success story in Taiwan's aquaculture industry,
following in the footsteps of the advances made in raising shrimp and grouper.</P>
      <P>The research team estimates that by 2011, Taiwan could breed 2 million clownfish
and generate NT$100 million in the lucrative ornamental fish market, while
helping save the species in the wild.</P>
      <P>The team is led by Ho Yuan-hsing, an associate researcher with Fisheries
Research Institute of the Eastern Marine Biology Research Center in eastern
Taiwan's Taitung County, who has been actively engaged in fish breeding programs
for nearly two decades.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Ho published the world's first report on the artificial breeding of the
giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) , but later turned to research on
saltwater ornamental fish and edible fish like abalone because he wanted "to do
something more important and that has greater influence on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>His change in interest was largely motivated by pursuing an area that few had
treaded because he has always wanted to be a "trailblazer."</P>
      <P>The captive breeding of saltwater ornamental fishes has a high entry threshold
because of technology barriers and the difficulty of obtaining sea water, which
is why an overwhelming 98 percent of saltwater ornamental fishes are still
caught in the sea rather than artificially bred.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is ideally positioned, Ho says, to reverse the disturbing trend,
especially for clownfish. The country's warm weather and waters provide a
perfect habitat for the prized fish, and its large fish farming population
(127,000 in 2007) has traditionally excelled in the field.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has artificially bred the most fish species in the world," Ho says.</P>
      <P>The country  has also broken considerable  ground  in the development of live
bait as a food source for clownfish larvae, a critical advancement since finding
suitable food and mass producing it is essential to the artificial breeding
process.</P>
      <P>Ho's center inaugurated a clownfish fry production farm in November 2008, which
Ho estimated could produce 100,000 clownfish this year and potentially double
that in 2010.</P>
      <P>The center actually began researching clownfish in 2002, but the Fry Production
Model Farm only became a reality because Ho's team was finally able to master
several core technologies.</P>
      <P>For one, pairing the clownfish is not easy. Though clownfish are strictly
monogamous, that does not mean that "they will mate automatically if a male and
female are put together," Ho says.</P>
      <P>"We have to see to it that the two see eye to eye and will not attack each
other, especially because the fish is very fierce and protective of its own
territory and attacks any fish, even of its own species, that encroaches into
its territory," he adds.</P>
      <P>The farm now has 150 seed pairs, with half of them spawning.</P>
      <P>The center also controls the spawning, Ho says. In their natural habitat at sea,
clownfish lay from 500 to more than 1,000 fertilized eggs once per month, but
the center has been able to get the fish to spawn twice a month.</P>
      <P>After the eggs hatch, the next challenge is to prepare the right food for the
larvae, Ho says, a potentially difficult step because the larvae are only about
0.4 mm in size at birth.</P>
      <P>The center has solved the problem by providing live bait and also micro-
organisms, such as rotifers and copepods, to suit the needs of the larvae.
Pellet diet is only fed to the fry after they grow to 20-day-olds.</P>
      <P>Clownfish larvae are also more vulnerable to disease in the winter when the
water temperature is low, and the center will install a water heating system
this year to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>"Clownfish could be one of the easiest fish species to breed if you can master
those core technologies, " Ho says.</P>
      <P>Having mastered the process, the center plans to hand these technologies and the
planning and management of the farm model to 10 selected breeders next year, and
Ho estimates that the breeders will each be able to produce 200,000 clownfish
and generate NT$10 million in revenues annually.</P>
      <P>The many years of research by Ho's team also culminated in the opening of the
world's first aquarium devoted solely to clownfish adjacent to the center in
mid-May.</P>
      <P>Though it may be the smallest aquarium in Taiwan, it has nine exhibition areas
and displays nearly 1,500 clownfish from 18 species -- including eight from
foreign countries and five from local waters. Ho's center can now breed 13 out
of the 18 species.</P>
      <P>The Aquarium of Amenonefish will soon become the center's main remnant of its
basic clownfish breeding program as it recently has shifted its focus to raising
ornamental fish with added value, concentrating on two new approaches.</P>
      <P>One involves breeding "hybrid" species while the other emphasizes selecting
unique fish within the same species, such as those with more exotic or brighter
patterns, and trying to reproduce them after repeated trials.</P>
      <P>Ho cited as an example an Australian clownfish, which is black with two white
bands, but the two bands gradually approach each other and one day merge
together.</P>
      <P>Such a species, because of its rarity, could be highly prized and fetch 10 times
or more the value of a typical ornamental fish, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Andrew Fang, executive director of saltwater ornamental fish exporter Taikong
Co., said the center's research and breeding efforts of clownfish and other
saltwater ornamental fish has outstanding commercial potential and will help
protect the species in the wild.</P>
      <P>Saltwater ornamental fish, he says,  are more prized than freshwater species
because of their bright and beautiful color, but fish harvested from the wild
often succumb to weakness when kept in tanks, making them dicey commercial
propositions even if they are highly sought after.</P>
      <P>"Most aquariums actually sell mostly freshwater  ornamental fishes, because
saltwater ornamental fish only have a 20 percent chance of survival if they are
kept in water tanks," Fang said.</P>
      <P>When saltwater ornamental fish are caught, the netting used to trap them or the
drugs used to daze them often damage the fish or leave drug residues adhered to
their skin.</P>
      <P>Those dangers, coupled with the suspension of feeding during the transportation
process, results in the fish arriving at a private aquarium in a highly weakened
state.</P>
      <P>Fang estimates that the survival rate of ornamental fish in tanks may be less
than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>The breeding program, however, produces healthier fish that will be more than
competitive with those caught in the wild.</P>
      <P>"Captive breeding could solve the problem of keeping them alive in tanks," Fang
said.</P>
      <P>The trader strongly believes that the strong demand for clownfish and other
ornamental fish triggered by Finding Nemo will continue unabated but with an
environmental element added.</P>
      <P>"Products that meet environmental requirements -- conserving the species and not
damaging marine ecology simultaneously -- will remain in vogue," Fang believes.</P>
      <P>In Southeast Asia, where ornamental fish species are abundant, fishermen often
use drugs such as potassium cyanide to trap their targets, not only harming
their catch but also nearby fish and the surrounding marine ecology.</P>
      <P>Fang noted that the European Union, one of his three major export destinations
(the others are Japan and the United States), is very strict on the origin of
imports, and some EU countries will not accept ornamental fish caught in the
wild.</P>
      <P>"The captive bred fish could easily make inroads into their markets," he says.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan has the skills to artificially breed the clownfish and then mass
produce them at a consistent level of high quality, it will have a significant
competitive edge in the market, Fang believes.</P>
      <P>That may also allow many young clownfish like Nemo to thrive once again in the
wild and protect the coral reefs that serve as their natural habitats. /ls</P>

      <P>A new cruise recently marketed by local tour agencies that will take travelers
from Shanghai to Taiwan via Hong Kong has gained warm market response,
particularly among families with children, as the summer vacation is just around
the corner, a cruise executive said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the executive with the Shanghai Spring International Travel
Service, the newly designed trip has been very popular as the first three trips
have been fully booked.</P>
      <P>He told CNA that many Shanghai parents are very interested in cruising with
their kids to Taiwan and Hong Kong during the summer break despite a cost of
about 9,000 Chinese yuan (US$1,323) per person for a week.</P>
      <P>On the first day of the week-long trip, tourists will fly from Shanghai to Hong
Kong, where they will depart for Taiwan the second day on board the SuperStar
Aquarius cruise vessel, the executive said.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, the ship will anchor in Keelung in the north, Taichung in
central Taiwan, and Tainan in the south to allow tourists the opportunity to
visit these Taiwanese cities.</P>
      <P>After wrapping up tours in Taiwan, tourists will sail back to Hong Kong on the
cruise ship and take a return flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Each cruise ship can accommodate around 1,500 passengers, which could amount to
a tourism windfall for Taiwan if the cruise route continues to be popular.</P>
      <P>The executive said many Chinese parents are highly interested in taking part in
the trip with their children, but that many of them were forced to drop the plan
because the tour is strictly limited to legal residents of Shanghai City, not
people who have moved from other parts of the country to live there and are not
registered with the city government.</P>
      <P>If one of the parents is not a legal Shanghai resident, the whole family will
not be able to take part in the tour, the executive said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Minister proposes opening Taiwan-Japan youth baseball camp</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou proposed Wednesday that Taiwan and
Japan jointly open a youth baseball camp as part of their efforts to boost
bilateral relations, an idea that was supported by Japanese baseball legend
Sadaharu Oh.</P>
      <P>Ou raised the proposal in a meeting with Oh, known in Taiwan as Wang Chen-chih,
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Ou said the idea was derived from President Ma Ying-jeou's focus on the
importance of "cultural diplomacy" and "soft power" and the fact that baseball
is one of Taiwan's best sports.</P>
      <P>If Japan can organize a baseball camp for young Taiwanese players and thus help
raise the level of baseball in Taiwan, this will contribute to closer ties
between the two countries, Ou added.</P>
      <P>The minister said he is a fan of Oh's, noting that the all time home run king
was an ambassador-at-large for Taiwan who contributed a lot to the country's
diplomatic efforts.</P>
      <P>Ou said he hopes Oh will continue to use his influence and star power in Japan
to help promote Taiwan-Japan relations.</P>
      <P>In response, Oh said that baseball is all he knows and that if it can be used to
enhance the links between Taiwan and Japan, he will do his best in this regard.</P>
      <P>He said that he has been able to detect the Taiwan people's enthusiasm for
baseball, and believes that if Taiwan is given the opportunity of hosting
international baseball games, it will help to lift the level of the game in the
country and the region.</P>
      <P>Oh also applauded the minister's proposal to open a joint youth baseball camp
and promised to convey the idea to the relevant Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Oh, who retired from the Yomiuri Giants in 1980 at the age of 40, hit 868 home
runs during his career, the most hit by a player in any professional league
around the world.</P>
      <P>The son of a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, Oh has stayed close to his
Chinese heritage although he has spent most of his life in Japan.</P>
      <P>He has always maintained a close relationship with Taiwan's baseball community
and has contributed to the development of the sport in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prostitution to be decriminalized: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has tentatively decided to decriminalize prostitution in response
to sex workers' appeals for better protection of their human rights, a senior
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jiang Yi-huah,  minister of the Research,  Development and Evaluation
Commission, made the remarks after a meeting of the Executive Yuan's special
task force on human rights.</P>
      <P>The discussion in the meeting focused on the progress on domestic implementation
of two United Nations-sponsored human rights treaties -- the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>When President Ma Ying-jeou promulgated the two covenants May 14, he promised to
bring all relevant domestic laws and statutes in line with the standards set
forth in the two international treaties, within two years.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's meeting, Premier Liu was quoted as having said that the
current regulations that criminalize prostitution and punish prostitutes  should
be amended in line with the principle of "exempting prostitutes from any
penalties."</P>
      <P>"As to whether a special district should be demarcated for the sex trade, the
premier said it would be up to the local governments," Jiang told a post-meeting
news conference.</P>
      <P>Instead of putting the issue to a referendum, Jiang said, city/county councils
and governments should decide on their own whether a special zone should be
designated for sex trade in their administrative areas.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, the premier also directed the Ministry of the Interior come up
with a draft package of regulations on the management of sex workers and other
ancillary matters within six months to pave the way for the decriminalization of
prostitution.</P>
      <P>Once the Interior Ministry completes those preparatory steps, Liu said, work
should get started on amending the current statute that holds prostitutes liable
to penalties.</P>
      <P>Before the existing regulations are scrapped, the Executive Yuan will ask the
Judicial Yuan to suggest that local courts fine prostitutes instead of detaining
them, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Liu also ordered the Interior Ministry not to include arrests for prostitution
in the criteria for evaluating the performance of police officers.</P>
      <P>"This will help to ensure that the police only arrest prostitutes under
'unavoidable circumstances,'" Jiang explained.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu said Wednesday that it is "simply natural" for her
to seek re-election after her southern port city received the green light a day
earlier to be merged with Kaohsiung County into a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with cable network SET TV, Chen said the merger
represents the beginning of new and greater responsibilities.</P>
      <P>"I will strive to win Kaohsiung residents' support with the outstanding
performance of my administrative team and will definitely come up with a
blueprint for the development of the Greater Kaohsiung area soon," she said.</P>
      <P>An ad hoc panel organized by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) approved Tuesday
the upgrading of Taipei County, Taichung City and Taichung County, and Kaohsiung
City and Kaohsiung County into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The panel's decision must be approved by the Executive Yuan to be implemented.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei welcomed the panel's decision
to allow Taipei County to be upgraded into a special municipality without having
to merge with Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Noting that the changed status implies greater responsibility and pressure, Chou
said he will help build the upgraded Taipei County -- to be renamed "New Taipei
City, " -- into a modern, civilized and international metropolis where
residents' quality of life will be significantly upgraded.</P>
      <P>If the MOI panel's decision is approved by the Executive Yuan, incumbent
Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei and
Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu will have their tenures prolonged for another year
until the heads of the newly formed special municipalities are elected in late
2010.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi said Wednesday that since the election
of the head of the new Taichung  special municipality will not be held until
next year, Hu will take his time in considering whether he will enter the race.</P>
      <P>"The decision will not be made until next year, " Hsiao quoted Hu as saying.</P>
      <P>A total of 11 counties and cities had applied to be upgraded to seven
municipalities.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the MOI panel rejected applications submitted by Taoyuan County,
Changhua County, Yunlin County and Chiayi County, and failed to reach a
unanimous decision on whether Tainan City and Tainan County  should  be merged
and upgraded  to a special municipality.</P>
      <P>The MOI said the Tainan issue will be referred to the Executive Yuan for a
decision.</P>
      <P>The panel's decisions were made by its members by consensus after a 15-hour
meeting and were announced by Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi at a news
conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No timetable for fully opening market to U.S. beef: health minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no timetable for fully opening Taiwan's market to U.S. beef, Department
of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Wednesday, although he noted that
the government is considering how best to open the doors.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks in response to media inquiries after Jason Yuan, Taiwan's
representative to the United States, confirmed the previous day that a
delegation from the U.S. Trade Representative office had talked with Taiwanese
officials on the issue during a recent visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two sides "engaged in delightful talks, " Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Harry Tseng, head of the Department of North American Affairs under
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also expressed optimism over the timeline for
market opening.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE, or mad cow disease) was diagnosed in Seattle. The ban was lifted in April
2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle aged under 30 months,
but the government reimposed the ban two months later when a second BSE case was
discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, limited to boneless
beef from cattle younger than 30 months of age, produced from certified
slaughterhouses and without high-risk items such as brains and spinal cords.</P>
      <P>Asked about the risk of consuming U.S. beef, Yeh admitted that the average
lifetime risk of contracting BSE through eating boneless beef is one in 7.18
trillion -- equivalent to the risk of being hit by lightning twice in a row.</P>
      <P>However, Yeh said that despite the trivial risk, some people are still hesitant
to eat beef out of health concerns.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, U.S. beef imports have been increased year-on-year.
At present, the U.S. supplies 32 percent of Taiwan's beef, with the rest coming
mainly from New Zealand and Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ireland will grant visa-free treatment to Taiwanese from July</HEADLINE>

      <P>Ireland will become the second European country after Britain to grant visa-free
treatment to visitors from Taiwan, beginning next month, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>From July 1, Taiwanese visiting Ireland for non-work purposes, including
tourism, business and visits to relatives and friends, will be able to enter
Ireland without a visa for a maximum stay of 90 days, the MOFA said in a press
release.</P>
      <P>This will make Ireland the second European country to offer the visa-exemption
privilege to Taiwan's passport holders,  sparing Taiwanese citizens NT$2,700
(US$82) for a single-entry visa and NT$4,500 for a multi-entry visa to that
country.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom offered visa-free treatment to Taiwanese starting in March
this year, allowing stays of up to six months, the MOFA noted.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry is hopeful that the measure will help lure more Taiwanese
to Ireland, which has not been a popular destination among local residents
because of the difficulty of getting a visa and the high cost of living there.</P>
      <P>Currently, some 200 Taiwanese students are studying in Ireland, and about 1,000
Taiwanese tourists visit that country per year, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Apart from Ireland and Britain, Taiwanese citizens also enjoy visa-free entry in
30 other countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the MOFA announced that a 30-day visa-free privilege for
visitors from Ireland to Taiwan will also be extended to 90 days, effective from
July 1, in efforts to bolster two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government began allowing Republic of Ireland passport holders 30-day
visa-free stays from April 1, 2003.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei-based Thailand Trade and Economic Office announced
Wednesday that it will continue to issue travel visas to Taiwanese tourists free
of charge until March 4, 2010.</P>
      <P>The Thai representative office began the free visa service in March in a bid to
attract more Taiwanese visitors to Thailand, which has been hard hit by the
global economic recession since late last year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices opened low but closed higher Wednesday,  with the weighted
index,  the market's key barometer, advancing 182.61 points, or 2.94 percent, to
close at 6,380.08.</P>
      <P>Rebounding from losses sustained the previous day, the local bourse opened at
6,230.76 and fluctuated between 6,511.97 and 6,191.63.</P>
      <P>A total of 5.01 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$127.98
billion (US$3.89 billion).</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories gained ground, with banking and financial
shares moving up the most at 6.4 percent. Cement stocks rose 5.1 percent,
textile stocks advanced 3.3 percent, construction issues were up 2.9 percent,
plastics and chemicals shares gained 2.3 percent, machinery and electronics
shares increased 2.2 percent, paper and pulp issues advanced 2.1 percent, and
foodstuff issues advanced 1.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Gainers outnumbered losers 1,809 to 510,  with 105 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The three major institutional investors made net purchases of NT$14.37 billion
on shares.</P>
      <P>Shares in some of the assets and construction agencies on the market rose
moderately, which analysts attributed to news a day earlier that Ministry of the
Interior had approved the upgrading of Taipei County, Taichung city and county,
and Kaohsiung city and county to special municipalities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, shares in several finance, insurance and securities firms advanced by
the maximum daily limit of 7 percent and shares in some plastics and chemicals,
textile and cement firms also increased significantly, which the analysts said
was caused by the announcement by Fan Liqing, chairwoman of the Taiwan Affairs
Office of China's State Council, that Taiwan and China are likely to discuss a
Taiwanese government-proposed plan to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement in the second half of this year.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese research team has made a breakthrough in the development of DNA-
based vaccine patches that can replace invasive injections as a vaccine delivery
method, an academic source said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The research team leader, Wu Chang-jer, an associate professor at National
Taiwan Ocean University, said the DNA-based vaccine patch uses the skin's
liposomes as a transport vehicle to deliver vaccine into the body via a non-
invasive method.</P>
      <P>"It opens a new pathway in global vaccine applications -- in the future,
vaccinations against major epidemic diseases could be done via a small patch,
instead of injections using needles or via gene guns," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Although the cost of producing a DNA-based vaccine patch is about the same as a
regular dose of DNA-based vaccine, the patches are easier to apply, free from
the risk of needle contamination and more comfortable for the inoculation
receivers, he noted.</P>
      <P>The DNA vaccine patches, if approved for use on humans, could be used to deliver
vaccines against Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis C, dengue fever and even SARS
or influenza A(H1N1), Wu said.</P>
      <P>The research -- which also received contributions from Tseng Wen-chi, an
associate professor at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, and
Lee Tzung-lin, an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica's Genomics
Research Center -- was published May 4 in the international periodical Journal
of Controlled Release, marking the first research report in the world on DNA-
based vaccine patches, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>The newly developed patches have been referred to agencies in Taiwan as well as
in major countries around the world for patent rights, he went on.</P>
      <P>He said the patches will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and the
Food and Drug Administration as a new drug awaiting human trial, but forecast
that it will take at least 10 years before the patches can be used on humans.</P>
      <P>Wu quoted the Rabobank Group, a global financial services provider specializing
in food and agribusiness financing, as having reported that the vaccination
market is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.</P>
      <P>Global human vaccines commanded a market of US$10 billion in 2006, a figure that
it is estimated will have ballooned to US$30 billion by 2015, Wu quoted the
Rabobank as indicating.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>At a time when the prevalence of random violence by adolescents in today's
society has sparked editorial pieces in local newspapers bemoaning "the loss of
good morals, " the results of a survey released Wednesday give the lie to these
opinions and might come as a comfort to many.</P>
      <P>The survey results,  published by the Champions  Education Association, show
that most of the adolescents surveyed -- all of whom have received counselling
for one reason or another -- have a strong moral sense, which is evident from
their disapproval of behavior such as cheating and stealing.</P>
      <P>According to the results, 73 percent of the respondents would confront their
classmates directly or report them to their teachers if they discovered them
cheating in examinations.</P>
      <P>In the event of stealing by their classmates, the ratio of respondents who said
they would take similar action increased to 79 percent.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 80 percent and 83 percent of respondents said they would feel
guilty if they stole or cheated in examinations, respectively, while more than
75 percent said they would feel frightened or nervous.</P>
      <P>However, 5 percent said they would feel happy or ambivalent about the issues.</P>
      <P>The survey on adolescents' perceptions, feelings and responses to ethical
dilemmas was conducted by Lin Jyh-sheng, an assistant professor of education at
National Taiwan Ocean University, among 9,520 students from 48 junior high
schools around Taiwan. The students were drawn from a group of 59,430 students
who received counseling provided by the Champions Education Associations during
the first semester of the 2008-2009 academic year.</P>
      <P>The survey coincides with a high-profile public education program launched
recently by the Ministry of Education to promote good morals among the country's
citizens.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, for moral education to be effective, it is important for such
education to be integrated into daily life.</P>
      <P>In school, students should be guided to discuss and consider various
hypothetical situations to help them build their own moral values "so that good
morals are not reduced to mere slogans, " Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economics minister touts importance of building Taiwanese brands</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming on Wednesday touted the importance
of building globally popular Taiwanese brands, stressing that creating the
country's own brands is the key to Taiwan's sustainable growth in the world
marketplace.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the 2009 Taiwan International Branding Forum hosted
by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), Yiin
said Taiwan must make all-out efforts to build its own distinguished brands as a
way to tap the key to global industrial development.</P>
      <P>To serve that end, Yiin said, his ministry is driving a brand- building program
to help local brands go international, train qualified professionals and assist
enterprises to become global companies.</P>
      <P>In the past few decades, Taiwan has enjoyed economic success by focusing on
manufacturing for top brands through the OEM (original equipment manufacturing)
or ODM (original design manufacturing) models.</P>
      <P>But Yiin said local businesses should quickly turn to branding efforts to pursue
greater profits and survive.</P>
      <P>That is because developing countries such as China are quickly catching up to
Taiwan in terms of being able to manufacture for others cheaply and efficiently.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang echoed Yiin's views.</P>
      <P>"Only innovation and customized-design can create added value to products and
achieve sustainable growth through branding as Taiwan has lost its niche in
manufacturing," Wang told the forum.</P>
      <P>Currently, few Taiwanese brands are recognizable worldwide, other than a
handful, such as Acer and Asus. But if Taiwan were to have more globally well-
known brands, its companies could make more profits as profit margins tend to be
higher for brand owners than product or parts manufacturers.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Taiwanese companies have already begun making efforts in brand
promotion.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey, Wang said the value of Taiwan's top 10 brands
amounted to US$7.5 billion in 2008, up by 11.8 percent over the 2007 level. The
2008 value represented an increase of 111.5 percent compared to the figure
recorded in 2003, when the annual survey was launched for the first time, he
noted.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong Friday to promote
the 21st Summer Deaflympics Taipei 2009, a games organizer said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hau is scheduled to meet that same day with Donald Tsang, chief executive of the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and will hold an
international news conference on the Taipei Deaflympics the following day, said
Emile Chih-jen Sheng, CEO of the Taipei Deaflympics Organizing Committee.</P>
      <P>It will be the first meeting between a Taipei mayor and an incumbent Hong Kong
government chief, said Sheng.</P>
      <P>Confident that the Taipei Deaflympics 2009, the 2010 Taipei International Flora
Expo and the World Expo 2010 Shanghai will generate immeasurable business
opportunities, Hau has been making plans to cooperate with the authorities in
Shanghai and Hong Kong to promote these events, according to Taipei city
government officials.</P>
      <P>The Sept. 5-15 Deaflympics Taipei, which are being held in Asia for the first
time, will be preceded by a grand opening of the main stadium July 23 and an
invitational track and field warm-up meet July 24-25, according to Sheng.</P>
      <P>A series of large-scale promotional performances will also be staged during the
run-up to the games, which will see some 4,000 athletes from 80 countries
competing in 20 events at 22 venues in Taipei City and in Taipei, Taoyuan and
Hsinchu counties.</P>
      <P>The Deaflympics date back to 1924, when they were held for the first time in
Paris. In 1995, they received official recognition from the International
Olympics Committee and today, 96 national deaf sports federations are members of

      <P>The average age of local HIV carriers is getting ever-younger, with the
incidence rate rising fastest among male teens,  the non-profit  Taiwan AIDS
Foundation  cautioned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health, the foundation said the number of student
HIV carriers increased by 110 in 2007 and rose further by 156 in 2008.</P>
      <P>"The figures mark an alarming 42 percent year-on-year surge, " said Lin Chiung-
chao, the foundation's secretary-general.</P>
      <P>In the past, Lin said, 70 percent of HIV carriers were aged between 20 and 40.
The trend, however, has gradually changed in recent years, with more and more of
those in the 15-19 age group infected with the virus that causes AIDS.</P>
      <P>"This is a general world trend, as the AIDS prevention publicity campaign has
failed to catch up with the tendency that the average age of youngsters having
sex for the first time has dropped to 16, " Lin explained.</P>
      <P>He urged public health and education authorities to step up publicity efforts to
raise local teens' awareness of the risk of AIDS and the importance of safe sex.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the foundation's online surveys, 95 percent of
Internet respondents said they would be willing to take HIV tests, with
hospitals and public health centers their most favored places for such tests. In
addition, 20 percent said it would be acceptable for regular health checkups to
include HIV tests.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that 39 people tested HIV-positive at blood donation centers around
the country in the five months of this year.</P>
      <P>"The figure is relatively high, as the number of people who tested HIV-positive
at blood donation centers was 67 for the whole of last year, " Lin said, adding
that more efforts should be made to educate people not to misuse blood donation
as a method of free HIV testing.</P>
      <P>He also urged those who indulge in high-risk sexual activity or who have shared
syringes when abusing drugs to get tested for HIV within three months of taking
part in such activities.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan AIDS Foundation was established in 2005 to assist the government in
various programs for AIDS prevention and control, as well as to promote
international cooperation in combating AIDS.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will take steps to remodel the image of the
country's prisons as stereotypical dark, cold places of confinement and will go
even further to turn them into tourist attractions, Justice Minister Wang Ching-
feng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Penghu Prison on the Penghu archipelago in the Taiwan
Strait, Wang promised to lead an effort to modernize the country's prisons.</P>
      <P>She was at the prison for the closing ceremony of a drug rehabilitation program
for inmates, which included a skit, choir and Chi Gung performances, and an
exhibition of various art works by the prisoners.</P>
      <P>Addressing inmates who were soon to be released, Wang said she hopes they will
have a brand new start in life.</P>
      <P>The normally  heavily guarded  prison was opened to local officials, the media
and the public Wednesday in support of the MOJ's idea of turning Taiwan's jails
into tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Wang told the visitors that the MOJ will try to create a new image of the 24
jails around the country and will call them "cultural prisons" -- places of
hope.</P>
      <P>In addition, the people confined in such places should be referred to as
"students" instead of "inmates," she said.</P>
      <P>The visitors, led by Wang and the chief warden Chan Che-feng, toured the Penghu
Prison and looked at the farm work being done by the inmates.</P>
      <P>At one point, Wang tried on a pair of leg irons, which she said were very heavy

    <HEADLINE>Cute clownfish could be rising star of Taiwan's aquaculture sector</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/24/09  20:50:32</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For thousands of years, clownfish lived undisturbed by man in coral reefs. But
when the 2003 Hollywood animated blockbuster "Finding Nemo" cast the world's
attention on the previously obscure species, the newfound stardom threatened the
clownfish's survival.</P>
      <P>Reef aquarium owners around the globe were suddenly desperate to add the bright
orange saltwater fish with the white stripe to their collection, just as Nemo
was added to a fish tank in a dentist's office in Australia.</P>
      <P>Wild clownfish were overharvested to satisfy surging demand, sending their
numbers plummeting.</P>
      <P>Even captive breeding programs, which some hope could replenish enough clownfish
to prevent their demise in the wild, have been woefully inadequate in curtailing
the species' dwindling numbers and damage done to its natural habitat.</P>
      <P>That may soon change,  however,  as a Taiwanese saltwater ornamental fish
research team has unlocked some of the mysteries surrounding the breeding
process and hopes that through the diffusion of the technology, the clownfish
trade will emerge as another success story in Taiwan's aquaculture industry,
following in the footsteps of the advances made in raising shrimp and grouper.</P>
      <P>The research team estimates that by 2011, Taiwan could breed 2 million clownfish
and generate NT$100 million in the lucrative ornamental fish market, while
helping save the species in the wild.</P>
      <P>The team is led by Ho Yuan-hsing, an associate researcher with Fisheries
Research Institute of the Eastern Marine Biology Research Center in eastern
Taiwan's Taitung County, who has been actively engaged in fish breeding programs
for nearly two decades.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Ho published the world's first report on the artificial breeding of the
giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) , but later turned to research on
saltwater ornamental fish and edible fish like abalone because he wanted "to do
something more important and that has greater influence on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>His change in interest was largely motivated by pursuing an area that few had
treaded because he has always wanted to be a "trailblazer."</P>
      <P>The captive breeding of saltwater ornamental fishes has a high entry threshold
because of technology barriers and the difficulty of obtaining sea water, which
is why an overwhelming 98 percent of saltwater ornamental fishes are still
caught in the sea rather than artificially bred.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is ideally positioned, Ho says, to reverse the disturbing trend,
especially for clownfish. The country's warm weather and waters provide a
perfect habitat for the prized fish, and its large fish farming population
(127,000 in 2007) has traditionally excelled in the field.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has artificially bred the most fish species in the world," Ho says.</P>
      <P>The country  has also broken considerable  ground  in the development of live
bait as a food source for clownfish larvae, a critical advancement since finding
suitable food and mass producing it is essential to the artificial breeding
process.</P>
      <P>Ho's center inaugurated a clownfish fry production farm in November 2008, which
Ho estimated could produce 100,000 clownfish this year and potentially double
that in 2010.</P>
      <P>The center actually began researching clownfish in 2002, but the Fry Production
Model Farm only became a reality because Ho's team was finally able to master
several core technologies.</P>
      <P>For one, pairing the clownfish is not easy. Though clownfish are strictly
monogamous, that does not mean that "they will mate automatically if a male and
female are put together," Ho says.</P>
      <P>"We have to see to it that the two see eye to eye and will not attack each
other, especially because the fish is very fierce and protective of its own
territory and attacks any fish, even of its own species, that encroaches into
its territory," he adds.</P>
      <P>The farm now has 150 seed pairs, with half of them spawning.</P>
      <P>The center also controls the spawning, Ho says. In their natural habitat at sea,
clownfish lay from 500 to more than 1,000 fertilized eggs once per month, but
the center has been able to get the fish to spawn twice a month.</P>
      <P>After the eggs hatch, the next challenge is to prepare the right food for the
larvae, Ho says, a potentially difficult step because the larvae are only about
0.4 mm in size at birth.</P>
      <P>The center has solved the problem by providing live bait and also micro-
organisms, such as rotifers and copepods, to suit the needs of the larvae.
Pellet diet is only fed to the fry after they grow to 20-day-olds.</P>
      <P>Clownfish larvae are also more vulnerable to disease in the winter when the
water temperature is low, and the center will install a water heating system
this year to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>"Clownfish could be one of the easiest fish species to breed if you can master
those core technologies, " Ho says.</P>
      <P>Having mastered the process, the center plans to hand these technologies and the
planning and management of the farm model to 10 selected breeders next year, and
Ho estimates that the breeders will each be able to produce 200,000 clownfish
and generate NT$10 million in revenues annually.</P>
      <P>The many years of research by Ho's team also culminated in the opening of the
world's first aquarium devoted solely to clownfish adjacent to the center in
mid-May.</P>
      <P>Though it may be the smallest aquarium in Taiwan, it has nine exhibition areas
and displays nearly 1,500 clownfish from 18 species -- including eight from
foreign countries and five from local waters. Ho's center can now breed 13 out
of the 18 species.</P>
      <P>The Aquarium of Amenonefish will soon become the center's main remnant of its
basic clownfish breeding program as it recently has shifted its focus to raising
ornamental fish with added value, concentrating on two new approaches.</P>
      <P>One involves breeding "hybrid" species while the other emphasizes selecting
unique fish within the same species, such as those with more exotic or brighter
patterns, and trying to reproduce them after repeated trials.</P>
      <P>Ho cited as an example an Australian clownfish, which is black with two white
bands, but the two bands gradually approach each other and one day merge
together.</P>
      <P>Such a species, because of its rarity, could be highly prized and fetch 10 times
or more the value of a typical ornamental fish, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Andrew Fang, executive director of saltwater ornamental fish exporter Taikong
Co., said the center's research and breeding efforts of clownfish and other
saltwater ornamental fish has outstanding commercial potential and will help
protect the species in the wild.</P>
      <P>Saltwater ornamental fish, he says,  are more prized than freshwater species
because of their bright and beautiful color, but fish harvested from the wild
often succumb to weakness when kept in tanks, making them dicey commercial
propositions even if they are highly sought after.</P>
      <P>"Most aquariums actually sell mostly freshwater  ornamental fishes, because
saltwater ornamental fish only have a 20 percent chance of survival if they are
kept in water tanks," Fang said.</P>
      <P>When saltwater ornamental fish are caught, the netting used to trap them or the
drugs used to daze them often damage the fish or leave drug residues adhered to
their skin.</P>
      <P>Those dangers, coupled with the suspension of feeding during the transportation
process, results in the fish arriving at a private aquarium in a highly weakened
state.</P>
      <P>Fang estimates that the survival rate of ornamental fish in tanks may be less
than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>The breeding program, however, produces healthier fish that will be more than
competitive with those caught in the wild.</P>
      <P>"Captive breeding could solve the problem of keeping them alive in tanks," Fang
said.</P>
      <P>The trader strongly believes that the strong demand for clownfish and other
ornamental fish triggered by Finding Nemo will continue unabated but with an
environmental element added.</P>
      <P>"Products that meet environmental requirements -- conserving the species and not
damaging marine ecology simultaneously -- will remain in vogue," Fang believes.</P>
      <P>In Southeast Asia, where ornamental fish species are abundant, fishermen often
use drugs such as potassium cyanide to trap their targets, not only harming
their catch but also nearby fish and the surrounding marine ecology.</P>
      <P>Fang noted that the European Union, one of his three major export destinations
(the others are Japan and the United States), is very strict on the origin of
imports, and some EU countries will not accept ornamental fish caught in the
wild.</P>
      <P>"The captive bred fish could easily make inroads into their markets," he says.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan has the skills to artificially breed the clownfish and then mass
produce them at a consistent level of high quality, it will have a significant
competitive edge in the market, Fang believes.</P>
      <P>That may also allow many young clownfish like Nemo to thrive once again in the
wild and protect the coral reefs that serve as their natural habitats. /ls</P>

      <P>A new cruise recently marketed by local tour agencies that will take travelers
from Shanghai to Taiwan via Hong Kong has gained warm market response,
particularly among families with children, as the summer vacation is just around
the corner, a cruise executive said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the executive with the Shanghai Spring International Travel
Service, the newly designed trip has been very popular as the first three trips
have been fully booked.</P>
      <P>He told CNA that many Shanghai parents are very interested in cruising with
their kids to Taiwan and Hong Kong during the summer break despite a cost of
about 9,000 Chinese yuan (US$1,323) per person for a week.</P>
      <P>On the first day of the week-long trip, tourists will fly from Shanghai to Hong
Kong, where they will depart for Taiwan the second day on board the SuperStar
Aquarius cruise vessel, the executive said.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, the ship will anchor in Keelung in the north, Taichung in
central Taiwan, and Tainan in the south to allow tourists the opportunity to

      <P>After wrapping up tours in Taiwan, tourists will sail back to Hong Kong on the
cruise ship and take a return flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Each cruise ship can accommodate around 1,500 passengers, which could amount to
a tourism windfall for Taiwan if the cruise route continues to be popular.</P>
      <P>The executive said many Chinese parents are highly interested in taking part in
the trip with their children, but that many of them were forced to drop the plan
because the tour is strictly limited to legal residents of Shanghai City, not
people who have moved from other parts of the country to live there and are not
registered with the city government.</P>
      <P>If one of the parents is not a legal Shanghai resident, the whole family will

    <HEADLINE>Minister proposes opening Taiwan-Japan youth baseball camp</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou proposed Wednesday that Taiwan and
Japan jointly open a youth baseball camp as part of their efforts to boost
bilateral relations, an idea that was supported by Japanese baseball legend
Sadaharu Oh.</P>
      <P>Ou raised the proposal in a meeting with Oh, known in Taiwan as Wang Chen-chih,
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Ou said the idea was derived from President Ma Ying-jeou's focus on the
importance of "cultural diplomacy" and "soft power" and the fact that baseball
is one of Taiwan's best sports.</P>
      <P>If Japan can organize a baseball camp for young Taiwanese players and thus help
raise the level of baseball in Taiwan, this will contribute to closer ties
between the two countries, Ou added.</P>
      <P>The minister said he is a fan of Oh's, noting that the all time home run king
was an ambassador-at-large for Taiwan who contributed a lot to the country's
diplomatic efforts.</P>
      <P>Ou said he hopes Oh will continue to use his influence and star power in Japan
to help promote Taiwan-Japan relations.</P>
      <P>In response, Oh said that baseball is all he knows and that if it can be used to
enhance the links between Taiwan and Japan, he will do his best in this regard.</P>
      <P>He said that he has been able to detect the Taiwan people's enthusiasm for
baseball, and believes that if Taiwan is given the opportunity of hosting
international baseball games, it will help to lift the level of the game in the
country and the region.</P>
      <P>Oh also applauded the minister's proposal to open a joint youth baseball camp
and promised to convey the idea to the relevant Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Oh, who retired from the Yomiuri Giants in 1980 at the age of 40, hit 868 home
runs during his career, the most hit by a player in any professional league
around the world.</P>
      <P>The son of a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, Oh has stayed close to his
Chinese heritage although he has spent most of his life in Japan.</P>
      <P>He has always maintained a close relationship with Taiwan's baseball community
and has contributed to the development of the sport in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prostitution to be decriminalized: official</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government has tentatively decided to decriminalize prostitution in response
to sex workers' appeals for better protection of their human rights, a senior
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jiang Yi-huah,  minister of the Research,  Development and Evaluation
Commission, made the remarks after a meeting of the Executive Yuan's special
task force on human rights.</P>
      <P>The discussion in the meeting focused on the progress on domestic implementation
of two United Nations-sponsored human rights treaties -- the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>When President Ma Ying-jeou promulgated the two covenants May 14, he promised to
bring all relevant domestic laws and statutes in line with the standards set
forth in the two international treaties, within two years.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's meeting, Premier Liu was quoted as having said that the
current regulations that criminalize prostitution and punish prostitutes  should
be amended in line with the principle of "exempting prostitutes from any
penalties."</P>
      <P>"As to whether a special district should be demarcated for the sex trade, the
premier said it would be up to the local governments," Jiang told a post-meeting
news conference.</P>
      <P>Instead of putting the issue to a referendum, Jiang said, city/county councils
and governments should decide on their own whether a special zone should be
designated for sex trade in their administrative areas.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, the premier also directed the Ministry of the Interior come up
with a draft package of regulations on the management of sex workers and other
ancillary matters within six months to pave the way for the decriminalization of
prostitution.</P>
      <P>Once the Interior Ministry completes those preparatory steps, Liu said, work
should get started on amending the current statute that holds prostitutes liable
to penalties.</P>
      <P>Before the existing regulations are scrapped, the Executive Yuan will ask the
Judicial Yuan to suggest that local courts fine prostitutes instead of detaining
them, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Liu also ordered the Interior Ministry not to include arrests for prostitution
in the criteria for evaluating the performance of police officers.</P>
      <P>"This will help to ensure that the police only arrest prostitutes under
'unavoidable circumstances,'" Jiang explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Irish lawmaker hails visa-free status as big step in bilateral ties</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ireland's decision to grant visa-free treatment to Taiwanese passport holders
symbolizes its recognition of Taiwan's democratic development and President Ma
Ying-jeou's efforts to improve relations with China, an influential Irish
lawmaker said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The visa-free privilege also marks a significant step forward in relations
between our two countries, " said John Perry, chairman of the Ireland-Taiwan
Parliamentary Friendship Society, in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>From July 1, Taiwanese visiting Ireland for non-employment purposes such as
tourism, business and family visits, will be able to enter without a visa for a
maximum stay of 90 days.</P>
      <P>This will make Ireland the second European country to offer visa exemptions to
Taiwan passport holders, who will no longer have to pay NT$2,700 (US$82) for a
single-entry visitor's visa or NT$4,500 for a multiple-entry visitor's visa to
that country.</P>
      <P>Since March this year, the United Kingdom has been allowing Taiwan citizens to
enter the country visa-free for stays of up to six months.</P>
      <P>Perry recalled that over the past 12 months he and scores of his colleagues in
the Irish Parliament have collaborated with Taiwan's representative  to Ireland,
Lee Nan-yang,  and several  Irish universities  to push the Irish government to
grant visa-free treatment to visitors from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I'm pleased to see our joint efforts finally bear fruit, " Perry said, adding
that he believes the privilege will contribute to the promotion of trade and
economic cooperation between the two countries and increased investment by
Taiwan in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The visa-free treatment is also expected to lure more Taiwanese youngsters to
study in Ireland, Perry said. The Irish government hopes to attract at least
1,500 Taiwanese students per year, or 10 percent of the 15,000-plus Taiwan
youths who travel annually to the neighboring United Kingdom for advanced study,
he added.</P>
      <P>Perry, who has been to Taiwan twice, is scheduled to visit the country again in
September to meet with President Ma on new measures to further enhance bilateral
ties.</P>
      <P>According to official Irish statistics, Taiwan is Ireland's 21st largest trading
partner, 14th largest import source and 33rd largest export outlet. Two-way
trade amounted to 760 million euros (about US$1.07 billion) in 2008, with
Ireland importing 536 million euros worth of goods from Taiwan and exporting 224
million euros worth of merchandise to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the new visa regulations, Taiwanese students will be allowed to enter
Ireland with school admission certificates instead of student visas. If they
want to stay for more than 90 days, they will be required to apply for a
Certificate of Registration with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Wednesday that
the 30-day visa-free period for visitors from Ireland to Taiwan will also be
extended to 90 days, effective from July 1, in an effort to bolster two-way
exchanges.  The Taiwan government on April 1, 2003 began allowing Republic of
Ireland passport holders visa-free entry for stays of up to 30 days.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese citizens enjoy visa-free entry to 30 other countries apart from
Ireland and Britain. These include Japan, Singapore and South Korea.</P>

      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait may start talks in October on the signing an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), according to Minister of
Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming.</P>
      <P>Yiin made the remarks Wednesday in an interview with the Central News Agency
after Fan Liqing, spokeswoman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said earlier in
the day that Taiwan and China are likely to start negotiations on the ECFA issue
in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Fan said that the two sides are stepping up preparations for striking an ECFA
deal to boost bilateral  trade and economic cooperation. Whether the topic will
be put on the agenda for the fourth round of cross-strait high-level talks
scheduled for later this year will depend on the progress of the preparations by
both sides, she added.</P>
      <P>Responding to Fan's statement, Yiin said Taiwan's interacton with china in this
regard has been on schedule. The research on all related subjects is expected to
be completed at the end of this month, after which a comprehensive three-month
study will be carried out, he added.</P>
      <P>While the study is being conducted, the two sides will meet for preliminary
talks, Yiin said, adding that this stage may not be completed in three months as
scheduled.</P>
      <P>"Conclusion of the comprehensive study will depend on whether the two sides can
reach consensus on key matters of mutual concern," Yiin said. If all goes well,
formal cross-strait talks on the ECFA may kick off in October at the earliest,
he added.</P>
      <P>On Vice Economics  Minister  Huang Chung-chiou's  departure Wednesday on a visit
to China, Yiin said the trip has nothing to do with the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>"Huang is not in charge of ECFA affairs and will therefore not talk about any
issues related to that proposal during his visit.... the two sides have not yet
had any exchanges on this topic," Yiin explained.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has commissioned the Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research's Taiwan WTO Center to conduct an indepth study of all ECFA-
related issues. Yiin said the think tank will unveil the results of the study at
the end of June as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, the minister said, the Taiwan WTO Center and its Chinese counterpart
-- the Economic and Trade Exchange Association -- would jointly organize a
seminar soon on the ECFA initiative so as to explore whether both sides agree or
disagree on any of the major components.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) plans to set up an action team to deal with
gender discrimination and related issues in schools, Education Minister Cheng
Jei-cheng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the announcement in the wake of a news conference held by several
gender equity advocacy groups earlier in the day to review the Gender Equity
Education Act five years after its implementation.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-chun, director of the Taiwan Gender Equity Education Association, said
that while there have been encouraging signs in Taiwan's gender equity
education, there is still ample room for improvement.  She pointed  to weak
areas  such  as inadequate investigation into sexual harassment complaints by
females, a skewed ratio of male to female faculty members, sexual bullying in
schools, and a school dress code that requires all female students to wear
skirts in summer.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chih-wei, secretary-general of the Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association,
urged the ministry to instill in students the concept of respecting people of
different sexual orientations. He suggested the government promote education on
homosexuality and gender differences in order to achieve gender equality in
schools.</P>
      <P>In response, the minister acknowledged that the NT$60 million earmarked by the
MOE for gender equity education was inadequate, and said that the ministry will
consider increasing the allocation based on the actual situation.</P>
      <P>Minister Cheng also said that schools should not lay out a dress code for
students, but if there is one, violators should not be punished.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he admitted there are fewer female faculty members in schools in
general, particularly in tertiary education institutions, However, the ministry
cannot stipulate a ratio of male to female teaching staff in schools, he added.</P>
      <P>The minister said an action team will be established to handle sexual harassment
and gender bullying incidents in schools in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, females accounted for 34.12 percent of college and university faculty
members in 2006, which was close to the average in countries  that are members
of the Organization  for Economic Co-operation and Development, and higher than
the 17.9 percent in Japan, and the 30.88 percent in South Korea, according to
ministry statistics.</P>
      <P>Among 162 colleges and universities in Taiwan, only 14 are headed by female
presidents. Meanwhile, Taiwan's literacy rate among females aged 15 and over
surged to 96.1 percent in 2008 from 92 percent in 1999, the statistics revealed.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it is evaluating the
possibility of starting new cooperation projects with two of its allies, in line
with President Ma Ying-jeou's policy of "economic and trade diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Diego Chou, deputy director-general of the MOFA's Department of Central and
South American Affairs, said at a regular press briefing that the Foreign
Ministry is considering the possibility of launching a cooperation project with
Belize on tilapia fish farming.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has extensive experience in tilapia fish farming, which is something
Belize wants to get into. It will be a great new cooperation project between the
two countries," Chou said.</P>
      <P>Tilapia fish farming is one of the top priorities for the Belize government in
its economic development of the country and it is prepared to offer aquaculture
businesses a 15-year tax holiday, Chou said.</P>
      <P>A group commissioned  by the MOFA and coordinated by the non-governmental
Chinese  International  Economic  Cooperation Association visited Belize June
6-12 to study the feasibility of the project and the MOFA has asked its embassy
in Belize to further evaluate the proposal, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan and Saint Christopher and Nevis might also be able to
cooperate in the future to explore the Caribbean ally's rich geothermal
resources, according the Chou.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Taiwan June 9-13, Joseph W. Parry, premier of Nevis Island
Administration, invited Taiwan's Bureau of Energy to attend the first East
Caribbean Geothermal Conference scheduled to open June 30, he added.</P>
      <P>"We hope to help our allies through more cooperation projects -- an approach
that is in line with President Ma's policy of 'economic and trade diplomacy,'"
Chou said.</P>
      <P>Ma has repeatedly said that his administration's new pragmatic diplomacy will
focus on economic ties with its diplomatic allies through the provision of
technology, expertise and training.</P>

      <P>A center was opened at National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) in
southern Taiwan Thursday for early phase clinical trial of new drugs, mainly for
cancer.</P>
      <P>The center is a joint project launched by the National Health Research
Institutes (NHRI) and the hospital. Chen Jyh-hong, superintendent of the
hospital, and Chang Jang-yang, director of the NHRI's National Institute of
Cancer Research, presided over a plaque-unveiling ceremony to formally open the
center.</P>
      <P>NCKUH said that it set up a clinical trial center as early as 1990, but with
Taiwan's advancement in new drug development and the willingness of foreign
pharmaceuticals to commission clinical trials in Taiwan, the hospital decided to
set up a separate early-phase clinical trial center.</P>
      <P>Early phase clinical trials cover the first two stages of the four-phase trial
of new drugs. In phase one the drug is tested on humans and the right dosages
are determined. Phase two assess the effects and toxicity of the drug. Phase
three researches the effects and safety of the drug, and in phase four it is
monitored for side-effects after it is put on the market.</P>
      <P>NCKUH said that the time frame for a new drug to proceed from development to
clinical trials and then to the market is five to seven years and involves
millions of dollars.</P>
      <P>The hospital said it has been commissioned by local and foreign pharmaceutical
companies to conduct clinical trials for 40 cancer drugs.</P>
      <P>Most of the requests for clinical trials of new drugs have come from foreign
counties, while 20 percent are from local pharmaceutical companies, the hospital
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait culture summit slated for September in Beijing</HEADLINE>

      <P>Officials from Taiwan and China will meet to exchange views and discuss ways to
boost two-way cultural activities later this year in Beijing, it was announced
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-twan, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs
(CCA) , said the two sides will hold a "cultural summit" in September in the
Chinese capital to delve into several issues important to the promotion of
cross-Taiwan Strait cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Culture is the largest common ground between Taiwan and China, and the two
sides should set up a channel of negotiation," she told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Huang revealed that she might take part in the Beijing summit and said that an
upcoming forum between the Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of
China, scheduled for July in Changsha, China's Hunan Province, will also touch
on the topic of cultural sharing.</P>
      <P>In the Beijing meeting, officials from both sides will negotiate issues
regarding arranging visits by cultural officials to each other's areas,
organizing exhibitions,  protecting intellectual property and cooperating in
filmmaking and the promotion of Taiwanese art, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Taiwan pavilion to be built at the Shanghai World Expo 2010,
she said the facility will revolve around culture and the CCA will put forward
several ideas and proposals to the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) , which is in charge of the construction.</P>
      <P>The recent improvement in Taiwan-China relations has focused on setting up
regular, direct transportation links as well as boosting trade and investment.</P>
      <P>Culture, however, is believed to be one of the key factors in building mutual
understanding between the two sides, whose relations have been long strained,
observers said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's pop culture, especially music, has already been widely influential in
mainland China, but its movies, performance arts and other cultural exchanges
are still not widespread. Imports of Chinese contemporary culture to Taiwan is
more uncommon, with no mainland Chinese TV channels accessible here, and few
Chinese movies shown in theaters or singers performing here, they opined.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On the status upgrades for selected localities</P>
      <P>The political manipulation underlying the government's recent decision to
upgrade several localities to the level of special municipalities is the most
controversial part about the decision.</P>
      <P>Firstly, it is suspected to be a conspiracy designed to secure President Ma
Ying-jeou's victory in his 2012 re-election bid. Under this conspiracy, the
election for Taipei County -- a decisive race leading up to Ma's re-election bid
-- will be postponed because of the county's upgrade. When the poor performance
of the Kuomintang (KMT) incumbent Chou Hsi-wei is widely expected to lead to the
party's defeat in the election, the postponement would help the KMT continue its
grip of Taiwan's most populous locality.</P>
      <P>It is unconstitutional for Ma's administration to put off the elections for
localities affected by the upgrades. According to interpretations by the
Constitutional Court, public office holders must be re-elected regularly unless
there is a "major national emergency," and the upgrades do not fall under this
definition.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: On the police's inability to deal with random assaults</P>
      <P>The frequent occurrence  of random assaults  committed  by anti-social
individuals against innocent people poses a serious threat to society. The
police, however, appear powerless to deal with such crime.</P>
      <P>We surmise the situation would encourage more social perverts to follow suit,
putting pedestrians in greater danger.</P>
      <P>The government, especially the police, should feel ashamed when the country has
become so dangerous that it is not even safe for people to simply walk or ride a
motorcycle on the streets. Such a government should be condemned and ousted.</P>
      <P>China Times: On the status upgrades for selected localities</P>
      <P>The government's decision to upgrade several localities to the level of special
municipalities is expected to bring major changes to Taiwan's political
landscape, which deserve our attention. The possibilities of conflict are likely
to increase not only between Taipei City and the upgraded Taipei County, but
also between the central and local governments over the distribution of
financial resources.</P>
      <P>We always believe that the government should find a solution to the issue of
revenue distribution first before dealing with the upgrade issue. Unfortunately,
the government has put the horse before the cart.</P>
      <P>We have no idea as to how much Taiwan will have to pay for such a premature
policy. The shortsightedness of politicians is clearly demonstrated in this
case.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On the Central Bank's monetary policy</P>
      <P>The Central Bank is scheduled to meet Thursday to review its monetary policy. It
is widely believed that the Central Bank will maintain its loose monetary
policy.</P>
      <P>With the momentum for an economic recovery remaining weak, the current policy,
though not a stimulant, is a basic element for the economy to maintain its
strength. Unless any of Taiwan's major competitors or trade partners change
their monetary policies, it would be best for the Central Bank to stick to its
present policy.</P>
      <P>The policy adopted by the Central Bank since the start of the global financial
crisis in September 2008 has been proven feasible, which helps maintain orderly
market operations. At a time when the financial market has just begun to
stabilize, the Central Bank's non-volatility is essential to sustaining the
market's stability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Agricultural authorities said U.S. beef safe for consumption</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
06/25/09  19:10:13
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the issue over whether Taiwan should fully open its market to U.S. beef draws
public debate, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday it
believes that the products do not pose a health threat as long as the
potentially risky parts of the cattle are removed.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuei-sen, director of the COA Animal Industry Department, said his
department believes that "there should be no animal quarantine concerns" over
U.S. beef once the cattle undergo health checks before and after they are
slaughtered and the specified risk materials (SRMs) are taken off and discarded
during the slaughtering process.</P>
      <P>Hsu said his department came to this conclusion based on a decision by the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH),
which determined that U.S. beef, regardless of the age of the cattle, was safe.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently only allows boneless U.S. beef from cattle younger than 30
months of age to be imported, but the government is considering agreeing to a
U.S. request to allow imports of U.S. beef from all cattle, regardless of age,
and some beef with bones, to be imported, as long as the parts considered
potentially risky are removed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- was diagnosed in Seattle. The ban was
lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle aged
under 30 months, but the government reimposed the ban two months later when a
second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months of age, produced by certified slaughterhouses
and without any risky parts of the cattle.</P>
      <P>These include the brain, skull, eyes, trigeminal ganglion, notochord, backbone,
and spinal nerve root, as well as all the cattle's tonsil and small intestines,
according to information on the DOH's Web site.</P>
      <P>The deadly disease is passed on to humans through affected beef.</P>
      <P>With only boneless U.S. beef from young cows being allowed, the U.S. supplies 32
percent of Taiwan's beef consumed, much lower than the over 50 percent prior to
the ban against beef from older cows.</P>
      <P>Hsu on Thursday also noted that the United States has been recognized by the OIE
as having a controlled risk to mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>A controlled risk means the beef is safe once the cattle undergo health checks
before and after slaughtering and the specified risk materials (SRMs) are
removed during slaughtering.</P>
      <P>Hsu also pointed out that Taiwan, as a World Trade Organization member, is
obliged to open its market to beef imports.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will import foreign beef as long as they meet existing food
safety standards.</P>
      <P>However, his office, the COA, and DOH have both stopped short of openly
endorsing a full market opening for U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan told the media that there is no
timetable for fully opening the local market to U.S. beef. The issue also
depends on whether the public will accept the product, he said.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks after Harry Tseng, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs'
Department of North American Affairs expressed optimism over the timeline for
full market opening.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports about 73,000 tons of beef a year, mostly from Australia, the U.S.
and New Zealand, according to COA tallies.</P>
      <P>Allowing a full resumption of U.S. beef imports will not affect Taiwan's
domestic market for locally-produced beef, Hsu said, because locally produced
beef amounted to only 6,000 tons a year, accounting for just 7.6 percent of the
total beef consumed in the country.</P>
      <P>The government's softened attitude, however, triggered protests from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DDP) , which denounced the Kuomintang-
led administration for "conducting political trading with people's health."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Sing-nan said the government should safeguard people's
health and should not be allowed to make compromises on the matter.</P>
      <P>He called for every person in the country to telephone the DOH to directly raise
their objections to the attempt to open Taiwan's doors fully to U.S. beef.</P>

      <P>With tropical storm Nangka approaching Taiwan from the Philippines, the Central

northwesterly direction at a speed of 20 kph.</P>
      <P>After detecting that the high pressure system was strengthening, a CWB
meteorologist said that if the process is fast enough, the system will become so
strong that it will force the storm west, moving it closer to China than Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Over 60 percent of the hotels which normally cater to foreign tourists in
Kaohsiung City have been booked ahead of the World Games to be held in the
southern Taiwanese port city in July, a business source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chun-liang, CEO of the Kaohsiung Tourist Hotel Association, said the

over the period from July 13-29, which overlaps with the period when the games

      <P>Lin attributed the good occupancy rate at the eight hotels to business generated

      <P>Meanwhile, the occupancy rate at other hotels in the city also hit around 60
percent, Lin said.</P>
      <P>To support the games, 29 hotels affiliated with the association are offering
their rooms at a preferential price of NT$2,000 (US$61) each on average, Lin
noted, adding that the association is also keen on promoting tourism in
Kaohsiung on the occasion of the World Games at a time when it is also a peak
season for domestic travel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chengching Lake tourism area in neighboring Kaohsiung County's
Niaosong township is undergoing an overhaul, including environmental cleanup and
facilities renewal, to embrace the World Games and lure tourists.</P>
      <P>Two competitions of the World Games -- field archery and orienteering -- will be
held in the scenic area of more than 200 hectares.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, an increased number of Chinese and Japanese tourists have

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen joined a
group of academics and social activists Thursday to initiate a drive calling for
an end to what they argue is the "unjustified detention" of former President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"The detention lacks legal necessity and legitimacy. Through this action, we
want to highlight the unreasonableness of the existing detention system," Tsai
said in a news conference.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she hopes the drive will help muster the power of the public to
promote reforms to the judicial system.</P>
      <P>Co-sponsors  of the action included former Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-
tseh, Taiwan Bar Association Chairman Wellington Koo, Judicial Reform Foundation
Chairman Huang Jui-ming, former Awakening Foundation Chairwoman Lee Yuan-chen,
and Academic Sinica academician Chen Chien-jen.</P>
      <P>Also on the list were Chen Hwei-syin, dean of the College of Law at National
Chengchi University, Academia Sinica research fellows Michael Hsiao and Chiu
Hei-yuan, and Ku Chung-hwa, chairman of the Citizen Congress Watch.</P>
      <P>According to a statement signed by the initiators, the court decision's to
continue the detention of Chen "seriously undermined the credibility of the
judiciary."</P>
      <P>The decision, the statement said, was based solely on irrelevant grounds, such
as that Chen has denied he committed any crime, that he has published a book
while in detention, that he has accepted visits from foreign journalists, that
he has applied to rejoin the DPP, and that he has claimed he is not in good
health.</P>
      <P>Although the alleged irregularities involving Chen and his family are
"disappointing, " his rights as a defendant must be upheld, according to the
statement.</P>
      <P>The former president was first detained Nov. 12, 2008 and released Dec. 13
following his indictment on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money
laundering.</P>
      <P>He was detained again Dec. 30 after the Taipei District Court approved a request
by prosecutors to take him back into custody.</P>
      <P>Rejecting Chen's repeated requests to be freed on bail, the court ruled in March
and again in May to continue his detention.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million
(US$3.15 million)  from a special Presidential  Office discretionary fund during
his presidency from 2000 to May 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes in connection with a land
procurement deal and kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a
government construction project. They allegedly wired and  stashed  the  funds
overseas  secretly  through  various intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The couple is still being probed on suspicion of helping several financial
conglomerates acquire financial holding companies in return for "political
contributions."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The stranded oil tanker Colombo Queen has left some coral formations off the
southern county of Pingtung damaged, although it remains to be determined how
much coral has been affected and to what extent, the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Results of a preliminary investigation show that an area of about 300 square
meters surrounding the 497-ton tanker has been affected, about 150 square meters
of which is covered with coral, said officials from the Construction and
Planning Administration under the MOI.</P>
      <P>The administration will continue to monitor the affected area to see whether any
fuel oil has leaked from the stranded ship and whether it has affected any other
marine life, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, work that began a day earlier to remove the 39,000 liters of fuel oil
from the stranded tanker was suspended Tuesday because of bad weather caused by
the approaching tropical storm Nangka, said the Pingtung County Environmental
Affairs Bureau.</P>
      <P>As tropical storm Nangka is poised to sweep toward the Bashi Channel and the
Taiwan Strait, the company authorized by the bureau to pump out the oil from the
Colombo Queen began working instead to prevent further damage to the ship by
strong winds that could trigger leakages.</P>
      <P>The ship, registered in the East African island nation of the Comoros, got stuck
on a reef just 50 meters from the coast in Pingtung County's scenic Jialeshuei
coastal park area Saturday during tropical storm Linfa.</P>
      <P>There were no signs of leakage from the vessel, but workers were called in to
remove the fuel oil from the tanker before the authorities ask its owner to
refloat the ship.</P>
      <P>The Colombo Queen was on its way from Hiroshima in Japan to Sri Lanka and local
authorities are concerned about a replay of the January 2001 Amorgos disaster,
in which 1,150 liters of oil spilled from a Greek ship stranded in the same
area. The valuable coral habitat took six years to recover from the damage,
while Taiwan's efforts to sue for compensation in international courts took even
longer.</P>

      <P>Many children raised by their grandparents said their family faces financial
difficulties and they often experience feelings of abandonment, according to the
results of a survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the non-profit Child Welfare League Foundation
(CWLF) to gauge the living conditions of the increasing number of Taiwanese
children being raised by their grandparents instead of their parents. According
to a government estimate, Taiwan now has more than 90,000  households  whose
breadwinners  are grandparents.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 14 percent of the respondents said their families did not
have fixed or regular income, which was 2.2 times that of those among normal
families.</P>
      <P>Most of the respondents' grandparents made a living scavenging because their age
and stamina limited their job opportunities. Against this backdrop, 56 percent
of the respondents said they often worry about their family's financial status.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 30 percent said they do not like their living quarters because the
houses were shabby, crowded, dirty, chaotic or had leaking roofs; and 32 percent
said they could seldom pay school fees or tuition on time.</P>
      <P>Up to 50 percent of the children surveyed said they feel that they are lagging
behind their peers or classmates in their academic studies and need additional
after-school tutoring; 52 percent said nobody could help them with their
homework. Only 30 percent said they can afford to attend afterschool talent
classes or cram schools.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 40 percent of the children who responded to the survey also said they
often feel abandoned and lonely.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 39 percent of the children had once slept or stayed
up overnight alone; 1 percent said they often or consistently take care of their
own daily life by themselves; and 70 percent said they have never or only
occasionally discussed things with grown-ups in their family.</P>
      <P>CWLF executives said the campus life or relationship of children raised by their
grandparents is worrisome as 50 percent of the respondents said they had been
bullied by their classmates over the past two months and 5 percent said they
were harassed by classmates every school day.</P>
      <P>With the approach of summer vacation, the CWLF launched a campaign Thursday to
raise funds to help school children raised by their grandparents attend talent
classes or after-school classes during summer break.</P>
      <P>The foundation began the survey late last year, targeting mainly fourth-to-sixth
grade students from families with their grandparents as key breadwinners.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,487 valid samples were collected. The survey results had a 99
percent confidence level and a margin of error of less than 2 percent.</P>

      <P>Law enforcement authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will step up
joint efforts to curb financial fraud that targets Chinese citizens, an aviation
police officer said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement came one day after Taoyuan prosecutors,  in conjunction with some
60 police officers from various agencies, busted two Taiwan-based fraud rings
that were duping Chinese citizens into transferring sums of money to bank
accounts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The law enforcement agents, in a raid on a residential building in Guanyin
township in Taoyuan County, arrested 10 suspects and seized a number of
computers, phone handsets, some 10 guidebooks, and several accounting books,
according to the police officer.</P>
      <P>Most of the victims of the phone scams were Chinese citizens who were told by
impersonators  of China's Public Security Bureau personnel that their phone
bills were in arrears and they needed to transfer payments to designated
accounts, the police officer said.</P>
      <P>The files stored on the computers that were seized could yield more information
how many Chinese people were defrauded, the officer added.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau will collaborate with China's Public Security
Bureau to obtain statements from the victims' via video links, the officer said.</P>
      <P>In another raid, seven people were arrested on suspicion of placing fake
employment ads in newspapers and convincing job seekers to open new bank
accounts, the officer disclosed. These accounts were later used, in a joint
operation by the two fraud rings, to accept transfers from the Chinese citizens
who fell for the phone bill story, he added.</P>
      <P>All of the suspects were referred to the Taoyuan Persecutors Office for
investigation, the officer said.</P>

      <P>The number of tourist arrivals posted a 13.9 percent annual increase in the
first five months of this year, with the number of visitors from China
registering the largest surge, the government's statistics agency reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Up to 415,000 Chinese tourists visited Taiwan between January and May,  marking
a 2.8-fold increase year-on-year,  according  to statistics released by the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies compiled by the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of

the largest increase, although the number of visitors from Hong Kong and Macau
also increased an encouraging 26.3 percent during the five-month period.</P>
      <P>In contrast, visitor numbers from all other areas posted negative growth, with
the number of tourists from South Korea experiencing the steepest fall, down
41.9 percent year-on-year to 75,000. This was followed by an 11.7 percent drop

      <P>Three agreements signed by the top negotiators from the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait in late April took effect Thursday,  paving the way for closer cross-
strait cooperation in the financial, civil aviation and judicial fields.</P>
      <P>Under the three agreements, the two sides will expand direct cross-strait flight
services, cooperate in financial services, work together to fight crime and
offer judicial aid to each other.</P>
      <P>The three pacts were sealed in Nanjing in central China April 26 by Chiang Pin-
kung, chairman of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and
his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association
of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>According to the aviation service expansion pact, the number of direct cross-
strait flights will be significantly increased and will cover more destinations.</P>
      <P>However, a provision in the aviation agreement for mutual tax exemption will not
take effect along with the other clauses because a relevant law revision failed
to clear the legislative floor due to a boycott from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said the tax exemption clause
will be implemented later after the opposition has been overcome.</P>
      <P>As to when the two sides will sign a memorandum of understanding on cooperation
in financial supervision to pave the way for local banks and other financial
service companies to enter the Chinese market and vice versa, Liu said that
relevant negotiations are proceeding between the Cabinet-level Financial
Supervisory Commission and its Chinese counterpart and may reach a conclusion
soon.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait judicial aid, Liu said, local citizens intending to
travel to China to visit their family members serving times at Chinese prisons
are advised to seek assistance of the Ministry of Justice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Agricultural authorities said U.S. beef safe for consumption</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
06/25/09  19:10:13
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the issue over whether Taiwan should fully open its market to U.S. beef draws
public debate, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday it
believes that the products do not pose a health threat as long as the
potentially risky parts of the cattle are removed.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuei-sen, director of the COA Animal Industry Department, said his
department believes that "there should be no animal quarantine concerns" over
U.S. beef once the cattle undergo health checks before and after they are
slaughtered and the specified risk materials (SRMs) are taken off and discarded
during the slaughtering process.</P>
      <P>Hsu said his department came to this conclusion based on a decision by the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH),
which determined that U.S. beef, regardless of the age of the cattle, was safe.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently only allows boneless U.S. beef from cattle younger than 30
months of age to be imported, but the government is considering agreeing to a
U.S. request to allow imports of U.S. beef from all cattle, regardless of age,
and some beef with bones, to be imported, as long as the parts considered
potentially risky are removed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- was diagnosed in Seattle. The ban was
lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle aged
under 30 months, but the government reimposed the ban two months later when a
second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months of age, produced by certified slaughterhouses
and without any risky parts of the cattle.</P>
      <P>These include the brain, skull, eyes, trigeminal ganglion, notochord, backbone,
and spinal nerve root, as well as all the cattle's tonsil and small intestines,
according to information on the DOH's Web site.</P>
      <P>The deadly disease is passed on to humans through affected beef.</P>
      <P>With only boneless U.S. beef from young cows being allowed, the U.S. supplies 32
percent of Taiwan's beef consumed, much lower than the over 50 percent prior to
the ban against beef from older cows.</P>
      <P>Hsu on Thursday also noted that the United States has been recognized by the OIE
as having a controlled risk to mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>A controlled risk means the beef is safe once the cattle undergo health checks
before and after slaughtering and the specified risk materials (SRMs) are
removed during slaughtering.</P>
      <P>Hsu also pointed out that Taiwan, as a World Trade Organization member, is
obliged to open its market to beef imports.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will import foreign beef as long as they meet existing food
safety standards.</P>
      <P>However, his office, the COA, and DOH have both stopped short of openly
endorsing a full market opening for U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan told the media that there is no
timetable for fully opening the local market to U.S. beef. The issue also
depends on whether the public will accept the product, he said.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks after Harry Tseng, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs'
Department of North American Affairs expressed optimism over the timeline for
full market opening.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports about 73,000 tons of beef a year, mostly from Australia, the U.S.
and New Zealand, according to COA tallies.</P>
      <P>Allowing a full resumption of U.S. beef imports will not affect Taiwan's
domestic market for locally-produced beef, Hsu said, because locally produced
beef amounted to only 6,000 tons a year, accounting for just 7.6 percent of the
total beef consumed in the country.</P>
      <P>The government's softened attitude, however, triggered protests from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DDP) , which denounced the Kuomintang-
led administration for "conducting political trading with people's health."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Sing-nan said the government should safeguard people's
health and should not be allowed to make compromises on the matter.</P>
      <P>He called for every person in the country to telephone the DOH to directly raise
their objections to the attempt to open Taiwan's doors fully to U.S. beef.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With tropical storm Nangka approaching Taiwan from the Philippines, the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) said Thursday that a Pacific high pressure system will
determine how close the storm will come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, Nangka was located 350 km west northwest of the
Philippines capital of Manila as of 2 p.m. that day, moving in a north-
northwesterly direction at a speed of 20 kph.</P>
      <P>After detecting that the high pressure system was strengthening, a CWB
meteorologist said that if the process is fast enough, the system will become so
strong that it will force the storm west, moving it closer to China than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the weather bureau issued a heavy rain alert for northern and eastern

      <P>Over 60 percent of the hotels which normally cater to foreign tourists in
Kaohsiung City have been booked ahead of the World Games to be held in the
southern Taiwanese port city in July, a business source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chun-liang, CEO of the Kaohsiung Tourist Hotel Association, said the
occupancy rates at eight local tourism hotels are averaging close to 70 percent
over the period from July 13-29, which overlaps with the period when the games
will be held from July 16-26.</P>
      <P>Lin attributed the good occupancy rate at the eight hotels to business generated
by the Kaohsiung Organizing Committee (KOC), which is organizing the games.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the occupancy rate at other hotels in the city also hit around 60
percent, Lin said.</P>
      <P>To support the games, 29 hotels affiliated with the association are offering
their rooms at a preferential price of NT$2,000 (US$61) each on average, Lin
noted, adding that the association is also keen on promoting tourism in
Kaohsiung on the occasion of the World Games at a time when it is also a peak
season for domestic travel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chengching Lake tourism area in neighboring Kaohsiung County's
Niaosong township is undergoing an overhaul, including environmental cleanup and
facilities renewal, to embrace the World Games and lure tourists.</P>
      <P>Two competitions of the World Games -- field archery and orienteering -- will be
held in the scenic area of more than 200 hectares.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, an increased number of Chinese and Japanese tourists have
visited the area, said a local official.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen joined a
group of academics and social activists Thursday to initiate a drive calling for
an end to what they argue is the "unjustified detention" of former President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"The detention lacks legal necessity and legitimacy. Through this action, we
want to highlight the unreasonableness of the existing detention system," Tsai
said in a news conference.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she hopes the drive will help muster the power of the public to
promote reforms to the judicial system.</P>
      <P>Co-sponsors  of the action included former Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-
tseh, Taiwan Bar Association Chairman Wellington Koo, Judicial Reform Foundation
Chairman Huang Jui-ming, former Awakening Foundation Chairwoman Lee Yuan-chen,
and Academic Sinica academician Chen Chien-jen.</P>
      <P>Also on the list were Chen Hwei-syin, dean of the College of Law at National
Chengchi University, Academia Sinica research fellows Michael Hsiao and Chiu
Hei-yuan, and Ku Chung-hwa, chairman of the Citizen Congress Watch.</P>
      <P>According to a statement signed by the initiators, the court decision's to
continue the detention of Chen "seriously undermined the credibility of the
judiciary."</P>
      <P>The decision, the statement said, was based solely on irrelevant grounds, such
as that Chen has denied he committed any crime, that he has published a book
while in detention, that he has accepted visits from foreign journalists, that
he has applied to rejoin the DPP, and that he has claimed he is not in good
health.</P>
      <P>Although the alleged irregularities involving Chen and his family are
"disappointing, " his rights as a defendant must be upheld, according to the
statement.</P>
      <P>The former president was first detained Nov. 12, 2008 and released Dec. 13
following his indictment on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money
laundering.</P>
      <P>He was detained again Dec. 30 after the Taipei District Court approved a request
by prosecutors to take him back into custody.</P>
      <P>Rejecting Chen's repeated requests to be freed on bail, the court ruled in March
and again in May to continue his detention.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million
(US$3.15 million)  from a special Presidential  Office discretionary fund during
his presidency from 2000 to May 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes in connection with a land
procurement deal and kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a
government construction project. They allegedly wired and  stashed  the  funds
overseas  secretly  through  various intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The couple is still being probed on suspicion of helping several financial
conglomerates acquire financial holding companies in return for "political
contributions."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Stranded oil tanker damages coral in southern Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The stranded oil tanker Colombo Queen has left some coral formations off the
southern county of Pingtung damaged, although it remains to be determined how
much coral has been affected and to what extent, the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Results of a preliminary investigation show that an area of about 300 square
meters surrounding the 497-ton tanker has been affected, about 150 square meters
of which is covered with coral, said officials from the Construction and
Planning Administration under the MOI.</P>
      <P>The administration will continue to monitor the affected area to see whether any
fuel oil has leaked from the stranded ship and whether it has affected any other
marine life, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, work that began a day earlier to remove the 39,000 liters of fuel oil
from the stranded tanker was suspended Tuesday because of bad weather caused by
the approaching tropical storm Nangka, said the Pingtung County Environmental
Affairs Bureau.</P>
      <P>As tropical storm Nangka is poised to sweep toward the Bashi Channel and the
Taiwan Strait, the company authorized by the bureau to pump out the oil from the
Colombo Queen began working instead to prevent further damage to the ship by
strong winds that could trigger leakages.</P>
      <P>The ship, registered in the East African island nation of the Comoros, got stuck
on a reef just 50 meters from the coast in Pingtung County's scenic Jialeshuei
coastal park area Saturday during tropical storm Linfa.</P>
      <P>There were no signs of leakage from the vessel, but workers were called in to
remove the fuel oil from the tanker before the authorities ask its owner to
refloat the ship.</P>
      <P>The Colombo Queen was on its way from Hiroshima in Japan to Sri Lanka and local
authorities are concerned about a replay of the January 2001 Amorgos disaster,
in which 1,150 liters of oil spilled from a Greek ship stranded in the same
area. The valuable coral habitat took six years to recover from the damage,
while Taiwan's efforts to sue for compensation in international courts took even
longer.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many children raised by their grandparents said their family faces financial
difficulties and they often experience feelings of abandonment, according to the
results of a survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the non-profit Child Welfare League Foundation
(CWLF) to gauge the living conditions of the increasing number of Taiwanese
children being raised by their grandparents instead of their parents. According
to a government estimate, Taiwan now has more than 90,000  households  whose
breadwinners  are grandparents.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 14 percent of the respondents said their families did not
have fixed or regular income, which was 2.2 times that of those among normal
families.</P>
      <P>Most of the respondents' grandparents made a living scavenging because their age
and stamina limited their job opportunities. Against this backdrop, 56 percent
of the respondents said they often worry about their family's financial status.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 30 percent said they do not like their living quarters because the
houses were shabby, crowded, dirty, chaotic or had leaking roofs; and 32 percent
said they could seldom pay school fees or tuition on time.</P>
      <P>Up to 50 percent of the children surveyed said they feel that they are lagging
behind their peers or classmates in their academic studies and need additional
after-school tutoring; 52 percent said nobody could help them with their
homework. Only 30 percent said they can afford to attend afterschool talent
classes or cram schools.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 40 percent of the children who responded to the survey also said they
often feel abandoned and lonely.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 39 percent of the children had once slept or stayed
up overnight alone; 1 percent said they often or consistently take care of their
own daily life by themselves; and 70 percent said they have never or only
occasionally discussed things with grown-ups in their family.</P>
      <P>CWLF executives said the campus life or relationship of children raised by their
grandparents is worrisome as 50 percent of the respondents said they had been
bullied by their classmates over the past two months and 5 percent said they
were harassed by classmates every school day.</P>
      <P>With the approach of summer vacation, the CWLF launched a campaign Thursday to
raise funds to help school children raised by their grandparents attend talent
classes or after-school classes during summer break.</P>
      <P>The foundation began the survey late last year, targeting mainly fourth-to-sixth
grade students from families with their grandparents as key breadwinners.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,487 valid samples were collected. The survey results had a 99
percent confidence level and a margin of error of less than 2 percent.</P>

      <P>Law enforcement authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will step up
joint efforts to curb financial fraud that targets Chinese citizens, an aviation
police officer said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement came one day after Taoyuan prosecutors,  in conjunction with some
60 police officers from various agencies, busted two Taiwan-based fraud rings
that were duping Chinese citizens into transferring sums of money to bank
accounts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The law enforcement agents, in a raid on a residential building in Guanyin
township in Taoyuan County, arrested 10 suspects and seized a number of
computers, phone handsets, some 10 guidebooks, and several accounting books,
according to the police officer.</P>
      <P>Most of the victims of the phone scams were Chinese citizens who were told by
impersonators  of China's Public Security Bureau personnel that their phone
bills were in arrears and they needed to transfer payments to designated
accounts, the police officer said.</P>
      <P>The files stored on the computers that were seized could yield more information
how many Chinese people were defrauded, the officer added.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau will collaborate with China's Public Security
Bureau to obtain statements from the victims' via video links, the officer said.</P>
      <P>In another raid, seven people were arrested on suspicion of placing fake
employment ads in newspapers and convincing job seekers to open new bank
accounts, the officer disclosed. These accounts were later used, in a joint
operation by the two fraud rings, to accept transfers from the Chinese citizens
who fell for the phone bill story, he added.</P>
      <P>All of the suspects were referred to the Taoyuan Persecutors Office for
investigation, the officer said.</P>

      <P>The number of tourist arrivals posted a 13.9 percent annual increase in the
first five months of this year, with the number of visitors from China
registering the largest surge, the government's statistics agency reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Up to 415,000 Chinese tourists visited Taiwan between January and May,  marking

also increased an encouraging 26.3 percent during the five-month period.</P>
      <P>In contrast, visitor numbers from all other areas posted negative growth, with
the number of tourists from South Korea experiencing the steepest fall, down

      <P>Three agreements signed by the top negotiators from the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait in late April took effect Thursday,  paving the way for closer cross-
strait cooperation in the financial, civil aviation and judicial fields.</P>
      <P>Under the three agreements, the two sides will expand direct cross-strait flight
services, cooperate in financial services, work together to fight crime and
offer judicial aid to each other.</P>
      <P>The three pacts were sealed in Nanjing in central China April 26 by Chiang Pin-
kung, chairman of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and
his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association
of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>According to the aviation service expansion pact, the number of direct cross-
strait flights will be significantly increased and will cover more destinations.</P>
      <P>However, a provision in the aviation agreement for mutual tax exemption will not
take effect along with the other clauses because a relevant law revision failed
to clear the legislative floor due to a boycott from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said the tax exemption clause
will be implemented later after the opposition has been overcome.</P>
      <P>As to when the two sides will sign a memorandum of understanding on cooperation
in financial supervision to pave the way for local banks and other financial
service companies to enter the Chinese market and vice versa, Liu said that
relevant negotiations are proceeding between the Cabinet-level Financial
Supervisory Commission and its Chinese counterpart and may reach a conclusion
soon.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait judicial aid, Liu said, local citizens intending to
travel to China to visit their family members serving times at Chinese prisons
are advised to seek assistance of the Ministry of Justice.</P>

      <P>Three agreements signed by the top negotiators from the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait in late April took effect Thursday,  paving the way for closer cross-
strait cooperation in the financial, civil aviation and judicial fields.</P>
      <P>Under the three agreements, the two sides will expand direct cross-strait flight
services, cooperate in financial services, work together to fight crime and
offer judicial aid to each other.</P>
      <P>The three pacts were sealed in Nanjing in central China April 26 by Chiang Pin-
kung, chairman of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and
his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association
of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>According to the aviation service expansion pact, the number of direct cross-
strait flights will be significantly increased and will cover more destinations.</P>
      <P>However, a provision in the aviation agreement for mutual tax exemption will not
take effect along with the other clauses because a relevant law revision failed
to clear the legislative floor due to a boycott from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said the tax exemption clause
will be implemented later after the opposition has been overcome.</P>
      <P>As to when the two sides will sign a memorandum of understanding on cooperation
in financial supervision to pave the way for local banks and other financial
service companies to enter the Chinese market and vice versa, Liu said that
relevant negotiations are proceeding between the Cabinet-level Financial
Supervisory Commission and its Chinese counterpart and may reach a conclusion
soon.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait judicial aid, Liu said, local citizens intending to
travel to China to visit their family members serving times at Chinese prisons
are advised to seek assistance of the Ministry of Justice.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: On baby-killing by mothers</P>
      <P>Several cases of mothers killing their newborns have been reported in Taiwan
over the past year. The latest of such cases occurred Thursday, with experts
speculating that the tragedy could be the result of postpartum depression.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon is puzzling, but it is also an indication that Taiwanese society
is sick.</P>
      <P>Depression and stress experienced by mothers can be relieved through
psychological or psychiatric therapy, assistance by social workers, and support
from their families. However, when it comes to the traditional burdens of
childbearing imposed on women and the unhealthy atmosphere of local society, it
is the government that is responsible.</P>
      <P>China Times: On the soft power of Taiwan's younger generation</P>
      <P>Taiwan set a glorious record recently when 10 students from Shih Chien
University were chosen to show their work at the Space Time Gallery of SIGGRAPH
2009 -- the world's premier forum for computer graphics and interactive
techniques. One of the students, Chao Hua-chun, won third place for his project
Mad Evolution, in the interactive works category of the Space Time Student
Competition and Exhibition.</P>
      <P>The brilliant performance of Taiwan's students and businesses in the fields of
animation, game development and design in recent years shows that Taiwan's
creativity is exploding. It also rings in the opportunity for industrial
transformation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is seeking opportunities for economic breakthroughs in a "post-
manufacturing age." How to build a proper connection between the talent trained
in schools and the demands of business is crucial to whether Taiwan's economy
can successfully reach a new climax.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On "economic democracy"</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) recently said that its push
for a referendum on the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China was aimed at establishing an "economic democracy" system. When
discussing this issue,  the DPP should first examine its poor performance in
practicing  "economic  democracy"  in the eight years  of its administration.</P>
      <P>The essence of "economic democracy" lies in adopting a rational approach in
terms of governance, rather than engaging in political maneuvering such as
promoting referendums.</P>
      <P>With more than 10 countries having signed a free trade agreement with China and
more than 20 others ready to do so, whether Taiwan should sign an ECFA with
China is no longer an issue. The real issue here is how Taiwan can avoid the
possible disadvantages of such an agreement. Instead of pandering to populism
and making ECFA its political toy, the DPP should play its role as an opposition
party properly and contribute its opinions on "how" the ECFA should be signed.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On President Ma's bid for the KMT chairmanship</P>
      <P>When registering Thursday to run in the next ruling Kuomintang chairmanship
election, President Ma Ying-jeou said the bid is aimed at assuming his "new
historic responsibility." This responsibility probably refers to the unification
of Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Upon returning to the party helm, Ma will gain full control over the tempo of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations; and in his capacity as KMT chairman, he will also
be able to meet his Chinese Communist Party counterpart Hu Jintao. This would
increase his chances of success in promoting his "economy comes before politics"
strategy for achieving unification.</P>
      <P>Ma already proved himself incompetent during his previous KMT chairmanship. Now
that he is ready to regain the leadership to realize his dream of grasping more
power, not only should the Taiwanese people worry that he will bring together
all government and party resources to push for unification through closer
economic interaction with China, but the KMT should also begin to worry that Ma
would impose a strongman leadership to again make a mess of party affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan close to fully opening market to U.S. beef: U.S. official</HEADLINE>

06/26/09  16:01:23

    <TEXT>
      <P>A long-term call from the United States asking Taiwan to fully open its market
to U.S. beef will apparently be realized very soon, with Stephen M. Young,
director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), expressing confidence Friday
on the issue.</P>
      <P>Young said at his last biannual press conference before vacating the post in
July that ever since he became AIT director in March 2006 he has been seeking a
science-based approach to fully opening Taiwan's market to all U.S. beef by
working closely with the previous Chen Shui-bian administration  and the
incumbent  Ma Ying-jeou administration.</P>
      <P>"As I've always said publicly, all we were asking for was a science-based
determination that is grounded in the international standards set by the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) , " said Young, who serves as the de facto
U.S. ambassador to Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Such efforts seem to have received a great response from the government, with
Young pointing out that in recent days, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh
Ching-chuan and other officials from the Council of Agriculture and the Foreign
Ministry have underscored his point.</P>
      <P>"I would be disingenuous if I didn't admit that I'm disappointed that I'm
preparing to leave (Taiwan) without this agreement having been reached but I
think we are very close," Young said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan at present only allows boneless U.S. beef from cattle younger than 30
months of age to be imported, but the government is considering agreeing to a
U.S. request to allow imports of U.S. beef from all cattle, regardless of age,
and some beef with bones, to be imported, as long as the parts considered
potentially risky are removed.</P>
      <P>Noting that imports of U.S. beef to Taiwan amounted to a record US$136 million
last year despite the restrictions on bone-in beef, Young said this indicates
that Taiwanese consumers already know what the American and many other consumers
around the world know about U.S. beef -- that it is safe for consumption.</P>
      <P>"It's time for the government to move forward, " Young said, calling at the same
time for the opposition parties to focus on the science and not the politics
surrounding the issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- was diagnosed in Seattle. The ban was
lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle aged
under 30 months, but the government reimposed the ban two months later when a
second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months of age, produced by certified slaughterhouses
and without any risky parts, such as brains, skulls, eyes, spinal nerve roots,
tonsils and small intestines.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, U.S. beef imports have been increased year-on-year.
At present, the U.S. supplies around 32 percent of Taiwan's beef, with the rest
coming mainly from New Zealand and Australia.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has urged China to tolerate different opinions and to uphold and realize
the universal values of human rights in response to Beijing's formal arrest of
prominent dissident Liu Xiaobo.</P>
      <P>Liu, a prominent writer and pro-reform activist, was formally arrested Wednesday
after being held incommunicado by police for more than six months in an unknown
location on charges of suspicion of "inciting subversion of state power."</P>
      <P>He was originally detained in early December 2008, just before the Charter 08 he
co-authored was due to be released.</P>
      <P>The charter called for democracy, protection of human rights, election of public
officials, freedom of expression and religion, and an end to the Communist
Party's monopoly over the military, judicial system and government.</P>
      <P>In response to the arrest that drew global attention. Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) spokesman Liu Te-shun said Thursday that all citizens should be able to
present their own views on national development and the government's direction
and that this is a natural phenomenon in a democratic society, one that China
should face up to.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) issued a statement
urging China's government to immediately release Liu.</P>
      <P>The DPP called on China to squarely face and respond to people's calls for
democratic  reform instead  of oppressing  and even threatening pro-democracy
activists.</P>
      <P>Saying that democracy, freedom and human rights have been recognized worldwide
as Taiwan's important assets, the DPP urged the Ma Ying-jeou administration to
publicly appeal to Chinese authorities for Liu's release and demonstrate the
country's support for China's pro-reform activists and the importance it
attaches to democracy and human rights.</P>

      <P>News of the sudden death of America's King of Pop Michael Jackson rippled
through Taiwan Friday, leaving many in the country's music community distraught
and nostalgic over his many hits.</P>
      <P>Yu Guang, a veteran music program host and concert agent said he was very sad
and confused over the pop star's sudden death at the age of 50.</P>
      <P>Yu, who invited Jackson to Taiwan in September 1993 for a concert, the third
stop in the pop icon's "Dangerous" concert tour around Asia, said the Michael
Jackson he knew was simple and pure and had a childlike innocence.</P>
      <P>But Jackson, Yu said, also loved and was single-mindedly devoted to music.</P>
      <P>Wu Chien-heng, a renowned Taipei DJ, said he had been a Jackson fan since when
he was in high school and loved to mimic Jackon's signature "moonwalk, " a dance
move that saw Jackson glide across the stage and set off an instant fad across
the globe.</P>
      <P>Wu said Jackson's "Thriller" in 1982 opened the door for him to Western pop
music, but he picks Jackson's 1991 hit "Black or White" as his favorite.</P>
      <P>"It was a great song with a global perspective and compassion, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said many pop icons have visited Taiwan and given concerts here over the
years, but none have been on a par with Jackson, who raised the standards of
music and performance to new heights.</P>
      <P>Jackson, whose hits also included "Billie Jean," "Off the Wall, " and "Bad, "
died Thursday in Los Angeles of cardiac arrest, leaving behind an unfulfilled
series of comeback concerts set for London in July and hefty debts.</P>
      <P>He was one of the most successful entertainers of all time, with 13 Grammy
Awards, 13 number one singles, several groundbreaking music videos, and sales of

diplomatic relations between the two countries, is scheduled to leave Taiwan in
July after concluding his three-year term as AIT director.</P>
      <P>Young said that while the U.S. welcomes the reduction of tensions between Taiwan
and China, it is also aware of the People's Republic of China's relentless
military buildup -- much of it directed at Taiwan --  and the Ma Ying-jeou
administration's  interest in continuing to pursue security cooperation with the
U.S.</P>

friends in that light and act at an appropriate time when there are decisions
about what types of defensive weapons might make the most sense to provide this

      <P>Describing the triangular relations among Taipei, Beijing and Washington, Young
said there have been times in the past when one side of the triangle was
stronger than others, but that one of the promising aspects at present is that
all three sides are fairly strong, and improving and growing.</P>
      <P>"An important point here is that President Ma and his government, despite its
very major focus on improving relations with Beijing, continues to believe it is
appropriate and necessary to have an active security cooperation relationship
with the U.S.," Young said.</P>
      <P>He added that Washington will continue to look closely at Taiwan's arms sales
requests and that it will not consult with Beijing on its security cooperation
or arms decisions involving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"That's the framework. The decision itself will be made by Washington under that
framework at a time and in a nature that reflect our own national interests as
well as our commitments to Taiwan," Young said.</P>
      <P>He believes that the efforts of all three of the triangle's sides can help
reduce the possibility that Taiwan might be a land mine in U.S.-China relations,
as some have suggested. Enditem/ls</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 26 (CNA) The United States is not concerned that advanced military
technologies will be leaked to China through its weapon sales to Taiwan because
Taiwan is capable of protecting such technologies, the top U.S. envoy to Taiwan
said Friday.</P>

from Taiwan because I think that Taiwan has very effective means in the
controlling of technology, " Stephen M. Young, director of the American

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Friday requested the Kaohsiung City government and
the Sports Affairs Council (SAC) to resolve an NT$200 million (US$6.06 million)
budget shortage for the 2009 World Games through negotiations.</P>
      <P>Making the appeal during a safety inspection of the World Games main stadium,
Liu said that to ensure the success of the event, it should in principle be held
by the local government and supported by the central government because of its
importance to the country.</P>
      <P>The city and central government should find ways to narrow the budget shortage
on the basis of not wasting public funds, Liu added.</P>
      <P>SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling, who was with Liu in Kaohsiung, said that once the
city government  applies for funds legally and reasonably, the SAC will
carefully review the application.</P>
      <P>The SAC slashed an NT$845 million budget approved for the World Games by NT$230
million earlier this month because of what it described as inflated and
overlapping funding requests by the city government.</P>
      <P>After further discussion, Kaohsiung still finds itself NT$190 million short of
its targeted budget.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, during his inspection of the World Games venues, the premier
expressed his concerns over the event's safety measures, the parachuting events,
and the certification of the athletes' villages and personnel and urged the
Kaohsiung Organizing Committee (KOC) to pay particular attention to these areas.</P>
      <P>The premier  noted  that  if individuals  duplicate  their applications for
permits, it could cause a loophole in security preparations.</P>
      <P>Referring to the kidnapping of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in
Munich, Liu asked the KOC to step up measures to ensure the safety of the hotels
that athletes will use.</P>
      <P>The premier also agreed to Kaohsiung's requests for the central government to
send 600 military police to maintain security during the event and to grant
visa-free treatment to Kenyan guests who will visit Taiwan during the games,
slated to be held July 16-26.</P>

      <P>Heads of three local governments from central Taiwan arrived in Beijing Friday
to promote agricultural products from central Taiwan, boost trade opportunities
and meet with Taiwanese businessmen operating in northern China.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu, accompanied by Taichung County Magistrate Huang
Chung-sheng and Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan, said the Taiwanese
delegation with nearly 200 members from four cities and counties was the biggest
ever to visit Beijing.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching was also expected to be part of the
group, but he backed out after learning tropical storm Nangka might hit Taiwan
in the next few days and sent Chen Chao-wang, chief of the county's agricultural
bureau, on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Hu said the group had brought many special agricultural products to the capital
city to share with the Chinese people, after similar promotional trips to Hong
Kong, Macau and Xiamen had met with considerable success.</P>
      <P>Cho, heading a group that also comprised members of an alliance of industrial
and business associations from the four cities and counties, said before leaving
Taiwan earlier in the day that the group's mission in Beijing is to sell
Taiwanese products and tourism to consumers in the vast markets of China's inner
provinces.</P>
      <P>The group will organize a trade fair and visit city officials during its stay in

      <P>Stephen M. Young, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), bid
farewell to local media Friday before stepping down from his post in July but
remained silent on the identity of his successor.</P>
      <P>Young, who assumed his post as AIT director in March 2006, said at his last
press conference with members of Taiwan's media before completing his three-year
term that Taiwan and the United States were very close to working out the
identity of his successor.</P>
      <P>When a decision is made, he said, the announcement will be made in Washington.</P>
      <P>Speculation in Washington has centered on William A. Stanton, deputy chief of
mission to the Republic of Korea, as the most likely diplomat to succeed Young.</P>
      <P>Describing his job as a relay competition, the 10th AIT director said that he
has followed the steps of his nine distinguished and competent  predecessors,
and  he would  consider  it a great accomplishment if he had done his job as
effectively as them.</P>
      <P>"You don't want to drop the baton. You want to pass it on. I feel that I've
carried the baton now for three years and four months as the director and I'm
ready to pass it on," Young said.</P>
      <P>"I've not dropped it yet and I am almost finished," he added.</P>
      <P>Young said he is glad that he has been able to have a good frank dialogue with
Taiwan's government and its people about many areas of the very close
relationship between Taiwan and the U.S.</P>
      <P>"Our relations with Taiwan today governed by the Taiwan Relations Act and other
aspects of our China policy are in good shape. They are in good shape because we
have so much in common, both in values and in interests, " Young said, referring
to stronger protection of intellectual property rights, a possible investment
agreement, and e-commerce cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Obama administration is also working with Taiwan to clinch an extradition
pact that will enhance the already strong law enforcement cooperation between
the two countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Nearing the end of his fifth stay in Taiwan over the past 46 years, Young, who
is an enthusiastic cyclist, said that he will go back to the U.S. with four
Giant bicycles manufactured in Taiwan and that he would love to visit this
beautiful island again in the future.</P>
      <P>Though the exact date Young will leave Taiwan has yet to be confirmed, he will
depart shortly after presiding over a function July 2 to celebrate U.S.
Independence Day.</P>

      <P>A patient suffering from blood coagulation abnormalities and mental disorders
was the most-frequent user of the National Health Insurance  (NHI)  system in
2007,  making 576 insurance-covered medical visits during the year, the Bureau
of National Health Insurance said Friday.</P>
      <P>This means that the patient visited hospitals almost twice a day except for
holidays, said Chang Shu-ling, manager of the bureau's Medical Affairs Section.</P>
      <P>Chang mentioned the case while briefing the NHI Supervisory Committee on the
bureau's measures to control abuses of the insurance program.</P>
      <P>Chang said that at present, any person covered by the insurance system who makes
more than 200 medical visits a year or more than 20 visits in a month will be
monitored and offered counseling by the bureau.</P>
      <P>There were 376 people who made more than 200 doctor visits in 2007, and 9,176
people who made more than 20 visits in a given month in 2008, she said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the two most common abnormal patterns in among local
patients were an unusually high frequency of medical visits and unusually high
expenses.</P>
      <P>While high visit frequencies are usually seen among patients with mental
disorders, high expenses often occur in treating patients suffering from cancer
or serious illnesses, she said.</P>
      <P>Through the control measures adopted by the bureau, the average number of
medical visits by high-frequency users decreased by 20 percent in 2007 and 50
percent in 2008, bureau statistics show.</P>

      <P>The Chiayi County branch of the Tzu Chi General Hospital has reaped a greater-
than-expected harvest of organic rice recently and will distribute the crop to
followers of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation around the world,
a hospital spokeswoman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ho Zi-yi, a section chief of Tzu Chi General Hospital's Dalin Branch in charge
of human affairs, said a total of 840 kilograms of the rice was harvested last
week from an experimental farm operated by the branch.</P>
      <P>The organic rice will be packed into small gift bags to be distributed worldwide
to enable Tzu Chi followers to share the harvest, Ho said.</P>
      <P>She said the harvest of the Taigeng No. 2 rice strain was considered a precious
gift from God, as rice farmers in eastern Taiwan lost all of the year's first
harvest of the Taigeng No. 4 rice strain because of a string of cold spells that
hit Taiwan in April.</P>
      <P>The Taigeng No. 2 strain is stronger in terms of pest and cold weather
resistance, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The Dalin Branch is the only one of the Tzu Chi General Hospital's six branches

      <P>In addition to running health institutions in Taiwan, Tzu Chi Foundation,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leading economic indicators in May pointed upwards for the second consecutive
month, providing a glimmer of hope that Taiwan's economic slump could ease in
the near future, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The monitoring score for Taiwan's leading indicators was 12 in May, up one point
from April, but the indicators continued to flash a "blue" signal for the ninth
consecutive month, a sign that the local economy remains in recession, the CEPD
said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council uses five colors to measure domestic economic  health,
with "red" indicating  serious  overheating, "yellow-red" for light overheating,
"green" for steady growth, "yellow-blue" for a slowdown, and "blue" for
recession.</P>
      <P>Most other indicators showed positive cyclical movement in May, according to the
CEPD report. The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer of the
economic outlook for the coming three months -- moved higher by 3.3 percent in
May from the previous month to 94.9, rising for the fourth consecutive month.</P>
      <P>The annualized six-month rate of change of the leading indicators index rose by
7.8 percentage points from April to 3.5 percent -- the first positive figure in
16 months.</P>
      <P>All seven leading indicator components, except for new building permits,
contributed positively to the index.</P>
      <P>Export orders, average monthly overtime in industry and services, book-to-bill
ratios in the semiconductor machinery industry, monetary aggregate M1B, stock
prices, and producers' inventory all showed positive movement, the report
showed.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which represents the current economic
situation, stood at 87.4 in May, up 2.7 percent from the previous month. It grew
for the fourth consecutive month, the CEPD said.</P>

      <P>Another local travel agent announced Friday that financial woes had forced it
out of business, the latest sign that the global economic recession and the
recent scare over the swine flu outbreak continue to take a toll on local tour
operators.</P>
      <P>Taipei-based Long Way Travel Service Co. said Friday it was shutting down
because of operating difficulties and accumulated debts of more than NT$10
million (US$300,000).</P>
      <P>Long Way became the second industry casualty in the past month after Skylark
Travel Service Co., a prominent travel agent known for organizing high-end group
tours to Japan, also ended operations recently because of similar cash flow
problems after a potential buyout by Tsann Kuen Trans-Nation Group fell through.</P>
      <P>Both Long Way and Skylark enjoyed good reputations in the local tourism sector.</P>
      <P>According to the Travel Quality Assurance Association of the Republic of China,
a bad economy is the prime reason behind the difficulties facing many travel
agents.</P>
      <P>Amid a lingering economic crunch, many people have opted to cut down on travel
to save money, and a full recovery for travel agents might be still some ways
off, sources familiar with the business said.</P>
      <P>A Long Way employee told the Central News Agency that the number of tours
organized by the agency since the beginning of this year had fallen by 30
percent to 40 percent compared to the previous year's level.</P>
      <P>Long Way specializes in tours to Southeast Asian countries, which normally
attract large numbers of Taiwanese tourists, but have suffered this year along
with most other destinations.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, Taiwanese took 3.24 million trips abroad in
the first five months of the year, 10 percent fewer than during the same period
in 2008.</P>
      <P>The monthly number for May also dropped by 13.28 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Travel to Japan, usually one of the most popular overseas destinations among
Taiwanese tourists with more than 1 million visits a year, has been particularly
hard hit.</P>
      <P>Only 80,382 Taiwanese visited Japan in May, compared to 124,440 visits in the
same month last year, a year-on-year decline of 35.41 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's tourist departures to Thailand also shrank to 21,558 in May
this year, from 33,896 in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Foreign tourist arrivals to Taiwan in May,  not including travelers from China,
also were down, by an annual rate of 18.55 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of tourists from Japan and South Korea visiting Taiwan last month
fell by 18.46 percent and 39.1 percent, respectively, while the number from
Singapore and Malaysia also declined by 28.69 percent and 39.77 percent, the
statistics show.</P>
      <P>Although more Chinese tourists came to Taiwan in March and April, business
sources said the outbreak of swine flu, known officially as influenza A (H1N1)
has affected their willingness to travel.</P>
      <P>In April, an average of 3,280 Chinese tourists entered Taiwan per day, but that
number fell to 1,500 per day in late May and has averaged only 950 per day so
far in June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to step up monitoring of oil used in fast food chains</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) sent test paper that detects the acid value of
cooking oil to local fast food chains to help them monitor the quality of the
oil they are using to fry foods.</P>
      <P>The DOH said acid value is an indicator  of whether the composition of the oil
has changed due to repeated use, and that the maximum acceptable acid value will
be adjusted downwards to 2.0 mg KOH/g from the original 2.5.</P>
      <P>The acid value measures how many milligrams  of potassium hydroxide (KOH) it
takes to neutralize the fatty acids found in one gram of oil.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ching-hsin, a senior technical specialist in the DOH's Department of Food
Safety, said that virgin oil should have an acid value approaching zero but that
the figure rises with repeated use as the oil rancidifies and fatty acids are
created.</P>
      <P>"Fast-food operators should use the test paper to manage and replace the oil
they use," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Local health authorities will now list the edible oil used in fast food chains
as one of the priorities when they conduct spot checks on food safety, he added.</P>
      <P>The move comes after spot checks carried out by the Taipei County government
Sunday found that some big name fast food outlets did not change their frying
oil on a daily basis, prompting worries that the continued use of the oil would
release carcinogenic substances and pose a health hazard to consumers.</P>
      <P>Fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, KFC, Burger King, Pizza Hut and Napoli
Pizza sent representatives Friday to listen to a briefing on the DOH's latest
regulations.</P>
      <P>Some of them, including McDonald's and KFC, said they would follow the
guidelines recommended by the DOH.</P>
      <P>Food safety officials said that restaurants are required to make improvements if
the oil they are using does not meet the standard. Those failing to follow the
guidelines will be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Chuang Chia-jung hopes to re-establish herself as one of the world's
top-ranked women's doubles players with a strong showing at Wimbledon, and she
got off to a good start Thursday despite fighting pain in her lower back.</P>
      <P>Chuang and partner Sania Mirza of India, seeded 15th in this year's women's
doubles, needed only 79 minutes to finish off Americans Jill Craybas and Carly
Gullickson 6-4, 6-2 in a first round match to set up a second round encounter
with unseeded Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia and Monica Nicolescu of Romania.</P>
      <P>Chuang told the Central News Agency that she had been suffering from a lower
back strain in the days prior to her doubles opener, and she said the pain
intensified Thursday.</P>
      <P>She got a massage and took pain killers prior to the match, which helped to some
extent, but her movement was still limited during the encounter.</P>
      <P>After climbing as high as fifth in the women's doubles rankings in August 2008
while partnering with compatriot Chan Yung-jan, Chuang's ranking has suffered
since.</P>
      <P>The duo broke up over personal differences soon after a poor showing at the
Beijing Olympics (second round) and the US Open (first round) , and with Chuang
playing with six different partners since then, her ranking has plummeted to
27th.</P>
      <P>But Chuang believes her pairing with Mirza, which began in March and has led to
a WTA Tour win and three semifinal appearances, has potential.</P>
      <P>"Our chemistry is getting better, she said.Mirza has a good forehand and is
excellent from the baseline, while my strengths are my backhand and I'm pretty
good at net. We complement each other well and could continue playing together
in the future.</P>
      <P>The two were eliminated in the second round of the French Open, but hope to do
better at Wimbledon, where Chuang and Chan crashed out in the first round last
year. The question now is how much they will be affected by Chuang's injury.</P>
      <P>Chuang remains the last Taiwanese player remaining in a singles or doubles draw
(not including the mixed doubles).</P>
      <P>Lu Yen-hsun was ousted in the first round of the men's singles by second seed
Roger Federer and in the first round of the men's doubles (paired with Bjorn
Phau of Germany) by Russians Igor Andreev and Evgeny Korolev in straight sets.</P>
      <P>Chan was crushed in the women's singles by 12th seed Marion Bartoli of France,
and lost her first round doubles match, paired with Hungary's Agnes Szavay, to
Russia's Vera Dushevina and Tatiana Perebiynis of the Ukraine 7-5, 3-6, 6-4.</P>
      <P>A bigger surprise was when fifth seeds Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan and Peng Shuai of
China lost their first round match on Thursday to Sorana Cirstea of Romania and
Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark 6-4, 2-6, 6-2.</P>
      <P>Though neither Cirstea or Wozniacki are highly ranked in doubles, they both have
reached the third round of the women's singles and proved to be too good for the
Taiwan-China pairing.</P>
      <P>Peng, who lost a three-hour singles match earlier in the day, said the energy-
sapping singles match affected her performance in the later doubles.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and Peng reached  the quarterfinals  of this year's Australian Open and
the semifinals of the French Open, catapulting Hsieh to No. 11 in the world in
women's doubles, above both her more storied compatriots Chuang and Chan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1963 death of German priest confirmed by local policeman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A policeman stationed in Pingtung County recently tracked down the tomb of a
Catholic missionary from Germany at the behest of his family members, who were
never fully convinced by reports that the priest had died in the southern Taiwan
county in 1963.</P>
      <P>Tien-Hsiang Chen-ling, a member of the Chaojhou police department in Pingtung
County, was assigned to find out the truth at the request of Father Sebastian M.
Heuken's family members, who wanted any documents that could prove Heuken's
death.</P>
      <P>According to Heuken's younger brother Karl, the priest had worked at a Catholic
church in Chaojhou since his arrival in Taiwan in 1960.</P>
      <P>Karl said his brother reportedly died in a traffic accident and was buried in
the small town, but he questioned the report's accuracy because he never
received his brother's death certificate.</P>
      <P>Tien-Hsiang said it was the most difficult case he had ever investigated because
there were no clues indicating the priest's existence.</P>
      <P>"I could find nothing at local household offices, other police stations and
traffic police divisions," the police officer said.</P>
      <P>After turning to local churches, he finally discovered that the missionary's
remains were buried at a Chaojhou church cemetery. Heuken's tombstone was
engraved with Chinese characters reading "the tomb of Father Ho Li-chien" and
his German name.</P>
      <P>Tien-Hsiang said he also visited an 86-year-old Catholic nun from Switzerland in
Pingtung's Jiandong Township who had worked with Heuken to gain first-hand
information about the accident that led to Heuken's death.</P>
      <P>Sister Germana Rotzetter told him that on the day of the tragedy, she and Heuken
were each riding a motorbike on Provincial Highway No. 1 when Heuken collided
with an oncoming cargo truck, the police officer said.</P>
      <P>Rotzetter recalled that she called for help, but when it came, it was too late.</P>
      <P>Tien-Hsiang said he found out that Heuken's personal effects and his death
certificate had been kept at a parish in Donggang but were eventually destroyed
due to their old age.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No decision yet on relaxation of U.S. beef imports: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26 (CNA)
06/26/09  22:25:13
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has not yet made any decision on whether to ease restrictions on
U.S. beef imports, Department of Health (DOH) Deputy Minister Sung Yen-jen said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation argued earlier in the day that if the government opens
its domestic market wider to U.S. beef imports, it would be tantamount to
"selling out local people's health or putting their health at risk."</P>
      <P>"No conclusion on the issue has been reached yet," Sung stressed. "At the
moment,  we only recognize that U.S. beef meets the requirements of having all
specified risk materials (SRMs) taken off and discarded in the cattle
slaughtering process."</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of boneless beef from cattle younger than
30 months over mad cow disease concerns.</P>
      <P>Earlier Friday, Washington's top envoy to Taiwan, Stephen M. Young, said Taiwan
was very close to fully opening its market to U.S. beef, but Sung did not agree.</P>
      <P>"Even though officials from the U.S. Trade Representative office gave us their
assurances during a visit to DOH headquarters last week, we have never promised
to allow imports of beef from cattle older than 30 months," Sung elaborated.</P>
      <P>During their visit, U.S. officials presented documents showing that all U.S.
beef met safety regulations set forth by the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE).</P>
      <P>All cattle undergo health checks before and after they are slaughtered and the
SRMs, including brain, skull, eyes, trigeminal ganglion, notochord, backbone,
and spinal nerve root, as well as all of the cattle's tonsils and small
intestines, are all removed during the slaughtering process, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Before the arrival of the U.S. trade officials, Sung said, the DOH had sent its
staff members to the United States on two separate occasions to check out animal
quarantine and slaughtering operations there.</P>
      <P>Through extensive face-to-face discussions, Sung said,  DOH officials have come
to the conclusion that U.S. beef met the OIE-established safety requirements.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Sung said, the United States has imposed strict restrictions on animal
feed since 1997. Against such a backdrop, U.S. beef from cattle born after that
year and treated in accordance with the OIE requirements was not likely to
contain mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Sung said, the government plans to still only allow imports of de-
boned beef from cattle younger than 30 months, and not of any age as the U.S.
has requested.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's quarantine officials currently conduct spot checks on two to five
batches out of every 100 shipments to look for irregularities.</P>
      <P>"We only occasionally spot some small pieces of bones in certain shipments,
which are invariably denied entry. Otherwise, no other major violations have
been discovered," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- was diagnosed in Seattle.</P>
      <P>The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from
cattle aged under 30 months, but the government reimposed the ban two months
later when a second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months of age, produced by certified slaughterhouses
and without any risky parts, such as brains, skulls, eyes, spinal nerve roots,
tonsils and small intestines, mixed in.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, U.S. beef imports have been increasing year-by-year.
The U.S. currently supplies around 32 percent of Taiwan's beef, with the rest
coming mainly from New Zealand and Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fumigation treatment plant helps Tainan mango exports to Japan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A fumigation treatment plant has played a big role in the success in a Tainan
County town's efforts to export Irwin mango exports to Japan, cutting down the
time it takes to process the fruit before shipping it overseas.</P>
      <P>Mango growers in the Tainan County town of Yujing said that in the past, Taiwan
had mainly exported Chin Huang mangoes, a yellow-skinned mango, because they
could be stored for a longer time than the more popular Irwin mango, with its
sweet fragrance and attractive red color.</P>
      <P>They said that because the Irwin mango cannot be stored for long and its harvest
time is too concentrated during a specific period of time during the summer, the
price of Irwin mangoes often plunged during the harvest period.</P>
      <P>Many Irwin mango growers wanted to give up and turn to other kinds of mangoes
because of these problems, but the establishment of a fumigation treatment plant
in Yujing helped turn the tide, the growers said.</P>
      <P>Fruit exported to Japan needs to be fumigated to help tackle the fruit fly or
other pest problems. Prior to the building of the NT$130 million fumigation
treatment plant in Yujing in 2004, that meant that harvested mangoes had to be
transported to Kaohsiung and to Fengyuan in Taichung County to be fumigated.</P>
      <P>The time it took to transport the mangoes and their vulnerability to bruising
often left the fruit damaged during the transportation process, the growers
said.</P>
      <P>But the establishment of the plant, coupled with a rigorous traceability system
and pesticide residue tests, contributed to increased exports of Yujing's Irwin
mangoes.</P>
      <P>According to Japanese import statistics, the country imported 109 tons of
Taiwanese mangoes in 2001 and 505 tons in 2004 after the Tainan County
government traveled to Japan for the first time to promote the fruit.</P>
      <P>The figure surged to 852 tons in 2008, accounting for 7.4 percent of Japanese
mango imports.</P>

applied because of limited berths in popular airports and the difficulty of
commissioning maintenance and other integrated services.</P>
      <P>But with only planes registered in Taiwan or China allowed to travel directly

      <P>A Hebrew-language pamphlet featuring Taiwan's major tourist attractions has been
published in Israel as part of Taiwan's efforts to lure more Israelis to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Tel Avia invited influential figures in
Israel's travel and media industries to a function Thursday to mark the launch
of the new Taiwan travel guide, the first in Hebrew ever published in the world.</P>
      <P>With a scenic tea farm on its cover, the booklet introduces a list of must-see
tourist spots around Taiwan, including Taipei 101, Sun Moon Lake and the
National Palace Museum.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Lung-chi, information division chief at the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Tel Aviv, said that although Israel has a relatively small population
of about 7 million, its citizens make nearly 4 million overseas trips each year.</P>
      <P>Young Israelis are especially interested in traveling abroad as they receive a
stipend after completing their compulsory military service, Hsieh said, adding
that many of them then go backpacking in India, China and Thailand.</P>
      <P>"Given our special cultural heritage, natural beauty and gourmet cuisine, Taiwan
should be able to attract Israeli travelers if we step up publicity efforts,"
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Miriam Zairi, an Israeli staffer at Taiwan's representative office in Tel Aviv
who studied Mandarin Chinese at National Taiwan Normal University  between  2006
and 2007,  made an important contribution to the publication of the Hebrew-

      <P>"Zairi translated a Chinese-language travel guide on Taiwan into Hebrew in an
effort to help Israelis better understand Taiwan," Hsieh said. "Hopefully, the
pamphlet will help Israeli citizens who visit our office to apply for visas or
other documents come to a beteer understanding of Taiwan's beauty and tourist
resources," he added.</P>
      <P>Orly Spagnul, an Israeli travel fair organizer, said that if Taiwan and Israel
sign a working holiday agreement like the ones Taiwan has signed with Japan,

    <HEADLINE>Fumigation treatment plant helps Tainan mango exports to Japan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A fumigation treatment plant has played a big role in the success in a Tainan
County town's efforts to export Irwin mango exports to Japan, cutting down the
time it takes to process the fruit before shipping it overseas.</P>
      <P>Mango growers in the Tainan County town of Yujing said that in the past, Taiwan
had mainly exported Chin Huang mangoes, a yellow-skinned mango, because they
could be stored for a longer time than the more popular Irwin mango, with its
sweet fragrance and attractive red color.</P>
      <P>They said that because the Irwin mango cannot be stored for long and its harvest
time is too concentrated during a specific period of time during the summer, the
price of Irwin mangoes often plunged during the harvest period.</P>
      <P>Many Irwin mango growers wanted to give up and turn to other kinds of mangoes
because of these problems, but the establishment of a fumigation treatment plant
in Yujing helped turn the tide, the growers said.</P>
      <P>Fruit exported to Japan needs to be fumigated to help tackle the fruit fly or
other pest problems. Prior to the building of the NT$130 million fumigation
treatment plant in Yujing in 2004, that meant that harvested mangoes had to be
transported to Kaohsiung and to Fengyuan in Taichung County to be fumigated.</P>
      <P>The time it took to transport the mangoes and their vulnerability to bruising
often left the fruit damaged during the transportation process, the growers
said.</P>
      <P>But the establishment of the plant, coupled with a rigorous traceability system
and pesticide residue tests, contributed to increased exports of Yujing's Irwin
mangoes.</P>
      <P>According to Japanese import statistics, the country imported 109 tons of
Taiwanese mangoes in 2001 and 505 tons in 2004 after the Tainan County
government traveled to Japan for the first time to promote the fruit.</P>
      <P>The figure surged to 852 tons in 2008, accounting for 7.4 percent of Japanese
mango imports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No decision yet on relaxation of U.S. beef imports: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26 (CNA)
06/27/09  14:20:58
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has not yet made any decision on whether to ease restrictions on
U.S. beef imports, Department of Health (DOH) Deputy Minister Sung Yen-jen said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation argued earlier in the day that if the government opens
its domestic market wider to U.S. beef imports, it would be tantamount to
"selling out local people's health or putting their health at risk."</P>
      <P>"No conclusion on the issue has been reached yet," Sung stressed. "At the
moment,  we only recognize that U.S. beef meets the requirements of having all
specified risk materials (SRMs) taken off and discarded in the cattle
slaughtering process."</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of boneless beef from cattle younger than
30 months over mad cow disease concerns.</P>
      <P>Earlier Friday, Washington's top envoy to Taiwan, Stephen M. Young, said Taiwan
was very close to fully opening its market to U.S. beef, but Sung did not agree.</P>
      <P>"Even though officials from the U.S. Trade Representative office gave us their
assurances during a visit to DOH headquarters last week, we have never promised
to allow imports of beef from cattle older than 30 months," Sung elaborated.</P>
      <P>During their visit, U.S. officials presented documents showing that all U.S.
beef met safety regulations set forth by the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE).</P>
      <P>All cattle undergo health checks before and after they are slaughtered and the
SRMs, including brain, skull, eyes, trigeminal ganglion, notochord, backbone,
and spinal nerve root, as well as all of the cattle's tonsils and small
intestines, are all removed during the slaughtering process, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Before the arrival of the U.S. trade officials, Sung said, the DOH had sent its
staff members to the United States on two separate occasions to check out animal
quarantine and slaughtering operations there.</P>
      <P>Through extensive face-to-face discussions, Sung said,  DOH officials have come
to the conclusion that U.S. beef met the OIE-established safety requirements.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Sung said, the United States has imposed strict restrictions on animal
feed since 1997. Against such a backdrop, U.S. beef from cattle born after that
year and treated in accordance with the OIE requirements was not likely to
contain mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Sung said, the government plans to still only allow imports of de-
boned beef from cattle younger than 30 months, and not of any age as the U.S.
has requested.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's quarantine officials currently conduct spot checks on two to five
batches out of every 100 shipments to look for irregularities.</P>
      <P>"We only occasionally spot some small pieces of bones in certain shipments,
which are invariably denied entry. Otherwise, no other major violations have
been discovered," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- was diagnosed in Seattle.</P>
      <P>The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from
cattle aged under 30 months, but the government reimposed the ban two months
later when a second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months of age, produced by certified slaughterhouses
and without any risky parts, such as brains, skulls, eyes, spinal nerve roots,
tonsils and small intestines, mixed in.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, U.S. beef imports have been increasing year-by-year.
The U.S. currently supplies around 32 percent of Taiwan's beef, with the rest
coming mainly from New Zealand and Australia.</P>

      <P>Some entrepreneurs have inquired about registering their private planes in
Taiwan for the convenience of traveling across the Taiwan Strait, the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan allowed individuals to register their own planes in 2007, but nobody had
applied because of limited berths in popular airports and the difficulty of
commissioning maintenance and other integrated services.</P>
      <P>But with only planes registered in Taiwan or China allowed to travel directly
between the two countries, two business tycoons have inquired about moving their
jets' registrations from other countries to Taiwan to facilitate their business
travel, the CAA said at a seminar to promote private planes sponsored by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Hebrew-language pamphlet featuring Taiwan's major tourist attractions has been
published in Israel as part of Taiwan's efforts to lure more Israelis to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Tel Avia invited influential figures in
Israel's travel and media industries to a function Thursday to mark the launch
of the new Taiwan travel guide, the first in Hebrew ever published in the world.</P>
      <P>With a scenic tea farm on its cover, the booklet introduces a list of must-see
tourist spots around Taiwan, including Taipei 101, Sun Moon Lake and the
National Palace Museum.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Lung-chi, information division chief at the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Tel Aviv, said that although Israel has a relatively small population
of about 7 million, its citizens make nearly 4 million overseas trips each year.</P>
      <P>Young Israelis are especially interested in traveling abroad as they receive a
stipend after completing their compulsory military service, Hsieh said, adding
that many of them then go backpacking in India, China and Thailand.</P>
      <P>"Given our special cultural heritage, natural beauty and gourmet cuisine, Taiwan
should be able to attract Israeli travelers if we step up publicity efforts,"
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Miriam Zairi, an Israeli staffer at Taiwan's representative office in Tel Aviv
who studied Mandarin Chinese at National Taiwan Normal University  between  2006
and 2007,  made an important contribution to the publication of the Hebrew-
language travel guide, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"Zairi translated a Chinese-language travel guide on Taiwan into Hebrew in an
effort to help Israelis better understand Taiwan," Hsieh said. "Hopefully, the
pamphlet will help Israeli citizens who visit our office to apply for visas or
other documents come to a beteer understanding of Taiwan's beauty and tourist
resources," he added.</P>
      <P>Orly Spagnul, an Israeli travel fair organizer, said that if Taiwan and Israel
sign a working holiday agreement like the ones Taiwan has signed with Japan,
Australia and New Zealand, it would be of great help in the promotion of
bilateral tourist exchanges.</P>

Workshop in Grass Mountain Arts Village in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>The "Silk Road, Thought Road: Embroidering Workshop by Lily Huang, " which

bustle of the city and visit the arts village in Yangmingshan National Park, the
TAV said in a press statement. It described the art of embroidery as detailed,
refined and three dimensional.</P>
      <P>"Using needle and braid knit skills, artist Lily Huang is drawing her
inspiration from the natural scenery of Grass Mountain in her new art form
'Stainless Steel Embroidery,'" said the press release.</P>
      <P>"Leave the complex city behind, concentrate on the needles, feel the art, enjoy

      <P>The 40th annual conference of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians' Union (APPU) is
scheduled to take place Aug. 10-12 in Taipei, marking the first time that Taiwan
will host an APPU event, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Saturday.</P>
      <P>APPU, which is comprised of 21 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is the only
international parliamentary organization in which Taiwan has membership.</P>
      <P>Other members of the organization include Japan, South Korea, Thailand,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Mongolia, Laos and the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the upcoming meeting will focus on the theme of human
security and is expected to draw nearly 100 parliamentarians from the member
states.</P>
      <P>Wang said seeking membership in international parliamentary organizations is one
of the ways the Legislative Yuan can help develop the country's foreign
relations.</P>
      <P>The opportunity to host the international conference will also allow Taiwan's
legislators to strength their friendship and exchanges with their foreign
counterparts, Wang said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the participation of Taiwan's legislators in international events
will help to expand Taiwan's presence in the international arena, giving the
country an opening to free itself from the diplomatic isolation imposed by
China, he said.</P>
      <P>"Parliamentary diplomacy is a path that can lead Taiwan back to the
international community," Wang said.</P>
      <P>At present, more than 50 countries and regions have set up Taiwan friendship
groups within their parliaments, while there are 34 inter-parliamentary  groups
in the Legislative Yuan to promote friendship with their foreign counterparts,
he said.</P>
      <P>One of these groups, the Taiwan-USA Inter-Parliamentary Amity Association, is
likely to visit the United States in early September.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lin Yu-fang, who heads the association, said
the visit, if realized, would focus on lobbying for Taiwan's procurement of F-16
C/D fighters from the United States.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, a visit to the U.S. by Taiwanese legislators in July  2008
played  a crucial  part in prompting  the former administration of George W.
Bush to approve six arms sales to Taiwan in October that year.</P>
      <P>During the visit, the legislators discussed the arms issue with officials of the
U.S. Department of State and Department of Defense as well as with leaders of
the armed services committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
which helped the U.S to resolve any doubts about Taiwan's determination to
acquire the weapon systems, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan-Japan Exchange Association is planning to visit Japan
after the conclusion of Japan's parliamentary elections in September.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, a KMT legislator who heads the group, said the association meets
every year with the Japan-ROC Dietmen's Council to discuss issues of bilateral
concern.</P>
      <P>He noted that Japanese parliamentarians have contributed greatly to the adoption
of reciprocal measures by the two sides in recent years,  including  the mutual
visa waiver program  and mutual recognition of driver's licenses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in New York issued its 1,000th
Republic of China passport embedded with an integrated circuit (IC) chip Friday,
which was a milestone in a program instituted by Taiwan last year mainly to
crack down on crimes involving forged passports.</P>
      <P>Kenneth K.M. Liao, head of the TECO New York office, reiterated that objective
as he handed over the 1,000th IC passport to the applicant. He also expressed
the hope that the United States, which he described as one of Taiwan's best
foreign friends, would allow visa-free treatment for Taiwan passport holders.</P>
      <P>Ireland recently announced that, with effect from July 1, Taiwan citizens
visiting Ireland for non-employment  purposes such as tourism, business and
family visits will be able to enter the country without a visa for a maximum
stay of 90 days.</P>
      <P>Liao attributed the decision, which followed a similar concession by Britain in
March this year, to Taiwan's introduction on Dec. 29, 2008 of its new anti-fraud
IC passport.</P>
      <P>If Washington decides to offer visa-free treatment to the large number of Taiwan
citizens who travel to the U.S. every year, this will not only allow greater
convenience, but will also symbolize the close friendship and mutual trust that
exist between the U.S. and Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began issuing electronic passports late last year as part of an effort to
prevent human smuggling rings from using the stolen identity of Taiwan children
to apply for ROC passports through "legal channels."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is hoping that the highly enhanced security of its passports will
convince the U.S. to offer visa-free treatment to Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>Taiwan passport holders are allowed visa-free entry to some countries, including
Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, for visits of up to 30 days.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China is
crucial to Taiwan's ability to compete with other countries on an equal basis,
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at a national leadership forum held by the Taiwan Hakka
Forum Association, Chiang noted that China, which joined the World Trade
Organization as a developing country, has restricted the participation of
foreign businesses, including those from Taiwan, in certain of its sectors.</P>
      <P>However, many of the restricted sectors are open to Hong Kong businesses, mainly
because Hong Kong has signed a Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with
China, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in a phenomenon in which many Taiwanese businesses have
acquired Hong Kong companies so that they could enter the Chinese market, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, economic agreements between countries can lead to a trade
diversion effect, which is usually unfavorable to those excluded from the pacts.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, after South Korea signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with
the United States, some Taiwanese businesses decided to set up operations in
South Korea so as to obtain tariff-free treatment for their exports to the
United States.</P>
      <P>"This shows that if Taiwan cannot sign similar agreements with other countries,
Taiwanese businesses will be deprived of the opportunity to compete fairly in
the world markets," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>To date, there are more than 400 economic agreements in effect worldwide, he
noted. These include the economic integration in Europe, which allows for tariff
exemptions and the free flow of goods and personnel in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>Another example is the imminent economic integration between the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Japan and South Korea, he said.</P>
      <P>Under this framework, Japan will grant tariff-free treatment to 90 percent of
the goods exported by ASEAN countries and will gradually increase that to 93
percent within 10 years, which will severely undermine  the competitiveness  of
Taiwanese  exports, according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has raised the possibility of signing FTAs with Japan, Singapore
and the United States, there has been no progress on these fronts so far mainly
because of these countries' concerns about opposition from China, he said.</P>
      <P>With 40 percent of Taiwan's exports being directed to China, the signing of an
ECFA between the two sides has become an urgent issue, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has expressed strong support for the establishment of an
ECFA with China, stressing that it would be similar to an FTA and there would be
no political strings attached.</P>
      <P>Critics, however, have warned that the agreement could jeopardize Taiwan's
sovereignty, make Taiwan too economically dependent on China, and lead to an
influx of Chinese capital and goods.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which is strongly against the
proposal, has insisted that a referendum be held to allow the public to have a
say in the matter.</P>

Kinmen Saturday from Xiamen in China's Fujian province via direct ferry
services, commonly known as the "mini three links," across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The 12-member group, headed by Jan Berris, vice president of the New York-based
think tank National Committee on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR) , just concluded
a weeklong visit to China that took it to Beijing, Changsha and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Berris said her group chose the maritime travel route in an attempt to get
first-hand information about the "mini three links" ferry service.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng played host to the group at the county
government building.</P>
      <P>Recalling that the United States posted a military advisory group in Kinmen when
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were at war in the 1950s, Lee said Kinmen
residents are grateful to the U.S. for its assistance and friendship.</P>
      <P>Kinmen residents are looking forward to further expansion of the "mini three
links" ferry services with China, as the once strained cross-stait relations
have been warming over the past year, he said.</P>
      <P>When the direct cross-strait travel route was launched in 2001 after a decades-
old hiatus because of the Chinese civil war, only 21,377 passengers used the
service that year, Lee said. However, the the number zoomed to 974,486 last year
and is expected to leap past the 1.2 million mark this year, he added.</P>
      <P>"The opening of the 'mini three links' has laid a solid foundation for the full-
fledged opening of direct cross-strait three links," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The NCUSCR delegation members showed keen interest in a number of subjects,
including Kinmen's development, cross-strait relations, the feasibility  of
building  a bridge between Kinmen and Xiamen, protection of cultural heritage
and Kinmen residents' views on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Lee told his guests that the Kinmen County government has come up with a
blueprint for building a bridge between Kinmen's Wulungshan and Xiamen's Dadeng,
which would require an outlay of less than US$400 million.</P>
      <P>"Neither capital nor technology is a problem. We just need a nod from the
central government to execute the long-talked-about project to promote cross-
strait tourism and peace," he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. think tank group is scheduled to travel to Taipei Sunday on a fact-
finding visit.</P>

      <P>The plan for President Ma Ying-jeou to visit Honduras remains in place, but
relevant government agencies will keep a close watch on political developments
in that country, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Henry Chen also said that currently Ma's
travel itinerary remains unchanged. But he added that the ministry is closely
monitoring the situation in Honduras and has drafted contingency plans in case
of any changes in the political situation there.</P>
      <P>Ma is set to depart June 29 on his second diplomatic tour of the region this
year and will visit three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America --
Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of Ma's trip is for him to attend the July 1 inauguration of
Panamanian President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in Panama City.</P>
      <P>Honduras will be the last leg of his Central America visit. He is scheduled to
arrive in Honduras July 4 for a two-day state visit. During his stay, Ma is
expected to sign a joint comunique with Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on
further promotion of bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Ma will make a transit stop in San Francisco en route to Panama and will stop in
Hawaii on his way home.</P>
      <P>At the core of the conflict in Honduras is President Zelaya's insistence on a
referendum to approve a constitutional assembly, which is seen by some as a bid
to prolong his term in office.</P>
      <P>In a standoff with the military, President Zelaya earlier this week fired
General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, after the general refused the president's
request that the military give logistical support for the referendum.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld Vasquez Velasquez position and reinstated
the military official in his post. On Friday the military deployed hundreds of
soldiers across the Honduras capital of Tegucigalpa in a growing power standoff
in the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Red tape seen hampering visits by severely ill patients from China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan offers high quality low-cost medical services, this is not the
key factor in tapping the Chinese market for medical tourism, as clearing the
red tape for severely ill patents is more vital, a medical executive said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-yen, secretary general of the Taiwan Non-governmental Hospitals and
Clinics Association (NHCA), said that the complicated, time consuming
application process is deterring very ill Chinese citizens who wish to travel to
Taiwan to seek medical attention.</P>
      <P>Currently, Chinese citizens who wish to visit Taiwan for medical purposes must
first obtain a medical certificate from a doctor in China, verifying that they
need specialized care. Then they must secure an acceptance from a Taiwan
hospital, which in turn is required to apply to Taiwan immigration authorities,
on behalf of the prospective patient, for an entry permit.</P>
      <P>In the final step, the patients have to obtain permission from the Chinese
authorities to travel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the second and third steps could take up to three weeks and if the
applicant is lucky, the last step could take a month.</P>
      <P>In response to media inquiries  about the situation,  Liu Ming-hsun, the
official in charge of the issue at the Department of Health's Bureau of Medical
Affairs, said Taiwan is working to relax the restrictions and streamline the
application procedure.</P>
      <P>However, Liu added, it might still take a long time for severely ill patients to
obtain the Chinese authorities' permission to travel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He therefore urged Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to address
this issue in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are two quasi-official intermediary bodies designated by each
side to handle cross-strait issues in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Taiwan opened its doors to patients from China seeking live  donor
liver  transplants,  maxillofacial  reconstruction, artificial insemination,
joint replacement,  and cardiovascular treatment.</P>
      <P>However, statistics show that so far, only about 30 Chinese patients have
traveled to Taiwan for this type of medical treatment.</P>
      <P>This number falls far short of the government's goal of "offering medical
services to 100,000 people in three years" at the time when the restrictions
were lifted, said Lee Wei-chiang, director of Taipei Veterans General Hospital's
International Medical Service Center (IMSC).</P>
      <P>The information on the IMSC's Web site and the way it is presented indicates
that it is targeting China as one of its major sources of patients. The Web site
features both English and Mandarin, but the information in Mandarin is written
in simplified Chinese characters, the system used in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet has no timeline for full opening to U.S. beef: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has no timetable for the full opening of Taiwan's market to
U.S. beef, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Saturday, refuting a media
report that the government plans to open the market at the end of June.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Executive  Yuan will fully respect  the professional judgment
of the Department of Health (DOH) on the issue, since that is the government
unit responsible for public health.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in response to media inquiries after Stephen M. Young, the
outgoing director of the American Institute in Taiwan, stated the previous day
that it is getting very close to the time when Taiwan would open its market
fully to U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The U.S. official's remarks not only triggered protests from the Consumers'
Foundation, but also prompted a headline in a local newspaper Saturday that the
Executive Yuan is likely to permit the importation of U.S. beef with effect from
the end of June at the latest.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to safeguarding
consumers' rights, stated that the mutant protein in the brain of cattle that
causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , also known as mad cow disease,
is not easily destroyed.</P>
      <P>Even if the affected parts of the cattle are burned to ashes and buried, the
protein could still enter the human body via the food chain, the foundation
said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows U.S. imports of boneless beef from cattle under
than 30 months old.</P>
      <P>An Executive Yuan official, who declined to be named, said that the beef issue
does not involve just food safety, but also politics and foreign trade.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan has been handling the issue very cautiously," he said.</P>
      <P>According to a comprehensive risk analysis report prepared by the DOH, the risk
of contracting BSE by eating U.S. beef with bone is "lower than that of being
hit by lightening twice, " the official said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, although it has been deemed safe to consume U.S. beef,
the most crucial issue is the public's acceptance of the product. Therefore,
further consideration is required before the Cabinet can decide on a timeline
for fully opening the market, he said.</P>

      <P>A German Buddy bear, painted by local school teachers and students to resemble a
Formosan black bear, was debuted in Taipei Saturday as part of efforts to
promote the ideals of "living together in peace and harmony on the Earth."</P>
      <P>Addressing the inaugural ceremony at Spot Cinema, Birgitt Ory, director general
of the German Institute in Taipei, said the first German Buddy bear was launched
in 2001 as part of a program to promote world peace and harmony.</P>
      <P>As the program drew an enthusiastic response, organizers decided to continue
carrying out it. To date, Ory said, 1,300 German Buddy bears have been produced
and delivered to many countries around the world.</P>
      <P>"Each Buddy bear has a unique thematic motif and name, " said the top German
representative in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Ory, 140 Buddy bears are now on global tours.</P>
      <P>The Buddy bear with a serial number of "1289" arrived in Taiwan May 6. Artistic
design and painting for the Buddy bear were carried out by students and teachers
at two senior high schools in Kaohsiung County's Fengshan City.</P>
      <P>Ory said the newly painted Buddy bear -- a "hybrid" of Taiwan's endemic Formosan
black bear and Germany's indigenous Brown bear, will be taken to two major
international sports events to be held in Taiwan later this year -- the 2009
World Games in Kaohsiung City in July and the 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei
in September.</P>
      <P>The Buddy bear will also appear at a German concert to be held at the National
Concert Hall in Taipei in October and a special film festival marking the 20th
anniversary of the fall of Berlin Wall to spread the messages of peace, goodwill
and mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Ory said the German Institute in Taipei has launched a campaign to solicit
entries  for naming  the Buddy bear.  Prospective participants should mail their
entries before Oct.3.</P>
      <P>The Buddy bear inaugural ceremony drew the attendance of some 300 well-wishers
from home and abroad, including Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-
yuan and German film director Wolfgang Becker.</P>
      <P>Lai said the "hybrid" Buddy bear symbolizes further development of Taiwan-German
friendship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan office in New York issues 1,000th ROC e-passport</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in New York issued its 1,000th
Republic of China passport embedded with an integrated circuit (IC) chip Friday,
which was a milestone in a program instituted by Taiwan last year mainly to
crack down on crimes involving forged passports.</P>
      <P>Kenneth K.M. Liao, head of the TECO New York office, reiterated that objective
as he handed over the 1,000th IC passport to the applicant. He also expressed
the hope that the United States, which he described as one of Taiwan's best
foreign friends, would allow visa-free treatment for Taiwan passport holders.</P>
      <P>Ireland recently announced that, with effect from July 1, Taiwan citizens
visiting Ireland for non-employment  purposes such as tourism, business and
family visits will be able to enter the country without a visa for a maximum
stay of 90 days.</P>
      <P>Liao attributed the decision, which followed a similar concession by Britain in
March this year, to Taiwan's introduction on Dec. 29, 2008 of its new anti-fraud
IC passport.</P>
      <P>If Washington decides to offer visa-free treatment to the large number of Taiwan
citizens who travel to the U.S. every year, this will not only allow greater
convenience, but will also symbolize the close friendship and mutual trust that
exist between the U.S. and Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began issuing electronic passports late last year as part of an effort to
prevent human smuggling rings from using the stolen identity of Taiwan children
to apply for ROC passports through "legal channels."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is hoping that the highly enhanced security of its passports will
convince the U.S. to offer visa-free treatment to Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>Taiwan passport holders are allowed visa-free entry to some countries, including
Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, for visits of up to 30 days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA crucial to Taiwan's competitiveness: SEF chairman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China is
crucial to Taiwan's ability to compete with other countries on an equal basis,
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at a national leadership forum held by the Taiwan Hakka
Forum Association, Chiang noted that China, which joined the World Trade
Organization as a developing country, has restricted the participation of
foreign businesses, including those from Taiwan, in certain of its sectors.</P>
      <P>However, many of the restricted sectors are open to Hong Kong businesses, mainly
because Hong Kong has signed a Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with
China, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in a phenomenon in which many Taiwanese businesses have
acquired Hong Kong companies so that they could enter the Chinese market, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, economic agreements between countries can lead to a trade
diversion effect, which is usually unfavorable to those excluded from the pacts.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, after South Korea signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with
the United States, some Taiwanese businesses decided to set up operations in
South Korea so as to obtain tariff-free treatment for their exports to the
United States.</P>
      <P>"This shows that if Taiwan cannot sign similar agreements with other countries,
Taiwanese businesses will be deprived of the opportunity to compete fairly in
the world markets," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>To date, there are more than 400 economic agreements in effect worldwide, he
noted. These include the economic integration in Europe, which allows for tariff
exemptions and the free flow of goods and personnel in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>Another example is the imminent economic integration between the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Japan and South Korea, he said.</P>
      <P>Under this framework, Japan will grant tariff-free treatment to 90 percent of
the goods exported by ASEAN countries and will gradually increase that to 93
percent within 10 years, which will severely undermine  the competitiveness  of
Taiwanese  exports, according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has raised the possibility of signing FTAs with Japan, Singapore
and the United States, there has been no progress on these fronts so far mainly
because of these countries' concerns about opposition from China, he said.</P>
      <P>With 40 percent of Taiwan's exports being directed to China, the signing of an
ECFA between the two sides has become an urgent issue, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has expressed strong support for the establishment of an
ECFA with China, stressing that it would be similar to an FTA and there would be
no political strings attached.</P>
      <P>Critics, however, have warned that the agreement could jeopardize Taiwan's
sovereignty, make Taiwan too economically dependent on China, and lead to an
influx of Chinese capital and goods.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which is strongly against the
proposal, has insisted that a referendum be held to allow the public to have a
say in the matter.</P>

      <P>The plan for President Ma Ying-jeou to visit Honduras remains in place, but
relevant government agencies will keep a close watch on political developments
in that country, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Henry Chen also said that currently Ma's
travel itinerary remains unchanged. But he added that the ministry is closely
monitoring the situation in Honduras and has drafted contingency plans in case
of any changes in the political situation there.</P>
      <P>Ma is set to depart June 29 on his second diplomatic tour of the region this
year and will visit three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America --
Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of Ma's trip is for him to attend the July 1 inauguration of
Panamanian President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in Panama City.</P>
      <P>Honduras will be the last leg of his Central America visit. He is scheduled to
arrive in Honduras July 4 for a two-day state visit. During his stay, Ma is
expected to sign a joint comunique with Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on
further promotion of bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Ma will make a transit stop in San Francisco en route to Panama and will stop in
Hawaii on his way home.</P>
      <P>At the core of the conflict in Honduras is President Zelaya's insistence on a
referendum to approve a constitutional assembly, which is seen by some as a bid
to prolong his term in office.</P>
      <P>In a standoff with the military, President Zelaya earlier this week fired
General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, after the general refused the president's
request that the military give logistical support for the referendum.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld Vasquez Velasquez position and reinstated
the military official in his post. On Friday the military deployed hundreds of
soldiers across the Honduras capital of Tegucigalpa in a growing power standoff
in the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Red tape seen hampering visits by severely ill patients from China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan offers high quality low-cost medical services, this is not the
key factor in tapping the Chinese market for medical tourism, as clearing the
red tape for severely ill patents is more vital, a medical executive said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-yen, secretary general of the Taiwan Non-governmental Hospitals and
Clinics Association (NHCA), said that the complicated, time consuming
application process is deterring very ill Chinese citizens who wish to travel to
Taiwan to seek medical attention.</P>
      <P>Currently, Chinese citizens who wish to visit Taiwan for medical purposes must
first obtain a medical certificate from a doctor in China, verifying that they
need specialized care. Then they must secure an acceptance from a Taiwan
hospital, which in turn is required to apply to Taiwan immigration authorities,
on behalf of the prospective patient, for an entry permit.</P>
      <P>In the final step, the patients have to obtain permission from the Chinese
authorities to travel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the second and third steps could take up to three weeks and if the
applicant is lucky, the last step could take a month.</P>
      <P>In response to media inquiries  about the situation,  Liu Ming-hsun, the
official in charge of the issue at the Department of Health's Bureau of Medical
Affairs, said Taiwan is working to relax the restrictions and streamline the
application procedure.</P>
      <P>However, Liu added, it might still take a long time for severely ill patients to
obtain the Chinese authorities' permission to travel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He therefore urged Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to address
this issue in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are two quasi-official intermediary bodies designated by each
side to handle cross-strait issues in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Taiwan opened its doors to patients from China seeking live  donor
liver  transplants,  maxillofacial  reconstruction, artificial insemination,
joint replacement,  and cardiovascular treatment.</P>
      <P>However, statistics show that so far, only about 30 Chinese patients have
traveled to Taiwan for this type of medical treatment.</P>
      <P>This number falls far short of the government's goal of "offering medical
services to 100,000 people in three years" at the time when the restrictions
were lifted, said Lee Wei-chiang, director of Taipei Veterans General Hospital's
International Medical Service Center (IMSC).</P>
      <P>The information on the IMSC's Web site and the way it is presented indicates
that it is targeting China as one of its major sources of patients. The Web site
features both English and Mandarin, but the information in Mandarin is written
in simplified Chinese characters, the system used in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet has no timeline for full opening to U.S. beef: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 27 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has no timetable for the full opening of Taiwan's market to
U.S. beef, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Saturday, refuting a media
report that the government plans to open the market at the end of June.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Executive  Yuan will fully respect  the professional judgment
of the Department of Health (DOH) on the issue, since that is the government
unit responsible for public health.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in response to media inquiries after Stephen M. Young, the
outgoing director of the American Institute in Taiwan, stated the previous day
that it is getting very close to the time when Taiwan would open its market
fully to U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The U.S. official's remarks not only triggered protests from the Consumers'
Foundation, but also prompted a headline in a local newspaper Saturday that the
Executive Yuan is likely to permit the importation of U.S. beef with effect from
the end of June at the latest.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to safeguarding
consumers' rights, stated that the mutant protein in the brain of cattle that
causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , also known as mad cow disease,
is not easily destroyed.</P>
      <P>Even if the affected parts of the cattle are burned to ashes and buried, the
protein could still enter the human body via the food chain, the foundation
said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows U.S. imports of boneless beef from cattle under
than 30 months old.</P>
      <P>An Executive Yuan official, who declined to be named, said that the beef issue
does not involve just food safety, but also politics and foreign trade.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan has been handling the issue very cautiously," he said.</P>
      <P>According to a comprehensive risk analysis report prepared by the DOH, the risk
of contracting BSE by eating U.S. beef with bone is "lower than that of being
hit by lightening twice, " the official said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, although it has been deemed safe to consume U.S. beef,
the most crucial issue is the public's acceptance of the product. Therefore,
further consideration is required before the Cabinet can decide on a timeline
for fully opening the market, he said.</P>

      <P>A German Buddy bear, painted by local school teachers and students to resemble a
Formosan black bear, was debuted in Taipei Saturday as part of efforts to
promote the ideals of "living together in peace and harmony on the Earth."</P>
      <P>Addressing the inaugural ceremony at Spot Cinema, Birgitt Ory, director general
of the German Institute in Taipei, said the first German Buddy bear was launched
in 2001 as part of a program to promote world peace and harmony.</P>
      <P>As the program drew an enthusiastic response, organizers decided to continue
carrying out it. To date, Ory said, 1,300 German Buddy bears have been produced
and delivered to many countries around the world.</P>
      <P>"Each Buddy bear has a unique thematic motif and name, " said the top German
representative in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Ory, 140 Buddy bears are now on global tours.</P>
      <P>The Buddy bear with a serial number of "1289" arrived in Taiwan May 6. Artistic
design and painting for the Buddy bear were carried out by students and teachers
at two senior high schools in Kaohsiung County's Fengshan City.</P>
      <P>Ory said the newly painted Buddy bear -- a "hybrid" of Taiwan's endemic Formosan
black bear and Germany's indigenous Brown bear, will be taken to two major
international sports events to be held in Taiwan later this year -- the 2009
World Games in Kaohsiung City in July and the 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei
in September.</P>
      <P>The Buddy bear will also appear at a German concert to be held at the National
Concert Hall in Taipei in October and a special film festival marking the 20th
anniversary of the fall of Berlin Wall to spread the messages of peace, goodwill
and mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Ory said the German Institute in Taipei has launched a campaign to solicit
entries  for naming  the Buddy bear.  Prospective participants should mail their
entries before Oct.3.</P>
      <P>The Buddy bear inaugural ceremony drew the attendance of some 300 well-wishers
from home and abroad, including Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-
yuan and German film director Wolfgang Becker.</P>
      <P>Lai said the "hybrid" Buddy bear symbolizes further development of Taiwan-German
friendship.</P>

never regards anything as beneath his notice or as unworthy of serious and
careful attention -- that is what is meant by being dignified without being
supercilious."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Young farmer touts 'Kuso' way</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/28/09  15:21:58</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Will a housewife buy rice from a farmer who pushes his products in the "Kuso"
way online? Probably not.</P>
      <P>However, this is not a problem for Hsieh Ming-chien,  an electronics factory
worker-turned-farmer in Taiwan's eastern county of Hualien, who has succeeded in
touting on the Internet the rice he produces and has put his name on the map as
a farmer-blogger.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, 28, the youngest rice farmer in Hualien, has been working the land for
the last five years, splitting his time between tending his farm and blogging on
the Internet.</P>
      <P>A son of a rice farmer, Hsieh headed to Taipei to work after graduating from
high school and finishing his military service. He did not save a dime working
in the metropolis and was eventually ordered home by his father to plow their
own farmland. He was 23 when he became a fulltime farmer.</P>
      <P>Hsieh did not have a smooth start. His first year's harvest was only a sixth of
the normal yield -- only about 2,000 kg of rice for each hectare of paddy he
farmed.</P>
      <P>That dismal result was a real kick in the pants, so he set out to learn all
about the work from his dad and his elderly neighbors. Not until his third year
did he finally bring in a successful harvest.</P>
      <P>He then decided to take his business  a step further by innovating, adding a
modern touch to the age-old occupation by selling his rice online.</P>
      <P>The idea came from online friends, who at first reacted with disbelief when he
told them he was a farmer, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>To prove his credentials, Hsieh started a blog on his farming experiences,
chronicling the whole process of rice farming from propagating rice seedlings
and planting them out, to fertilizing and harvesting.</P>
      <P>Believing that building a "corporate image" is important in terms of marketing,
Hsieh, who was an art design major when he was at vocational high school,
designed the cartoon character "Chien Chien" and branded his rice products
"Chien Chien's Good Rice."</P>
      <P>A born humorist, Hsieh has sprinkled his online diary with amusing or self-
deprecating parodies and caricatures of the "Kuso style."</P>
      <P>In "Kuso" -- which literally means "shit" in Japanese -- Hsieh makes fun of
himself, reflects local farmers' ideals and plights, and describes the
outrageous matters facing him and his fellow Hualien farmers in his online
diary.</P>
      <P>Also via his Web site, he keeps people informed about his products, which range
from "Champion Rice" Taigeng No. 2 -- a chewy and crystal-looking grain best
suited to frying, "Pearl Rice" Taigeng No. 16 -- chewy but soft, pearl-like rice
best for sushi, to "Aromatic Rice" Taigeng No. 4 -- the most popular variety
among Taiwanese consumers in recent years.</P>
      <P>First attracted by his novel sales method and intrigued by his diary, then later
finding that "Chien Chien's Good Rice" is actually really tasty and good
quality, online buyers flocked to him in droves.</P>
      <P>"Chien Chien" and his rice have developed something of a fan following, earning
Hsieh fame and a reasonable living.</P>
      <P>His success is in part owing to the fact that the land he works sits in the
Huadong Rift Valley, with the Central Mountain Range on the western side and the
East Coast Range on the east, a natural corridor long famed for its fertility
and good rice.</P>
      <P>As far back as Taiwan's occupation by the Japanese between the late 19th Century
and early 20th Century, rice produced in the valley was shipped to Japan as
tribute to the Japanese emperor.</P>
      <P>However, this heyday was long gone for Hsieh and his fellow farmers in the
valley, which became especially obvious earlier this year when a string of cold
spells hit Taiwan after the year's first crop had been planted out.</P>
      <P>By the time the crops were about to mature in late May, they found to their
dismay that the crop had failed to set grain and they lost the entire crop.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented disaster -- the worst calamity that local rice farmers said
they had ever witnessed or heard of in a century -- caused all 2 hectares of
Hsieh's Taigeng No. 4 crop to disappear down the drain and left 60 percent  of
another  hectare  damaged. Fortunately, he said, crops of the other two rice
varieties on his other nine hectares were only slightly affected.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the "empty hull" problem was much more detrimental than the onslaught
of a typhoon, flooding or any pest scourge.</P>
      <P>"My heart went out to my fellow farmers, most of whom are in their 50s and 60s,
most of whom are their households' only breadwinners and most of whom had given
over the majority of their paddy to Taigeng No. 4," he said.</P>
      <P>Undaunted, Hsieh said he is planning to increase his farming for the second
harvest this year, adding eight hectares to make a total of 20 hectares under
the plough, in order to meet demand.</P>
      <P>Young as he is, Hsieh has already developed the characteristics of a
philanthropic entrepreneur. He frequents an institution for people suffering
from mental problems not far from his village, where his wife works as a nurse.</P>
      <P>From that institution, he has hired four patients who were able to take up
manual labor jobs at his seedling development quarters, giving them a sense of
worth while allowing Hsieh to make cost savings.</P>
      <P>"Farming is stereotyped as backbreaking and profitless, but I'm determined to be
a cheerful farmer," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"To me, the best compliment is people saying to me that 'your rice brings
happiness,'" Hsieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former CAA head busy planning Taiwan's first flight school</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
06/28/09  16:10:09
(By Deborah)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since his retirement one year ago, former Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
head Billy K.C. Chang has been busy with plans for the establishment of Taiwan's
first flight school, in a bid to help upgrade the standard of the country's
aviation services.</P>
      <P>Chang, one of the few CAA directors-general in Taiwan who could fly an aircraft,
recently established the non-profit Aviation Education Foundation in a first
step toward setting up a flight school.</P>
      <P>His aim is to open the flight school in eastern Taiwan and have the foundation
lease a training base at Taitung Airport in Taitung City's Fengnien Borough, he
said.</P>
      <P>Initially the foundation will collaborate with a U.S. aviation school, he said.
Instructors from the United States will be hired to work in Taitung to help
train local people as flight trainers, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang, who is working as a volunteer at the foundation, said because there is no
flight school in Taiwan, local airline companies have had to send their student
pilots abroad for training.</P>
      <P>He said the idea of setting up an aviation school in Taiwan was discussed
before, but it never moved beyond the discussion stage because the Ministry of
National Defense wanted to maintain tight control on Taiwan airspace.</P>
      <P>"But the Ministry of National Defense is now more relaxed on the air space
control issue, which makes it possible to establish a civilian flight training
program," Chang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the steadily improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations and
closer air links between Taiwan and mainland China portend growing demand for
civilian aircraft and pilots.</P>
      <P>"This is spurring us to speed up the plans for the establishment of the flight
training school," he added.</P>
      <P>However, he noted, the success of the project hinges on the support of the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The flight school will also provide training for air traffic controllers, he
said. Taiwan is one of the very few countries in the world where air traffic
controllers are not required to receive flight training before assuming their
duties in the tower, he noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) , which provides water to 22 cities and counties
across the country, said Sunday that as of late last year it had achieved a
penetration rate of 90.7 percent on average.</P>
      <P>The current average water supply penetration rate of over 90 percent is much
higher than the average 42.66 percent posted in 1974, when the company was
established, a spokesman for the state-run TWC said.</P>
      <P>According to TWC statistics, the highest penetration rate was in Tainan City in
southern Taiwan, with 99.88 percent of its households on tap. Chiayi City was
second, with 99.66 percent of its residences supplied by the company.</P>
      <P>A rate of over 90 percent was recorded for other 12 cities and counties,
including Taipei, Yilan and Taoyuan counties as well as Keelung and Hsinchu
cities in the north. The others included Changhua and Yunlin counties, Taichung
City in central Taiwan, Tainan County, Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County in the
south and the offshore Penghu County.</P>
      <P>The lowest penetration rate -- 45.13 percent -- was in Pingtung County on
Taiwan's southernmost tip, which is one of the key issues that county
authorities are waiting to have resolved.</P>
      <P>TWC supplies water to 22 cities and counties on Taiwan proper and on the
offshore counties, including Penghu. It serves some 17.3 million people, but its
service does not cover the capital of Taipei City or some areas of the adjoining
Taipei County.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's plan to visit Honduras remains unchanged despite
political uncertainties in the Central American country, Presidential Office
Spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Relevant government authorities, such as the National Security Council and the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will continue to keep a close watch on political
developments in Honduras and will inform the Presidential Office if there is any
need to revise the itinerary for the trip, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"We have not been informed of any changes so far in this regard," he noted.</P>
      <P>Ma is set to embark June 29 on his second trip this year to Central America,
which will take him to three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America --
Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>Ma will first travel to Panama, where he will attend the July 1 inauguration of
Panamanian President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in Panama City.</P>
      <P>Ma will make a transit stop in San Francisco en route to Panama and will stop in
Hawaii on the return trip. He is expected to return to Taiwan July 8.</P>
      <P>He is scheduled to arrive in Honduras July 4 for a two-day state visit, on the
last leg of his Central American tour. During his stay, Ma is expected to sign a
joint comunique with Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on promotion of two-way
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, Honduras has been embroiled in a political standoff that
arose from Zelaya's insistence on a referendum to approve a constitutional
assembly, a move that is seen by some as a bid to prolong his term in office.</P>
      <P>In a standoff with the military, Zelaya earlier last week fired General Romeo
Vasquez Velasquez after the general turned down the president's request that the
military give logistical support for the referendum.</P>
      <P>On Friday the military deployed hundreds of soldiers across the capital
Tegucigalpa in a growing power struggle, after the Supreme Court on Thursday
upheld Vasquez Velasquez position and reinstated the general in his post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan lab to produce 7.5 M. doses of swine flu vaccine by October</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
06/28/09  19:41:49
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly built vaccine plant is set to make available 7.5 million doses of a
vaccine against the influenza A(H1N1) virus, better known as swine flu, before
Oct. 10 this year, the chairman of the biopharmaceutical firm Adimmune Corp.
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Specialists at Adimmune Corp.'s vaccine processing plant in Tanzih township,
central Taiwan are currently experimenting with a virus strain that was provided
by four World Health Organization (WHO) -authorized labs in Australia, Britain
and the United States, Steve Chan told the CNA in an exclusive interview.</P>
      <P>Adimmune, the only human vaccine manufacturer in Taiwan, is scheduled to
complete the experimental process and decide on a vaccine strain for mass
domestic production by the end of August, said Chan. This would pave the way for
animal and human trials of the A(H1N1) vaccine in September, he added.</P>
      <P>Chan, who served as Taiwan's health minister between 1997 and 2000, said the
human clinical trials are scheduled to be completed by the end of September,
giving the vaccine producer enough time to begin mass producing the A(H1N1)
vaccine around Double Ten National Day on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>If all goes according to plan, Taiwan will become the 12th country in the world
capable of producing A(H1N1) vaccines, he said.</P>
      <P>Adimmune's Tanzih plant, in working toward this goal, will advance its original
launch schedule by 18 months, as it had planned to begin mass production of
vaccines against normal influenza in 2011 for export, he added.</P>
      <P>The Tanzih plant, inaugurated in mid-June, is ready to ramp up production of the
A(H1N1) vaccine to fill the orders placed by the Department of Health, as the
WHO has declared the A(H1N1) swine flu a pandemic, which portends a growing
demand for the swine flu vaccine worldwide, Chan said.</P>
      <P>He quoted international health specialists' estimates that in case of a global
outbreak of swine flu, about 400 million to 800 million people around the world
will become infected.</P>
      <P>Chan said he is confident  that Adimmune --  the largest vaccine-producing
company in Asia with a maximum annual capacity of 30 million doses of vaccine --
is capable of meeting the deadline.</P>
      <P>"The company is actually working as a national lab to produce the vaccine in an
emergency mission," Chan said.</P>
      <P>Adimmune is partly controlled by the government and 20 percent of its founding
capital was contributed by the National Development Fund, which is supervised by
the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>With Adimmune's rush to produce the A(H1N1) vaccine on schedule, it cannot spare
the time it would take to acquire the chicken eggs in which vaccines are usually
produced, as the eggs have to meet specific local and international standards,
Chan explained.</P>
      <P>Instead, Adimmune will produce the vaccine based on the cells of chicken
embryos.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, the National Laboratories of Foods and Drugs will begin
inspections of Adimmune's Tanzih plant from Monday to check whether it conforms
to Taiwan's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards.</P>
      <P>WHO representatives are also expected to visit Taiwan soon to inspect the
plant's facilities and its operations, he added.</P>
      <P>Chan brushed off doubts in some quarters that the plant may not be able to
produce quality A(H1N1) swine flu vaccines because of the rush.</P>
      <P>Adimmune Deputy CEO and President Ignatius Wei has said that he will volunteer
to receive the first vaccine that the company's lab produces, Chan said.</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-chou, director of the Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs under the
Department of Health,  has also volunteered  to be inoculated first once the
Adimmune swine flu vaccine is approved by the bureau, Chan added.</P>

      <P>A tiny settlement of Bunun aboriginals, which occupies an area of about 2.5
square kilometers in Taitung County, claimed three Golden Melody Awards Saturday
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Nanwang Three Sisters, three female singers from the Nanwang settlement, won
awards for Best Aboriginal Album, Best Singing Group and Best Publisher,
bringing to eight the total number of Golden Melody Awards won by residents of
the settlement since the awards were first introduced in 1990.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that Nanwang can claim the most Golden Melody Awards per
capita in Taiwan, Chen Guan-lien, a leader of the settlement of 1,500 people,
said exuberantly Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The Bunun people are known for their beautiful voices, and the Nanwang
settlement is the music mecca of the Bunun," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Music is part of our life. Bunun women sing when they are weeding together,
Bunun men sing when they go hunting, and singing is a vital part of our
worshipping rites for our ancestors and deities." Chen added.</P>
      <P>Another local leader Wang Chih-po said Nanwang is invisible on the geographic
map of Taiwan, but it has made it onto the music map thanks to its many talented
singers.</P>
      <P>The first Golden Melody Award winner from Nanwang was Chen Chien-lien, who won
the Award for Best Popular Music Composer in 2000.</P>
      <P>He was followed by three other singers -- Chih Hsiao-chun, Kao Tien, Hao Eng and
Jia Jia -- from Nanwang.</P>

never regards anything as beneath his notice or as unworthy of serious and
careful attention -- that is what is meant by being dignified without being
supercilious."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Young farmer touts 'Kuso' way</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/28/09  15:21:58</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Will a housewife buy rice from a farmer who pushes his products in the "Kuso"
way online? Probably not.</P>
      <P>However, this is not a problem for Hsieh Ming-chien,  an electronics factory
worker-turned-farmer in Taiwan's eastern county of Hualien, who has succeeded in
touting on the Internet the rice he produces and has put his name on the map as
a farmer-blogger.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, 28, the youngest rice farmer in Hualien, has been working the land for
the last five years, splitting his time between tending his farm and blogging on
the Internet.</P>
      <P>A son of a rice farmer, Hsieh headed to Taipei to work after graduating from
high school and finishing his military service. He did not save a dime working
in the metropolis and was eventually ordered home by his father to plow their
own farmland. He was 23 when he became a fulltime farmer.</P>
      <P>Hsieh did not have a smooth start. His first year's harvest was only a sixth of
the normal yield -- only about 2,000 kg of rice for each hectare of paddy he
farmed.</P>
      <P>That dismal result was a real kick in the pants, so he set out to learn all
about the work from his dad and his elderly neighbors. Not until his third year
did he finally bring in a successful harvest.</P>
      <P>He then decided to take his business  a step further by innovating, adding a
modern touch to the age-old occupation by selling his rice online.</P>
      <P>The idea came from online friends, who at first reacted with disbelief when he
told them he was a farmer, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>To prove his credentials, Hsieh started a blog on his farming experiences,
chronicling the whole process of rice farming from propagating rice seedlings
and planting them out, to fertilizing and harvesting.</P>
      <P>Believing that building a "corporate image" is important in terms of marketing,
Hsieh, who was an art design major when he was at vocational high school,
designed the cartoon character "Chien Chien" and branded his rice products
"Chien Chien's Good Rice."</P>
      <P>A born humorist, Hsieh has sprinkled his online diary with amusing or self-
deprecating parodies and caricatures of the "Kuso style."</P>
      <P>In "Kuso" -- which literally means "shit" in Japanese -- Hsieh makes fun of
himself, reflects local farmers' ideals and plights, and describes the
outrageous matters facing him and his fellow Hualien farmers in his online
diary.</P>
      <P>Also via his Web site, he keeps people informed about his products, which range
from "Champion Rice" Taigeng No. 2 -- a chewy and crystal-looking grain best
suited to frying, "Pearl Rice" Taigeng No. 16 -- chewy but soft, pearl-like rice
best for sushi, to "Aromatic Rice" Taigeng No. 4 -- the most popular variety
among Taiwanese consumers in recent years.</P>
      <P>First attracted by his novel sales method and intrigued by his diary, then later
finding that "Chien Chien's Good Rice" is actually really tasty and good
quality, online buyers flocked to him in droves.</P>
      <P>"Chien Chien" and his rice have developed something of a fan following, earning
Hsieh fame and a reasonable living.</P>
      <P>His success is in part owing to the fact that the land he works sits in the
Huadong Rift Valley, with the Central Mountain Range on the western side and the
East Coast Range on the east, a natural corridor long famed for its fertility
and good rice.</P>
      <P>As far back as Taiwan's occupation by the Japanese between the late 19th Century
and early 20th Century, rice produced in the valley was shipped to Japan as
tribute to the Japanese emperor.</P>
      <P>However, this heyday was long gone for Hsieh and his fellow farmers in the
valley, which became especially obvious earlier this year when a string of cold
spells hit Taiwan after the year's first crop had been planted out.</P>
      <P>By the time the crops were about to mature in late May, they found to their
dismay that the crop had failed to set grain and they lost the entire crop.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented disaster -- the worst calamity that local rice farmers said
they had ever witnessed or heard of in a century -- caused all 2 hectares of
Hsieh's Taigeng No. 4 crop to disappear down the drain and left 60 percent  of
another  hectare  damaged. Fortunately, he said, crops of the other two rice
varieties on his other nine hectares were only slightly affected.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the "empty hull" problem was much more detrimental than the onslaught
of a typhoon, flooding or any pest scourge.</P>
      <P>"My heart went out to my fellow farmers, most of whom are in their 50s and 60s,
most of whom are their households' only breadwinners and most of whom had given
over the majority of their paddy to Taigeng No. 4," he said.</P>
      <P>Undaunted, Hsieh said he is planning to increase his farming for the second
harvest this year, adding eight hectares to make a total of 20 hectares under
the plough, in order to meet demand.</P>
      <P>Young as he is, Hsieh has already developed the characteristics of a
philanthropic entrepreneur. He frequents an institution for people suffering
from mental problems not far from his village, where his wife works as a nurse.</P>
      <P>From that institution, he has hired four patients who were able to take up
manual labor jobs at his seedling development quarters, giving them a sense of
worth while allowing Hsieh to make cost savings.</P>
      <P>"Farming is stereotyped as backbreaking and profitless, but I'm determined to be
a cheerful farmer," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"To me, the best compliment is people saying to me that 'your rice brings
happiness,'" Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>Chang, who is working as a volunteer at the foundation, said because there is no
flight school in Taiwan, local airline companies have had to send their student
pilots abroad for training.</P>
      <P>He said the idea of setting up an aviation school in Taiwan was discussed
before, but it never moved beyond the discussion stage because the Ministry of
National Defense wanted to maintain tight control on Taiwan airspace.</P>
      <P>"But the Ministry of National Defense is now more relaxed on the air space
control issue, which makes it possible to establish a civilian flight training
program," Chang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the steadily improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations and
closer air links between Taiwan and mainland China portend growing demand for
civilian aircraft and pilots.</P>
      <P>"This is spurring us to speed up the plans for the establishment of the flight
training school," he added.</P>
      <P>However, he noted, the success of the project hinges on the support of the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The flight school will also provide training for air traffic controllers, he
said. Taiwan is one of the very few countries in the world where air traffic
controllers are not required to receive flight training before assuming their
duties in the tower, he noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) , which provides water to 22 cities and counties
across the country, said Sunday that as of late last year it had achieved a
penetration rate of 90.7 percent on average.</P>
      <P>The current average water supply penetration rate of over 90 percent is much
higher than the average 42.66 percent posted in 1974, when the company was
established, a spokesman for the state-run TWC said.</P>
      <P>According to TWC statistics, the highest penetration rate was in Tainan City in
southern Taiwan, with 99.88 percent of its households on tap. Chiayi City was
second, with 99.66 percent of its residences supplied by the company.</P>
      <P>A rate of over 90 percent was recorded for other 12 cities and counties,
including Taipei, Yilan and Taoyuan counties as well as Keelung and Hsinchu
cities in the north. The others included Changhua and Yunlin counties, Taichung
City in central Taiwan, Tainan County, Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County in the
south and the offshore Penghu County.</P>
      <P>The lowest penetration rate -- 45.13 percent -- was in Pingtung County on
Taiwan's southernmost tip, which is one of the key issues that county
authorities are waiting to have resolved.</P>
      <P>TWC supplies water to 22 cities and counties on Taiwan proper and on the
offshore counties, including Penghu. It serves some 17.3 million people, but its
service does not cover the capital of Taipei City or some areas of the adjoining
Taipei County.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's plan to visit Honduras remains unchanged despite
political uncertainties in the Central American country, Presidential Office
Spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Relevant government authorities, such as the National Security Council and the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will continue to keep a close watch on political
developments in Honduras and will inform the Presidential Office if there is any
need to revise the itinerary for the trip, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"We have not been informed of any changes so far in this regard," he noted.</P>
      <P>Ma is set to embark June 29 on his second trip this year to Central America,
which will take him to three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America --
Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>Ma will first travel to Panama, where he will attend the July 1 inauguration of
Panamanian President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in Panama City.</P>
      <P>Ma will make a transit stop in San Francisco en route to Panama and will stop in
Hawaii on the return trip. He is expected to return to Taiwan July 8.</P>
      <P>He is scheduled to arrive in Honduras July 4 for a two-day state visit, on the
last leg of his Central American tour. During his stay, Ma is expected to sign a
joint comunique with Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on promotion of two-way
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, Honduras has been embroiled in a political standoff that
arose from Zelaya's insistence on a referendum to approve a constitutional
assembly, a move that is seen by some as a bid to prolong his term in office.</P>
      <P>In a standoff with the military, Zelaya earlier last week fired General Romeo
Vasquez Velasquez after the general turned down the president's request that the
military give logistical support for the referendum.</P>
      <P>On Friday the military deployed hundreds of soldiers across the capital
Tegucigalpa in a growing power struggle, after the Supreme Court on Thursday
upheld Vasquez Velasquez position and reinstated the general in his post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan lab to produce 7.5 M. doses of swine flu vaccine by October</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
06/28/09  19:41:49
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly built vaccine plant is set to make available 7.5 million doses of a
vaccine against the influenza A(H1N1) virus, better known as swine flu, before
Oct. 10 this year, the chairman of the biopharmaceutical firm Adimmune Corp.
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Specialists at Adimmune Corp.'s vaccine processing plant in Tanzih township,
central Taiwan are currently experimenting with a virus strain that was provided
by four World Health Organization (WHO) -authorized labs in Australia, Britain
and the United States, Steve Chan told the CNA in an exclusive interview.</P>
      <P>Adimmune, the only human vaccine manufacturer in Taiwan, is scheduled to
complete the experimental process and decide on a vaccine strain for mass
domestic production by the end of August, said Chan. This would pave the way for
animal and human trials of the A(H1N1) vaccine in September, he added.</P>
      <P>Chan, who served as Taiwan's health minister between 1997 and 2000, said the
human clinical trials are scheduled to be completed by the end of September,
giving the vaccine producer enough time to begin mass producing the A(H1N1)
vaccine around Double Ten National Day on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>If all goes according to plan, Taiwan will become the 12th country in the world
capable of producing A(H1N1) vaccines, he said.</P>
      <P>Adimmune's Tanzih plant, in working toward this goal, will advance its original
launch schedule by 18 months, as it had planned to begin mass production of
vaccines against normal influenza in 2011 for export, he added.</P>
      <P>The Tanzih plant, inaugurated in mid-June, is ready to ramp up production of the
A(H1N1) vaccine to fill the orders placed by the Department of Health, as the
WHO has declared the A(H1N1) swine flu a pandemic, which portends a growing
demand for the swine flu vaccine worldwide, Chan said.</P>
      <P>He quoted international health specialists' estimates that in case of a global
outbreak of swine flu, about 400 million to 800 million people around the world
will become infected.</P>
      <P>Chan said he is confident  that Adimmune --  the largest vaccine-producing
company in Asia with a maximum annual capacity of 30 million doses of vaccine --
is capable of meeting the deadline.</P>
      <P>"The company is actually working as a national lab to produce the vaccine in an
emergency mission," Chan said.</P>
      <P>Adimmune is partly controlled by the government and 20 percent of its founding
capital was contributed by the National Development Fund, which is supervised by
the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>With Adimmune's rush to produce the A(H1N1) vaccine on schedule, it cannot spare
the time it would take to acquire the chicken eggs in which vaccines are usually
produced, as the eggs have to meet specific local and international standards,
Chan explained.</P>
      <P>Instead, Adimmune will produce the vaccine based on the cells of chicken
embryos.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, the National Laboratories of Foods and Drugs will begin
inspections of Adimmune's Tanzih plant from Monday to check whether it conforms
to Taiwan's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards.</P>
      <P>WHO representatives are also expected to visit Taiwan soon to inspect the
plant's facilities and its operations, he added.</P>
      <P>Chan brushed off doubts in some quarters that the plant may not be able to
produce quality A(H1N1) swine flu vaccines because of the rush.</P>
      <P>Adimmune Deputy CEO and President Ignatius Wei has said that he will volunteer
to receive the first vaccine that the company's lab produces, Chan said.</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-chou, director of the Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs under the
Department of Health,  has also volunteered  to be inoculated first once the
Adimmune swine flu vaccine is approved by the bureau, Chan added.</P>

p.m., the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported.</P>
      <P>The epicenter of the 5.6 magnitude temblor was located 19.8 kilometers northeast
of the seismology station in Hsiulin, Hualien County, at a depth of 8 kilometers
beneath the ocean floor, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>The other eight quakes, ranging in magnitude from 3.8 to 4.9, struck the eastern
county between 9: 26 a.m. and 5:52 p.m. and were centered within one kilometer
of each other, according to CWB seismologists.</P>
      <P>As of press time, no immediate casualties had been reported in the eastern
county.</P>
      <P>The CWB said the nine quakes occurred as a result of pressure being released

      <P>Honduras has been dropped from President Ma Ying-jeou's itinerary for his
upcoming visit to some of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America, the
Presidential Office said Monday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Ma will cut short his diplomatic
tour, which originally included plans to visit Panama, Nicaragua and Honduras,
and will return to Taiwan two days earlier than scheduled.</P>
      <P>Honduras President Manuel Zeyala was arrested and forced into exile  by military
leaders  Sunday  ahead of a controversial constitutional referendum.</P>
      <P>Wang said the decision to exclude Honduras from Ma's itinerary was based on
safety and security considerations and in view of the fact that the unstable
situation in Honduras precludes the purpose of Ma's visit there.</P>
      <P>With the cancellation of the Honduras leg of the trip, President Ma will return
to Taiwan on July 6, two days ahead of schedule, but his plans to visit Panama
and Nicaragua remain unchanged, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of President Ma's upcoming Central America tour is to attend
the inauguration of Panama's President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in Panama City
July 1, Wang said.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Panama, Ma will also hold talks with senior officials of the
new Panamanian government, visit the Panama Canal, give interviews to the
international news media and meet with Taiwanese community leaders.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China's Shaanxi Province can make better use of the direct cross-
strait charter flight service to develop closer tourism links, a top Chinese
official said Monday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a big tourism market (for us) and we want to strengthen cooperation
with the local tourism industry," Jing Junhai, vice governor of the People's
Government of Shaanxi Province, said at a seminar to promote bilateral tourism
exchanges between Taiwan and Shaanxi.</P>
      <P>He said that the Taiwan tourism industry can work with his government to
customize tour packages for visitors from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The richness and diversity of Shaanxi's natural and historic resources are
beyond compare. We hope more Taiwan tourists would come to visit Shaanxi as it
is an ancient, scenic and modern province," he added.</P>
      <P>Jing said that Shaanxi's central location makes it a convenient destination for
Taiwan travelers, noting that it takes only 2 hour 40 minutes on a direct
charter flight from Taipei to the historic province.</P>
      <P>He added that Shaanxi also offers a multi-faceted experience all year round,
with attractions  that include the historic Qing Terra-cotta Museum, Famen
Temple and Dayan Pagoda. The natural attractions include the Yellow River Hukou
Waterfall,  Qinling Mountain and giant panda natural reserve, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Jing, Shaanxi attracted more than 100 million visitors from home
and abroad in 2008, an increase of 11.94 million from the previous year, which
represented the highest growth in tourist arrivals among all of China's
provinces.</P>
      <P>Jing, who led a delegation of some 20 tourism, economic and trade officials from
Shaanxi Province, arrived in Taiwan June 27 for a week-long trip to promote
cooperation between the tourism industries on both sides.</P>
      <P>The delegation will also hold a seminar to explore more economic and trade
opportunities between Taiwan and Shaanxi.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will not raise travel alert for Honduras: Foreign ministry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not raise its travel alert for Honduras at the moment, as the
turmoil in the Central American country is confined to the center of government
and there are no widespread upheavals, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>"We will not up our travel advisory for Honduras, but we are keeping a close eye
on the situation," said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the MOFA has in place a yellow alert for San Pedro Sula City in
Honduras because of its poor public security. A yellow alert is the lowest on
the MOFA's three-color travel advisory scale and serves as a reminder for
travelers to exercise caution.</P>
      <P>The 70-odd Taiwanese expatriates and businessmen in Honduras, which is one of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the region, are all safe and the Foreign Ministry
is in close contact with its embassy there, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Honduras President Manuel Zelaya was ousted by the country's army Sunday and
forced into exile in Costa Rica,  from where the leftist-aligned president
denounced the military coup as illegal. The country's Supreme Court said it had
ordered the army to remove Zelaya.</P>
      <P>The Honduran Congress later on Sunday named its speaker Roberto Micheletti as an
interim leader.</P>
      <P>Micheletti imposed a curfew for Sunday and Monday night after hundreds of Zelaya
supporters took to the streets in the capital Tegucigalpa and blocked access to
the presidential palace, calling for Zelaya's reinstatement.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the MOFA will expand its travel alert if the protests escalate,
Chen said that is a possibility, but so far the Foreign Ministry has not
considered doing so.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Monday that, due to
safety concerns, Honduras has been dropped from President Ma Ying-jeou's
itinerary for his upcoming state visit to some of Taiwan's allies in Central
America.</P>
      <P>Ma was scheduled to leave for Panama Monday night to attend the inauguration
ceremony  of  Panamanian  President-elect  Ricardo Martinelli and then to travel
to Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>Now that the Honduras leg of the trip has been canceled, Ma will return to
Taiwan July 6, Wang said.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: The Control Yuan debases itself by looking into minor cases</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan drew fire last month when it asked the Ministry of Education to
probe a case in which a dog bit a man on the campus of National Ocean University
in Keelung.</P>
      <P>The members of Control Yuan should know better than to exercise their power on
such trifling matters.</P>
      <P>China Times: Upgrade of local governments should not lead to expansion of
bureaucracy</P>
      <P>Local governments which have been given approval to upgrade into special
municipalities evision brighter prospects for their residents.</P>
      <P>But one of the results of the upgrades will be the expansion of local government
staff, which will increase the burden on taxpayers but not necessarily lead to
better service to the people.</P>
      <P>The central government should seek to prevent such negative consequences by
urging the local governments to think twice before expanding their bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Education Ministry should not back down on plan to foster
students' integrity.</P>
      <P>The Education Ministry retreated after it drew fire for its plans to launch a
1.2 billion campaign to foster integrity, quality and good taste among students.</P>
      <P>Instead of bowing to criticism and downsizing the campaign, the ministry should
work on improving the plan to ensure its success.</P>
      <P>The ministry should address two issues: the fact that education in the country's
schools has failed to foster good character; and the problem of adults,
especially politicians, failing to set good examples for our students.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: It is a historical fact that Taiwan's status is unclear</P>
      <P>When Tokyo's representative to Taiwan Masaki Saito said in May that Taiwan's
status is unclear, he was right.</P>
      <P>Japan gave up Taiwan at the end of the World War Two, but didn't say to whom the
island should be handed over and Taiwan's final status should be determined in
accordance with international law.</P>
      <P>Instead of being irritated by Saito's remark, President Ma should see it as a
warning that his China-leaning policies are causing concern in neighboring
countries.</P>

      <P>The 21st Summer Deaflympics Taipei 2009, which will be held in Asia for the
first time, are expected to attract some 10,000 athletes and visitors to Taiwan,
according to organizers.</P>
      <P>Emile C. J. Sheng, CEO of the Taipei Deaflympics Organizing Committee, said in
Hong Kong Sunday that all the venues for the Taipei Deaflympics are fully
functional and the main task at this stage is to train 8,600 volunteers for the
upcoming event.</P>
      <P>A series of large-scale promotional performances will also be staged during the
run-up to the games, which are scheduled for Sept. 5-15, Sheng added.</P>
      <P>Well-known Taiwanese stage director Lai Sheng-chuan will be in charge of the
artistic components of the Deaflympics opening and closing ceremonies, said
Sheng who was in Hong Kong for Deaflympics promotion.</P>
      <P>According to Sheng, Taiwan singer A-mei has been invited to perform at the
opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the committee has invited Hong Kong pop star Aaron Kwok to
serve as a spokesperson for the Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>The Deaflympics date back to 1924, when they were held for the first time in
Paris. In 1995, they received official recognition from the International
Olympics Committee and today, 96 national deaf sports federations are members of
the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan City and Tainan County finally had their demands met Monday after the
Executive Yuan decided to approve their applications for a merger, giving the
two administrative areas joint status as a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin also announced the upgrading
to special municipality status of Taipei County, Taichung City and Taichung
County into a single municipality, and Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County into
a single municipality, following a Cabinet meeting hosed by Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan.</P>
      <P>Liu ratified the upgrading, adhering to decisions made by an ad hoc panel
organized by the Ministry of the Interior to review applications  from local
governments seeking upgraded municipal status.</P>
      <P>The review panel approved June 23 the applications submitted by Taipei County,
Taichung City, Taichung County, Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County, while
rejecting those from Taoyuan County, Changhua County, Yunlin County and Chiayi
County.</P>
      <P>The panel, however, failed to reach a unanimous decision on whether Tainan City
and Tainan County should be merged and upgraded.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Cabinet finally approved the Tainan case based on the premise that
it is an important historic and cultural landmark.</P>
      <P>At present, only Taipei City and Kaohsiung City enjoy special municipality
status.</P>
      <P>An area with a population of over 1.25 million and with specific political,
economic, cultural and urban developments can obtain special municipality
status, giving a bigger share of national resources.</P>
      <P>At the Cabinet meeting, Liu explained the government's idea of establishing
"three metropolises" in Taiwan, which he said will help sharpen  the nation's
competitive  edge and balance  regional development thanks to their locations --
evenly spread over northern, central and southern regions.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the metropolises is designed to promote regional
modernization,  Liu added,  noting  that other local governments will be
encouraged to launch inter-city and inter-county cooperation programs to expand
local construction.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in the future, Taiwan's regional development will be
promoted in seven integrated areas -- the Taipei, Keelung and Yilan area; the
Taoyuan Hsinchu and Miaoli areas; the Taichung, Changhua and Nantou areas; the
Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan areas; the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas; the Hualien
and Taitung areas; and the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Each area will be asked to organize a working platform for plans to push for
integrated regional development, Liu went on, noting that these platforms will
be given financial support by the central government.</P>
      <P>The special municipalities will also be authorized to coordinate work to promote
the integrated regional development, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can further improve the energy efficiency of its new and existing
buildings by achieving a potential 30 percent reduction in both energy use and
carbon emissions using technologies that are already available, the European
Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should pick up its pace to catch up with the world in energy
conservation  by raising and instating  legally binding standards to improve
energy efficiency, " said Andreas Gursch, chairman of the ECCT's Energy and
Environment Committee, at a news conference to release a report titled "Energy-
Saving Measures for Taiwan's Built Environment."</P>
      <P>According to Gursch, while 30 percent would not be difficult to achieve and
could be done through existing technologies, what Taiwan needs is willingness on
the part of the government, entrepreneurs and the general public to work
together, especially when Taiwan's building insulation standards are two times
less strict than those in Europe.</P>
      <P>The report draws on the results of a computer simulation conducted by the ECCT
and National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), as well as best practices
and cutting-edge technologies from Europe, to improve the energy efficiency of
new and existing buildings in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results of the simulation with real climate data and typical user patterns
in Taiwan show a potential 30 percent reduction in both energy use and carbon
emissions in office buildings and residential high rises, which is equivalent to
NT$46 billion in dollar terms, or reductions of 12 million tons of greenhouse
gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuei-peng, an assistant professor at NTUT, said at the news conference that
as commercial and residential buildings account for around 35 percent of
Taiwan's total electricity use, saving 30 percent in energy is equal to a
reduction of 10 percent of electricity usage.</P>
      <P>"Energy conservation is a kind of invisible power plant, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>The report recommends the establishment of an inter-ministerial task force to
develop new regulations for Taiwan to improve building code standards and
promote the use of environmentally friendly technology.</P>
      <P>It also suggests that special skills in monitoring, energy simulation,  building
management  and maintenance,  design and construction should be included in the
education of architects, engineers  and  construction  workers  to raise  the
necessary professional skills and public awareness.</P>
      <P>The report concludes by emphasizing  that important policy decisions such as a
timeline for emissions reductions or carbon taxation versus a cap and trade
system should be made within the framework of international  standards that are
presently being developed.</P>
      <P>According to the ECCT,  the report has been presented to government  officials
such as Economic  Affairs Minister Yiin Chii-ming,  Taipei Magistrate  Chou Hsi-
wei  and Energy Bureau Director-General Yeh Huey-ching.</P>
      <P>The ECCT, which represents 370 multinational companies and 650 individual
members from more than 30 different countries, is the principle organization
promoting European business interests in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beef imports from the United States to Taiwan over the past four years have
grown faster than those from Australia and New Zealand, according to the latest
government statistics.</P>
      <P>Since  Taiwan  partially re-opened its market in 2005 to U.S. boneless beef from
cattle younger than 30 months, imports of U.S. beef have been rising steadily in
terms of volume and unit price, according to  statistics compiled by the Animal
Industry Department of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>U.S. beef imports to Taiwan  in 2008 totaled 22,572 metric tons, accounting for
30.84 percent of the country's beef imports, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The volume of U.S. beef imports to Taiwan grew from 7,041 metric tons in 2005,
to 18,260 metric tons in 2006, and 19,295 metric tons in 2007.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, beef imports from Australia decreased from 30,254 metric tons in 2005
to 26,741 metric tons in 2008, while imports from New Zealand dropped from
28,092 metric tons to 19,429 metric tons over that period.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened its market to foreign beef imports in 1975, the United
States, Australia and New Zealand have been its three major import sources.
Taiwan suspended beef imports from the United States in 2003 after a case of mad
cow disease was reported in that country earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>Currently, frozen beef from the United States is quoted at US$8.87 per kilogram,
more than double the average price of US$4.3 per kilogram for the same product
from other countries.</P>
      <P>The controversial issue of whether Taiwan should fully open its market to U.S.
beef has been the topic of much debate since Stephen M. Young, departing
director of the American Institute in Taiwan's Taipei Office, said last week
that it is getting very close to the time when Taiwan would make a full opening
to U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese importers have repeatedly given assurances on the safety of U.S. beef,
but local consumers have expressed concerns and have asked the government to
provide clear information on the issue.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Saturday that the government has not
set a timetable for a full opening to U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Executive  Yuan will fully respect  the professional judgment
of the Department of Health (DOH) on the issue, and he brushed aside
speculations  on the possibility of the government permitting full importation
of U.S. beef with effect from the end of June.</P>

      <P>Southern Taiwan's Kenting National Park Administration urged motorists Monday to
slow down when driving on the highway near the coastal area of Kenting, Pingtung
County because large numbers of land crabs will soon be making their way down to
the sea to lay eggs.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of the crabs will cross Provincial Highway 1 in the town to spawn on
the seashore beginning July 7 or July 8 this year and continuing to late
October, the high season for land crabs to spawn, park rangers told reporters.</P>
      <P>As the highway separates the land crabs' normal habitat from their spawning
grounds, the crustaceans used to be crushed by passing vehicles, which prompted
the park administration to later enact traffic restrictions at the peak spawning
season to protect the creatures.</P>
      <P>The move is a part of increasing efforts made by Taiwan's government and people
in recent years to protect animals and the environment.</P>
      <P>The highway runs along Kenting's Banana Bay, the part of which near Oluanpi is
the main spawning area for the crabs.</P>
      <P>Rangers on Monday reminded motorists to be extra careful when driving on that
part of the highway at night from July to October. During this period, female
crabs loaded with eggs make their way across the highway down to the sea to
spawn at night time.</P>
      <P>Along the highway at Banana Bay, a public traffic sign has been erected warning
motorists to "Watch out for land crabs and drive slowly."</P>
      <P>According to a research study conducted by an academic institute several years
ago, 25 different species of land crabs live near the Banana Bay area, making it
the No. 1 place in the world in terms of species diversity of land crabs.</P>
      <P>"The number of species has increased to 28 now, thanks to conservation
measures," the rangers said.</P>

      <P>If you're one of those people who can't, don't have time or don't like to cook,
your answer might be an automatic wok, according to inventors of the robot-like
devise unveiled Monday, which is capable of stir-frying Chinese dishes such as
gong bao diced chicken.</P>
      <P>The invention by a research team from southern Taiwan's Shu-Te University, comes
with a traditional wok, a robotic arm holding a spatula to be installed near the
gas stove in one's kitchen, a touch-panel PDA and a radio frequency
identification (RFID) reader.</P>
      <P>"It is capable  of reading  the manual  instructions  for stir-frying, braising
or stewing," said Chen Chih-yung, an assistant professor  with the university's
Department  of Computer  and Communication.</P>
      <P>By following the PDA's audio instructions, even someone who has never cooked can
partake in cooking after washing and cutting up the ingredients. The RFID system
in the PDA will let the person know what what seasonings to add, while the
automatic spatula will stir fry the ingredients, before serving the hot dish on
a plate, said Chen, who leads the research team.</P>
      <P>For now, the automatic wok and its RFID system can cook gong bao diced chicken,
beef with green onions and stir-fried tomato and eggs, Chen said. Eventually, it
can be programmed to make more elaborate dishes.</P>
      <P>The inventors have applied with the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a patent
for the automatic wok and its technology.</P>
      <P>The automatic wok is part of a system -- known as Integrating RFID Technology
into Shopping and Cooking system -- that won the top prize in a nationwide
college RFID application contest this month.</P>
      <P>Inventors  are also seeking  patent rights  for two other technologies of their
shopping and cooking system -- a robotic shopping trolley and a supermarket
navigation system.</P>
      <P>Tseng Cheng-kuang, a postgraduate student from the department and a team member,
said the shopping and cooking system is aimed at helping people who do not know
how to cook, but crave safe, hot home-made fare.</P>
      <P>No timetable has been set for commercial production of the system, Tseng said.</P>

      <P>As of noon Monday, 54 earthquakes strong enough to be felt had been recorded,
with the strongest one reaching 5.6 on the open-ended Richter scale, the
bureau's Seismology Center said.</P>
      <P>As the Taroko National Park, one of Taiwan's most popular tourist attractions,
is located near the quake zone, rocks have fallen sporadically along several
trails in the park, rangers said.</P>
      <P>The falling rocks have not caused any injuries or casualties, but the Taroko
National Park Administration has ordered closure of the park's four major trails
-- Jhueilu Historic Trail, Changchun Shrine Trail, Skadang Trail and Yanzikou
(Swallow Grotto) Trail -- as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>"The shutdown will remain valid for two days until the end of Tuesday, " a park
administrator said, adding that whether the order will be extended will depend
on the situation.</P>
      <P>"The trails will not be re-opened until after the seismic situation stabilizes,
and we hope travelers will observe the ban out of concern for their own safety,"
he urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Suicide is second killer of Taiwanese youth: prevention center</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
06/29/09  21:32:49

    <TEXT>
      <P>Suicide remained the second leading cause of death among young Taiwanese men and
women aged 15-24 in 2008, with 60 percent of the cases related to relationship
problems,  a government official reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-pin, director of the Taiwan Suicide Prevention Center under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) , said 4,092 suicide attempts by
members of the age bracket were reported to authorities last year, and 201
people succeeded in taking their own lives.</P>
      <P>Traffic accidents were the No. 1 factor which took away the lives of Taiwan's
youth last year, while malignant tumour was the third leading killer.</P>
      <P>The 201 suicide deaths marked a fall of 14 percent from the 2007 number, but the
more than 3,600 other young men and women whose attempts to kill themselves
failed now form the group with the highest possibility of attempting suicide
again, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lee would not speculate, however, on whether the growing number of suicide
attempts were linked to the global economic downturn, saying further analysis
was needed.</P>
      <P>The number of reported suicide cases involving Taiwan's young men and women has
been steadily increasing over the past four years, an expert said.</P>
      <P>Based on the youth suicide cases reported to authorities since 2006, Lee said 60
percent were driven by relationship problems, while academic pressure, to the
surprise of many, accounted for less than 3 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>About 25 percent of these young people sought to end their lives by taking
sleeping pills or sedatives, followed by 21 percent of whom tried to slit their
wrists. Self-staged poisoning and suicides using gases or by burning charcoal
resulted in the highest mortality rate of any method at 35.3 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee called on parents and teachers to pay adequate concern to the youth suicide
problem by patiently listening to their voices instead of rashly labeling them
as "fragile strawberries."</P>
      <P>The DOH reported earlier in the month that Taiwan's suicide mortality rate
increased by 3.3 percent in 2008 from the previous year -- a trend some believed
could be linked to financial problems caused by the sagging economy.</P>
      <P>Among all age groups, suicide was the ninth leading cause of death in Taiwan
last year, up one notch from 2007, a DOH report showed.</P>

      <P>People riding the Taipei rapid transit system's new Neihu Line Monday on its
first day of passenger test runs were generally satisfied with the new service,
but some also complained about the line's narrow cars.</P>
      <P>A total of 21,648 people tried the new Taipei Metro line Monday, the first day
of a three-day trial run.</P>
      <P>A woman surnamed Peng took her octogenarian wheelchair-bound father for a ride
on the train, saying that "it will be more convenient for me to take my father
to Taipei City with the new Metro line."</P>
      <P>Aslam, a Pakistani from Hong Kong traveling in Taiwan, said he learned about the
free test rides in the newspaper and was "very satisfied" with the service.</P>
      <P>A 75-year passenger surnamed Yeh said she "felt it was a quite comfortable
experience, " and she is planning to take her 93-year-old mother with her on the
train Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A woman surnamed Hsieh, however, complained about the narrow train cars, asking
why Taipei Metro did not make the cars bigger and more comfortable since it was
the newest line built.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also complained about the distribution of test ride tickets and the
returning of the tickets at the end of the journey, saying that this was
"troublesome" and a "waste of money."</P>
      <P>During the test runs, two small incidents occurred, although both proved to be
false alarms.</P>
      <P>At 9: 10 a.m., a signal appeared warning that a train's brakes had locked, while
at 10: 30 a.m., an MRT sensor detected a foreign object on the tracks.</P>
      <P>In both cases, trains were immediately brought to a stop and kept in place for
over a minute before the false alarms disappeared.</P>
      <P>Taipei Metro said it would "review the two incidents, " and that "it is also
improving the noise problem along the line."</P>
      <P>The Neihu line is slated to formally open to the public on July 4.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Metro Neihu Line is a medium capacity system and runs on an elevated
corridor except near Taipei Songshan Airport. The line spans 14.8 kilometers and
intersects with the Muzha Line, providing direct service through Neihu, Nangang
and Muzha.</P>
      <P>The construction of the line began in May 2002. During his time as mayor of
Taipei, President Ma Ying-jeou battled soaring costs and construction delays.</P>
      <P>The line's "high volume, underground" model was changed to a "medium volume,
above ground" model, and when he was mayor, Ma personally fought for the
inclusion of a station at Songshan Airport.</P>
      <P>To drum up interest for the Neihu line's opening, Taipei Metro is giving away
free tickets for rides on the line until July 1. Some 50,000 tickets will be
distributed per day on both June 29 and 30, and 30,000 will be handed out on
July 1.</P>
      <P>Travelers can collect the free tickets at the 10 participating stations along
the line: Jiannan Road Station, Xihu Station, Gangqian Station, Wende Station,
Neihu Station, Dahu Station, Huzhou Station, Donghu Station, Nangang Software
Park Station, and Nangang Exhibition Center Station.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou departed Taipei Monday on a visit to two of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in Central America in an effort to cement mutual friendship
and expand cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>The June 29-July 6 journey is taking Ma to Panama and Nicaragua, with a transit
stop in San Francisco en route to Panama City and another layover in Hawaii on
his way home.</P>
      <P>This is Ma's second diplomatic tour of the region, one of Taiwan's diplomatic
strongholds, so far this year.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure, Ma said the visit is part of his "modous vivendi"
diplomatic strategy, which calls for a pragmatic and flexible approach to
simultaneously maintain solid diplomatic ties with allied countries while
forging substantive partnerships with non-allied nations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the strategy has paved the way for a diplomatic truce with China, Ma
said his administration can now more efficienctly use national resources to
consolidate relations with the country's 23 diplomatic  allies  in  addition  to
developing  substantative partnerships with countries that do not maintain
formal relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of President Ma's upcoming Central America tour is to attend
the inauguration of Panama's President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in Panama City
July 1.</P>
      <P>His itinerary originally included a two-day visit to Honduras, but Ma decided to
cancel his travel plans there after Honduran President Manuel Zeyala was
arrested and forced into exile by military leaders Sunday ahead of a
controversial constitutional referendum.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Monday that Ma will return to
Taiwan July 6, two days earlier than scheduled.</P>
      <P>Wang said the decision to exclude Honduras from Ma's itinerary was based on
safety and security considerations and because the unstable situation in
Honduras precludes the purpose of Ma's visit there.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Panama, Ma will hold talks with senior officials of the new
Panamanian government, visit the Panama Canal, give interviews to the
international news media and meet with Taiwanese community leaders.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching is accompanying Ma on the June 29-July 6 diplomatic
tour. Chow will visit a charity organization that is headed by the new
Panamanian first lady.</P>
      <P>Following his trip to Panama, Ma will travel to Nicaragua where Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega will drive him to the hub of a bilateral technological
cooperation project, which will allow Ma to interact with Nicaraguan citizens.</P>
      <P>Ma will also attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a large trade fair to be held
in Nicaragua July 1-5, at which many Taiwanese companies are expected to exhibit
their latest products.</P>
      <P>During the Nicaragua visit, first lady Chow will visit the local branch of World
Vision -- a Christian charity dedicated to helping disadvantaged people around
the world -- and a development center for physically challenged children.</P>
      <P>He is traveling at the head of a 129-member delegation of government officials,
legislators, industry executives, academics, university presidents,  local
government chiefs,  charity group executives and performing artists.</P>

      <P>The focus of Taiwan's homeland development will be adjusted after a number of
the country's regional governments were formally upgraded to municipalities
Monday, with more balanced growth the main objective.</P>
      <P>Jiang Yi-huah,  minister of the Research,  Development and Evaluation
Commission, said the government's local development plan will now concentrate on
the "three major living circles" and seven integrated areas.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou originally proposed to streamline Taiwan's 25 counties
and cities, including the two special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung,
into three metropolitan areas and 15 counties, with a metropolitan area located
in each of Taiwan's northern, central and southern regions to encourage more
balanced development.</P>
      <P>Those plans will be modified after the Cabinet on Monday approved the mergers of
Taichung City and County, Kaohsiung City and County and Tainan City and County,
and the upgrading of Taipei County's status.</P>
      <P>The government now intends to pursue balanced development in seven regions,
Jiang said, grouped as follows: the Taipei, Keelung and Yilan area; the Taoyuan,
Hsinchu and Miaoli area; the Taichung, Changhua and Nantou area; the Yunlin,
Chiayi and Tainan area; the Kaohsung and Pingtung area; the Hualien and Taitung
area; and the Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu area.</P>
      <P>In the future, Jiang said, efforts will be made to highlight different
advantages of the seven planned integrated areas, such as the highly competitive
agricultural sector in the Yunlin, Chiayi and Nantou area, or the high-tech
cluster and well-preserved Hakka culture in the Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli
area.</P>
      <P>With this commitment to more balanced regional growth, the Cabinet hopes the
long-existing inequity in the distribution of funds from the central to local
governments will be resolved.</P>
      <P>At present, the two special municipalities receive 43 percent of the allocation
for local governments, while the other 23 cities and counties share the rest.</P>
      <P>But Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Monday that his agency has drafted a
legal revision that, if passed, would allocate funds to all local governments
based on the more equitable measures of population and administrative scale.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The mastermind of a drug trafficking ring that allegedly used young women as
mules has been arrested, officials of the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his surname of Liu, was rounded up Sunday in the
northern port city of Keelung on charges of having smuggled at least 8 kilograms
of high-grade heroin into Taiwan over the past two weeks alone, the MJIB
officials said.</P>
      <P>Liu's capture followed the arrest of a 31-year-old woman June 25 at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport for allegedly attempting to smuggle 10 heroin
bricks weighing a total of 3.5 kilograms into Taiwan from Myanmar, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The drugs were worth an estimated NT$100 million (US$3.03 million) on the
street.</P>
      <P>Since direct flight services between Taiwan and the Myanmar capital of Yangon
were launched last year, MJIB agents said the four weekly Taipei-Yangon flights
have become a new drug trafficking route, known as the "airborne heroin
trafficking corridor."</P>
      <P>The route connects Taiwan directly with the notorious Golden Triangle narcotics
production hub.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation found that drug trafficking mules in Liu's ring had
been seized three times over the past six months.</P>
      <P>As a result, Liu changed his tactics by hiring pretty married young women with
young children to serve as mules to reduce the risk of inviting attention or
close inspection from customs agents at ports of entry.</P>
      <P>The newly arrested woman, identified by her family name Shen, told investigators
that Liu interviewed her and demanded that she travel with her 14-year-old
daughter to Myanmar to smuggle contraband drugs into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that heroin is a first grade statutory  contraband substance, MJIB
officials said those caught selling or trafficking heroin could be subject to
the death penalty or life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>They urged local residents to not be tempted by money into serving as mules of
criminal rings.</P>

      <P>Tainan City and Tainan County finally had their demands met Monday after the
Executive Yuan decided to approve their applications for a merger, giving the
two administrative areas joint status as a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin also announced the upgrading
to special municipality status of Taipei County, Taichung City and Taichung
County into a single municipality, and Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County into
a single municipality, following a Cabinet meeting hosed by Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan.</P>
      <P>Liu ratified the upgrading, adhering to decisions made by an ad hoc panel
organized by the Ministry of the Interior to review applications  from local
governments seeking upgraded municipal status.</P>
      <P>The review panel approved June 23 the applications submitted by Taipei County,
Taichung City, Taichung County, Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County, while
rejecting those from Taoyuan County, Changhua County, Yunlin County and Chiayi
County.</P>
      <P>The panel, however, failed to reach a unanimous decision on whether Tainan City
and Tainan County should be merged and upgraded.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Cabinet finally approved the Tainan case based on the premise that
it is an important historic and cultural landmark.</P>
      <P>At present, only Taipei City and Kaohsiung City enjoy special municipality
status.</P>
      <P>An area with a population of over 1.25 million and with specific political,
economic, cultural and urban developments can obtain special municipality
status, giving a bigger share of national resources.</P>
      <P>At the Cabinet meeting, Liu explained the government's idea of establishing
"three metropolises" in Taiwan, which he said will help sharpen  the nation's
competitive  edge and balance  regional development thanks to their locations --
evenly spread over northern, central and southern regions.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the metropolises is designed to promote regional
modernization,  Liu added,  noting  that other local governments will be
encouraged to launch inter-city and inter-county cooperation programs to expand
local construction.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in the future, Taiwan's regional development will be
promoted in seven integrated areas -- the Taipei, Keelung and Yilan area; the
Taoyuan Hsinchu and Miaoli areas; the Taichung, Changhua and Nantou areas; the
Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan areas; the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas; the Hualien
and Taitung areas; and the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Each area will be asked to organize a working platform for plans to push for
integrated regional development, Liu went on, noting that these platforms will
be given financial support by the central government.</P>
      <P>The special municipalities will also be authorized to coordinate work to promote
the integrated regional development, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>European Chamber of Commerce pitches for energy-efficient buildings</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29 (CNA)
06/29/09  18:21:29

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can further improve the energy efficiency of its new and existing
buildings by achieving a potential 30 percent reduction in both energy use and
carbon emissions using technologies that are already available, the European
Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should pick up its pace to catch up with the world in energy
conservation  by raising and instating  legally binding standards to improve
energy efficiency, " said Andreas Gursch, chairman of the ECCT's Energy and
Environment Committee, at a news conference to release a report titled "Energy-
Saving Measures for Taiwan's Built Environment."</P>
      <P>According to Gursch, while 30 percent would not be difficult to achieve and
could be done through existing technologies, what Taiwan needs is willingness on
the part of the government, entrepreneurs and the general public to work
together, especially when Taiwan's building insulation standards are two times
less strict than those in Europe.</P>
      <P>The report draws on the results of a computer simulation conducted by the ECCT
and National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), as well as best practices
and cutting-edge technologies from Europe, to improve the energy efficiency of
new and existing buildings in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results of the simulation with real climate data and typical user patterns
in Taiwan show a potential 30 percent reduction in both energy use and carbon
emissions in office buildings and residential high rises, which is equivalent to
NT$46 billion in dollar terms, or reductions of 12 million tons of greenhouse
gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuei-peng, an assistant professor at NTUT, said at the news conference that
as commercial and residential buildings account for around 35 percent of
Taiwan's total electricity use, saving 30 percent in energy is equal to a
reduction of 10 percent of electricity usage.</P>
      <P>"Energy conservation is a kind of invisible power plant, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>The report recommends the establishment of an inter-ministerial task force to
develop new regulations for Taiwan to improve building code standards and
promote the use of environmentally friendly technology.</P>
      <P>It also suggests that special skills in monitoring, energy simulation,  building
management  and maintenance,  design and construction should be included in the
education of architects, engineers  and  construction  workers  to raise  the
necessary professional skills and public awareness.</P>
      <P>The report concludes by emphasizing  that important policy decisions such as a
timeline for emissions reductions or carbon taxation versus a cap and trade
system should be made within the framework of international  standards that are
presently being developed.</P>
      <P>According to the ECCT,  the report has been presented to government  officials
such as Economic  Affairs Minister Yiin Chii-ming,  Taipei Magistrate  Chou Hsi-
wei  and Energy Bureau Director-General Yeh Huey-ching.</P>
      <P>The ECCT, which represents 370 multinational companies and 650 individual
members from more than 30 different countries, is the principle organization
promoting European business interests in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. beef imports to Taiwan continue to rise</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
06/29/09  18:28:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beef imports from the United States to Taiwan over the past four years have
grown faster than those from Australia and New Zealand, according to the latest
government statistics.</P>
      <P>Since  Taiwan  partially re-opened its market in 2005 to U.S. boneless beef from
cattle younger than 30 months, imports of U.S. beef have been rising steadily in
terms of volume and unit price, according to  statistics compiled by the Animal
Industry Department of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>U.S. beef imports to Taiwan  in 2008 totaled 22,572 metric tons, accounting for
30.84 percent of the country's beef imports, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The volume of U.S. beef imports to Taiwan grew from 7,041 metric tons in 2005,
to 18,260 metric tons in 2006, and 19,295 metric tons in 2007.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, beef imports from Australia decreased from 30,254 metric tons in 2005
to 26,741 metric tons in 2008, while imports from New Zealand dropped from
28,092 metric tons to 19,429 metric tons over that period.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened its market to foreign beef imports in 1975, the United
States, Australia and New Zealand have been its three major import sources.
Taiwan suspended beef imports from the United States in 2003 after a case of mad
cow disease was reported in that country earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>Currently, frozen beef from the United States is quoted at US$8.87 per kilogram,
more than double the average price of US$4.3 per kilogram for the same product
from other countries.</P>
      <P>The controversial issue of whether Taiwan should fully open its market to U.S.
beef has been the topic of much debate since Stephen M. Young, departing
director of the American Institute in Taiwan's Taipei Office, said last week
that it is getting very close to the time when Taiwan would make a full opening
to U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese importers have repeatedly given assurances on the safety of U.S. beef,
but local consumers have expressed concerns and have asked the government to
provide clear information on the issue.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Saturday that the government has not
set a timetable for a full opening to U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Executive  Yuan will fully respect  the professional judgment
of the Department of Health (DOH) on the issue, and he brushed aside
speculations  on the possibility of the government permitting full importation
of U.S. beef with effect from the end of June.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Southern Taiwan's Kenting National Park Administration urged motorists Monday to
slow down when driving on the highway near the coastal area of Kenting, Pingtung
County because large numbers of land crabs will soon be making their way down to
the sea to lay eggs.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of the crabs will cross Provincial Highway 1 in the town to spawn on
the seashore beginning July 7 or July 8 this year and continuing to late
October, the high season for land crabs to spawn, park rangers told reporters.</P>
      <P>As the highway separates the land crabs' normal habitat from their spawning
grounds, the crustaceans used to be crushed by passing vehicles, which prompted
the park administration to later enact traffic restrictions at the peak spawning
season to protect the creatures.</P>
      <P>The move is a part of increasing efforts made by Taiwan's government and people
in recent years to protect animals and the environment.</P>
      <P>The highway runs along Kenting's Banana Bay, the part of which near Oluanpi is
the main spawning area for the crabs.</P>
      <P>Rangers on Monday reminded motorists to be extra careful when driving on that
part of the highway at night from July to October. During this period, female
crabs loaded with eggs make their way across the highway down to the sea to
spawn at night time.</P>
      <P>Along the highway at Banana Bay, a public traffic sign has been erected warning
motorists to "Watch out for land crabs and drive slowly."</P>
      <P>According to a research study conducted by an academic institute several years
ago, 25 different species of land crabs live near the Banana Bay area, making it
the No. 1 place in the world in terms of species diversity of land crabs.</P>
      <P>"The number of species has increased to 28 now, thanks to conservation
measures," the rangers said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Don't know how to cook? Try the automatic wok</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If you're one of those people who can't, don't have time or don't like to cook,
your answer might be an automatic wok, according to inventors of the robot-like
devise unveiled Monday, which is capable of stir-frying Chinese dishes such as
gong bao diced chicken.</P>
      <P>The invention by a research team from southern Taiwan's Shu-Te University, comes
with a traditional wok, a robotic arm holding a spatula to be installed near the
gas stove in one's kitchen, a touch-panel PDA and a radio frequency
identification (RFID) reader.</P>
      <P>"It is capable  of reading  the manual  instructions  for stir-frying, braising
or stewing," said Chen Chih-yung, an assistant professor  with the university's
Department  of Computer  and Communication.</P>
      <P>By following the PDA's audio instructions, even someone who has never cooked can
partake in cooking after washing and cutting up the ingredients. The RFID system
in the PDA will let the person know what what seasonings to add, while the
automatic spatula will stir fry the ingredients, before serving the hot dish on
a plate, said Chen, who leads the research team.</P>
      <P>For now, the automatic wok and its RFID system can cook gong bao diced chicken,
beef with green onions and stir-fried tomato and eggs, Chen said. Eventually, it
can be programmed to make more elaborate dishes.</P>
      <P>The inventors have applied with the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a patent
for the automatic wok and its technology.</P>
      <P>The automatic wok is part of a system -- known as Integrating RFID Technology
into Shopping and Cooking system -- that won the top prize in a nationwide
college RFID application contest this month.</P>
      <P>Inventors  are also seeking  patent rights  for two other technologies of their
shopping and cooking system -- a robotic shopping trolley and a supermarket
navigation system.</P>
      <P>Tseng Cheng-kuang, a postgraduate student from the department and a team member,
said the shopping and cooking system is aimed at helping people who do not know
how to cook, but crave safe, hot home-made fare.</P>
      <P>No timetable has been set for commercial production of the system, Tseng said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Major trails in Taroko National Park in eastern Taiwan were closed after more
than 50 earthquakes were recorded in its vicinity over the past two days, park
rangers said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau, earthquakes have struck along the
seashore of Hualien County's Hoping area intermittently since early Sunday
morning.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, 54 earthquakes strong enough to be felt had been recorded,
with the strongest one reaching 5.6 on the open-ended Richter scale, the
bureau's Seismology Center said.</P>
      <P>As the Taroko National Park, one of Taiwan's most popular tourist attractions,
is located near the quake zone, rocks have fallen sporadically along several
trails in the park, rangers said.</P>
      <P>The falling rocks have not caused any injuries or casualties, but the Taroko
National Park Administration has ordered closure of the park's four major trails
-- Jhueilu Historic Trail, Changchun Shrine Trail, Skadang Trail and Yanzikou
(Swallow Grotto) Trail -- as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>"The shutdown will remain valid for two days until the end of Tuesday, " a park
administrator said, adding that whether the order will be extended will depend
on the situation.</P>
      <P>"The trails will not be re-opened until after the seismic situation stabilizes,
and we hope travelers will observe the ban out of concern for their own safety,"
he urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Suicide is second killer of Taiwanese youth: prevention center</HEADLINE>

06/29/09  21:32:49

    <TEXT>
      <P>Suicide remained the second leading cause of death among young Taiwanese men and
women aged 15-24 in 2008, with 60 percent of the cases related to relationship
problems,  a government official reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-pin, director of the Taiwan Suicide Prevention Center under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) , said 4,092 suicide attempts by
members of the age bracket were reported to authorities last year, and 201
people succeeded in taking their own lives.</P>
      <P>Traffic accidents were the No. 1 factor which took away the lives of Taiwan's
youth last year, while malignant tumour was the third leading killer.</P>
      <P>The 201 suicide deaths marked a fall of 14 percent from the 2007 number, but the
more than 3,600 other young men and women whose attempts to kill themselves
failed now form the group with the highest possibility of attempting suicide
again, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lee would not speculate, however, on whether the growing number of suicide
attempts were linked to the global economic downturn, saying further analysis
was needed.</P>
      <P>The number of reported suicide cases involving Taiwan's young men and women has
been steadily increasing over the past four years, an expert said.</P>
      <P>Based on the youth suicide cases reported to authorities since 2006, Lee said 60
percent were driven by relationship problems, while academic pressure, to the
surprise of many, accounted for less than 3 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>About 25 percent of these young people sought to end their lives by taking
sleeping pills or sedatives, followed by 21 percent of whom tried to slit their
wrists. Self-staged poisoning and suicides using gases or by burning charcoal
resulted in the highest mortality rate of any method at 35.3 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee called on parents and teachers to pay adequate concern to the youth suicide
problem by patiently listening to their voices instead of rashly labeling them
as "fragile strawberries."</P>
      <P>The DOH reported earlier in the month that Taiwan's suicide mortality rate
increased by 3.3 percent in 2008 from the previous year -- a trend some believed
could be linked to financial problems caused by the sagging economy.</P>
      <P>Among all age groups, suicide was the ninth leading cause of death in Taiwan
last year, up one notch from 2007, a DOH report showed.</P>

      <P>People riding the Taipei rapid transit system's new Neihu Line Monday on its
first day of passenger test runs were generally satisfied with the new service,
but some also complained about the line's narrow cars.</P>
      <P>A total of 21,648 people tried the new Taipei Metro line Monday, the first day
of a three-day trial run.</P>
      <P>A woman surnamed Peng took her octogenarian wheelchair-bound father for a ride
on the train, saying that "it will be more convenient for me to take my father
to Taipei City with the new Metro line."</P>
      <P>Aslam, a Pakistani from Hong Kong traveling in Taiwan, said he learned about the
free test rides in the newspaper and was "very satisfied" with the service.</P>
      <P>A 75-year passenger surnamed Yeh said she "felt it was a quite comfortable
experience, " and she is planning to take her 93-year-old mother with her on the
train Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A woman surnamed Hsieh, however, complained about the narrow train cars, asking
why Taipei Metro did not make the cars bigger and more comfortable since it was
the newest line built.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also complained about the distribution of test ride tickets and the
returning of the tickets at the end of the journey, saying that this was
"troublesome" and a "waste of money."</P>
      <P>During the test runs, two small incidents occurred, although both proved to be
false alarms.</P>
      <P>At 9: 10 a.m., a signal appeared warning that a train's brakes had locked, while
at 10: 30 a.m., an MRT sensor detected a foreign object on the tracks.</P>
      <P>In both cases, trains were immediately brought to a stop and kept in place for
over a minute before the false alarms disappeared.</P>
      <P>Taipei Metro said it would "review the two incidents, " and that "it is also
improving the noise problem along the line."</P>
      <P>The Neihu line is slated to formally open to the public on July 4.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Metro Neihu Line is a medium capacity system and runs on an elevated
corridor except near Taipei Songshan Airport. The line spans 14.8 kilometers and
intersects with the Muzha Line, providing direct service through Neihu, Nangang
and Muzha.</P>
      <P>The construction of the line began in May 2002. During his time as mayor of
Taipei, President Ma Ying-jeou battled soaring costs and construction delays.</P>
      <P>The line's "high volume, underground" model was changed to a "medium volume,
above ground" model, and when he was mayor, Ma personally fought for the
inclusion of a station at Songshan Airport.</P>
      <P>To drum up interest for the Neihu line's opening, Taipei Metro is giving away
free tickets for rides on the line until July 1. Some 50,000 tickets will be
distributed per day on both June 29 and 30, and 30,000 will be handed out on
July 1.</P>
      <P>Travelers can collect the free tickets at the 10 participating stations along
the line: Jiannan Road Station, Xihu Station, Gangqian Station, Wende Station,
Neihu Station, Dahu Station, Huzhou Station, Donghu Station, Nangang Software
Park Station, and Nangang Exhibition Center Station.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou departed Taipei Monday on a visit to two of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in Central America in an effort to cement mutual friendship
and expand cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>The June 29-July 6 journey is taking Ma to Panama and Nicaragua, with a transit
stop in San Francisco en route to Panama City and another layover in Hawaii on
his way home.</P>
      <P>This is Ma's second diplomatic tour of the region, one of Taiwan's diplomatic
strongholds, so far this year.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure, Ma said the visit is part of his "modous vivendi"
diplomatic strategy, which calls for a pragmatic and flexible approach to
simultaneously maintain solid diplomatic ties with allied countries while
forging substantive partnerships with non-allied nations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the strategy has paved the way for a diplomatic truce with China, Ma
said his administration can now more efficienctly use national resources to
consolidate relations with the country's 23 diplomatic  allies  in  addition  to
developing  substantative partnerships with countries that do not maintain
formal relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of President Ma's upcoming Central America tour is to attend
the inauguration of Panama's President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in Panama City
July 1.</P>
      <P>His itinerary originally included a two-day visit to Honduras, but Ma decided to
cancel his travel plans there after Honduran President Manuel Zeyala was
arrested and forced into exile by military leaders Sunday ahead of a
controversial constitutional referendum.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Monday that Ma will return to
Taiwan July 6, two days earlier than scheduled.</P>
      <P>Wang said the decision to exclude Honduras from Ma's itinerary was based on
safety and security considerations and because the unstable situation in
Honduras precludes the purpose of Ma's visit there.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Panama, Ma will hold talks with senior officials of the new
Panamanian government, visit the Panama Canal, give interviews to the
international news media and meet with Taiwanese community leaders.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching is accompanying Ma on the June 29-July 6 diplomatic
tour. Chow will visit a charity organization that is headed by the new
Panamanian first lady.</P>
      <P>Following his trip to Panama, Ma will travel to Nicaragua where Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega will drive him to the hub of a bilateral technological
cooperation project, which will allow Ma to interact with Nicaraguan citizens.</P>
      <P>Ma will also attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a large trade fair to be held
in Nicaragua July 1-5, at which many Taiwanese companies are expected to exhibit
their latest products.</P>
      <P>During the Nicaragua visit, first lady Chow will visit the local branch of World
Vision -- a Christian charity dedicated to helping disadvantaged people around
the world -- and a development center for physically challenged children.</P>
      <P>He is traveling at the head of a 129-member delegation of government officials,
legislators, industry executives, academics, university presidents,  local
government chiefs,  charity group executives and performing artists.</P>

      <P>The focus of Taiwan's homeland development will be adjusted after a number of
the country's regional governments were formally upgraded to municipalities
Monday, with more balanced growth the main objective.</P>
      <P>Jiang Yi-huah,  minister of the Research,  Development and Evaluation
Commission, said the government's local development plan will now concentrate on
the "three major living circles" and seven integrated areas.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou originally proposed to streamline Taiwan's 25 counties
and cities, including the two special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung,
into three metropolitan areas and 15 counties, with a metropolitan area located
in each of Taiwan's northern, central and southern regions to encourage more
balanced development.</P>
      <P>Those plans will be modified after the Cabinet on Monday approved the mergers of
Taichung City and County, Kaohsiung City and County and Tainan City and County,
and the upgrading of Taipei County's status.</P>
      <P>The government now intends to pursue balanced development in seven regions,
Jiang said, grouped as follows: the Taipei, Keelung and Yilan area; the Taoyuan,
Hsinchu and Miaoli area; the Taichung, Changhua and Nantou area; the Yunlin,
Chiayi and Tainan area; the Kaohsung and Pingtung area; the Hualien and Taitung
area; and the Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu area.</P>
      <P>In the future, Jiang said, efforts will be made to highlight different
advantages of the seven planned integrated areas, such as the highly competitive
agricultural sector in the Yunlin, Chiayi and Nantou area, or the high-tech
cluster and well-preserved Hakka culture in the Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli
area.</P>
      <P>With this commitment to more balanced regional growth, the Cabinet hopes the
long-existing inequity in the distribution of funds from the central to local
governments will be resolved.</P>
      <P>At present, the two special municipalities receive 43 percent of the allocation
for local governments, while the other 23 cities and counties share the rest.</P>
      <P>But Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Monday that his agency has drafted a
legal revision that, if passed, would allocate funds to all local governments
based on the more equitable measures of population and administrative scale.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The mastermind of a drug trafficking ring that allegedly used young women as
mules has been arrested, officials of the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his surname of Liu, was rounded up Sunday in the
northern port city of Keelung on charges of having smuggled at least 8 kilograms
of high-grade heroin into Taiwan over the past two weeks alone, the MJIB
officials said.</P>
      <P>Liu's capture followed the arrest of a 31-year-old woman June 25 at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport for allegedly attempting to smuggle 10 heroin
bricks weighing a total of 3.5 kilograms into Taiwan from Myanmar, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The drugs were worth an estimated NT$100 million (US$3.03 million) on the
street.</P>
      <P>Since direct flight services between Taiwan and the Myanmar capital of Yangon
were launched last year, MJIB agents said the four weekly Taipei-Yangon flights
have become a new drug trafficking route, known as the "airborne heroin
trafficking corridor."</P>
      <P>The route connects Taiwan directly with the notorious Golden Triangle narcotics
production hub.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation found that drug trafficking mules in Liu's ring had
been seized three times over the past six months.</P>
      <P>As a result, Liu changed his tactics by hiring pretty married young women with
young children to serve as mules to reduce the risk of inviting attention or
close inspection from customs agents at ports of entry.</P>
      <P>The newly arrested woman, identified by her family name Shen, told investigators
that Liu interviewed her and demanded that she travel with her 14-year-old
daughter to Myanmar to smuggle contraband drugs into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that heroin is a first grade statutory  contraband substance, MJIB
officials said those caught selling or trafficking heroin could be subject to
the death penalty or life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>They urged local residents to not be tempted by money into serving as mules of
criminal rings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The focus of Taiwan's homeland development will be adjusted after a number of
the country's regional governments were formally upgraded to municipalities
Monday, with more balanced growth the main objective.</P>
      <P>Jiang Yi-huah,  minister of the Research,  Development and Evaluation
Commission, said the government's local development plan will now concentrate on
the "three major living circles" and seven integrated areas.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou originally proposed to streamline Taiwan's 25 counties
and cities, including the two special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung,
into three metropolitan areas and 15 counties, with a metropolitan area located
in each of Taiwan's northern, central and southern regions to encourage more
balanced development.</P>
      <P>Those plans will be modified after the Cabinet on Monday approved the mergers of
Taichung City and County, Kaohsiung City and County and Tainan City and County,
and the upgrading of Taipei County's status.</P>
      <P>The government now intends to pursue balanced development in seven regions,
Jiang said, grouped as follows: the Taipei, Keelung and Yilan area; the Taoyuan,
Hsinchu and Miaoli area; the Taichung, Changhua and Nantou area; the Yunlin,
Chiayi and Tainan area; the Kaohsung and Pingtung area; the Hualien and Taitung
area; and the Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu area.</P>
      <P>In the future, Jiang said, efforts will be made to highlight different
advantages of the seven planned integrated areas, such as the highly competitive
agricultural sector in the Yunlin, Chiayi and Nantou area, or the high-tech
cluster and well-preserved Hakka culture in the Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli
area.</P>
      <P>With this commitment to more balanced regional growth, the Cabinet hopes the
long-existing inequity in the distribution of funds from the central to local
governments will be resolved.</P>
      <P>At present, the two special municipalities receive 43 percent of the allocation
for local governments, while the other 23 cities and counties share the rest.</P>
      <P>But Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Monday that his agency has drafted a
legal revision that, if passed, would allocate funds to all local governments
based on the more equitable measures of population and administrative scale.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The mastermind of a drug trafficking ring that allegedly used young women as
mules has been arrested, officials of the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his surname of Liu, was rounded up Sunday in the
northern port city of Keelung on charges of having smuggled at least 8 kilograms
of high-grade heroin into Taiwan over the past two weeks alone, the MJIB
officials said.</P>
      <P>Liu's capture followed the arrest of a 31-year-old woman June 25 at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport for allegedly attempting to smuggle 10 heroin
bricks weighing a total of 3.5 kilograms into Taiwan from Myanmar, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The drugs were worth an estimated NT$100 million (US$3.03 million) on the
street.</P>
      <P>Since direct flight services between Taiwan and the Myanmar capital of Yangon
were launched last year, MJIB agents said the four weekly Taipei-Yangon flights
have become a new drug trafficking route, known as the "airborne heroin
trafficking corridor."</P>
      <P>The route connects Taiwan directly with the notorious Golden Triangle narcotics
production hub.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation found that drug trafficking mules in Liu's ring had
been seized three times over the past six months.</P>
      <P>As a result, Liu changed his tactics by hiring pretty married young women with
young children to serve as mules to reduce the risk of inviting attention or
close inspection from customs agents at ports of entry.</P>
      <P>The newly arrested woman, identified by her family name Shen, told investigators
that Liu interviewed her and demanded that she travel with her 14-year-old
daughter to Myanmar to smuggle contraband drugs into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that heroin is a first grade statutory  contraband substance, MJIB
officials said those caught selling or trafficking heroin could be subject to
the death penalty or life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>They urged local residents to not be tempted by money into serving as mules of
criminal rings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China to send fishery delegation to Taiwan for talks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's top fishery administrator will lead a delegation to Taiwan in August for
talks on ways to cooperate in the fishing industry, according to a Council of
Agriculture (COA) official.</P>
      <P>Sha Chih-yi, director of the COA's Fisheries Administration, revealed China's
plan during a fact-finding visit to Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen Monday.</P>
      <P>As Kinmen lies closer to China's Fujian province than to Taiwan proper, there
have been frequent reports of Chinese fishing boats intruding into Kinmen waters
for poaching.</P>
      <P>Sha said he is concerned about Kinmen's fishery environment as Chinese poachers
often use illegal fishing methods, such as electrofishing and dynamite fishing,
to stun or kill schools of fish for easy collection. Such illegal practices can
be extremely destructive to the surrounding ecosystem, as electric currents or
explosions often destroy the underlying habitats, such as coral reefs, that
support the fish.</P>
      <P>Due to these problems, Sha said fishery issues also will be put on the agenda
for the fourth round of high-level cross-Taiwan Strait talks slated for later
this year.</P>
      <P>"When Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, meet later this year, they will address
bilateral fishing issues," Sha said.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the Chiang-Chen talks, Sha said, China's Fishery Bureau under
its Ministry of Agriculture will organize a delegation to visit Taiwan in August
to exchange views on how to settle fishing disputes, cooperate on fishing
resources conservation, and other related topics.</P>
      <P>As fishery resources in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea belong to people
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Sha said, the two sides should step up
cooperation to better protect the abundant marine resources in waters that
separate Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>During his Kinmen visit, Sha also met with Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng and
promised to assist the county government in fishing port dredging and clean up,
as well as farming community renovation.</P>

      <P>Three to five typhoons will hit Taiwan this year, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) forecasted Tuesday, while reminding people to always be prepared during
the typhoon season from July to September.</P>
      <P>The bureau also predicted that 24 to 27 tropical storms and typhoons may form
over the northwestern Pacific Ocean this year. That is slightly less than the
historical average.</P>
      <P>According to a CWB report, over the past five years, an average of 24.2 tropical
storms and typhoons have formed over the western North Pacific each year, less
than the historical average of 26.6 a year.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan got hit by 4.4 of the storms each year during the five-year
period, more than the historical average of 3.1, the report said.</P>
      <P>CWB statistics showed that the average annual loss caused by typhoons reached
over NT$ 17 billion (US$518.6 million) in Taiwan, accounting for up to 85
percent of all damage from severe weather.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Honduras trip cancellation will not affect ties: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed his confidence Monday that the cancellation of
his planned state visit to Honduras following a military coup in the country
will not affect bilateral diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Ma said aboard a chartered flight that would take him to Panama and Nicaragua
that he believes Taiwan's diplomatic ties with Honduras will remain unchanged
because all of the Central American country's political party factions hold the
same views toward maintaining formal relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that he will visit Honduras at an opportune time in the future,
noting that it would be a good time to visit the country when the new Honduran
president is sworn into office in January 2010.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the cancellation of the Honduras leg of the trip in the wake of the
overthrown of Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya by the Honduran military
Sunday was based on considerations that Honduras  will not be able to host
foreign guests under the circumstances and on hopes that Taiwan's embassy in
Honduras can dedicate all of their efforts to taking care of Taiwanese
expatriates in the country.</P>
      <P>President Ma also praised Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and national
security authorities for staying on top of the latest developments in Honduras
and quickly coming up with contingency plans.</P>
      <P>Since taking office a year ago, Ma has visited seven countries that have
diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Remarking on the visits, Ma said that the solid
foundation of Taiwan's diplomatic friendships with its allies is not laid on
"checkbook diplomacy, " but on the concept and practice of flexible diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Under previous administrations, Taiwan and China had competed for diplomatic
recognition, often by paying large amounts of money to the countries it was
trying to woo, with some of the money going to those countries' politicians
instead of towards developing the countries.</P>
      <P>Ma has vowed to end the practice, insisting instead on truly helping Taiwan's
allied countries develop.</P>
      <P>Quoting the MOFA's most recent white paper on Taiwan's foreign aid policy, Ma
said Taiwan should establish long term cooperative relations with its diplomatic
allies based on the principles of equality, reciprocity, and mutual respect.</P>
      <P>Ma also noted that "overseas assistance must have legitimate objectives, grant
procedures must be in accordance with the law, and implementation must be
effective and efficient."</P>
      <P>The president later arrived in San Francisco for a transit stop en route to
Panama City and was greeted at the airport by American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
honorary Chairman William Brown and Taiwan's Representative to the United
States, Jason Yuan.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival at a hotel in San Francisco where he will stay, President Ma
received a warm welcome from a number of Taiwanese expatriates in the area, but
was also greeted with protest by many others.</P>
      <P>Ma and his entourage will leave Tuesday for Panama for a three-day visit mainly
to attend the inauguration of Panama's President-elect Ricardo Martinelli in
Panama City Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Following his trip to Panama, Ma will travel to Nicaragua where Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega will take him to the hub of a bilateral technological
cooperation project, which will allow Ma to interact with Nicaraguan citizens.</P>
      <P>He will then stop in Hawaii July 5 on his way home and return to Taiwan on July
6.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors on Tuesday decided to continue barring Chen Hsing-yu, the daughter
of former President  Chen Shui-bian, from leaving the country, because they said
she gave false testimony.</P>
      <P>The ruling by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office was made after prosecutors
reviewed all related documents and decided Chen Hsing-yu should be required to
stay in Taiwan in order to ensure the smooth continuum of the investigation of
alleged corruption by her parents as well as her own trial on perjury charges.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office decided
in mid-May to list the former presidents daughter, son-in-law Chao Chien-ming
and son Chen Chih-chung as defendants, after discovering that the three gave
different accounts during questioning  into alleged  false reimbursement  claims
by the ex-president.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu was prohibited from leaving the country after being questioned by
prosecutors on June 22 in connection with alleged perjury, which has hampered
her plan to study in the United States.</P>
      <P>She had filed a petition of appeal to the prosecutors' office, calling  for
removal  of the travel restriction  by promising prosecutors that she would hand
over her passport to Taiwans representative office in the U.S. upon arrival and
would report to the representative office everyday, as well as return to Taiwan
periodically.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu also stated that she was willing to leave her three children in
Taiwan to show that she has no intent of absconding from the country.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on her petition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
earlier Tuesday that its representative offices have no rights or the obligation
to guard any citizens passport or travel documents, nor does it have the rights
to require anyone to report to the office.</P>
      <P>I find this (her request) totally unbelievable, said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen.</P>

      <P>The local chapter of World Vision said Tuesday that it will launch a campaign in
cooperation with Inventec Appliances Corp. to raise funds through the company's
mobile phone sales to finance the education of children whose families are
facing financial woes.</P>
      <P>Helping children go to school is always one of our main priorities,said Hank Du,
executive director of World Vision Taiwan, in a statement released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the midst of this economic crisis, Inventec's support is coming just at the
right time. It's something the children who are being helped will never
forget,he added.</P>
      <P>According to World Vision Taiwan, Inventec will donate NT$50 (US$1.5) to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:</P>
      <P>China Times: On ex-President Lee's wish to visit China</P>
      <P>During a recent meeting with former President Lee Teng-hui, former Taiwan
Governor James Soong offered to help Lee realize a wish that Lee mentioned two
years ago: visiting China to retrace a "touring the kingdoms" journey made by
Confucius 5,000 years ago. If this wish of Lee were realized, it would be a
major event not only in Lee's life, but also in the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee, who did not conceal his disapproval of China in the last years of his
presidency  and has openly leaned toward Taiwan independence after stepping down
in 2000, has now begun to fine-tune his attitude toward China. Lee proposed
recently that the relations between Taiwan and China should be "you are you, and
I am me. But you and me are friends."</P>
      <P>As friends, the two sides have no reason to obstinately refuse contact with each
other. Since Beijing has opened its arms to Taiwan and is ready to listen to the
different voices of Taiwan's various sectors, why doesn't Lee boldly consider
the possibility of visiting China and speak his mind candidly with this friend?</P>
      <P>United Daily News: On ex-President Lee's new approach to China</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui recently said he does "not oppose the deepening of
exchanges between Taiwan and China" and described the relations between the two
sides as "you are you, and I am me. But you and me are friends." His new
approach toward China is tantamount to completely deconstructing his previous
concepts on dealing with China.</P>
      <P>This concept that the "two sides of the Taiwan Strait are friends, " however,
does not provide a solution to his previous proposition in which he defined
cross-strait ties as "special state-to-state relations." Lee has not clearly
explained how Taiwan should define its national status in the context of cross-
strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee's critical examination has in fact reflected the dilemma faced by supporters
of Taiwan independence. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has proposed
a debate with the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou on the signing of an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, but dares not face a
debate on China policy within the party. Isn't this pathetic? Isn't this
ridiculous?</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: On President Ma's Central America visit</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's departure Monday for a tour to Panama and Nicaragua
marked his second Central America visit in just one month. The high frequency
raises the question of why Ma, who is boastful of the "satisfactory" results of
his "diplomatic truce" policy, is now squandering taxpayers' money on such
diplomatic trips?</P>
      <P>Only hours before his departure, Ma made a last-minute decision to cancel his
visit to Honduras, in the wake of the ouster of Honduran President Manuel Zeyala
in a military coup. The incident shows that one year after the implementation of
the "diplomatic truce" policy, its negative effects are surfacing. The country's
overseas missions have been completely paralyzed and lost their information-
gathering function.</P>
      <P>In the face of Panama's possible move to switch diplomatic recognition to
Beijing under the incoming administration of Ricardo Martinelli, Ma probably can
do nothing but beg Chinese President Hu Jintao to be merciful. To put Taiwan's
survival in the hands of the "mercy" of its rival is like committing a slow
suicide.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: On ex-President Chen's plea for his daughter's freedom</P>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian reportedly has written to his successor  Ma
Ying-jeou  to ask him to help lift the travel restrictions imposed by
prosecutors on his daughter, Chen Hsing-yu, who is under investigation for
alleged perjury in connection with her father's corruption case.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that Chen Shui-bian, who was president for eight years, does not
know that the president cannot interfere with the judiciary. But he likely wrote
the letter based on his own experience and perception.</P>
      <P>Ma has said he will not interfere with the judiciary. We hope he does not say
one thing and mean another. Chen Hsing-yu's case should be dealt with by the
judiciary based on human rights principles.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A screening process specially designed to ensure quality service to Chinese
tourists will be implemented with effect from Wednesday, the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Mei-shiou, a section chief at the bureau, said that from July 1, local tour
agencies that service Chinese tour groups will be required to submit online all
arrangements related to hotels, tour guides, restaurants and tour buses for
screening by the bureau.</P>
      <P>As long as the local agencies are given the green light by the bureau one day
before the scheduled arrival of their Chinese clients, those agencies can apply
to the National Immigration Agency for entry permits on behalf of the visitors,
Chen explained.</P>
      <P>If the bureau finds fault with the arrangements submitted online, the local tour
agencies will not be able to obtain entry permits for their Chinese clients, she
added.</P>
      <P>This mechanism was put in place to help guarantee the quality of service
provided by Taiwanese travel operators to Chinese tourists, as the number of
arrivals from China is expected to continue to rise, Chen said.</P>
      <P>To avoid a price war, Taiwan authorities have stipulated that local travel
agencies keep their prices at a minimum of US$60 per person per day for Chinese
tour groups.</P>

      <P>However, the Foreign Ministry will review its entire handling of the matter, he
added. Meanwhile, when asked whether the Foreign Ministry will issue a statement
on the political situation in Honduras, especially as the the United States and
the European Union have publicly condemned the military takeover, Chen said the
MOFA is usually extremely cautious in its handling of such matters, given
Taiwan's special international situation. The Foreign Ministry is in close
contact with all the leaders in Honduras, including the interim leader Roberto
Micheletti, and will respect the election results of the Honduran democratic
process, he added.</P>
      <P>As to whether Ma will meet with Zelaya, who is currently in Nicaragua, Chen said
this is not on Ma's official itinerary for his July 3-4 visit to that country,
but adjustments could be made depending on the situation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The amount of precipitation during this year's Mei-yu, or plum rain season in
Taiwan was the fifth lowest in the past 58 years, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The plum rains and typhoons make a major contribution to Taiwan's water supply.
With the minimal rainfall from this year's plum rains, the CWB hopes the
upcoming typhoon season will bring large quantities of rainwater to Taiwan and
compensate for the shortfall.</P>
      <P>Total precipitation in May and June, the two plum rain season months, was 279.6
millimeters nationwide, the fifth lowest amount recorded since 1951.</P>
      <P>The plum rain season is so named because it coincides with the ripening of the
fruit. Formed when moist air over the Pacific meets cooler continental air
masses, the plum rains often last in East Asian countries until mid-summer.</P>
      <P>The CWB predicts a total of 24 to 27 typhoons and tropical storms will form over
the western Pacific in 2009, which would be near or below the annual average of
26.6.</P>
      <P>Three to five of these may hit Taiwan, similar to the number of storms Taiwan
has faced in the past five years, the bureau predicted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Carriers to step up service as demand on Taiwan-Kinmen route rises</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three air carriers are planning to increase their number of flights or use
larger planes between Taiwan proper and the outlying Kinmen Island in
anticipation of higher demand this summer.</P>
      <P>UNI Air, TransAsia Airways and Mandarin Airlines -- the three aviation companies
that operate flights to Kinmen -- all are planning to expand their service on
the route, in response to greater interest among people from Taiwan proper to
travel to China from Kinmen via the mini three links.</P>
      <P>UNI Air intends to use larger planes for its Tainan-Kinmen flights from July,
while the other airlines will flexibly increase the number of their summer
flights to the island, depending on demand.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the majority of tour agencies in Taiwan have been hit hard
by the global financial crisis, cross-Taiwan Strait travel via the mini links --
direct ferry service between the Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and
several ports in China's Fujian Province -- has been brisk.</P>
      <P>In response to Taiwan's keen efforts to lure Chinese tourists, China's Jiangsu,
Shandong and Fujian provinces have been promoting tours to Taiwan in the hope
that at least 10,000 tourists from each of the three provinces would visit
Taiwan. Many of the Chinese tourists from these coastal provinces prefer to
travel to Taiwan via the mini links because of lower costs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to date, more than 10,000 people in Taiwan have booked special China
tours -- launched on April 1 by UNI Air in conjunction with 24 tour agencies --
that feature the use of the "mini links" to travel to Fujian.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Tuesday, Huang Wei-lin, a senior high school teacher from Taichung,
was awarded NT$10,000 (US$300) in cash and a free trip worth NT$16,800 to
Fujian, after she was pronounced as UNI Air's 10,000th passenger on the route.
Huang was at Taipei's Songshan Airport checking in for a flight to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ming-hung, general manager of the Taipei-based Life Tour, predicted that
more than 30,000 Taiwanese tourists will buy tours to "travel to Fujian via the
mini links" this year.</P>
      <P>In the period January-May this year, flights to Kinmen that originated from
points on Taiwan proper, such as Taipei, Taichung, Chiayi and Tainan, had an
average passenger load factor of about 70 percent, according to statistics
compiled by the Civil Aeronautics Administration  under  the  Ministry  of
Transportation  and Communications.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will set up a preparatory panel in July to draft legislation
on a long-term health care insurance system that it hopes to submit to the
Legislature by the end of this year, a Cabinet official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and the Ministry of the Interior were commissioned by
the Cabinet Monday to form the panel, which will eventually become the
preparatory arm of the new program, according to DOH Deputy Minister Cheng Shou-
hsia.</P>
      <P>The panel will consider a number of issues, including whether to provide long-
term health care insurance coverage to all citizens or only to those over 40
years of age.</P>
      <P>Among the services potentially covered under the plan would be in-home nursing
and institutional care.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the panel will also have to decide if a separate long-term health
care insurance bureau should be created to handle related operations or if the
Bureau of National Health Insurance, which runs Taiwan's public health insurance
system,  will be authorized to administer the program.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Tsai Hsung-hsiung, who has been the head of a task
force promoting a long-term care system, and Minister without Portfolio Hsueh
Cherng-tay will serve as the convener and associate convener of the 19-member
preparatory panel.</P>
      <P>It will consist of deputy chiefs of the DOH, the MOI, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development and the Council of Labor Affairs, academics and
experts, and representatives of long-term care and social welfare organizations,
Cheng noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to drafting legislation, the panel will also be asked to provide
advice on long-term health care policies, coordinate major issues related to
long-term health care planning and supervise the promotion of other plans for
long-term health care insurance, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Various central government agencies will hold 29 forums, while the country's 25
cities and counties will each hold a seminar to solicit opinions on the issue
from related groups, the general public and government agencies at all levels,
Cheng added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has officially  closed its representative office in Dhaka, Bangladesh in
an effort to put the country's diplomatic resources to better use.</P>
      <P>Since  the  establishment  of  the  Foreign  Ministry's representative  office
in Bangladesh 2004,  it has faced many restrictions and has not been able to
receive better treatment (from Bangladesh's government) , the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a statement released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA therefore shut down its representative office in Bangladesh June 30 in
order to make better use of national resources under the government's flexible
diplomacy,it added.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA, its representative office in New Delhi, India will take
over related services after the closure of the office in Bangladesh, which
leaves Taiwan with 120 offices around the world.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said June 6 that in an effort to put the
country's diplomatic resources to better use, the government would close down
five underutilized overseas offices in the coming months, including its
representative offices in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Bangladesh, its consulate-
general in Colon, Panama, and its liaison office in Johannesburg, South Africa.</P>
      <P>Ou cited a perception of unfriendliness of some of the countries toward Taiwan
and the existence of offices within close proximity of each other as reasons for
the closures.</P>
      <P>Bangladesh's government, for instance, was unwilling to have any contact with
Taiwanese officials and refused to allow the MOFA's representative office to
offer visa services, according to Ou.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Johannesburg office, it is only about a 10-minute drive from
Taiwan's main South African mission located in Pretoria,  and a similar

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chang Sho-wen from Yunlin County will lose
his seat in the Legislative Yuan after a local court invalidated his legislative
election victory in 2008.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Branch of the Taiwan High Court upheld a lower court's decision that
Chang's victory was not fair and valid. Chang had claimed that he was unaware of
his father's scheme to buy votes for him in the election, but the High Court
found that the lawmaker's argument was not believable.</P>
      <P>The ruling is final, and a by-election has to be held in the Yunlin County
district within three months according to the law.</P>
      <P>The court's decision will not affect the ruling KMT's grip of the Legislature
because of the absolute majority it enjoys.</P>
      <P>Chang won a regional legislative seat in Yunlin County's second district in
January 2008, but his defeated opponent, Liu Chien-kuo of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , accused Chang of vote-buying and filed a
lawsuit seeking to invalidate his election.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin District Court granted Liu's request Nov. 28, 2008 on the ground that
Chang Sho-wen was believed to be aware of and have taken part in a well-planned
and well-organized vote-buying scheme masterminded  by his father Chang Hui-
yuan,  president  of an influential local irrigation association.</P>
      <P>Chang Hui-yuan had already been sentenced to five years and eight months in jail
in a separate case for colluding with the irrigation association's staff members
and grassroots borough chiefs in the county to canvas support for his son by
offering cash to voters.</P>
      <P>The senior Chang denied the charges and has appealed his sentence.</P>
      <P>Liu Chien-kuo who initiated the suit against Chang Shou-wen said Tuesday that he
will definitely compete in the by-election.</P>
      <P>Chang Sho-wen is the second incumbent lawmaker who had his election annulled by
the court for vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Lee Yi-ting, also a KMT lawmaker, from Miaoli County was stripped of his seat in
the Legislature after his appeal against a lower court's decision to invalidate
his election was rejected on Dec. 10, 2008.</P>

      <P>According to Wang, 85 percent of the abusers were parents and the leading factor
behind their behavior was that they lacked an understanding of parent-child
relationships.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of the parents surveyed acknowledged that they do not know
how to deal with their children, he explained.</P>
      <P>In 2008, 78,974 domestic violence cases were reported by police, schools,
hospitals and social workers, of which 17,086 were related to child abuse, MOI

      <P>The majority of people in Taiwan view China as nothing more than a business
partner, while most people in China see Taiwan as "kin, " according to the
results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted jointly by agencies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
found that 53.6 percent of the respondents in Taiwan see Chinese as "business
partners, " while 13.1 percent said they are "friends."</P>
      <P>In China, 52.3 percent of the respondents said they see relations across the
strait as existing between "family members, " while 16.2 percent said Taiwan is
a "business partner."</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted in May by Taiwan's Global View monthly magazine and 104
Job Bank and a Chinese market research firm Oracle Added Value, also asked the
respondents whether they thought the two sides would eventually unify, Taiwan
would attain independence, or the status quo would be maintained.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, 60 percent of the respondents said they foresee no change in the
status quo, 16.1 percent said Taiwan and China will move toward unification, and
8.9 percent said Taiwan will gain independence.</P>
      <P>Responding to the same question, 64.2 percent in China said they believe the two
sides will become one nation, 26.7 percent said the status quo will be
maintained and 5.1 percent said Taiwan will become independent.</P>
      <P>Asked to pinpoint the major advantages their country has over the other side,
38.75 percent of the respondents in Taiwan said "living standards," while 15.2
percent pointed to an "open society."</P>
      <P>For the Chinese respondents,  their country's international standing was seen by
39.8 percent as its chief advantage over Taiwan, while 19.5 percent identified
"respect for tradition."</P>
      <P>Asked what they would most like to do in China, 56.8 percent of the Taiwanese
respondents said sightseeing, 18 percent said work, and 15 percent said invest
in the real estate sector. For 36.1 percent, there was nothing they wanted to
do, as they said they had no wish to visit China.</P>
      <P>Some 70.5 percent of the Chinese respondents said what they would most like to
do in Taiwan is go sightseeing, 25 percent said they want to live in Taiwan,
while 23.3 percent said they have no desire to travel to the island.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by telephone in Taiwan May 11-13 using a random sample
of 1,004 people 18 years and over. In China, a random sample of 3,192 people in
eight Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, were interviewed between
May 20 and June 3.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two lawmakers punished for defamation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two lawmakers were punished Tuesday for defamation in separate Taiwan High Court
cases.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin Su-mei, an aboriginal legislator affiliated with the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union, was sentenced to 55 days in jail for calling a local
advertiser "a beast in human clothing" in an article published on her blog.</P>
      <P>The court said in its judgment that Kao Chin should be punished because her blog
is linked to many other blogs and her article has done more harm to the victim
than if she had issued the insult verbally.</P>
      <P>The court, however, allowed her the option of paying a fine in lieu of jail
time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao Jyh-peng, a lawmaker of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, was fined NT$6,000 for calling fellow legislator Chou Yi of the ruling
Kuomintang "a mad dog" at a news conference.</P>
      <P>There is no recourse to appeal in either case.</P>
