      <P>Following President Chen Shui-bian's
decision to "delegate power, " all major government decisions will be
jointly made by the Executive Yuan, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the party's legislative caucus, caucus convener Ko
Chien-ming said late Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new "triangular decision-making" mechanism shows that the DPP
will be even more united and unselfish when party members share their
historic responsibility at this critical juncture in time, Ko said.</P>
      <P>He called for a truce among the DPP's factions, urging them to
stop their "senseless infighting" because, he claimed, only by
joining forces to cope with the adversaries can they weather the
party's current difficulties.</P>
      <P>Ko was among the participants in a Presidential Office meeting
during which the president, dogged by a spate of corruption scandals
involving his senior aides and family members, announced his decision
to delegate power.</P>
      <P>Other participants in the meeting included Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and National
Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen, all of whom,
according to Ko, "understood the president's determination and

    <HEADLINE>TIME NOT RIGHT TO 'PULL TRIGGER': KMT HEAD ON RECALLING PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Thursday that "it is time to load the gun but not yet
time to pull the trigger" because there is only one chance to recall
a scandal-ridden president.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in reply to media questions as to why he is
opposed to pushing for a recall of the president who has been dogged
by a series of corruption scandals involving his senior aides and
family members.</P>
      <P>He cited KMT polls as showing that only 27 percent of the people
support the idea of recalling the president, while 58 percent are
opposed to it. "This is the public voice," he stressed.</P>
      <P>However, Ma noted that he is not opposed to pushing for a recall
in the future under certain circumstances. For instance, he said, if
the corruption scandals "develop and burn upward" to involve the
presidential couple, "I believe that more people, including
Democratic Progressive Party supporters, will stand up in support of
recalling the president."</P>
      <P>Ma said he has not discussed the issue with KMT Honorary Chairman
Lien Chan, who reportedly criticized Ma for being too reticent over

    <HEADLINE>KMT ACCUSES PRESIDENT OF VIOLATING CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's recent promise to
loosen his grip on power is tantamount to admitting that he violated
the Constitution and abused his power in the past, opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>They were referring to Wednesday's announcement by Chen that he
will no longer exercise any power beyond what is expressly defined by
the Constitution as the role of the president, a move which came in
the wake of a series of scandals implicating officials close to him
as well as his son-in-law.</P>
      <P>Chen promised that he will neither interfere with the
policy-making of the Executive Yuan nor meddle in DPP operations and
will refrain from involvement in any political campaigns. Also, he
pledged that the first family will conduct themselves according to
the highest ethical standards to live up to the public's
expectations.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, it is a matter of course
that the president should not enjoy any power that is not granted by
the Constitution.</P>
      <P>To show that he is truly repentant, the president should clarify
to the public whether his wife, Wu Shu-jen, has had any role in the
scandals, Ma said, pointing out that there have been a number of
reports alleging that the first family has interfered in the
personnel appointments of financial holding companies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said the president's
announcement indicates that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lacks any constitutional knowledge and any ability to conduct
self-examination.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the president, plagued by the scandals surrounding the
first family, should resign immediately because he is obviously
incapable of exercising his constitutional functions.</P>
      <P>On a proposal put forth by some KMT legislators to recall Chen,
Cheng said the KMT is not opposed to such a proposal but thinks that
the action should be taken at the right time when there is a high
degree of public consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with the opposition party, senior DPP legislators,
including Chen Chin-jun and William Lai, said they believe the
president's decision was made after comprehensive deliberation and
that the DPP must unite to back him up.</P>
      <P>They urged the public to give the president their encouragement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Ho Min-hao, who
also heads the party's policy committee, said Chen's announcement is
commendable but that the timing is wrong.</P>
      <P>Ho expressed his concern that the announcement will be taken
advantage of by the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" to promote its
campaign to recall the president.</P>
      <P>Ho suggested that the president address the deficiencies of the
Constitution by constitutional amendments or the drafting of a new
constitution for the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GREEN ISLAND TO HAVE 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY BY 2035</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(by Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Atomic Energy Council (AEC) is planning 
to renovate power-generating systems on Green Island by using 
renewable energy sources rather than non-renewable fuels, in hopes 
of making the outlying island truly "green" by the year 2035, an AEC
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official said that currently, there are only coal-power 
units on Green Islands, which are not only costly but also 
environmentally unfriendly.</P>
      <P>He noted the AEC will carry out the plan in two stages. Up until 
the year 2015, the power supply will be using 60 percent renewable 
energy at an estimated cost of NT$4 billion (US$1.25 million), while
by the year 2035, Green Island will enjoy a 100 percent "green" power
supply at an additional cost of NT$10 billion.</P>
      <P>According to the AEC, in the first stage, the power supply will 
rely on wind and solar energies, and in the second, power systems 
using geothermal and ocean thermal energies will be established.</P>
      <P>He explained that although Green Island's geographical
conditions are highly suitable for the generation of geothermal and
ocean thermal power, the technology for using these energies is still
primitive.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, the AEC decided to delay establishing 
facilities that require these energies, and to wait for the 
necessary technologies to mature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TRAMPLING ON CONSTITUTION BY DELEGATING POWER TO DPP: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Claiming that President Chen Shui-bian's
decision to delegate power to Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
heavyweights amounts to "trampling on the Constitution, " opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday he totally
disagrees with Chen's power-sharing plan.</P>
      <P>The president declared during a senior officials meeting
Wednesday that he will no longer exercise any power beyond what is
expressly defined by the Constitution as the role of the president.</P>
      <P>In order to improve the image of his office, the president
promised to reorganize the power structure of his administration.</P>
      <P>In reply to media inquiries, Ma said the president has not
clarified everything about the first family's suspected roles in some
of the scandals.</P>
      <P>"It is absurd to delegate the power of presidency, " Ma said,
since a president will be charged with dereliction of duty if he
gives up his constitutional power which simply cannot be delegated.</P>
      <P>As for the power that a president has not been given
constitutionally, there is nothing for him to give up or to delegate,
Ma said, citing the example of the first family's alleged
interference in the merger of financial holding companies.</P>
      <P>The only thing for the president to do now is to tell the truth
about the whole story of every scandal in which his family members
are suspected of involvement, Ma said, adding "this is the only way
for him to possibly win back any remaining respect of the people."</P>
      <P>Otherwise, he warned, the situation will continue to worsen for
the president and his family.</P>
      <P>He urged the president to "make the best choice for himself" at a
time when his credibility has been severely damaged.</P>
      <P>Ma asked, for example, "if Chen visits a foreign country now,
will he have the respect of the foreign head of state? And if he
receives an ambassador from a foreign country, can he win the
ambassador's respect?</P>
      <P>"And if he presents medals for outstanding achievement or
contribution, will the winners accept the medals as an honor? " Ma
further asked.</P>
      <P>"Even if Chen cites a great hero or heroine who has passed on,
will the bereaved family accept the citation?" Ma continued.</P>
      <P>"These are all presidential duties, which Chen can hardly execute
with dignity, " Ma said, calling for the president to "know what is
the best choice to make."</P>

President Chen Shui-bian was adopting "the blue oceans strategy" when

      <P>As for her future position, Lu noted that her duty will be to

    <HEADLINE>MAGISTRATE URGES BETTER COORDINATION AFTER PRESIDENT DELEGATES POWERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A better coordination mechanism must be
fleshed out between the government and the ruling party now that
President Chen Shui-bian has decided to delegate power in government
and party affairs, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su made the appeal afte Chen announced his decision a day earlier
to delegate governing powers and party authority in the wake of a
slew of scandals implicating his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power six
years ago, Su said government operations have been dogged by poor
coordination among the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and
the party central.</P>
      <P>"If this deficiency cannot be corrected, the president's
delegation of power will not resolve the problems faced by the DPP
administration," said Su, a DPP legislator-turned-magistrate.</P>
      <P>In the past, Su claimed, the Presidential Office often played a
key role in government personnel appointments which consequently
hobbled the Executive Yuan's policy implementation with some Cabinet
ministers subject to the Presidential Office's direct control. As a
result, he lamented that the local governments often had difficulties
conveying their opinions to policy-making authorities.</P>
      <P>Poor coordination and insufficient policy integration have also
hindered the formation of national consensus on major policy issues,
Su said.</P>
      <P>For instance, the DPP headquarters has so far failed to
extensively discuss the much-talked-about issue regarding direct
transport links across the Taiwan Strait, Su said, adding that the
issue is too crucial to be decided by only a handful of party
bigwigs.</P>
      <P>Su suggested that President Chen be more magnanimous and focus on
policy coordination and integration instead of personnel
arrangements. It is also hoped that the president can keep the door
open to opinions from all sectors of society and even constructive
criticism and never again restrict his source of information to a few
personal aides, he added.</P>
      <P>To the best of his knowledge, Su said, President Chen faces
pressure to quit the party. In his view, Su said it would not be a
wise strategy to force Chen to leave the party at this moment for
what some critics say saving the DPP's image. He stressed that the
best way to weather the political crisis faced by the DPP is for the
president and the premier to do more on policy coordination and
integration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AEC WORKING TO BOOST RATIO OF TAIWAN'S 'SELF-PRODUCED' ENERGY SOURCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(by Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan relies on imports to meet 98 
percent of its energy needs, the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) is 
working on a "blueprint on future power supply" with the aim of 
boosting the ratio of Taiwan's "self-produced" energy supplies from 
the current 2 percent to 30 percent by 2050, an AEC official said 
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to an AEC report, currently, coal plants comprise 43.
15 percent of Taiwan's power supply, nuclear plants 20.9 percent, 
natural gas ones 19.14 percent, oil ones 6 percent, cogeneration 
plants 7.17 percent, while renewable energies comprise 3.61 percent. </P>
      <P>According to the official, only 2 percent of Taiwan's energy 
sources are deemed as "self-produced" -- relying on local sources 
only, and 20 percent are "self-manageable" -- indicating sources 
that are either under long-term supply contracts or under mining 
cooperation agreements between Taiwan and the export countries.</P>
      <P>The official added that aside from increasing the percentage of 
self-produced energy sources, the government is also planning to 
expand the share of self-manageable ones to 70 percent by 2050 to 
establish a more secure power supply system.</P>
      <P>AEC research laboratories have been working on renewable energy 
technologies in areas such as wind power, solar power, geothermal 
utilization and ocean thermal conversion to achieve the 30 percent 
goal, the official said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will
file lawsuits against rumor mongers who spread rumors defaming
military authorities, MND spokesman Wu Chi-fang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after news reports saying that former
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Che-nan, who is
currently being detained in a bribery and corruption investigation,
had used his influence to secure the promotion of several
high-ranking military officers in exchange for a handsome sum of
money.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that the promotion of all military personnel has to
pass a transparent, rigid and fair process and that there is no
possibility of "buying posts" as some news reports claimed.</P>
      <P>"Even Defense Minister Lee Jye cannot use his influence in the
promotion of military personnel," Wu added.</P>
      <P>Lee said recently that there was absolutely no pressure and
influence peddling involved in the promotion of high-level military
personnel.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, since the publication of such news reports, the
MND has asked judicial authorities to help investigate the issue and
has held a press conference to explain the regulations governing
personnel promotion in the three branches of the armed forces.</P>
      <P>"The rumors have damaged the reputation of related people and the
military," Wu said.</P>
      <P>As the competition in obtaining high-level military posts is very
fierce, Wu said, he can completely understand the depression
experienced by those who don't secure promotions.</P>
      <P>However, the MND will lodge a strong protest against the persons
who publish such unfounded rumors that slander generals and damage
the military's image, and will consider filing lawsuit against them,
Wu stressed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice, also
known as the Pan-violet Alliance, called Thursday for public backing
of a national tax rebate campaign against government corruption,
saying that the wastefulness has cost taxpayers dearly nationwide.</P>
      <P>Pan-violet Alliance convener Chien Hsi-chieh issued the call at a
Legislative Yuan news conference. Some lawmakers from different
parties, including main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee
Chuan-chiao and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmaker Lai Hsin-yuan
were also present to lend their support.</P>
      <P>Chien demanded the government rebate NT$14,246 in taxes to each
household due to what he claimed a misuse of budgets and several
high-profile corruption scandals that have drained national coffers
at least NT$70.8 billion (US$2.2 billion).</P>
      <P>Taxpayers are entitled to a clean government and want to wipe out
corruption by checking the facts, Chien said, urging the public to
back the tax rebate campaign. Members of the "pan-violet alliance"
will submit a petition to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) next Monday
to state the cause of the initiative.</P>
      <P>Lee accused the government of fostering special interest groups
while turning a blind eye to many people living in poverty or even
committing suicide.</P>
      <P>Lai insisted the government must not waste the people's
hard-earned money, saying members of the public must be fully aware
of their rights and ask for a clean government.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the MOF has received a record number of
over 2.06 million income tax returns filed over the Internet as of
June 1 -- the deadline for income tax filing.</P>
      <P>The number has beat the ministry's target of 2 million cases,
with the national tax administration in northern Taiwan receiving the
largest number of electronic applications, MOF officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY CONFAB HINGES ON DIRECT LINKS BILL: SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday that the passage of a bill allowing direct cross-Taiwan
Strait transport links would be a decisive factor in the success of
a planned conference on Taiwan's sustainable economic growth.</P>
      <P>Quoting remarks made Wednesday by Tseng Yung-chuan, director of
the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) Central Policy Committee, Wang
said if the draft amendments allowing direct transport links between
Taiwan and China continue to be boycotted in the Legislature, the KMT
would have no reason to take part in the economic sustainability
conference being organized by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from the "pan-green camp" of the ruling DPP and Taiwan
Solidarity Union have continued to filibuster legislative sessions
over the past two weeks to block the KMT-led opposition -- which
controls a slight majority in the Legislature -- from putting the
direct links bill to a vote.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is pessimistic about the fate of the planned
conference on Taiwan's sustainable economic growth since lawmakers
from the two rival sides have failed to make any headway on
negotiations on the direct links bill over the past two weeks, with
both sides refusing to compromise and remaining deeply divided on
the issue.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party, which initiated the draft
legislation, had insisted that the bill had to be passed before the
end of the legislative session.</P>
      <P>The legislative session concluded Wednesday without a vote.
Opposition lawmakers have made "handling the direct links bill" a
condition to the administration's call for convening an extraordinary
legislative session to deal with initial budget bills.</P>
      <P>The conference on Taiwan's sustainable economic growth has been
postponed until July so the government will have more time to prepare
the agenda and seek support from opposition parties for the meeting,
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A preparatory meeting of the conference was also postponed from
June 3 to June 10, Hu added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Personnel in senior government posts will
soon be adjusted, Secretary-General Tan Sun-chen of the Presidential
Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Former premier Frank Hsieh, who was absent from a senior
officials meeting in which President Chen Shui-bian announced his
decision to delegate executive power, said it would be nice if the
president reallocated responsibility so the government can get back
to normal operations.</P>
      <P>President Chen said Wednesday that he will no longer exercise any
power beyond what is expressly defined by the Constitution as the
role of the president.</P>
      <P>The president also promised the premier will have "a free hand"
in making decisions for the Executive Yuan, while the Democratic
Progressive Party chief will have full authority to set the ruling
party's policy agenda.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen claimed that the president was very calm and
determined at yesterday's meeting in which he did not mention
reshuffling the government. The senior aide stressed that the
president is not a lame duck.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said the president's announcement had nothing to
do with the 2008 presidential election, as its main purpose was to
respond to public expectations.</P>
      <P>Bringing government operations back to normal is a good thing, as
it would allow the Cabinet more authority in setting economic policy
and improving social order, he added.</P>
      <P>As for his absence from Wednesday's meeting at the Presidential
Office, Hsieh asked the media not to exaggerate the incident, saying
it was not very convenient for him to get car service during the
Dragon Boat festival.</P>
      <P>In order to solve a dilemma for the DDP, Central Standing
Committee member Cheng Pao-ching asked the president not only to
delegate power but also share power with opposition parties by
forming a coalition Cabinet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
vowed Thursday to press ahead with its campaign to recall President
Chen Shui-bian, despite the president's recent promise to loosen his
grip on executive power and uphold the highest ethical standards.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said that as an opposition party, the
PFP must not remain silent and must do something to rein in what he
called a "corrupt ruling Democratic Progressive Party."</P>
      <P>The PFP will organize a demonstration in front of the
Presidential Office this Saturday to demand Chen step down, to
renounce his presidential immunity and to facilitate judicial
investigations into a series of scandals involving senior officials in
Chen's administration and his son-in-law, Soong said.</P>
      <P>Also, Soong urged the Kuomintang to fulfill its responsibility as
an opposition party and join the PFP's campaign to recall Chen.</P>
      <P>Soong said Chen's promise shows the DPP lacks any ability for
self-examination and has severely damaged the country's
constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Soong pointed out that the power of the executive is clearly
defined in the Constitution and not something that can be allotted,
traded or decided arbitrarily by the ruling party.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Chen announced he will no longer exercise any power
beyond what is expressly defined by the Constitution as the role of
the president.</P>
      <P>Chen promised that he will neither interfere with the
policy-making of the Executive Yuan nor meddle in DPP operations and
will refrain from involvement in any political campaigns. Also, he
pledged that the first family will conduct themselves according to
the highest ethical standards and live up to the public's
expectations.</P>
      <P>According to PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping, while Chen is
reluctant to resign in order to take responsibility, he made the move
in an attempt at damage control, as it seems likely the corruption
scandals will snowball to implicate other members of the first family
besides Chen's son-in-law.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said it is against the principle of democracy to allow the
premier, who is not elected by the people, to enjoy full

    <TEXT>
      <P>An Army lieutenant general who was accused
by an opposition lawmaker of gaining promotion to his current rank by
bribing an aide of President Chen Shui-bian filed a slander suit
Thursday against the accusing legislator.</P>
      <P>After a news conference organized by the Ministry of National
Defense, Lieut. Gen. Hsu Tai-sheng, director of the Joint Inspection
Office under the Ministry of National Defense, went to the Taipei
District Prosecutors' Office and filed suit with prosecutors in front
of news media.</P>
      <P>Hsu said at the news conference that as a career military officer
he was shocked and angered by People First Party Legislator Chang
Hsien-yao's "groundless" claim that he gave NT$8 million (US$249,057)
to then deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office, Chen
Cheh-nan, in return for a promotion in 2003.</P>
      <P>"By airing baseless allegations, the lawmaker has not only
tarnished my reputation but also damaged the credibility of the
Ministry of the National Defense, and my personal silence on the
charge would be considered tacit acknowledgement of it," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu was one of several examples cited by Chang on May 30 to
support his claim that President Chen Shui-bian's administration has
been riddled with corruption.</P>
      <P>Several other retired generals were quoted by Chang as
complaining they quit the armed forces after having refused to "buy
an advancement" in their careers.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Chang has insulted all senior military officers by
insinuating they have obtained their posts through bribery.</P>
      <P>Hsu's decision to file suit has the backing of the Ministry of
National Defense, which denied through its spokesman Wu Chi-fang at
Hsu's news conference that there have been any cash-for-promotion
cases in the armed forces.</P>
      <P>He also denied the existence of what the lawmaker called "Bian's
army" in the armed forces, consisting of a clique of officers who
have close personal ties with President Chen Shui-bian.</P>

      <P>Based on the principles of "Taiwan sovereignty" and "policy
flexibility, " the government hopes to proceed more effectively on
many issues, such as opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The government has been working on the issue since 2001, but
China's lack of cooperation has led to limited progress, Su pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Although the government must take precautions against all
possible senarios while opening Taiwan to China, he said that Taiwan
must also have confidence in its dealings with China -- a confidence
that has been a decisive factor in making Taiwan a hub of
international trade over the past 400 years.</P>
      <P>As a national economic conference on sustainable growth will be
held next month, the government hopes to incorporate the views of
Taiwan business operators and find ways to address their problems, he
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Thursday that the time is not ripe to recall President
Chen Shui-bian and that he will not partake in a rally slated for
Saturday to demand Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>At an interpellation session at the Taipei city council, Ma, who
doubles as Taipei mayor, reiterated that "it is still not time to
pull the trigger" in terms of pushing for a recall of Chen, who has
been dogged by a series of corruption scandals involving his senior
aides and family members.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) vowed Thursday to press
ahead with its campaign to recall Chen, despite his recent promise to
loosen his grip on executive power and uphold the highest ethical
standards.</P>
      <P>The demonstration will be part of the presidential recall
campaign launched by the PFP, which forms the opposition "pan blue
alliance" with the KMT and the tiny New Party.</P>
      <P>Discounting Ma's refusal to take part, New Party City Councilor
Hou Kuan-chun likened Ma to legendary Buddhist monk Sanzang of the
Tang Dynasty, who was unable to do anything but pray and call for
mercy in the face of bugs and goblins. Hou claimed that Ma is
"failing the public's expectation" by not supporting the campaign.</P>
      <P>However, Ma defended himself by saying that as leader of the main
opposition party he must be responsible and prudent in answering the
public's expectations. He also quoted a recent public opinion poll as
indicating that despite Hou's claims, only 30 percent of the
respondents supported a recall of Chen but some 60 percent were
against the idea.</P>
      <P>Ma told all members of the opposition parties that timing is a
crucial issue in terms of a recall of the head of state. "Once we do

      <P>Huang Shih-cho, convener of the TSU's legislative caucus, made
the remarks after the Legislative Yuan failed to pass major bills

Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang strongly criticized the lack of efficacy in the

Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday that there will be no disruption of

Shui-bian's announcement the previous day that he will no longer
exercise any power beyond what is expressly defined by the
Constitution as the role of the president.</P>
      <P>In response to opposition calls for Chen to step down to take
responsibility for a series of scandals involving senior officials

will have "a free hand" in making decisions for the Executive Yuan.
As head of state, he will neither interfere with the policy-making of
the Executive Yuan nor meddle with the operations of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, he said.
</P>
      <P>The media asked after Chen's announcement who will have the final

Dragon Boat Festival, which fell on May 31 this year.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Constitution and the Organic Law of the National
Security Council clearly define cross-strait policy and he added that
the MAC will adhere to it and that there will be no disruption in the
current cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>He also said that the "active management, effective opening"
policy regarding cross-strait economy and trade that Chen announced
earlier to replace the "active opening, effective management" policy
will continue, saying that it was a result of long-term discussion.</P>
      <P>"This major policy will remain unchanged, " Wu said, adding that
it is important that the policy "will give people a sense of

      <P>Asked whether Chen will still orchestrate cross-strait policy, Wu

      <P>Humans are nearing a dead end after relying
on underground fossil fuel for two centuries since the Industrial
Revolution while distancing themselves from the biological arena and
the Sun, Taiwan's top academic said Thursday.</P>
      <P>During a speech delivered at National Taiwan Normal University
(NTNU), Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh called for mankind to
resume close ties to the Sun, which he said beams energy to the Earth
by an amount that each hour is tantamount to the amount of energy
that the entire global population consumes for a whole year.</P>
      <P>Lee called for Taiwan people, including the NTNU faculty and
students, to be the "masters" of the nation who give the government
the best advice on energy policy and seriously push for cuts in
emissions of CO2 so as to do their duties as world citizens.</P>
      <P>He said that globally, people should strive to raise energy
efficiency and review their population policies.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, he said, at least three things should be done
immediately. First, he said, as a member of the global village,
Taiwan must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and must improve
waste water handling, a situation he described as the worst of its

      <P>Second, there must be a clear and workable energy policy that
will enable Taiwan to save energy in the coming three decades, he
said.</P>
      <P>Third, he said, Taiwan must speed up research on renewable energy
and develop new energy resources, pointing out that technologies that
transform solar power into electricity have been available around the
world and that the world would not need fossil fuel any longer if
just 1 percent of the world's land was used as a base to transform
solar light and power into electricity. Taiwan could also develop
other energy resources, including wind power, geothermal power and

    <HEADLINE>TSU LAWMAKER ACCUSES FORMER CLA CHAIRWOMAN OF HIDING TRUTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June  1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's
(TSU) candidate for Kaohsiung mayor criticized his rival from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Thursday for harboring an
ulterior motive by hiding the truth when she quit her post as
chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) last year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lo Chih-ming, who will represent the TSU in the
year-end mayoral race in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, told a
press conference that former CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu, who resigned to
take responsibility for the Aug. 21 riot by Thai workers last year,
never explained who reversed the government policy that banned the
hiring of foreign laborers for the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
railway project.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted to news media shortly after the riot that the
policy of hiring only domestic workers was reversed after an
"influential figure" had intervened. She did not reveal the identity
of this "influential figure."</P>
      <P>Lo claimed that Chen herself and National Security Council (NSC)
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen were the "influential figures" who
reversed the policy and contributed to the rioting by Thai workers to
protest their poor treatment by their employers -- the Kaohsiung
Rapid Transit Corp. (KTRC) -- and a labor brokerage firm.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in a notice dated May 10, 2001, the CLA
rejected a KTRC application to import foreign laborers on the grounds
that construction contracts awarded after May 16, 2001 were not
allowed to use foreign labor.</P>
      <P>The KTRC applied again in September 2001 to import Thai workers
and the CLA approved its request in December and informed the
Presidential Office of its decision, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Lo claimed that the reason for the policy about-face was to
please the Thai authorities in the hope that Lee Yuan-tseh, president
of Academia Sinica and winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry,
would receive high-profile treatment at the 2003 summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Bangkok.</P>
      <P>The TSU legislator also claimed that after Chen's remarks about
the "influential figure, " most people took her to be referring to
Chen Che-nan, who wielded considerable influence while serving as
deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office in 2000-2004.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, Chen Chu's remarks did far greater damage to
then-acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, son of Chen Che-nan, than
to herself because she ruined the political future of a would-be
rival in the Kaohsiung mayoral race who enjoyed a higher approval
rating than herself.</P>
      <P>Lo's attacks on Chen Chu followed a first wave of criticism he
leveled last week when he labeled her as "dishonest" and
"unqualified" to be mayor.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen Chu pointed out that Lo's claims were merely
speculation. She told Lo that the candidates of the "pan-green camp,"
consisting of the DPP and the TSU, should not attack each other.</P>
      <P>The NSC secretary-general also declined to comment on the "untrue
claims."</P>
      <P>Chen Chu appears set to become the DPP's nominee in the year-end
election after winning a DPP primary, but Lo claims to have a better
chance of winning the Kaohsiung mayoral election than her if he can
represent the "pan-green camp."</P>
      <P>Lo vowed to stay in the race and "fight to the end" even if Chen
is unwilling to yield.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PLAN FOR CABINET RESHUFFLE: GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The performance of the Cabinet has improved
after four months of adjustment and there is no plan for a reshuffle,
a government spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsan made the
remarks amid calls for a speedy Cabinet reshuffle after President Chen
Shui-bian's announcement the previous day that he will no longer
exercise any power beyond what is expressly defined by the
Constitution as the role of the president.</P>
      <P>The president, in response to opposition calls for him to step
down to take responsibility for a series of scandals involving senior
officials and members of his family, promised the premier will have
"a free hand" in making decisions for the Executive Yuan, while the
Democratic Progressive Party chief will have full authority to set
the ruling party's policy agenda.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that since Su assumed the premiership Jan. 25, he has
shown himself as leading a "pragmatic" Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The premier knows the high expectations of the public and has
demanded that every Cabinet member follow the highest ethical
standard, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The approval rating for the Cabinet performance has been rising,
Cheng said. "Maybe there is still room for improvement, but there is 
no plan for a reshuffle," he added.</P>
      <P>To live up to the public's expectations, Cheng said the
administration is planning to speed up major construction projects,
with plans to push for the completion of such projects as the 31-km
Peiyi Expressway connecting Taipei and Suao in northeastern Yilan
County, and the 345-km high speed railway connecting Taipei and
Kaohsiung, according to schedule.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Thursday that she has
no particular thoughts about the lineup of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>She said that each Cabinet member will be appraised for their
individual performance when she was asked whether there will be
a change in the lineup after Chen's announcement that he will give
Premier Su Tseng-chang a "free hand" in his administration.</P>
      <P>She said that the president mainly wants the Cabinet to enhance
its efficiency, which she said is "a greater responsibility for us,
and we'll do our best."</P>
      <P>Asked whether this means that a Su-Tsai ticket has been formed
for the 2008 presidential election, Tsai said it was too early to
say.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP FACTIONS HAIL RESIGNATIONS OF PRESIDENT'S RIGHT-HAND MEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major factions in the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) hailed the resignations of two of President
Chen Shui-bian's most trusted aides Thursday, saying the development
signifies Chen's determination to honor his commitment to political
accountability and integrity.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said in a press release that Chen had
approved the resignations of Ma Yung-cheng, his deputy chief of
staff, and Lin Chin-chang, a National Security Council advisory
member.</P>
      <P>Their resignations came a day after Chen pledged to give full
power to Premier Su Tseng-chang to control the Executive Yuan and to
refrain from meddling with the affairs of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The president also pledged in a written statement issued late
Wednesday that he and his family will "conduct themselves according
to the highest ethical standards and live up to the public's
expectations."</P>
      <P>Chen's statement was issued amid rising calls in both the DPP and
the opposition for the president to take responsibility for a series
of scandals embroiling his family and administration.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has been dogged by allegations of political and financial
irregularities, said he feels sorry for failing to do a better job
even though "he has tried his utmost." Given the complexities of his
official duties, Ma said he feels he is not capable and competent
enough to handle them perfectly. "It's time for me to leave," Ma said
in the letter. Ma has been one of Chen's most trusted right-hand men
for 15 years.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the resignations of Chen's close aides, Legislator
Gao Chih-peng, who concurrently serves as secretary of the DPP's
Justice Alliance, of which Chen is a member, said the departure of Ma
and Lin will pave the way for Chen to infuse new blood into his inner
circle and refresh the image of the DPP administration.</P>
      <P>As to whether Cabinet members close to Chen could be replaced,
Gao said the speculation is outrageous, adding that personnel
reshuffles should be based on individual ministers credentials and
performance rather than their "factional affiliations."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Lai Ching-teh, also convener of the New
Tide faction, which is widely believed to be the most influential
subgroup within the DPP, said he respects and support Chen's approval
of his two close aides' resignations to underscore his resolve to
carry out political reform and establish clean politics.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuan Bi-ling of the DPP's Welfare State Alliance
headed by former Premier Frank Hsieh said the resignations of Ma and
Lin do not necessarily mean that they have committed any wrongdoings
or crime.</P>
      <P>"But their images have been damaged in the pall of recent 'media
politics and populist judgments,'" Kuan lamented, adding that their
departure will help restore the Presidential Office's credibility. </P>
      <P>The DPP's "pan-green" ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
-- also gave a thumbs-up to the resignations, saying their departure
is Chen's response to public expectations of political integrity and
accountability.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Huang Shih-cho said he views Ma's departure as a
move to symbolize his integrity.</P>
      <P>"In the past, his detractors claimed that judicial authorities
dare not investigate his suspected irregularities, Now that he has
left the government, the judicial authorities can thoroughly probe
all cases allegedly implicating him, " Huang said, adding that he
admires Ma's courage in resigning at this critical moment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) were unmoved by the
resignations of two of President Chen Shui-bian's most trusted aides,
saying their departures could probably be Chen's "smoke screen" to

the main opposition parties's Policy Coordination Committee,

allegations implicating Chen's inner circle, including his
family member and close aides.</P>
      <P>The PFP's legislative caucus convener, Lu Hsueh-chang, made a
similar comment, saying that Chen himself should resign to take
responsibility for the series of corruption scandals allegedly

For Bush, Talks With Iran Were a Last Resort 

After 27 years in which the United States

President Bush reversed course on Wednesday

eventually by some of his advisers -- that he no

Wall Street Journal: Deep Trouble
As Demand for Coal Rises, Risky Mines Play
Bigger Role

Since May 20, seven miners have died,
bringing the number of workers killed in
coal-mine accidents in the U.S. this year to 33
-- compared with 22 for all of last year. Part
of the problem, some say, is a rise in the
number of small, undercapitalized mines that
have become economical since coal prices have
surged. Miners refer to them as "dogholes."
Despite the recent rash of fatalities, coal 
mining has gotten safer overall, due to 
improved technology and mining methods. In the 
early part of the 20th century, when there were 
roughly seven times as many coal miners as today,
the annual death toll from accidents often 
exceeded 2,000 miners. In 1950, there were 643 
fatalities. By 1990, the number had dropped to 
66.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that more
power delegated to him and the Executive Yuan by President Chen
Shui-bian means deeper trust and greater responsibility, and he urged
the public not to politicize the matter.</P>
      <P>Su called for the Taiwan public "to value the meaning of the
empowerment as it is high time that the government strives harder to
serve the people."</P>
      <P>Su appealed to the country to give him and his administrative
team some time and more "space" to carry out their tasks.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during an inspection tour of
Hualien, eastern Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>His remarks were in response to media members' inquiries about
the overall situation following President Chen's announcement May 31
that he would no longer exercise any power beyond what is expressly
defined by the Constitution as the role of the president.</P>
      <P>The president, in response to opposition calls for him to step
down to take responsibility for a series of scandals involving senior
officials and members of his family, promised that the premier will
have "a free hand" in making decisions for the Executive Yuan, while
the Democratic Progressive Party chief will have full authority to
set the ruling party's policy agenda.</P>
      <P>Su urged Taiwan society to give members of the first family "more
space" after President Chen's son-in-law Chao Chien-ming was taken
into custody more than a week ago on suspicions of involvement in
insider trading.</P>
      <P>He also called for greater space for the judicial system to allow
the judges and prosecutors to handle the Chao case objectively and
free of outside pressure.</P>

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
legislative caucus convener Lu Hsueh-chang said Friday that recalling
President Chen Shui-bian and staging massive rallies to show the
people's disgruntlement will be carried out at the same time.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to improve the image of the Presidential Office,
Chen promised to reorganize the power structure of his administration
after a senior officials meeting two days ago.</P>
      <P>He also approved the resignations of two of his right-hand men
the previous day in an effort to reorganize his inner circle to
facilitate political reform after a string of debilitating corruption
scandals allegedly implicating his son-in-law and senior
administration officials.</P>
      <P>At a press meeting, Lu said the first rally to pressure Chen to
step down will be held in front of the Presidential Office square
Saturday, rain or shine.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the main purpose of Chen's "delegate power"
announcements was to keep himself in power instead of stepping down,
adding that his announcement of returning to the normal operations of
the Constitution is nothing but lip service, which is why the PFP
caucus is demanding Chen's resignation.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court granted a request
by prosecutors Friday to detain a former senior aide to President
Chen Shui-bian for two more months, on the grounds that releasing him
could harm the investigation into his alleged wrongdoings.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan was detained in April on suspicion of taking bribes
from a businessman to help him settle his embezzlement charges. The
original two-month detention is to expire June 6.</P>
      <P>During the investigation, Chen admitted to having taken three
checks and other fees amounting to NT$7.11 million from Liang
Po-hsun, a wanted economic criminal.</P>
      <P>As Liang has turned himself in to police to substantiate his
charges that Chen did not help him get off the hook, the prosecutors
said Chen was "highly suspected" of having defrauded Liang.</P>
      <P>The prosecution requested an extended detention for Chen because
other witnesses and suspects in this and related cases have not yet
been summoned. Another reason for the request is that if freed on
bail, Chen might collude with other people to destroy evidence.</P>
      <P>The request takes effect June 7, meaning that Chen, who is also
charged in connection with the Kaohsiung rapid transit scandal, will
be kept in custody until Aug. 6.</P>

      <P>The "Unknown Rebel" who famously stood up

Tiananmen Square in 1989 is rumored to be living in Taiwan where he
reportedly settled in 1993.</P>
      <P>The "tank man" Wang Weilin has been an adviser on ceramic

Times quoted a Hong Kong-based professor who spoke on condition of

      <P>The photograph of Wang standing alone in front of a column of

      <P>The professor told the Epoch Times that Wang, born in Shaoyang in

traveled with a union group to Beijing to take part in the
pro-democracy demonstrations in the Chinese capital.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is
waiting for the most appropriate time to put forward at the
Legislative Yuan a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian, KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that a draft proposal crafted by a KMT lawmaker has
already gathered enough lawmakers' sponsorship needed for any motion,
Ma said "the gun has been loaded" and the only question now is "when
to pull the trigger."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after calling on Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng to discuss a wide range of issues, including convening
a provisional session of the legislature after the current session
ended Tuesday, as well as proposals to recall the president or topple
the Cabinet, and the resignation of two of President Chen's
right-hand men Thursday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came amid calls for the KMT to act quickly in
proposing a recall of the president in the wake of a spate of
corruption scandals implicating his close aides and family member.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated the KMT stance of waiting for the right time,
saying that details related to the string of scandals have yet to
come to light. "It might be more effective to pull the trigger when
they snowball to the boiling point," he said.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, at least a quarter of the members
of the Legislative Yuan are needed to sponsor a motion to recall the
president. The motion then has to be approved by two-thirds of the
legislators before it can be put to a national referendum. In
addition, for the referendum result to be valid, at least half of the
nation's voters must vote and of those who vote, more than half of
them must be in favor of the recalling the president. </P>
      <P>If the voters reject the recall proposal, another recall motion
cannot be put forward for at least three years.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
already moved to solidify its leadership, making the recall plan even
more difficult.</P>
      <P>"But the KMT has not ruled out any possibilities, and the party
is engaging in related preparations," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibility of toppling the Cabinet, Ma said that
if the KMT initiates and wins the legislature's approval of a motion
of no-confidence, the president might refuse to budge and dissolve
the legislature, and the legislative elections would have to be
carried out in accordance with amendments to the Constitution passed
last June, including the halving of the number of legislative seats
and implementing the "single constituency, two votes" electoral
system.</P>
      <P>However, as the re-districting in line with these changes has yet
to be completed, the matter will require further study, he added.</P>
      <P>On the resignations of Ma Yung-cheng, deputy chief of staff to
President Chen, and Lin Chin-chang, a National Security Council
advisory member, Ma said that this is only an attempt by President
Chen to save himself, claiming that "the problem lies not with the
two aides, but with the president himself."</P>
      <P>The president should seriously consider whether to step down, Ma
added.</P>

      <P>Should the ruling party not promise to give
a greenlight at the legislature to a law amendments package aimed at
opening the door for direct transport links between Taiwan and China,
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which along with the People First
Party controls a slight legislative majority, will not agree to hold
an extra legislative session, KMT Ma Ying-jeou warned Friday.</P>
      <P>Under such a scenario, the current hostility between the ruling
and opposition parties is expected to get worse, Ma said, adding that
without the passage of the amendments package, it is unlikely the KMT
will attend a national economic meeting on sustainable growth next
month, while the current standoff between the ruling and opposition
parties will not be resolved.</P>
      <P>Calling on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
legislative caucus to accept the opposition-proposed law revision
package, Ma said an agreement between the KMT and the DPP on the
issue is the key to opening an extra session at the Legislative Yuan,
which would allow a handful of other important bills to be screened.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after meeting with Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who expressed hope that Premier Su Tseng-chang

      <P>Responding to the possibility that People

mayoral election, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
admitted Friday that he has no answer and is open to negotiating over
the matter.</P>

      <P>As for the best resolution to the candidate issue, Ma said that
negotiations or polls will be the key.</P>
      <P>He expressed his concern that both that PFP and KMT are

      <P>Former Council of Labor Affairs
Chairwoman Chen Chu was nominated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Friday as the DPP candidate to run in the
year-end Kaohsiung mayoral race, according to DPP officials.</P>
      <P>Chen won an approval rating of 77.76 percent in a recent public
opinion poll in Kaohsiung City and captured nearly 80 percent of
ballots cast by party members in a DPP primary, making her the one
and only eligible DPP candidate for the mayoral election, DPP
officials said in a written statement.</P>
      <P>Also in a written statement, Chen said later in the day that she
welcomes the outcome of the primary process, which she described as a
"representation of the democratic values of the DPP."</P>
      <P>Chen vowed to safeguard Kaohsiung's development should she be
elected mayor of the port city. At the crucial juncture of the DPP,
she said, she will listen to and follow the voices of the Kaohsiung
residents and strive to improve quality of life for the entire city
based on a solid foundation that has been consolidated by former
mayor Frank Hsieh and incumbent acting mayor Yeh Chu-lan.</P>
      <P>Noting that what the Kaohsiung residents need is not the tumult
of political rhetoric but substantively good life, Chen said that if
elected, she will carry out her ideals in the port city in all areas
involving public order, transportation, education, employment,
environmental protection, industrial development and culture.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said she will heed the advice of DPP Legislator
Kuan Bi-ling in terms of city development efforts, including seeking
to have Chinese Television System (CTS) move its headquarters from
Taipei to the southern port city and for Kaohsiung to play host to
a proposed national video and audio digital center.</P>
      <P>Kuan, another DPP aspirant, won 20.76 percent of the total

    <TEXT>
      <P>If the current Legislative Yuan is
dissolved, a new legislative election will have to be conducted under
the new electoral system, the Central Election Commission (CEC) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The CEC made the announcement in the wake of reports that the
opposition is considering seeking a recall of the president or the
toppling of the Cabinet in the wake of a spate of corruption scandals
implicating the close aides of President Chen Shui-bian and his
son-in-law.</P>
      <P>CEC officials said that if the opposition legislators initiate a
motion of no-confidence and win support in the legislature, and the
president refuses to budge and instead dissolves the legislature,
then the CEC will have to conduct the new legislative election within
60 days.</P>
      <P>The new legislative election will be carried out according to the
amended Constitution, including the new electoral system of "single
constituency, two votes" under a re-districting scheme and the
halving of the number of legislative seats to 113, which was adopted
last June.</P>
      <P>According to the newly amended law governing the election and
recall of public functionaries, the legislature should give its
consent to the re-districting scheme 13 months before the current
legislature expires.</P>
      <P>CEC spokesman Deng Tien-you said that the draft re-districting
scheme, which was mapped out by the commission after a lengthy
consultation period with local election commissions and the views of
academics and experts, has already been sent to the legislature.
</P>
      <P>If the legislature has not yet given its consent and a new
legislative election is approaching, then the new constituency will
follow the re-districting scheme mapped out by the CEC, because the
status of the Constitution is higher than the law, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES END TO POLITICAL FIGHTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance" to stop its political
fighting Friday after President Chen Shui-bian vowed to hand over
power to Premier Su Tseng-chang in a gesture to assume responsibility
for a string of corruption scandals involving members of his family
and close aides.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whips Chen Chin-chun and Ker Chien-ming
made the call at a Legislative Yuan news conference.</P>
      <P>Saying that the "pan-blue alliance" must "stop creating chaos"
now that Chen has become a lame duck president, Chen Chin-chun said
the demands of the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party (PFP) and
the New Party that Chen step down from the presidency have gone too
far. He called them an apparent intention to fuel political strife.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-chun asked the "pan-blue alliance" not to push the
president to the corner as he has made it clear that he will play the
role as head of state strictly in line with the Constitution, leaving
full power to Su to lead the Cabinet and quitting all DPP activities.</P>
      <P>While many key bills are still awaiting legislative approval
after the Legislative Yuan went into recess May 30, Ker called on the
"pan-blue alliance" to support the proposal of calling an extra
session in summer instead of exchanging verbal attacks.</P>
      <P>According to Ker, the resignations Thursday of Ma Yung-cheng,
Presidential Office deputy chief of staff, and Lin Chin-chang, a
National Security Council advisory member -- two close aides of Chen
Shui-bian -- are an indication that the president has deeply
reflected on himself in response to the public's expectations. He
asked the "pan-blue alliance" not to further "complicate" the
situation.</P>
      <P>The resignations of Ma and Lin came as a surprise amid fierce
demands that Chen should quit the presidency immediately to take
responsibility for the many corruption scandals implicating his
family members and close aids.</P>
      <P>However, the "pan-blue alliance" views the resignations as a
scheme designed by Chen to "drag out" the situation.</P>
      <P>As Chen is mired in a serious crisis and his approval rating has
sunk to a new low, leading opposition KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has
come under fierce fire that he "lacks the teeth" to take action to
boot out Chen.</P>
      <P>Although Ma has called on Chen to quit presidency as he lacks the
integrity to govern the country, he maintains that now is not the
proper time to initiate a presidential recall proposal, as there is
no hard evidence showing that the president himself is implicated in
the corruption cases.</P>
      <P>While KMT Secretary-General Chan Chun-po said that a presidential
recall proposal should be decided by the party's legislative caucus,
KMT lawmaker Ting Shou-chung, who is also a KMT Central Committee
member, will put forward a presidential recall proposal in a
committee plenary meeting Saturday to seek a resolution to do so
despite Ma's ambiguous attitude.</P>
      <P>According to KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen, Ma will give a
speech in the meeting on his views regarding the presidential recall
proposal and a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Cheng, however, expressed reservations about a rally to be held
by the PFP in front of the Presidential Office Saturday to demand
Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming also called a news conference at
the Legislative Yuan Friday, in which he insisted that Chen must step
down and face judicial investigation in line with constitutional
requirements.</P>
      <P>If he refuses to do so, the "pan-blue alliance, " which controls
a slim majority in the legislature, should consider launching a
no-confidence vote and forming a new Cabinet, Yok suggested.</P>
      <P>Yok also visited the KMT legislative caucus earlier the same day
to seek the KMT's endorsement to remove Chen.</P>
      <P>New Party lawmaker Wu Cheng-dien asked Chen to honor his promises
of delegating power to the premier and come up with concrete measures
to show his determination to clear his name.</P>
      <P>He must also publicize all suspected unlawful activities
involving his family members, senior aides and high-level government
officials, make public all the property of his family for public
scrutiny, and pledge in public that he will wait for the results of
an investigation, We demanded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan wishes to see a peaceful resolution
to the dispute over Iran's implementation of a nuclear program, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Despite not being a member of the United Nations, Taiwan respects
the UN's position on nuclear proliferation and hopes all members of
the international community will keep their promise with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to develop and use nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes only, the MOFA said in a news release.</P>
      <P>The MOFA made the comment after U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday in Brussels that should Iran agree to
halt its nuclear program, Washington would be willing to hold
diplomatic talks with Iran -- along with Britain, France and Germany
-- in order to seek ways to settle differences on the issue.</P>
      <P>The news release said that Taiwan, a peace-loving nation, is
delighted to see the United States willing to address the dispute
through multilateral diplomatic channels, and that Taiwan supports
the U.S. position on the matter.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is ready to start talks with China at
any time on opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists and setting up regular
cross-Taiwan Strait charter passenger flights as soon as Chinese
leaders give the nod, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Travel Agent Association of the Republic of China remains the
government-designated body entitled to contact its Chinese
equivalent, and all technical matters regarding the two issues are
almost resolved, the MAC officials said.</P>
      <P>But the officials were reserved about when representatives from
the two sides could meet to wrap up negotiations, saying only that
"the two measures could be put in place immediately once the Chinese
side gives its approval."</P>
      <P>"It would be a good idea to create the two openings in September
and October when there is a long vacation period in China, " they
opined, pointing out that Taiwan's current political situation may
also affect when the two measures go into effect.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang told a Dragon Boat Festival gathering with
China-based Taiwanese businesspeople a day earlier that he would
allow "a wide opening" of civilian exchanges with China under the
framework of the "active management, effective opening" policy.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said on the same occasion that the two
measures could be implemented in four or five months.</P>
      <P>In a related development, tourism-related and construction shares
in the Taiwan Stock Exchange surged robustly Friday on news that the
government might allow Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan in the near

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Finance Minister Lin Chuan was
questioned by prosecutors Friday in connection with an insider
trading case in which President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law has been
detained on suspicion of involvement.</P>
      <P>Chao Chien-ming, the husband of Chen's daughter Chen Hsing-yu,
was in detention on suspicion of using dummy accounts to buy and sell
Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) shares on insider information.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors wanted Lin to describe the process by which the
Bank of Taiwan led a consortium of 19 banks to bail out TDC with
syndicated loans, why the Bank of Taiwan recommended Su Teh-chien to
be TDC chairman and how the Department of National Treasury decided
to sell TDC shares. Su is also in custody.</P>
      <P>The other focus of the prosecution's investigation is the sources
of funding used by the Chao family to purchase TDC shares. For that
purpose, investigators summoned several people for questioning,
including National Taoyuan Hospital Director Ho Feng-ming, who was
found to have remitted NT$500,000 to the bank account of Chao
Chien-hsun, Chien-ming's younger brother. Ho resigned Thursday.</P>
      <P>Also being questioned were Chen Hui-you, general affairs official
at the president's residence; and Lin Che-min, a table tennis player
in the national team. Chen and Lin told investigators they had asked
other people to transfer money into the bank account of Chao Yu-chu,
Chien-ming's father.</P>
      <P>Hung Kuang-tsan, another table tennis player; and Chang
Cheng-chung and Chang Cheng-an -- who are brothers and friends of
Chao Chien-ming -- were found to have handled funds for Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>Yu Shih-yi, a businessman detained since May 21, was also
questioned to clarify details about the insider trading scandal,
which has severely damaged support for the president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU WITHHOLDS COORDINATION WITH DPP ON KAOHSIUNG MAYORAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June  2 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's
(TSU) candidate for Kaohsiung mayor said Friday that it is too early
yet to discuss whether the TSU and its "pan-green" alliance partner,
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), will field a single
candidate in the Kaohsiung mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lo Chih-ming, TSU's candidate for Kaohsiung mayor,
indicated through his office that he will not coordinate with DPP
candidate Chen Chu until public prosecutors close the case on her
role in a profiteering scandal involving the Kaohsiung rapid transit
railway project.</P>
      <P>Chen, former Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) chairwoman, was
nominated by the DPP Friday as the party's candidate in the year-end
Kaohsiung mayoral race.</P>
      <P>Lo has questioned her integrity and urged her to withdraw from
the race because he believes her chances of winning are slim. He has
indicated that he will run in the election even if Chen is unwilling
to yield.</P>
      <P>Although some DPP officials favor using an opinion poll to select
a single candidate to represent the pan-green camp, Lo's office said
Lo will not coordinate with Chen until the dust has settled on the
investigation of her role in the scandal.</P>
      <P>Chen resigned from her post as CLA chairwoman in September last
year to take political responsibility for the Aug. 21 riot in
Kaohsiung County by hundreds of Thai laborers.</P>
      <P>The scandal came to light after the Thai workers staged the riot
to protest poor treatment by their employers and a labor brokerage
firm. Subsequent investigations by public prosecutors indicated the
possibility of a massive profiteering racket involving government
officials, executives of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) and
construction companies contracted by the KRTC and two illegal
brokerage firms.</P>
      <P>Chen was questioned as a suspect by the Bureau of Investigation
under the Ministry of Justice last November and it is unclear whether
she will eventually become a defendant in the case.</P>
      <P>She has repeatedly faced questioning about the role she might
have played in the DPP government's policy about-face that allowed
the KRTC to hire Thai laborers instead of domestic workers for the
Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted before quitting her Cabinet post that the policy
was reversed because of the intervention of an "influential figure,"
but she has never revealed the identity of that person.</P>

1839: China's Ching Commissioner Lin Tse-hsu orders the burning

offshore islands of Tungyin and Matsu, his first visit to the
frontline islands since he assumed the post on May 20.

2001: Chang Jung-kung, director of the Kuomintang's Mainland
Affairs Department, says that the 1989 crackdown on the unarmed
pro-democracy students in Beijing's Tiananmen Square is a major
factor which has driven the Chinese communists toward a more open
society.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three kinds of errors to
which men are liable when in the presence of their superiors. First,
to speak out when one is not called upon to speak: that is called
being forward. Second, to keep silent when called upon to speak: that
is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak out without taking into
consideration the expression in the eyes of the person spoken to:
that is called blindness."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGED TO PICK PREMIER FROM MAJORITY PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
suggested Friday that President Chen Shui-bian pick a new premier
from the political party that holds majority seats in the legislature
in conformity with the basic spirit of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Wang aired his view while meeting with Huang Kwang-kuo, a
representative of the Democracy Action Alliance who has been one of
President Chen's most bitter critics.</P>
      <P>Huang, a psychology professor at a National Taiwan University,
said the nation's Constitution prescribes a dual-leadership
governmental system which he claimed has been "distorted" into a
presidential system with the president enjoying too much authority.</P>
      <P>In the future, Huang said ruling and opposition parties should
exercise self-discipline and jointly direct the governmental system
toward a parliamentary system without any new round of constitutional
amendments. He said the premier should be given the authority to
endorse any major policy decision to be promulgated by the president
and the Cabinet should respect the legislature's resolutions on major
policy issues.</P>
      <P>Wang echoed Huang's view, saying that the president should
respect the legislature and let the majority party organize the
Cabinet. "The president should pick a premier from the majority party
which should also be authorized to form a Cabinet," he added.</P>
      <P>The Wang-Huang meeting took place two days after President Chen
said he will no longer exercise power beyond what the Constitution
specifically conferred on him and will hand over policy-making and
cabinet-appointment authority to Premier Su Tseng-chang amid rising
calls in both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition camp to take responsibility for a recent rash of
corruption allegations embroiling his family and administration.</P>
      <P>Late Thursday, Chen accepted the resignation of his deputy chief
of staff and perhaps his most trusted adviser, Ma Yung-cheng. In a
Presidential Office news release, Ma said his decision to resign was
a response to Chen's call for change.</P>
      <P>Chen himself hasn't been implicated in any of the cases of
alleged wrongdoing, but the allegations, particularly the detention
of his son-in-law on suspicion of insider trading, have badly damaged
him. Opposition lawmakers have urged him to resign and some of them
have even initiated a motion to recall him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT PROMOTES 'SOFT POWER' AT DPU MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The world, as a community sharing a common
destiny, needs to promote and practise "soft power" because no-one
will benefit from a zero-sum or negative-sum game, Vice President
Annette Lu said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while addressing via teleconference the
opening of the 2006 West Pacific Regional Convention of the
Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) held in Seoul, South Korea.</P>
      <P>Lu pointed out that over the past century, the West Pacific
region has experienced colonialism, ethnic confrontation and
bloodshed originating from the endless pursuit of wealth and military
power.</P>
      <P>The formation of a global community sharing a common destiny has
highlighted the importance of the values of democracy, peace and
prosperity advocated by the DPU, Lu said, noting that of the five
remaining countries practising communism in the world, four are in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Lu said she is convinced that the world will only enjoy stability
and perpetual peace by sharing the values of democracy and that only
through democracy and peace will prosperity be sustained.</P>
      <P>Lu said that without democracy, the pursuit of economic
prosperity will only expand the wealth disparity and that without
peace, the pursuit of economic prosperity will only lead to arms
races that sow the seeds of destructive military conflicts.</P>
      <P>She said the DPU is different from the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in that the DPU believes that democracy and peace
should be given priority over the pursuit of economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>She noted that the DPU has set up a Pacific disaster prevention
center after its establishment last year and will soon form a Pacific
parliamentary front and a Pacific university alliance.</P>
      <P>The DPU is scheduled to hold a conference on bird flu control and
prevention in Indonesia in July and will hold another conference on
parliamentary reforms in Taipei in August, Lu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS `RECOGNIZED BY WORLD': PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fact that Taiwan has remained off a U.S.
list of major drug-producing or drug-trading countries for six
consecutive years shows that the nation's fight against narcotics has
won international recognition, President Chen Shui-bian said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the 2006 International Narcotics Control
Strategy Report released in March by the U.S. Department of State. He
made the remarks in a written address to a national anti-drug
conference held by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that drug abuse and its accompanying crime seriously
undermines the country's image, competitiveness and public order.</P>
      <P>While a lot of new drugs have appeared in recent years, drug
users and drug traffickers are starting at a younger age and the
ratio of repeat and serial offenders is also rising in Taiwan, Chen
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Also, the sharing of needles among drug users has accelerated the
spread of HIV, he said.</P>
      <P>To promote a national campaign against narcotics, the Executive
Yuan has made anti-drug operations a major part of its measures to
improve the country's law and order, has worked out a program aimed
at reducing the hazards of narcotics and AIDS and has declared 2005
to 2008 "years of national combat against narcotics," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Executive Yuan has adopted four strategies,
including drug prevention, drug rejection, drug withdrawal and drug
crackdown, and holds regular briefings on drug control and
prevention, he said.</P>
      <P>The president urged the private sector to continue to work with
the government to achieve the goal of making Taiwan a "drug-free
country."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ECSTASY DRUG PMMA TO BE BANNED IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has suggested
placing paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) on a list of banned ecstasy
derivatives after the Criminal Investigation Bureau's (CIB's)
forensic science researchers found three kinds of PMMA-containing
street drugs among those confiscated by the police.</P>
      <P>According to CIB experts in toxicant, PMMA is a ring-methoxlated
phenethylamine derivative that affects the body in similar ways to
ecstasy but because PMMA does not produce an immediate effect on the
body, overdoses are common, the DOH claimed.</P>
      <P>The drug caught world attention in 2001, when a young man in
Belgium died of a PMMA overdose, according to the CIB.</P>
      <P>With the fact that street drugs offered as ecstasy do not
necessarily contain MDMA but frequently differ in composition, users
therefore risk consuming pills with dangerous life-threatening
ingredients.</P>
      <P>The DOH asked judicial authorities to list the new amphetamine
compounds as banned drugs while igniting its anti-drug abuse warning
system to obtain the latest information on "dope evolution" and new
ecstasy derivatives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A laboratory under the Atomic Energy Council
(AEC) released Saturday its newly invented "group III-V solar energy
system, " which possesses a solar-to-electricity transfer ratio of
more than 20 percent -- superior to traditional solar power systems
that can only transform 10 percent to 14 percent of total light
energy into electricity.</P>
      <P>Group IV materials -- such as silicon and diamonds -- are widely
used in making semiconductors. While searching for better substances,
scientists found that group III-V compounds -- being better
electricity conductors than group IV materials -- are more suitable
for semiconductors. However, due to several technical difficulties,
III-V semiconductors still have lower yields than silicon.</P>
      <P>According to the AEC, the new solar energy system can generate a
stable output of one kilowatt, as well as 0.5 degree accuracy in
tracking the sun, which function will be improved to 0.2 degrees in
the coming months.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that
political fighting does not live up to the expectations of the
people.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks amid reports that the opposition is
mulling whether to recall President Chen Shui-bian or propose a
no-confidence motion to topple the Cabinet in the wake of a string of
corruption allegations implicating close aides of Chen and his
son-in-law.</P>
      <P>As the opposition People First Party (PFP) planned to stage a
protest in front of the Presidential Office later in the day to call
for the president to step down to take responsibility for the series
of scandals, Su said that everyone has the freedom of assembly and
expression in a democratic society.</P>
      <P>But no acts should go beyond the legal boundary or affect social
stability, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su, generally considered to be one of the best bets for the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to run in the 2008
presidential election, said his administration hopes to serve the
people, which he said is also the "greatest expectation of the
public."</P>
      <P>After Chen's announcement that he would delegate his power, the
administration has been entrusted with a bigger task, Su said, adding
that now is not the time to think about the 2008 presidential
election or about who will succeed Chen, but "to get down to work." </P>
      <P>In response to calls from the opposition for his resignation,
Chen announced Wednesday that he would play his role as head of state
strictly in line with the Constitution, giving Su "free rein" to lead
the Cabinet. Chen also said that he would quit meddling in DPP
affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PREMIER MIGHT RUN IN TAIPEI MAYORAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh has begun to
think about the possibility of throwing his hat into the ring for the
year-end Taipei mayoral election, a lawmaker close to him said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Shih-chien of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) also said that he thinks the chances of Hsieh's running
are high.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP has targeted Hsieh from the beginning as the
party's ideal candidate for the Taipei election, Hsieh has repeatedly
said that he has no intention of running. The party has ended up in
an embarrassing state with no candidate yet, as no one came forward
to register in the party primary in late May.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that when he called on Hsieh May 29, Hsieh asked him
about his views on joining the Taipei mayoral election and he felt
that Hsieh's insistence on not running had softened.</P>
      <P>Wang said Hsieh has a great attachment to the DPP, noting that he
took part in the drafting of its name and platform when it was
founded in 1986.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the slipping approval rating for the DPP
because of a spate of corruption allegations revolving around
President Chen Shui-bian's close aides and son-in-law, running in the
Taipei mayoral election will not be favorable for Hsieh, Wang
claimed.</P>
      <P>But it will be positive for the DPP and the party will be able to
keep its seats in the city councilor elections, according to Wang.
Also, whether elected or not, Hsieh will probably be shut out of the
2008 presidential election, he added. </P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun echoed Wang's view, saying that Hsieh's
participation will greatly boost the morale of the party, as Hsieh
has a broad base of support among the grassroots supporters.</P>
      <P>Saying that Hsieh has often taken on the most daunting tasks at
the party's most difficult times, Yu expressed his admiration.</P>
      <P>He also lauded Hsieh's "Kaohsiung experience, " which he claimed
would contribute a great deal to Taipei's development.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hsieh left a legacy of achievements during his six
years as Kaohsiung mayor, including the dredging of the Love river,
"neat and clean streets" and cleaning the city's drinking water.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Taipei's development has been "very limited" over
the past eight years since President Chen stepped down as Taipei
mayor in 1998, adding that if Hsieh could serve as Taipei mayor, he
would not only save the floundering party but would also make the
city "on par with other metropolises."</P>

      <P>Sixty-eight percent of new graduates in

lack of part-time work or internship experience, according to the

      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC)
confirmed Taiwan's first case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) Saturday
and urged travelers to the southern part of the country to avoid
being bitten by mosquitoes.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi said there have been an average
of around 30 JE cases annually during the past five years and he
estimated that the number of JE patients this year will be similar to
that of last year.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the JE incubation period is roughly between five
and 15 days, but that it is not contagious. The mosquitoes contract
the virus by biting pigs and carry it until they die.</P>
      <P>Recent tallies compiled by the CDC show that over half of the
pigs they tested carried JE virus, and the subsequent confirmation of
the first JE case indicates that the country has entered JE season,

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Saturday that the legislative caucuses of the KMT and
its allies will decide the time and the method of President Chen
Shui-bian's removal from office.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a rally calling for Chen's resignation
that was sponsored by the People First Party (PFP) , an ally of the
KMT, in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Upon hearing his words, PFP Chairman James Soong urged an
"immediate" proposal of a recall motion of Chen at the legislature in
the wake of a spate of corruption allegations revolving around his
close aides and son-in-law.</P>
      <P>Ma, who earlier attended a plenary meeting of the KMT's Central
Standing Committee, noted that Chen said Wednesday that he would
restrain his family members, engage in reforms, and delegate power to
Premier Su Tseng-chang.
</P>
      <P>The president is hoping that his "power sharing" will write off
all the alleged wrongdoings by people around him, Ma said,
questioning if Chen has any shred of remorse.</P>
      <P>He also said the plenary session reached a consensus with its
only goal to remove Chen.</P>
      <P>It could be a recall of the president, a no-confidence motion to
topple the Cabinet or any other form, because "the people can no
longer put up with President Chen," Ma said.</P>
      <P>To push for the goal, the legislative caucuses of the KMT will
work closely with the caucuses of the PFP, New Party and Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union to map out "the most effective and feasible
approach."</P>
      <P>Chen has lost the trust and respect of the people, Ma claimed,
adding that if he tries to cling to power and get the DPP to solidify
his floundering leadership, he will be making an even bigger mistake.</P>
      <P>"President Chen, your days are numbered and your opportunities
are fast slipping away," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said the party will first promote the recall and no-confidence
motion in the legislature, saying that the party has collected more
than a quarter of the signatures needed to establish a valid recall
motion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the earlier plenary session of the KMT, legislators
proposed a recall of the president and the toppling of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>In addition, KMT Central Standing Committee member Lien
Sheng-wen, son of honorary KMT Chairman Lien Chan, proposed a
"Million people stand up" campaign.</P>

      <P>The opposition should refrain from "blowing
out of proportion" criminal allegations that are still under
investigation, a Presidential Office spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the Presidential Office's Public
Affairs Department, made the call after main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou threatened earlier in the day to initiate
a vote of no-confidence in the legislature against President Chen
Shui-bian's Cabinet over an insider trading allegation implicating
his son-in-law.</P>
      <P>Lee's call also coincided with a mass rally organized by the
KMT's "pan-blue alliance" ally -- the People First Party -- in front
of the Presidential Office pushing Chen to step down to take
responsibility for a rash of corruption scandals allegedly involving
his family and closest aides.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is now a democratic society, Lee said the
opposition should respect basic democratic principles. He said Chen
has on many occasions reaffirmed his support for a proseuctorial
inquiry into his son-in-law's alleged role in the Taiwan Development
Corp. stock insider trading scandal and his willingness to respect a
final judicial ruling on the case.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee said, Chen has announced that he will no longer
exercise power beyond what the Constitution specifically confers on
him and will hand over policy-making and Cabinet-appointment
authority to Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Chen himself has not been implicated in any case
of alleged wrongdoing, Lee said the opposition should show reason and
rationality and refrain from "overblowing" suspected criminal
allegations into a political crisis. "Doing so will only come at a
heavy social cost and do no good for social stability, " he added.</P>

      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
caucus whip urged parties across the political spectrum Saturday to
end the turmoil over recent corruption allegations in which President
Chen Shui-bian's close aides and family members are suspected of
involvement.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Chen Chin-jun said that society will be chaotic
if the opposition "pan-blue alliance" demands Chen's resignation
simply for his son-in-law's alleged involvement in an insider trading
scandal.</P>
      <P>He said there are "many more important things to deal with" at
the Legislative Yuan, such as more than NT$2 trillion worth of budget
bills pending legislative approval, which could help boost the

    <HEADLINE>DPP MEETING HOLDS KEY TO FORMER PREMIER'S RUNNING IN TAIPEI MAYORSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A meeting of a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) team on campaign strategy in the year-end
elections next Wednesday will hold the key to whether
former Premier Frank Hsieh will run in the Taipei mayoral
election, DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ker made the remarks after legislators sent out conflicting
messages about Hsieh's joining the race.
</P>
      <P>Although the DPP has targeted Hsieh from the beginning as the
party's ideal candidate for the Taipei election, Hsieh has repeatedly
said that he has no intention of running. The party has ended up in
an embarrassing state with no candidate yet, as no one came forward
to register in the party primary in late May.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP aspirants for Taipei city councilor elections 
said that Hsieh has lost the opportunity to "touch the
heart of the people " by refusing to express his attitude clearly.</P>
      <P>They also questioned if Hsieh, if he announces his bid, will only
be reluctantly agreeing to throw his hat into the ring because he
wants to jockey for a post in the runup to the 2008 presidential
election in the wake of President Chen Shui-bian's announcement
Wednesday that he was "delegating his power" to Premier Su
Tseng-chang, giving the latter a free rein in administrative work
instead of being a mere executive director to the president as in the
past.</P>
      <P>The city councilor aspirants, including Wu Shih-yao, Lee
Ching-feng and Lee Wei-ming, expressed their dissatisfaction over the
lack of coordination ability of the party.</P>
      <P>They said they were disappointed that DPP heavyweights, including
Su, Hsien, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Vice President Annette Lu,
have eyes only for the presidential election in 2008 and have no time
or energy for the year-end mayoral and city councilor elections.</P>
      <P>They said they will no longer wait for a decision from a DPP
candidate and will decide themselves upon a "simulated mayor" that
they can use to confront Hau Lung-bin, candidate of the opposition
Kuomintang for the year-end mayoral election, on issues concerning
city development.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's decision to hand
over control of the Executive Yuan to Premier Su Tseng-chang is
constitutional and doesn't violate any legal provisions, government
spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng was responding to questions about the constitutionality of
Chen's recent delegation of policy-making and cabinet-appointment
authority to Su in the wake of a rash of corruption allegations
implicating his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>"Some critics claim that the president's move was in violation of
the Constitution. Their criticism mainly results from their
misunderstanding of our constitutional provisions," Cheng contended.</P>
      <P>Quoting the Council of Grand Justices Interpretation No. 520,
Cheng said the president is eligible to materialize his policy
initiatives by naming a premier to carry out them. Against this
backdrop, he said, the president can delegate more powers to the
premier out of his trust in the latter.</P>
      <P>"The power delegation doesn't involve any change to our existing
constitutional framework and its constitutionality is beyond
question," Cheng insisted.</P>
      <P>While Su is appointed by the president, he is also held
responsible to the legislature, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Quoting Premier Su, Cheng said the government must function
continuously and effectively to maintain social stability and ensure
economic prosperity and peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Cheng's issued the statement after main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said his party will study either to
launch a motion to recall Chen or a vote of no confidence against the
Cabinet if Chen fails to resign to take responsibility for the string
of corruption scandals allegedly involving his family and
administration.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a mass rally in front of the Presidential
Office earlier in the day calling for Chen's resignation. The rally
was organized by the KMT's "pan-blue" ally -- the People First Party.</P>
      <P>In response, Cheng said either a presidential recall or a
no-confidence vote against the Cabinet will cause social unrest and
take toll on national development.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is now a mature democracy. Everybody has right to
assembly and speech freedoms. All judicial cases should be handled in
accordance with due process of law. Opposition parties should refrain
from politicizing them. Any drastic move would let down the people
and run against public expectations," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen has on many occasions reaffirmed his support
for a full proseuctorial inquiry into his son-in-law's alleged role
in an insider trading scandal, Cheng said opposition parties should
not "overblow" the case into a political crisis or abuse it as an
excuse for political dogfight.</P>
      <P>Touching on a U.S. State Department statement that the U.S.
government has confidence that "Taiwan's democratic society is strong
and secure" and that its policy on Taiwan-U.S. relations remains
unchanged, Cheng said the government appreciates U.S. faith in
Taiwan's democratic strength.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that all sectors of our society will cooperate to
safeguard our hard-won young democracy and let politics be politics
and judiciary be judiciary, " Cheng said, adding that he hopes
opposition parties can refrain from blowing out of proportion
criminal allegations that are still under probes.</P>
      <P>The U.S. statement further said the United States has interest in
stability across the Taiwan Strait and would like to see Taiwan's

Initial Response to Marine Raid Draws Scrutiny

Marine commanders in Iraq learned within two
days of the killings in Haditha last November
that Iraqi civilians had died from gunfire, not
a roadside bomb as initially reported, but the
officers involved saw no reason to investigate
further, according to a senior Marine officer.
The handling of the matter by the senior 
Marine commanders in Haditha, and whether 
officers and enlisted personnel tried to cover up
what happened or missed signs suggesting that the
civilian killings were not accidental, has become
a major element of the investigation by an Army 
general into the entire episode. Officials have 
said that the investigation, while not yet
complete, is likely to conclude that a small
group of marines carried out the unprovoked
killings of two dozen civilians in the hours
after a makeshift bomb killed a marine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An Indonesian municipal official has
requested Taiwan to assist in rebuilding schools reduced into rubble
in a devastating earthquake that hit his city in the central
Indonesian island of Java May 27.</P>
      <P>Yogyakarta City Mayor H. Herry Zudianto made the request Saturday
when Taiwan Representative to Indonesia Lin Yung-lo and
representatives from the Taipei-based Buddhist charity -- the Dharma
Drum Mountain Culture and Eduction Foundation -- visited the
Yogyakarta city government.</P>
      <P>The mayor said nearly 200 elementary and high schools in his city
were either completely destroyed or seriously damaged. It is hoped
that Taiwan can assist in rebuilding some of those schools and
constructing cultural and education centers to facilitate public
education, he said.</P>
      <P>The Dharma Drum Mountain representatives said they will decide
how to help Yogyakarta rebuild its education facilities after making
a careful evaluation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's government authorities have purchased 25 tons
of rice to be distributed to earthquake victims in the Yogyakarta
area -- the ground zero of the 6.3 magnitude temblor that left more
than 5,000 people dead and thousands of others homeless.</P>
      <P>The Dharma Drum Mountain also donated 5 tons of rice to
Indonesian authorities Saturday for distribution to residents in
Bantul, the hardest-hit zone.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government sent a 26-member first-aid team, composed
of well-trained rescuers and medical professionals, to help with
post-disaster relief work last Sunday. The team was the first foreign
rescue team to reach Bantul. The team took with it a large amount of
relief goods and medical supplies. Taiwan authorities have also
pledged to donate US$100,000 in quake relief fund to Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Several other Taiwan charities, including World Vision Taiwan and
Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, have also launched
fund-raising campaign or sent volunteers to help with rehabilitation

should beware of in the three stages of his life. In youth, when the
constitution of his body is not yet formed, he should beware of lust.
In manhood, when his physical powers are in full vigor, he should
beware of strife. In old age, when the physical powers are in decay,
he should beware of greed."</TEXT>

      <P>Portable Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC)
that can continuously supply power to a Digital Video Disc (DVD)
player for eight hours were introduced here by researchers at the
Atomic Energy Council (AEC) Sunday.</P>
      <P>The researcher said a new version half the size of the current
DMFC and suitable for laptop computers will be unveiled by mid-June.</P>
      <P>Using methanol as a power supply has become a new global trend.
Generating power through reactions between methanol and air, the
byproducts are pure water and half the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2)

      <P>A local research team in the central city of
Taichung released Sunday its newly made solar power system "Chang

      <P>The head of the team, Wu I-lung, said that current solar power
systems can only convert light to energy, while heat is left unused.
He said, however, the new system is able to react both to heat and
light, and therefore to generate more power than conventional
systems.</P>
      <P>Wu said the name "Chang Tien" in Chinese means "ever-lasting
solar energy," a reference to the system's new feature.</P>
      <P>Wu noted the new system not only applies to low-voltage everyday

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
said Sunday that the opposition's attempts to recall the president
are not justified because the president has not been implicated in
any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen said the president was elected by the people of this
country in accordance with the Constitution and that the president
cannot be ousted if he is innocent of wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen called for opposition politicians not to destabilize
Taiwan because of their own political agenda or electoral rancor.</P>
      <P>"The public won't buy it," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the top presidential aide said he "didn't have the
slightest idea" about Chen's intentions regarding media speculation
that a coalition government may be formed by parliamentary majority
after the president pledged last Wednesday to cede some of his
executive power to Premier Su Tseng-chang in the wake of recent
corruption scandals involving senior officials and members of the
first family.</P>
      <P>A local daily quoted an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) source as
reporting Sunday that President Chen was not opposed to the formation
of a coalition government as suggested by Legislature Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, and has "even started thinking about it seriously."</P>
      <P>The daily also reported that some people have recommended to Chen
that he consider inviting KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to lead a
coalition government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative
caucus whip Chen Ching-chun said so far he "hasn't heard a single
word" about President Chen "starting to think about a coalition
government being formed by parliamentary majority."</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun shrugged off the speculation, saying DPP
legislators will not "dance to the tune" of the opposition or
groundless media reports.</P>
      <P>For his part, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday the public
has reasons and the justification for either recalling the president
or toppling the Cabinet, given that recent corruption scandals have
aroused widespread public anger and the president has not shown any
sign of remorse.</P>
      <P>Ma said systematic and well-designed methods must be followed
when the opposition launches either of these two approaches, which he
said will be "unavoidably costly" in terms of social stability.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Allowing the majority party in the
legislature to form a Cabinet is not in accordance with the spirit of
the Republic of China Constitution, a senior aide to President Chen
Shui-bian said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general to the president, was
commenting on opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's
remarks that the Constitution allows the majority party to form the
Cabinet although this has not been the case over the past six years.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has never been the majority party in the Legislative Yuan since
Chen was first elected in 2000.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in response to a newspaper report that the
president was "starting to seriously consider" Legislative Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng's suggestion that he invite a majority party to form
the Cabinet in order to overcome a political gridlock in the coming
two years.</P>
      <P>Cho said it was the former KMT administration which in previous
amendments of the Constitution had stripped the legislature of its
right of consent on the premier's appointment, thereby depriving the
Constitution of "the spirit of allowing the majority party in the
legislature to form the Cabinet."</P>
      <P>It is unrealistic for opposition parties to now try to "discuss
basic constitutional principles without seeking to explain why, when
they led the campaign to amendment the Constitution, they had taken
away the legislature's right of consent on the premier's
appointment," Cho said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that taking away the legislature's right to approve
the appointment of the premier "was not an initiative of the DPP, "
which came into power in 2000 and won re-election in 2004.</P>
      <P>Cho continued that theoretically speaking, in a country that
adopts the Cabinet system of government, a majority party in
parliament forming the Cabinet is quite normal, but "it is very clear
that it is simply not in the spirit of our Constitution to allow a
majority party to form a Cabinet."</P>
      <P>He added that he has never heard of President Chen Shui-bian
talking about allowing a majority party to form a Cabinet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN VAGUE ON RUMORS OF NEW CABINET FORMULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
refused to be pinned down Sunday on whether he would serve as premier
if President Chen Shui-bian agreed to allow the legislative majority
to form the Cabinet in the event the current Cabinet is toppled by a
no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>Ma gave no concrete answers on the subject when asked by
reporters prior to a meeting of the KMT's Central Advisory Committee,
after news reports alleged that Chen is "seriously" considering
allowing the Cabinet to be formed by the majority in the Legislative
Yuan should the current Cabinet led by Premier Su Tseng-chang be
toppled by the "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Stating that the Constitution allows the majority in the
Legislative Yuan to form the Cabinet, Ma said that Chen had failed to
adopt the practice over the past six years.</P>
      <P>"For the time being, I am unable to respond to hypothetical
cases," he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman also neglected to make it clear whether he would
join a protest at the Presidential Office Saturday organized by the
party's pan-blue alliance partner, the People First Party (PFP) --
the second of its kind after last weekend's -- to ask Chen to step
down amid several high-profile corruption scandals involving his
close aides and members of the first family.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight, opined
that it would help stabilize the political situation if the
legislative majority could form the Cabinet in line with the spirit
of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>However, Wang did not say whether he supported either launching a
motion to recall Chen or a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet
-- an issue upon which the KMT and PFP remain divided.</P>
      <P>Amid strong pressure to step down to assume responsibility for
scandals embroiling his administration, Chen pledged earlier last
week to cede any power to Su that is not expressly defined in the
Constitution as the role of the executive.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, PPF legislative caucus whip Lee Hung-chun expressed
fierce opposition to the idea of the pan-blue alliance forming a
Cabinet at present.</P>
      <P>"We want the corrupt and incompetent Chen to step down, not to
'split the loot' with the opposition," he stressed.</P>
      <P>If the pan-blue alliance caves in and accepts the proposal to
form a Cabinet, Chen would still remain in the presidency --
something which Lee said is against the public's expectations to
remove Chen.</P>
      <P>"Now is not a good time for the pan-blue alliance to set up a
Cabinet, and the PFP will never bow to private partisan gains despite
Chen's intention to lure opposition parties with political
interests, " he said, pointing out that "the PFP will not stop its
protests in the streets until Chen steps down."</P>
      <P>"The present goal of the PFP is to boot out Chen from presidency,
regardless of whether it's by resorting to a presidential recall
motion or forcing him to resign," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers accused Chen of plotting to slander the
pan-blue alliance by saying that he is mulling the possibility of
allowing Ma to form a Cabinet.</P>
      <P>If Chen is sincere in his promise to serve the nation strictly in
line with the Constitution, he should invite leaders of all parties
to discuss the formation of a coalition government instead of making
backroom deals, KMT Legislator Lai Shyi-bao said.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Chen Jie and Tsai Ching-lung said
that it is "unbelievable" that Chen would ask Ma to form a Cabinet at
a time when the pan-blue alliance is trying to recall Chen or topple
Su.</P>
      <P>They described media reports about Ma forming a Cabinet as Chen's
scheme to "drag out" the situation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou urged China Sunday not to be afraid of pursuing democratic
reform, claiming Taiwan's experience shows it would not affect
China's economic development.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar held at National Taiwan Normal University
marking the 17th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre, Ma admitted
that Beijing was "not very happy" with his participating in such
functions every year.</P>
      <P>In response to media queries as to whether he felt a little
hesitant about joining such activities, he said he hadn't the
slightest compunction.</P>
      <P>"I am just trying to share my experience in handling the Feb. 28,
1946 tragedy, and not trying to use the opportunity to sabotage
China," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that in Taiwan, it took 40 years to rehabilitate and
comfort victims and bereaved families of the Feb. 28 tragedy. As
China is equipped with better information technology than the Taiwan
of 1947, "I believe China's rehabilitation of the June 4 Incident
will be faster than Taiwan's [of the Feb. 28 tragedy]," he said.</P>
      <P>Citing the Taiwan experience, Ma said political reform will not
affect China's economic development. On the contrary, it would help
people vent their anger and frustration, "so China should not be
afraid of pursuing democratic reform," he added.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's growing economic dependence on its neighbor, Ma said
China's economy has grown at an unprecedented pace following the 1989
Tiananmen Square tragedy.</P>
      <P>"For Taiwan, China is both an opportunity and a threat in that it
is targeting missiles at Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-shui, a Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker, said
corruption in China is more serious now than when the June 4 Massacre
occurred.</P>
      <P>"Though Taiwan's democracy is not very successful, it is after
all a democracy, " Lin said, adding that as a fellow ethnic Chinese,
he hopes China will develop into a democracy, a development which he
said would be "a blessing" to people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

      <P>The issue of "substandard qulity foods"
is considered the most worrisome public health problem in Taiwan, the
Taipei Medical University (TMU) found in its latest opinion poll, the
results of which were publicized Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the survey, 33 percent of respondents said "substandard qulity
foods," originating mostly from China or elsewhere outside of Taiwan,
pose the greatest threat to Taiwanese people's health.</P>
      <P>A total of 32.4 percent of respondents said "how to lead a
healthy life" is the most important issue for them, according to
Prof. Han Po-cheng of the TMU's Department of Public Health.</P>
      <P>The university conducted the survey by telephone in mid-May,

      <P>Only 12.3 percent of those surveyed identified "avian flu" as the
most critical issue in Taiwan's public health, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42.6 percent consider many news reports or TV talk

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government Information Office chief Cheng
Wen-tsan urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance" Sunday to stop
political maneuvering aimed at recalling President Chen Shui-bian or
toppling the Cabinet, and to instead work toward maintaining social
stability.</P>
      <P>Cheng also denied knowledge of a media report that Chen is
gauging the possibility of allowing the majority in the Legislative
Yuan to form a Cabinet at a time when the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) are poised to recall Chen or topple Premier
Su Tseng-chang as head of the Cabinet, amid a string of high-profile
corruption scandals embroiling Chen's family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the corruption cases are judicial matters, Cheng
said that "politicized maneuvering" will by no means help stabilize
the situation and that "a paralyzed government will only fuel
confrontation and instability in society."</P>
      <P>Both ruling and opposition camps should respond to the public's
demands, he said, adding the most pressing task at present is to hold
an extraordinary legislative session and to pass as quickly as
possible several key budgets pending in the legislature, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan session ended dramatically May 30 after a
final session of scuffling and clashes erupted between pan-blue
lawmakers and "pan-green" lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers Cheng Yun-peng and Hsiao Bi-khim contended that
conditions are "not yet ripe" for the pan-blue alliance to form a
Cabinet, arguing the most critical objective is to maintain
political, economic and social stability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the TSU described as "impossible" rumors that Chen is
"starting to seriously consider" the possibility of allowing the
pan-blue alliance -- which controls a slight majority in the
Legislative Yuan -- to form a Cabinet.</P>
      <P>According to two of the TSU's three legislative caucus whips,
David Huang and Lo Chih-ming, a Cabinet formed by the pan-blue
alliance would not only fail to safeguard Taiwan but instead "pave
the way" toward Taiwan's unification with China.</P>
      <P>Wrongdoing by the president's son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, who
was taken into custody by the Taipei Prosecutor's Office late last
month for his suspected role in an insider trading, has nothing to do
with Chen or Su, and the pan-blue camp must not use Chao as a
political weapon to fight against Chen, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Lo warned the DPP of fiercer political infighting should Chen
replace Su, saying that the DPP's powerful New Tide faction, which
maintains close ties with Su, would fight back.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With hot money pouring into the market,
parking spaces, executive suites and stores have all become the most
popular investment targets in Taiwan, while residences still remain
high on the list, a real estate agent said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien, General Manager of H&amp;B Realty, said the demand for
real estate varies from region to region, with parking lots a welcome
investment in the north, executive suites in the central region and
stores in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The price of real estate and maintenance costs in metropolitan
Taipei are higher, and there aren't too many residence units on the
selling block, Lin said.</P>
      <P>She said 6- to 8-percent returns are possible for those who
invest in parking lots in a good location, since parking spaces
require little maintenance.</P>
      <P>For the central Taiwan area, Lin said executive suites are an
excellent choice as long as they are in good condition and equipped
with broadband Internet access.</P>
      <P>H&amp;B Realty pointed out that the neighborhoods of Tunghai
University and Feng Chia University are the best areas for rented
suites, adding the suites would have a 10-percent investment return
if they are well managed.</P>
      <P>Stores would be the best investment choice in the Kaohsiung area,
where the population is only half of Taipei's and where lifestyles
and investment habits are quite different from the capital city.</P>
      <P>Given the general public's expectations about the post-2008
political climate and the long-held belief that real estate best
maintains its investment value, more and more people in Taiwan would
like to invest in it, Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, Lin advised potential investors to carefully pick their
investment targets and manage their finances, and avoid for example
borrowing too much from banks to purchase property that carries high
interest rates on the mortgage.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a
wise and good man holds in awe. He holds in awe the Laws of God,
persons in authority, and the words of wisdom of holy men. A fool, on
the other hand, does not know that there are Laws of God; he,
therefore, has no reverence for them; he is disrespectful to persons
in authority, and condemns the words of wisdom of holy men."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Monday called
for a meeting of leaders from across Taiwan's political spectrum at
this crucial juncture when Taiwan is facing an increasingly difficult
situation in the international arena and turbulent politics at home.</P>
      <P>Lu said that with President Chen Shui-bian's consent, she invited
legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng Monday to collaborate with her to
arrange an unprecedented meeting of President Chen, herself, Wang,
the presidents of the Executive Yuan, Judicial Yuan and Examination
Yuan, as well as leaders of the five major political parties to
jointly tackle challenges and disputes facing Taiwan "with wisdom and
in a rational and responsible manner."</P>
      <P>Lu made the call after she delivered a keynote speech at the 2006
Taiwan-U.S. Technology and Industry Summit Forum, which opened in
Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>In the face of partisan rancor and growing pressure from the
opposition, which held a rally over the weekend to demand that Chen
step down a week after the detention of his son-in-law following
allegations of insider trading by an opposition legislator, Lu called
for all parties concerned to demonstrate rationality and observe the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Chen has already met with opposition People
First Party Chairman James Soong and with Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou in the past, Lu said there is no reason why such meetings
cannot be expanded in scope to include other top leaders in order to
"allow for a more resourceful meeting."</P>
      <P>Lu appealed to all parties concerned to support the proposed
meeting, noting that there are many major issues that urgently need
to be tackled and that the whole country is eagerly expecting that
the current volatile domestic situation will be stabilized soon.</P>
      <P>The subject of Chen's son-in-law's alleged involvement in insider
trading as well as a series of suspected corruption scandals
involving top officials in the president's administration have

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh is planning to
file a defamation lawsuit against former Legislator Lin Ruey-tu,
former Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao said Monday.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Hsieh and accompanied by lawyer Chuang Ruey-hsiung,
Yao held a press conference to clarify several accusations made by
Lin against Hsieh, who expressed the hope that his filing of the
lawsuit will help curb the growing tendency of people to slander
others.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) Chairman Su
Teh-chien had given NT$3 million to then Premier Hsieh's relatives to
try to solicit Hsieh's influence to help in Su's bid for the
chairmanship of the company.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hsieh and his relatives have no financial relations
with Su, Chuang said Lin's accusations were unfounded.</P>
      <P>Lin also accused Hsieh of illegally helping Yu Shih-yi, general
manager of Kuan-Pin Co., make profits in some land acquisition
projects when he was serving as Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>However, Chuang noted that such land acquisition projects did not
have to be passed through Hsieh, saying that Lin's accusations
defamed Hsieh's reputation.</P>
      <P>Yao urged the public not to use double standards in judging
different politicians, noting that he didn't see anybody doubt Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's credibility after he attended several
high-profile banquets held by Fubon Commercial Bank and decided
afterward to sell Taipei Bank to Fubon.</P>
      <P>As Ma also owned Fubon Commercial Bank stocks, Yao said Ma's case
is more complicated than Hsieh's, expressing wonder as to why no one
paid any attention to Ma's case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FACES 4TH CRISIS SINCE 1979: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  May 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu warned Monday that
Taiwan is facing a major crisis as a result of long-time political
confrontation and the exposure of a series of corruption scandals
over the past six months, which she said has scared away foreign
investors.</P>
      <P>Lu described the crisis as "the fourth of its kind" since the
severance of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and the United
States in 1979, the Kaohsiung Incident that occurring at the same
time, and the weeks of political turmoil that erupted after the March
20, 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while addressing a Taiwan-U.S. technology
industry summit.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Lu said, the ruling and opposition parties need to
cooperate to overcome three challenges -- building a clean
government, upholding judicial justice and independence and the rule
of law, and protecting the country's democratic system.</P>
      <P>Lu claimed that compared with the past, when a lot of corrupt
officials were not brought to justice, the country's judicial system
is fairer now that officials allegedly involved in the scandals are
under investigation and facing possible indictment.</P>
      <P>She urged people who make allegations against others to back up
their allegations with evidence and avoid jumping to conclusion
before any conviction is handed down by the court.</P>
      <P>Suggesting that the ruling and opposition parties seek to resolve
their differences under the constitutional framework, Lu called on
the leaders of the five major political parties to accept her
invitation to a meeting with the heads of the five government
branches to try to find solutions to the problems facing the country.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed hope that the ruling and opposition parties will
drop their struggle and put their heads together rationally and
responsibly to hammer out what she described as "a blue ocean
strategy" for the country's future development. SHe did not
elaborate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO HELP APEC MEMBER COUNTRIES DEVELOP SIGNATURE INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to collaborate with
Thailand to help Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
member countries develop industries with "local features" based on
the framework of an APEC digital opportunity center (ADOC) initiated
by Taiwan, Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san said Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the ADOC framework, Hwang said, an information and product
exhibition platform will be established and summit meetings,
market-oriented forums and Web site expositions, as well as training
seminars, will be held to help create jobs in remote areas and narrow
the digital gap and the gap between the rich and poor in APEC member
countries.</P>
      <P>Hwang made the announcement in an address delivered at the 2006
Taipei Summit -- a summit among high-technology research institutes
and businesses from Taiwan and 10 Southeast Asian countries -- which
opened in Taipei Monday with over 200 officials and industrial
heavyweights from home and abroad participating.</P>
      <P>Hwang welcomed the delegates to the summit, saying that the
two-day meeting will serve as a platform where the participants can
exchange opinions on the investment environment for the information,
communications and technology (ICT) industries, probe new, innovative
technologies and discuss new formulas for cross-border cooperation.</P>
      <P>He said it is hoped that via the summit, Taiwan -- the world's
No. 1 producer or provider of 10 high-technology products and
technologies, including notebook PCs, LCD monitors, modems and
semiconductor OEM production -- and the Southeast Asian countries
that have strived to develop ICT industries in the recent decade,
will cooperate further to create a mutually beneficial economic and
trade environments for all.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, Taiwan, taking advantage of its strong ICT
industries, proposed at a 2003 APEC meeting the establishment of the
ADOC aimed at helping APEC member countries transform "digital gaps"
into "digital opportunities."</P>
      <P>Another advocacy of the "one village, one product" (OVOP)
program, designed to help rural areas develop their own signature
products with local features, was also promoted at the 2003 APEC
meeting, and was highly valued by APEC delegates from Japan,
Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Based on that concept, Hwang added, Taiwan is working to
cooperate with Thailand to help APEC member countries develop their
own industries with local features using Taiwan's development
experience of the ICT industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'JUST WAIT AND SEE MY FEROCIOUS SIDE': KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou refused to be branded as "too soft" toward scandal-plagued
President Chen Shui-bian Monday and challenged those who have such an
impression of him to "just wait and see" his "ferocious side."</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as Taipei mayor, made the remarks while
fielding questions at the Taipei city council.</P>
      <P>City Councilwoman Li-Keng Kui-fang asked Ma to explain his
positions on two separate proposals to dismiss the Cabinet and recall
the president, who is dogged by a series of corruption scandals
involving his senior aides and family members.</P>
      <P>Li-Keng urged Ma to "harden up" and not "fall into the
president's trap" by accepting his concession of allowing the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party,
which enjoys a slight majority in the legislature, to form the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>In reply, Ma said that although he did not know the origin of the
reports that the president is considering letting the majority party
in the legislature form the Cabinet, he was sure the proposal was
apparently intended to shift attention from the crisis faced by the
president.</P>
      <P>"I'm not so stupid as to dance to their tune, " he said, adding
that the most important thing at present is to get to the bottom of
all the corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Ma said the proposal to allow the majority party in the
legislature to form the Cabinet would cause a disturbance in the
opposition parties and attract the nation's attention by creating a
new political struggle.</P>
      <P>Chen's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has never been the
majority party in the Legislative Yuan since he was first elected in
2000.</P>
      <P>News reports Sunday said the president was "starting to seriously
consider" Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's suggestion that he
invite a majority party to form the Cabinet in order to overcome a
political gridlock in the remaining two years of his second term.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman was criticized by members of his own party for
his reluctance to support a motion to recall the president, saying it
was "not time yet to pull the trigger." Under mounting pressure, he
suggested that a motion to dismiss the Cabinet would appear more
feasible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TO MEET WITH TAIEX CHAIRMAN OVER PLANNED DEPARTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang confirmed Monday that
Taiwan Stock Exchange (TAIEX) Chairman Wu Nai-jen has told him that
he plans to leave his post and said he will talk with Wu about the
matter.</P>
      <P>Su was responding to reports that Wu, a heavyweight of the
powerful New Tide faction within the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), will quit next month.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said Su will only
consider if an individual is suitable for a post and will not take
into account the individual's political or factional background.</P>
      <P>Wu's planned departure came after President Chen Shui-bian
announced last Wednesday that he would give Su free rein in setting
the policy of his administration, inadvertently triggering misgivings
among the various DPP factions.</P>
      <P>Wu said that other DPP factions claim that the New Tide benefits
most from its close association with Su and that members of the
faction have too many key posts.</P>
      <P>But Wu said that only two New Tide members -- himself and Chiou
I-jen, secretary-general of the National Security Council -- have
taken the more conspicuous posts. "If Chiou asks my views, I'll
advise him to leave too, which will be good for everyone." Chiou is
also a New Tide heavyweight. Wu said he is also considering asking all
New Tide members to leave their government posts.</P>
      <P>DPP legislators had mixed reactions about Wu's planned departure.</P>
      <P>New Tide Legislator William Lai had a positive reaction, saying
that Wu is leaving because he wants to assuage the misgivings of the
other party factions.</P>
      <P>Another New Tide Legislator Lin Cho-shui said that since the DPP
became the ruling party in 2000, members of the New Tide have never
served as the heads of any of the five yuans, Lin said.</P>
      <P>As calls mount for a recall of the president or a no-confidence
motion to topple the Cabinet, the DPP should think about the problems
the party will face in the 2007 legislative elections and 2008
presidential election, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin dismissed reports that Su is forming a partnership with the
New Tide, saying that several sitting ministers are associated with
the Welfare State faction, of which former Premier Frank Hsieh is a
heavyweight. "It is better to say that Su and Hsieh are forming a
partnership," Lin added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Gao Ji-peng of the Justice Alliance faction said that
whether Wu's quitting will help promote party solidarity remains to
be seen. </P>
      <P>Gao said that the New Tide did not have many administrative
posts, but added that "one has to consider the feelings of others."
Furthermore, the rifts between the New Tide and other factions over
the years will also not be easily sorted out, he added.</P>
      <P>Legislator and convener of the Welfare State faction Lee Chun-yi
said that Wu's quitting will mean a retreat of the powerful New Tide
faction from President Chen's coterie.</P>
      <P>The plight of Chen, mired in a series of corruption allegations
involving his close aides and son-in-law, could be exacerbated, which
is also the price the president has to pay for putting a premium on
the New Tide members in the beginning, Lee claimed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
responded coolly Monday to a summit proposal made by Vice President
Annette Lu earlier the same day aimed at redressing the current
political situation.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he had not received Lu's invitation relayed by
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, main opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou expressed reservations about the proposed
summit and predicted that the atmosphere would not be good should the
summit be held now.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while fielding a question from a KMT city
councilwoman during an interpellation session at the Taipei City
Council at a time when the "pan-blue alliance" is poised to recall
President Shui-bian or topple Premier Su Tseng-chang's Cabinet
because of its strong dissatisfaction over a string of corruption
scandals allegedly involving members of Chen's family and his close
aides.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen said that Ma would participate in
the summit and work out ways with Lu to stabilize the political
situation should Chen resign and if Lu would agree to publicly call
on Chen to step down.</P>
      <P>Amid rising public sentiment against corruption, Lu should make
her stance clear to the people, whether or not she supports justice
and fairness, by standing with the people, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang called a news
conference later that day to refute a news report that Soong had
given the nod to Annette Lu's invitation relayed by Wang. Lu
Hsueh-chang said that Soong has not even the slightest interest in
taking part in the summit proposed by the vice president.</P>
      <P>According to the "pan-blue alliance," Chen's resignation would be
the best way to stabilize the current political turmoil and save
social costs.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lu called Monday for a summit to tackle the
current political situation, urging all political leaders to pool
their wisdom to deal with the problems ahead amid the opposition's
efforts to recall Chen or topple Su's Cabinet.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, she and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
will invite Chen, five political party leaders and the presidents of
the four other yuans to take part in the summit in an attempt to find
a means to stabilize the situation in the face of mounting political
chaos.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Lu first mentioned the summit idea to him May
20 and he proposed that she first contact Chen to seek the
president's agreement. Chen has showed willingness to attend the
summit, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Wang said he also asked for opinions from Ma and Soong on the
issue, claiming that Soong said he would consider attending and that
Ma made no response.</P>
      <P>Now that Lu has made the proposal for a second time, Wang said
that he is willing to contact Soong and Ma again to explore their
views on the issue.</P>
      <P>Wang also expressed the hope that the Legislative Yuan can hold
an extra session this summer to deal with several key bills that
remain outstanding after it ended the latest session May 30 in a
dramatically chaotic situation amid confrontation between "pan-blue"
lawmakers and their "pan-green" peers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union over a package of
law amendment proposals on opening direct transport links between
Taiwan and China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition legislators alleged Monday that a
section of the Taiwan high-speed railway in northern Taiwan has
serious cave-in problems and said the government should address the
situation.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chi-chu of the Kuomintang, on the heels of an
allegation she made a week earlier that a cave-in problem exists in
the 30-odd km section between Hsinchu and Miaoli, held a news
conference with Lee Hung-chun of the People First Party to claim that
the Bureau of the High Speed Rail under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) and the Taiwan High Speed
Rail Corp., (THSRC), the builder and operator of the railway, were
lying when they said the railway "has no problems at all."</P>
      <P>Neither legislator offered any evidence to back their allegations
and it remained unclear as to where they got the information upon
which they based their claims.</P>
      <P>They asked for a full cave-in and drilling report to be presented
to the legislators, saying that the MOTC should not use taxpayers
money to endorse a private enterprise that has borrowed heavily from
the government.</P>
      <P>Lee said the THSRC has already completed more than 30
reinforcement jobs on the Hsinchu-Miaoli section and that it still
detected three spots that were extremely soft in March. But the 
Bureau of High Speed Rail said they do not pose a problem.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that the bureau has lied to the public, warning that
the railway could collapse in the event of an earthquake.</P>
      <P>The construction work of the high speed rail must not rely on
"luck, " Lee said, adding that the MOTC has to do its utmost to
monitor the quality of construction.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government's investment in THSRC has exceeded
36 percent of the total investment and that it can only manage seven
seats on the board of directors, one less than the THSRC, which he
said has invited most criticism.</P>
      <P>Lee Chi-chu said that the THSRC has commissioned Sinotech
Engineering Consultant, Ltd. to do the examination, but claimed that
improvements have yet to be made.</P>
      <P>The 345-km high speed rail connecting Taipei and Kaohsiung is 
expected to be inaugurated in October.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC DENIES CONCESSION ON DIRECT LINKS DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) denied a
media reports Monday that it will budge from its previous insistence
on making prior government approval necessary for direct shipping and
flight services across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, MAC Chairman Joseph Wu met with
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) lawmakers
over the weekend to mend their difference over the direct
cross-strait transport link issues.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, lawmakers from the two "pan-blue alliance"
parties were quoted as having said they do not oppose the
installation of a government licensing system after direct
cross-strait transport links are in place, but they insisted that
such a regulation should not be spelled out in the existing Statute
Governing Relations Between the People in the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu reportedly said the MAC is not opposed to such a
proposal. Nevertheless, he added that lawmakers of the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) remain divided over the issue.</P>
      <P>However, the MAC dismissed the reports, denying that Wu has made
any concession or promise to opposition lawmakers on the issue.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the licensing system is an important basis for
effective government management of cross-strait shipping and air
links, the MAC said the media reports of Wu agreeing to the "no
inclusion of the licensing system in the statute" proposal were
not true.</P>
      <P>The ruling and opposition camps have been caught in a dogfight
over the PFP-proposed package of amendments to the cross-strait
statute paving the way for an opening of direct shipping and air
links. The "pan-green camp" blocked the package from being put to a
vote in the "pan-blue alliance"-controlled legislature three times
before this year's first legislative session ended in chaos May 30.</P>
      <P>The MAC said it is willing to further negotiate with parties
across the political spectrum to seek a final solution to the direct
links issue.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Air Masks at Issue in
Claims of 9/11 Illnesses

With mounting evidence that exposure to the toxic smoke and ash
at ground zero during the nine-month cleanup has made many people
sick, attention is now focusing on the role of air- filtering masks,
or respirators, that cost less than US$50 and could have shielded
workers from some of the toxins. More than 150,000 such masks were
distributed and only 40,000 people worked on the pile, but most
workers either did not have the masks or did not use them. These
respirators are now at the center of a federal lawsuit filed on
behalf of more than 8,000 firefighters, police officers and private
workers who say they were exposed to toxic substances at or near
ground zero that have made them sick or may eventually do so. Lawyers
representing the workers say that there was no central distribution
point for the respirators, no single organization responsible for
giving them out, and no one with the power to make sure the
respirators that were distributed got used, and used properly.

As financial markets grow more electronic and international, a

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Monday that both the ruling and opposition parties have agreed to
convene an extra legislative session but had not reached consensus on
topics to be discussed in the proposed session.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has been criticized for lack of efficiency
for failing to pass major bills related to public welfare in the
just-concluded legislative session, which ended in chaos a week
earlier.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, convener of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) legislative caucus, presented a petition endorsed by
88 legislators to Wang asking for an extra legislative session to
discuss eight bills including budgets for flood-prevention projects,
several budget plans for expanding infrastructure construction,
budget plans for state-owned enterprises, an additional NT$6.2
billion in the arms budget and unfreezing some of the central
government's budget.</P>
      <P>Although the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and
the People First Party also agreed to the convening of an extra
legislative session, it has different opinions about the topics that
should be discussed.</P>
      <P>Because of the lack of consensus on the topics to be discussed,
Wang said he will call an informal legislative session to set the

      <P>At the invitation of the Indonesian government, a Taiwan IHA team

      <P>Under the agreement, Taiwan will send a team of seasoned
psychologists to the central Indonesian island of Java, which was hit
by a magnitude-6.3 temblor May 27, taking the lives of more than
6,200 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also help train Indonesian psychologists with
skills and know-how to guide earthquake survivors through overcoming
deep sorrow over losing family members.</P>

billion over the previous month, Central Bank of China (CBC)

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Monday's significant dip in the stock market
is unusual and likely attributable to recent political upheaval
rather than anything related to Taiwan's economic fundamentals, the
nation's top economic planner said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, made the remarks after the weighted price index of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 244.37 points -- or 3.5 percent -- to
close at 6,715.27 Monday, the lowest closing level since April 4.</P>
      <P>"The plunge of the stock index to a two-month low is unrelated to
our economic fundamentals and mostly has to do with domestic
political uncertainty," Hu said, adding that the local economy
remains rosy and robust.</P>
      <P>As of last Friday, Hu said Taiwan share prices had spiked 6.28
percent since the beginning of this year, compared to Hong Kong's
6.97 percent rise, Singapore's 3.07 percent increase and Nasdaq's
0.64 percent. During the same period, Japan's stock index posted 2
percent negative growth and the South Korean stock index also slid
5.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hu said both Taiwan's exports and inbound investment
posted higher-than-expected gains in the first quarter of this year,
prompting the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics to adjust the economic growth target upward to 4.31
percent from the original 4.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Hu lamented that the recent domestic political situation,
however, has affected investor confidence, resulting in Monday's
unusual stock market tumbling.</P>
      <P>Hu was referring to threats from opposition parties to recall
President Chen Shui-bian or topple the Cabinet over recent corruption
allegations implicating Chen's son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Hu said all those allegations have been under judicial
investigation.</P>
      <P>"We need not jump to arbitrary conclusions before judicial
authorities complete investigations and mete out judgments," he
added.</P>
      <P>He also warned that if the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
fails to pass a large amount of critical budget bills in an extra
session during this summer, the nation's economic growth for this
year may fall below the original forecast.</P>

remains uncertain."</P>
      <P>Given the wide gap between the ruling and opposition camps'
preferred lists of topics to be addressed at the extra session, Wang
said a number of variables could affect the results of Thursday's
meeting on whether an extra session will truly be convened.</P>
      <P>On one hand, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) , which controls a slim
majority in the legislature most want the extra session to pass
a PFP-initiated package of amendments to a statute on relations across
the Taiwan Strait paving the way for opening direct cross-strait
transport links and deal with a motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian over corruption allegations against his son-in-law and
aides.</P>
      <P>On the other, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) strongly
opposes those two topics and instead gives priority to four crucial
budget bills that are related to people's livelihoods and sustainable
economic development. The DPP's "pan-green" ally, the Taiwan
solidarity Union, has vowed to exhaust its means to choke the direct
cross-strait links bill on the ground that the passage of the bill
would undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and put nation security at
stake.</P>
      <P>In view of the deep partisan rancor at play, Wang said he is not
sure whether an extra session can really take place or whether any
concrete results can be achieved even if the session is held.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves amounted
to a record high of US$260.93 billion as of the end of May, up US$1.9
billion over the previous month, Central Bank of China (CBC)
officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite remittances made out of Taiwan by foreign investors in
May, the country's foreign exchange reserves continued to increase
because of the appreciation of foreign currencies owned by Taiwan and
interest generated from the reserves, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Securities and Futures Bureau,
the net selling of Taiwan stocks by foreign investors amounted to
NT$31.4 billion (US$981.25 million) in May.</P>
      <P>While the euro rose 2.5 percent against the U.S. dollar in May,
the Japanese yen gained 2.4 percent, and the pound jumped 6 percent,
CBC officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves are third highest in the
world after China and Japan, according to the CBC.</P>
      <P>China's foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$875.1 billion as

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Monday's significant dip in the stock market
is unusual and likely attributable to recent political upheaval
rather than anything related to Taiwan's economic fundamentals, the
nation's top economic planner said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, made the remarks after the weighted price index of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 244.37 points -- or 3.5 percent -- to
close at 6,715.27 Monday, the lowest closing level since April 4.</P>
      <P>"The plunge of the stock index to a two-month low is unrelated to
our economic fundamentals and mostly has to do with domestic
political uncertainty," Hu said, adding that the local economy
remains rosy and robust.</P>
      <P>As of last Friday, Hu said Taiwan share prices had spiked 6.28
percent since the beginning of this year, compared to Hong Kong's
6.97 percent rise, Singapore's 3.07 percent increase and Nasdaq's
0.64 percent. During the same period, Japan's stock index posted 2
percent negative growth and the South Korean stock index also slid
5.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hu said both Taiwan's exports and inbound investment
posted higher-than-expected gains in the first quarter of this year,
prompting the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics to adjust the economic growth target upward to 4.31
percent from the original 4.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Hu lamented that the recent domestic political situation,
however, has affected investor confidence, resulting in Monday's
unusual stock market tumbling.</P>
      <P>Hu was referring to threats from opposition parties to recall
President Chen Shui-bian or topple the Cabinet over recent corruption
allegations implicating Chen's son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Hu said all those allegations have been under judicial
investigation.</P>
      <P>"We need not jump to arbitrary conclusions before judicial
authorities complete investigations and mete out judgments," he
added.</P>
      <P>He also warned that if the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
fails to pass a large amount of critical budget bills in an extra
session during this summer, the nation's economic growth for this
year may fall below the original forecast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DOWNGRADED IN U.S. 'TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 5 (CNA)
(By Lin Chieh-yu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been placed on a "Tier 2
Watch List" for not fully complying with the minimum standards for
the elimination of human trafficking, according to the annual
Trafficking in Persons Report released Monday by the U.S. State
Department.</P>
      <P>The latest listing marks a downgrading for Taiwan, which was
listed as a "Tier 2" country in past years.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is placed on the Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to
show evidence of increasing efforts over the past year to address
trafficking, despite ample resources to do so, particularly to
address the serious level of forced labor and sexual servitude among
legally migrating Southeast Asian contract workers and brides, " the
report says.</P>
      <P>The report urges Taiwan authorities to demonstrate political will
in tackling the human trafficking problem and develop a clear policy
and action plan that adequately covers sex trafficking and
involuntary servitude among foreign workers and brides.</P>
      <P>The report describes Taiwan as a destination for men, women and
children trafficked for forced labor and sexual exploitation.</P>
      <P>While women from China and Southeast Asian countries are
trafficked to Taiwan through fraudulent marriages, deceptive
employment offers, and illegal smuggling, some foreign workers,
primarily from Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines, are recruited
legally for low-skilled jobs in Taiwan's construction, fishing or
manufacturing industries or as domestic servants, and are subjected
to forced labor or involuntary servitude by labor agencies or
employers upon arrival in Taiwan, the report says.</P>
      <P>It notes that Taiwan has a number of related laws that may be
used to prosecute traffickers, including laws against slavery and
exploiting children for prostitution, but it does not have
comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities provided inadequate protection for many
victims of trafficking on the island over the last year, though they
made efforts to improve levels of victim support in some areas, the
report says.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, Taiwan's representative to the United States David
Ta-wei Lee expressed regret over the result.</P>
      <P>Lee said the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the U.S.
State Department had expressed their concern on the situation of
human trafficking in Taiwan three months ago and that Taiwan's
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) had also provided the United States
with a brochure for its reference.</P>
      <P>Lee said the AIT's Taipei office has continued to communicate
with the CLA and the Ministry of Justice for solutions to improve the
situation.</P>

      <P>A group of 25 inventors from Taiwan has
traveled from New York to Pittsburgh to attend the 2006 Invention and
New Product Exposition (INPEX) slated for June 7-10.</P>
      <P>With 27 original products, the group, headed by Taiwan Inventors
Association Chairman Chen Chung-tai, is confident of winning several
INPEX Awards, one of the world's major awards recognizing the
achievement of inventors from around the globe, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>At the INPEX 2005, Taiwan inventors won a total of 10 awards,
including two gold medals, seven bronzes, and one special award.</P>
      <P>INPEX, the largest invention trade show in the United States,
showcases inventions and new products available to business and
industry. The 2006 show is the 22nd of its kind.</P>
      <P>A fruit and vegetable processor, one of the 27 Taiwan-invented
products registered for the upcoming competition, won a gold medal at
the Geneva International Exhibition of Invention in April, said Chen,
who had also led Taiwan inventors to attend the European event.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won 38 medals there, adding a glorious page to the
island's history book of invention.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by Taiwan's Investment and Trade
Office to the United States, nearly 5,000 items invented in Taiwan
have received U.S. patents since 2000, ranking the country fourth in
the world behind only the United States, Japan and Germany.</P>
      <P>Taiwan only received its first U.S. patent in 1973.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Raymond F. Burghardt's visit to Taiwan later this week is a routine
matter, and "there is no need for over interpretation, " a spokesman
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu was responding to reports that the AIT chief will
pay his first visit to Taiwan since assuming his post in February and
that during his visit, he will also learn about political
developments in Taiwan and exchange views with leaders in every
sector. Burghardt has also reportedly requested a meeting with
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The AIT serves as the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the
absence of diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Burghardt's visit will come in the wake of President Chen's
announcement last Wednesday to hand over policy-making and
personnel-appointment authorities to Premier Su Tseng-chang in the
wake of a spate of corruption allegations against his close aides and
son-in-law.</P>
      <P>Lu said that since Burghardt assumed his post, he has planned the
visit, adding that his itinerary will be arranged by the AIT.</P>
      <P>"This is part of an international communication, and there is
nothing special about it," Lu stressed.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Burghardt will also meet with opposition leaders,
Lu said that as a democratic society, Taiwan has many different
political voices, which is normal, and there is a possibility that he
will meet with them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ETHYLENE OVERSUPPLY MAY CAUSE DOWNTURN IN PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The global petrochemical industry is
expected to experience a downturn this year as a result of an
oversupply of ethylene, an important raw material for manufacturing
plastics, a top executive of Formosa Plastic Corp. said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chih-tsuen, who took over as the new chairman of Formosa
Plastic Monday, said global ethylene production capacity is estimated
to increase 6 million tons this year, while the global demand will
grow only 4.3 million tons, resulting in an oversupply of 1.7 million
tons.</P>
      <P>Lee said the predicted global demand for ethylene is based on an
estimate by Global Insight Inc. -- an organization that provides
economic information, analysis and solutions -- that the world
economy will grow 3.8 percent this year, as the demand for ethylene
is closely related to the world economy.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that China and the Middle East are leading all other
areas in the expansion of ethylene production capacity, accounting
for 85 percent of the world's newly added productivity.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Iran alone plans to build 13 ethylene plants
to cope with its petroleum surplus and that the completion of these
projects in 2009 will definitely cause difficulties for the global
petrochemical industry.</P>
      <P>Ethylene, also known as ethene, is made by cracking hydrocarbons
from petroleum. It is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of
other chemicals, such as ethanal and ethanol, and can be polymerized
to make polyethylene -- the world's most widely-used plastic.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although most people in Taiwan have
developed the habit of sorting their garbage, the insufficient number
of public garbage cans has caused much inconvenience to the public,
according to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Good Neighbor Foundation on 1,094
people around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that 65 percent of the respondents are satisfied
with the overall tidiness of the environment in their neighborhood,
compared with 25 percent who are not.</P>
      <P>As high as 94 percent of the respondents are in favor of the
government's garbage separation policy. While 72 percent said the
policy has not caused any trouble in their daily life, 88 percent
said they sort their garbage even when they use public trash cans.</P>
      <P>However, 50 percent of the respondents think that disposing of
garbage in public places is a very inconvenient matter, and 62
percent said there are not enough public garbage cans in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some respondents said that they sometimes leave their garbage in
the baskets of parked scooters or discard it in the streets if there
are no public trash cans in the vicinity.</P>
      <P>As to the features public garbage cans should have, 95 percent of
the respondents think the cans should come with clear signs
indicating what kind of trash they are designated for. Other features
mentioned were large openings for convenient disposal of garbage,
large volume, and clean appearance, as well as convenient trash
separation features.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, the Good Neighbor Foundation announced the launch
of a public garbage can design competition, with the top winner to be

President Chen Shui-bian to step down amid growing public discontent
with the first family and Chen's administration, while the KMT's ally
-- the People First Party (PFP) -- is preparing to hold one in Taipei
the same day as part of efforts to recall Chen.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-chen, deputy chief of the KMT cultural and communication
committee, made the announcement Tuesday after a visit by PFP
Secretary-General Chin Chin-shen and PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping to
the KMT headquarters.</P>
      <P>Chin and Hsieh were greeted by KMT Secretary-General Chan
Chuen-pao, KMT Organization and Development Committee Director Liao
Feng-teh and Huang.</P>
      <P>According to Chin, their visit was aimed at inviting the KMT to
join with the PFP in the organization of its planned "People Rebuking
Bian, A-bian Stepping Down" rally on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of
the Presidential Office. A-bian is Chen's nickname.</P>
      <P>Chin said efforts have to be made by the opposition parties to
push the corruption scandal-ridden administration to step down,
noting that alleged bribery and profiteering reports involving the
first family and high-ranking officials in Chen's administration have
caused public outrage.</P>
      <P>Talking about the strategy for pushing to have Chen step down,
Chin said the best way is to promote a motion at the Legislative Yuan
to recall Chen and then push for a public referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>Huang said because KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou is scheduled to
visit Tainan, southern Taiwan on June 10, the KMT has decided to hold
a similar activity to the one planned by the PFP for Taipei the same
day. He added that the KMT encourages its members residing in the
northern part of the island to attend the PFP-planned rally.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has achieved results in its lobbying
efforts to win support for the signing of a free trade agreement
(FTA) between Taiwan and the United States, a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Leo Lee, director general of the MOFA's Department of North
American Affairs, made the remarks while responding to questions
about progress in the government's efforts to secure an FTA with the
United States</P>
      <P>Lee said the government has targeted the U.S. Congress, state
assemblies and the industrial sector among others in its lobbying
efforts.</P>
      <P>He noted that a joint resolution in support of an FTA between
Taiwan and the United States proposed by U.S. Reps. Jim Ramstad
(R-Minn.) and William Jefferson (D-La.) has won the endorsement of 45
members of Congress to date. In the U.S. Senate, Sens. Jon Kyl
(R-Ariz.) and Max Baucus (R-Mont.) have also proposed a joint
resolution, which has won the endorsement of six other senators so
far.</P>
      <P>On lobbying efforts directed at state governments, Lee said that
Taiwan has won the support of 15 states and 27 state senates and
assemblies for the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan FTA.</P>
      <P>On lobbying in the industrial sector, Lee said Taiwan's
representative office in the United States has held five briefings on
the proposed FTA so far this year. It is also actively soliciting
noted think tanks to sponsor related seminars and stepping up
lobbying efforts directed at U.S. enterprises.</P>
      <P>Two noted organizations -- the International Intellectual
Property Alliance and the American Council of Life Insurers -- have
already expressed their support for a U.S.-Taiwan free trade accord.</P>
      <P>In addition, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei also
recently issued a white paper report in which it said that if
Taiwan's government shows strong will to promote the FTA, the chamber
will also pitch in to help make the FTA a reality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL RECALL PLAN CREATING SOCIAL CHAOS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang condemned Tuesday
efforts by opposition parties to recall President Chen Shui-bian,
arguing that the move would create chaos and affect national
development.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while fielding reporters' questions on
reports that the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) in
the "pan-blue alliance" want to make the presidential recall proposal
a top priority in a proposed extra legislative session in summer.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the public is fed up with political fighting that
only hinders the country's development and competitiveness and causes
social instability, Su said that several key bills have failed to
pass the Legislative Yuan, whose latest session ended in turmoil May
30.</P>
      <P>If an extra session is held in summer, Su called on lawmakers of
all parties to first address bills affecting the public welfare,
including a budget for a flood control project as typhoon season
approaches. More than 30 bills are pending legislative approval,
involving trillions of dollars and affecting over 10,000 job
opportunities, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The premier also suspects the pan-blue alliance may have an axe
to grind by planning to initiate a presidential recall motion, as it
requires a high legal threshold.</P>
      <P>Monday's 244-point plunge in the domestic stock market, he said,
is in part due to ongoing political fighting at home, Su claimed.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting of ranking KMT officials, including Ma, The
KMT decided Monday night to launch a national campaign seeking to
oust Chen.</P>
      <P>The main opposition party also agreed to call for an extra
legislative session to screen major bills regarding people's
livelihoods and to put forth the presidential recall proposal, if
possible.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spokesman Tsai
Huang-liang told a news conference that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's
plan to promote a presidential recall plan is turning a deaf ear to
the people's call for a better economy. He asked Ma to look to
people's needs and KMT lawmakers to first screen major bills related
to the public interest.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers Hsu Kuo-yung and Lin Wen-lang claimed that Ma must
be held accountable for the chaos that would likely ensue if the
pan-blue alliance insists on calling a motion to recall Chen.</P>
      <P>Ma is fully aware that it won't be easy to have the presidential
recall motion clear the Legislative Yuan and that the public is
unsupportive of such a move, they said, warning that doing so will
only destabilize society and whip up a public confidence crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the pan-blue alliance is poised to take to the streets
Saturday -- the second time in as many weeks -- to protest against
Chen, whom it said must assume responsibility for a string of
high-profile corruption scandals allegedly involving Chen's family
members and close aides.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will expand
an insurance program against pig death this year in a bid to reduce
the possibility of pig farmers selling pigs dying of illness for
human consumption, officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The program, which was launched in Yunlin and Taichung Counties
on a trial basis last year, will be expanded to seven others
including Changhua, Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung Counties and
Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan Cities this year, with the goal of
having 2 million swine covered by the provision, they said.</P>
      <P>The premium for each pig is NT$21.6, with the government and pig
farmers contributing 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively. The
coverage is NT$1,200 per pig, while the compensation ceiling is 15
pigs for every 1,000 pigs insured, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>A total of 619,803 pigs in Yunlin and Taichung Counties were
covered by the policy last year, accounting for 77.5 percent of pigs
raised in the two counties, and 8,940 deaths were compensated for,

    <DATELINE>(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> Taipei, June 6 (CAN) Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that
if former Premier Frank Hsieh joins another heavyweight of
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to run in the year-end
mayoral elections, the party's prospects will be bright.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to Hsieh throwing his hat into the ring for the
Taipei mayoral election and former Chairwoman of the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA), Chen Chu, who has already entered the Kaohsiung mayoral
race as a DPP candidate.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP's approval ratings have slipped to a new low
following a string of corruption allegations surrounding close aides
of President Chen Shui-bian and his son-in-law, Su said the campaigns
of Chen and Hsieh, who has yet to announce his bid, would surely give
the beleaguered party a boost.</P>
      <P>Su recalled that both he and Hsieh were members of a defense team
defending Yao Chia-wen, the current president of the Examination
Yuan who was one of the eight people accused in a military court
during the Formosa Incident, which took place in Kaohsiung on Dec.
10, 1979 when a pro-democracy demonstration to commemorate Human
Rights Day turned violent and was suppressed by the then Kuomintang
administration.</P>
      <P>Su said he and President Chen Shui-bian -- also a member of the
defense team at the time -- as well as Hsieh then went into politics.</P>
      <P>Su said that although they have grown older they have kept their
courage, responsibility and sense of mission, and that he is looking
forward to seeing Hsieh take on the daunting task of running in the
mayoral election at this critical juncture.</P>
      <P>Su also said Hsieh's primary concern is not whether he can assure
victory in the mayoral election, which promises to be an uphill
battle, but to look after the party's best interest -- and the
public's.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese tourists will create business
opportunities in Taiwan worth an estimated NT$30 billion per year if
travel restrictions on Chinese citizens are lifted, according to a
report released Tuesday by a Japanese securities firm.</P>
      <P>The estimate by Daiwa Securities SMBC-Cathay Co. includes
spending on group tours and shopping, with the company predicting
that Taiwan's travel agencies and hotels would benefit the most from
easing restrictions.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuan-jung, a senior analyst at the company, estimated that
spending by each group of Chinese tourists could benefit the local
economy between US$100 and US$120 per day, with each person spending
between US$1,000 and US$1,200 each day of the 10-day tour.</P>
      <P>If there are 540,000 Chinese tourist arrivals per year,
spending on group tours will amount to US$540 million to US$650
million, or NT$17.3 billion to NT$20.8 billion, Chen said.</P>
      <P>If each tourist spends NT$20,000 on shopping in Taiwan, the total

    <HEADLINE>PRO-INDEPENDENCE GROUPS CALL FOR HOUSE CLEANING TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pro-Taiwan independence groups issued a
joint statement Tuesday calling on the government to clean house and
crack down on irregularities according to the law in order to restore
the public's confidence and regain their trust.</P>
      <P>In the statement, the "Hand-in-Hand League to Protect Taiwan, "
the "Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association" and other pro-independence
organizations also called on leaders of the major factions of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to renounce their "selfish
ambitions" and work together to surmount what they described as the
"gravest crisis" since the party's birth.</P>
      <P>They were referring to the string of corruption scandals dogging
President Chen Shui-bian's administration, including insider trading
charges against his son-in-law and senior Presidential Office
officials and the Financial Supervisory Commission, whose former
Examination Bureau Director Lee Chin-cheng was sentenced to 10 years
in jail Tuesday in the "stock vultures" case.</P>
      <P>"We are deeply saddened by investigation into the irregularities
involving members of the First Family. But Taiwanese do not have the
right to be pessimists, " said the statement, urging the public to
"give credit" to Chen's recent announcement that he will delegate
power and pursue reform.</P>
      <P>The president has decided to delegate power to the premier, an
indication that he is sincere in listening to sound advice from all
sides, it said. "Since the president has positively responded to
society's expectations, people should give him encouragement, " it
added.</P>
      <P>But it accused the ruling DPP of not only failing to make good on
its promise to create a "free, just and welfare" society in Taiwan,
but also presiding over a string of corruption scandals to the
disappointment of the people.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should do some deep soul-searching as to why it has
failed so miserably in its administration over the past six years. It
should also realize that the recent eruption of serious corruption
scandals has severely hurt the people's feelings," it said.</P>
      <P>It urged DPP's faction leaders to tell the people they are
honestly reviewing the party's records and are determined to reform
the party and government so as to implement the party's previous
blueprints for governing the country.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence bodies also lambasted the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First Party for
committing "all sorts of crimes" in Taiwan, including human rights
violations and stealing huge amounts of public assets which have yet
to be paid back.</P>
      <P>On the opposition alliance's plan to recall the president, Huang
Chao-tang, convener of the "Hand-in-Hand League, " said it has
destabilized the political situation as well as the stock market for
the ulterior purpose of seizing power.</P>
      <P>Huang Kun-hu, president of the "Friends of Lee Teng-hui
Association, " accused the opposition alliance of political
maneuvering aimed at "scuttling Taiwan's localization campaign" and
"making Taiwan part of China."</P>

      <P>Rumors that Taiwan's stock market plunge
Monday was due to four major institutional funds following the
government's instructions on short selling must be clarified, an
opposition legislator said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a discussion session in the Legislative Yuan, Legislator Lai
Shyi-bao of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vowed to find out the
truth about whether the four public funds -- the Public Service
Pension Fund, Postal Saving Fund, Labor Insurance Fund and Labor
Pension Fund -- deliberately caused the stock market plunge in an
attempt to keep scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian in
power.</P>
      <P>Retail investors suffered heavy losses Monday as the weighted
index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange shed 244.37 points to close at
6,715.27, causing NT$680 billion to evaporate in stock value. Losers
outnumbered gainers 781 to 46, with only 36 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>There were rumors the plunge was caused by overselling by the
four public funds.</P>
      <P>Lai suspected the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government
used the short-selling strategy to hurt retail investors and then
blame the opposition parties for the current political turmoil and
bad investment climate.</P>
      <P>He said that if the rumors are proven true, the managers of the
four funds, as well as those government officials who gave the
instructions for short selling, must be held responsible.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang claimed Monday that the stock
market plunge was in response to the plans of KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and James Soong, chairman of the People First Party (PFP),
to heighten confrontation with the DPP government, topple the Cabinet
and recall the president.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP, which are allies in the "pan-blue alliance,"

International Trade Center -- and will open the new space in 2008.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony of COMPUTEX TAIPEI 2006, Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said the computer exhibition will become the
largest in the world after resolving the space-shortage problem.</P>
      <P>After beating out a BOT competitor for rights to Nankang

TAITRA said it plans to ink an operational agreement soon with the
MOEA.</P>

double that of the international trade center, has two-floor layouts
which could accommodate 2,626 standard booths on the ground floor.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the second floor will be an ideal setting for
indoor multi-purpose activities and performances, a TAITRA official
said.</P>
      <P>The International Trade Center and Nankang exhibition hall will

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI COUNTY CHIEF CALLS FOR NUCLEAR WASTE REMOVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei asked
Tuesday that state-owned Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) speed up the
removal of nuclear waste from the first and second nuclear power
plants in his county.</P>
      <P>Cho made the remarks while presiding over a county meeting at
which the pollution issue was raised following an oil leak the
previous day at the fourth nuclear power plant -- still under
construction in Kungliao, Taipei County -- which led to river and sea
pollution.</P>
      <P>Chou noted there are three nuclear power plants in Taipei County,
and that high- and low-level radioactive nuclear waste is temporarily
stored in the plant's complex, with the final disposal location as
yet undecided.</P>
      <P>Chou stressed that for the sake of the county's environmental
protection, it adamantly opposes the storage of nuclear waste at the
plant, saying the government must attach greater importance to the
problem or the county government will have to resort to "extreme
measures" to combat the situation.</P>
      <P>If the central government fails to step up the waste's removal,
Chou threatened that he might not allow any additional waste to be
stored at the plant, and that he would block anyone other than
security personnel from entering the plant.</P>
      <P>"The operations of the nuclear power plant might be paralyzed, "
he warned.</P>
      <P>The county government will also send a team of experts to monitor
the nuclear waste storage facilities in the first and second nuclear
power plants, he said.</P>
      <P>According to an Atomic Energy Council estimate, as of May this
year 35,000 barrels of low-level radioactive nuclear waste are stored
at the first nuclear power plant, while the second nuclear power
plant has stored more than 44,000 barrels of low-level radioactive
nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Taipower, the operator of the nuclear power plants, has a
volume-reduction center near the second nuclear power plant which
uses supercompactors and incinerators to compact or to burn
inflammable waste.</P>

promote its concept of a "healthy family."</P>
      <P>Magistrate Chu Li-lun hosted a news conference at the county hall

cultivating close family relationships, he said.</P>
      <P>Encouraging the county's residents to say the word "love" from

carry out that notion in their daily life.</P>
      <P>Bureau Director of Education, Chang Ming-wen said that every day
there are six ways to strengthen husband-wife ties: give your
spouse a hug, doing one thing for him or her, share your experiences
every day and listen to your partner carefully, conduct one activity
together every week, respect that person's need to be alone and be
willing to face all challenges together.</P>
      <P>Outlining eight ways to enhance parent-child relationships,
Chen stated that parents need to embrace their child every day, give
them daily compliments, listen to them speak about their day at
school, express gratitude daily for something together with the
child, conduct one activity together every week, keep the child
company during one activity he/she is interested in, encourage
children to accomplish one mission and then compliment them on
achieving the goal, and educate them together with your spouse in a
manner that shows determination and kindness.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica's participation in
establishing the "Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) " -- the
largest ground-based array of radio telescopes in the world -- has
opened a window allowing Taiwan into the world of advanced
astronomical research, Academia Sinica said Tuesday in a press
release.</P>
      <P>The ALMA project, supported by Europe and the United States,
employs 64 12-meter antennas located at an elevation of 5,000 meters
in the foothills of the Andes in Chile. The array will be fully
operational in 2011.</P>
      <P>With the ALMA, astronomers will be able to detect and study the
earliest and most distant galaxies, as well as look into the details
of star and planet formation.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica, Taiwan's most prestigious research institute,
has previously collaborated with the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory in building the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii. The
SMA -- with eight six-meter antennas at 4,080 meters above sea level
-- was the first of its kind in the world.</P>
      <P>When comparing the SMA and the ALMA, a researcher at the Academia
Sinica offered the analogy that with the SMA, observers can "see" a
cockroach at Chiang Kai-shek Airport from Taipei 101, while with the
ALMA, observers can tell what kind of cockroach it is in the same
distance.</P>
      <P>An Academia Sinica official said that Taiwan is participating in
the ALMA project through joining an extensive project between Japan
and the ALMA. The project can enhance the function of the ALMA by
adding an additional four 12-meter and 12 seven-meter antennas to the
existing ones, forming an "Atacama Compact Array" observing the
universe with 80 radio telescopes.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the Academia Sinica signed a memorandum
of understanding (MOU) with Japan last September in which the
institute will provide US$16 million -- one 20th of Japan's total
funding. He added that under the terms of the MOU, Taiwan's
researchers share the same rights as their Japanese counterparts in
utilizing the ALMA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT OFFICE CONFIRMS BURGHARDT'S TAIPEI VISIT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Office of the American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT) confirmed Tuesday that AIT Chairman Raymond F.
Burghardt will arrive in Taipei later this week for his first visit
since assuming his post as the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan
in the absence of official ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>AIT Taipei Office acting spokesman David Miller said Burghardt
plans to make extensive contacts with various sectors of local
society during his stay. Nevertheless, details of his itinerary will
not be made public, Miller added.</P>
      <P>In addition to his stated purpose of inspecting AIT operations in
Taiwan, local media reports said, Burghardt will take advantage of
his visit to get first-hand information about Taiwan's latest
political situation amid growing pressure on President Chen Shui-bian
to resign over a string of corruption allegations implicating his
son-in-law and close associates. The reports said Burghardt has
requested a meeting with Chen.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, a retired career diplomat who served as the AIT Taipei
Office head from 1999 through 2001, is versed in Taiwan affairs. Chen
decorated him with a medal when he ended his Taipei stint in
appreciation of his contribution to the promotion of Taiwan-U.S.
relations.</P>
      <P>His diplomatic assignments also include ambassador to Vietnam,
consul-general in Shanghai and deputy chief of the missions in Seoul

    <HEADLINE>KMT RESOLVED TO RECALLING PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is
poised to attempt to oust President Chen Shui-bian by initiating a
presidential recall motion "to prevent the country from becoming
further crippled, " KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pan made the remarks in a news conference at the Legislative Yuan
in which she said that a KMT task force has decided to work to that
end following a meeting with high-ranking party officials, including
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, the previous evening.</P>
      <P>The KMT decided to first initiate a presidential recall motion to
gauge Chen's reaction while weighing other possible means, such as
toppling the Cabinet or taking people to the streets, to pressure him
to resign, she said.</P>
      <P>"The right time has come for the KMT do so, as the people want
Chen to step down to take responsibility for the wrongdoings
committed by members of his family," she claimed.</P>
      <P>The KMT is poised to initiate the motion because it has been
proved that Chen's wife, Wu Shu-jen, received political contributions
from former Tuntex Group Chairman Chen You-hao that can be dated back
to the 1990s -- something that Chen and his wife have repeatedly
denied, Pan claimed. Chen vowed to quit politics if the rumors were
proved to be true.</P>
      <P>Sheng Fu-hsiung, a former lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), recently confirmed that he accompanied Chen
You-hao, now a wanted fugitive living in China after having committed
a serious financial crime in Taiwan, to Chen's house in 1994 and made
a political contribution to Wu at their residence when her husband
was running for Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>In addition, Su Teh-chien, the Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC)
chairman who has been held in custody since late last month for his
suspected role in an insider trading scandal involving his company's
shares, asked Chao Chien-ming, Chen's son-in-law, to use his
influence to secure a syndicated loan for the TDC and thus secure his
own post.</P>
      <P>In exchange for Chao's favor, Su is suspected of telling Chao to
buy large amounts of TDC shares on the grounds that the value of TDC
stocks would surge if the syndicated loan for several land
development projects could be secured.</P>
      <P>In view of the many corruption allegations implicating members of
Chen's family, the president should step down in response to "public
demand" to bring an end to the present chaotic situation, Pan said,
arguing that "Chen's stepping down would be the least he can do for
the country to head off greater damage."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Yung-cheng, who resigned as deputy
secretary-general to President Chen Shui-bian last week, was
questioned Tuesday by prosecutors investigating alleged meddling into
appointments of board chairmen to state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>Ma told investigators that his handling of such appointments was
"completely legal," according to judicial sources.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Lin Pang-liang of the Taipei District Court said Ma
was questioned for his alleged role in appointing Su Teh-chien, who
is in detention, as chairman of the Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC), a
syndicate loan to bail out TDC, and an ownership fight over Waterland
Securities Co.</P>
      <P>Ma told the media that he "told the prosecutors everything they
wanted to know."</P>
      <P>According to judicial sources, Ma testified that Su was
recommended by an Executive Yuan committee and the Presidential
Office had reached a consensus with then-Finance Minister Lin Chuan
before appointing him. He insisted that "the whole process was
completely legal," according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Ma told the investigators that he did not know Su personally and
that Su might have used his name at a dinner party to boast of Su's
own influence, a party that became damning evidence of his insider
trading.</P>
      <P>Ma further claimed that he had not interfered in the dispute over
the ownership of Waterland Security Co., whose chairman, Tsai
Ching-wen, was released on bail after admitting to his wrongdoings in
connection with the TDC insider trading scandal.</P>
      <P>Also questioned Tuesday was Chen Chung, former deputy finance
minister and now chairman of Taiwan Cooperative Bank, for his alleged
role in the fight for ownership of Waterland Securities and a
government decision to approve a syndicate loan for TDC.</P>
      <P>Judicial sources said Chen Chung testified that Chao Chien-ming,
President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law now in detention, called him to
express "concern" over the ownership fight but said he was not sure
Chao was lobbying for any particular person.</P>
      <P>He also explained why the Financial Supervisory Commission
approved a NT$16.5 billion loan offered by a syndicate of 29 banks to
TDC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT TAIWAN'S POLITICAL SITUATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 5 (CNA)
(By Lin Chieh-you and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government is concerned about
Taiwan's recent volatile political situation as the opposition
parties are trying to oust President Chen Shui-bian over a string of
debilitating scandals, a State Department source said Monday.</P>
      <P>The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the U.S.
authorities have maintained intensive contacts with Taiwanese
political figures in recent days to keep abreast of the island's
political developments.</P>
      <P>Strictly abiding by diplomatic protocol, the source said, the
U.S. government is unlikely to make any public comments on Taiwan's
internal affairs. While the United States hopes Taiwan maintains
stability, the source added that Washington looks forward to seeing
Chen serve out the remaining two years of his second and final
four-year term.</P>
      <P>The official also denied a rumor circulating in Taiwan that
Chen's intention of allowing the majority party in the Legislative
Yuan to form a new Cabinet was the result of U.S. pressure.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the rumor as outrageously misleading, the official
said the U.S. government could not imagine the consequences of Chen
handing over or ceding power to any "other individual." But he did
not elaborate on what he meant by "other individual" -- another
government official? a ruling Democratic Progressive Party bigwig?
or an opposition heavyweight?</P>
      <P>David Ta-wei Lee, Taiwan's top representative to the United
States, confirmed Monday that the U.S. authorities have held constant
dialogue with him over the past week, exchanging views on Taiwan's
latest political developments. But Lee stressed that the U.S.
officials were mainly getting information and refrained from making
any comments.</P>
      <P>Speaking with Taiwan journalists posted in the U.S. capital, Lee
said U.S. officials asked him earlier in the day about the
significanc of the recent announcement by Taiwan's National Security
Council that its two deputy secretaries-general will leave their
posts soon as part of personnel adjustments in line with President
Chen's May 31 announcement to delegate administrative powers to
Premier Su Tseng-chang and carry out political reforms.</P>
      <P>Given Taiwan's special and close relations with the United
States, Lee said his office must maintain intensive and extensive
communications with U.S. authorities whenever there are major changes
or developments.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the U.S. govenrment is concerned about the
content of Chen's power delegation. Lee said he has assured U.S.
authorities that Chen's move strictly follows Taiwan's constitution
and existing law. Amid growing pressure on him to step down over
corruption allegations implicating his son-in-law and aides, Chen
announced May 31 that he will delegate policy-making and
personnel-appointment powers to Premier Su.</P>
      <P>Lee said he has assured the U.S. authorities that the continuity
of Taiwan's foreign policy will be maintained, no matter how the
political situation develops.</P>

      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said Tuesday
the government will step up crackdown on human trafficking and has

      <P>Lee made the remarks after the newly released U.S. annual report

    <HEADLINE>EXTRAORDINARY LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO CONVENE NEXT TUESDAY AT EARLIEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An extraordinary session of the legislature 
can be convened next Tuesday at the earliest, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the legislature will have an informal meeting
next Monday during which a decision on whether to convene an
extraordinary session will be made. If an extraordinary session is
held, the agenda will also have to be set, he added.</P>
      <P>He stressed that both the ruling and the opposition parties have
agreed that an extraordinary session is necessary and that "it is
bound to be held," despite the early threat by the opposition that it
will link the holding of an extraordinary session to discussions with
law revision proposals that would allow direct cross-strait
transportation links.</P>
      <P>The previous session ended May 30 in chaos when the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) and the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition
Kuomintang and the People First Party could not reach common ground
on the law revision proposals regarding the cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Many important bills, such as a bill for a major arms procurement
from the United States and one for a special budget for a national
flood-fighting project, were left undealt with in the last session.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that a proposal to recall the president, after
collecting 72 signatures from "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers, is now
valid and will set in motion a grueling process of recalling
President Chen Shui-bian whose leadership has been cast in doubt
following the detention of one of his former aides and his son-in-law
for their alleged roles in corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>On a reported plan by the opposition to adopt a no-confidence
motion to topple the Cabinet in September, Wang also said that "all
will have to be handled according to set procedures."</P>
      <P>He said that the Executive Yuan has already sent its
re-districting plan in line with a new electoral system to the
legislature, adding that whether the legislature can give its consent
by September "will also hinge on the decisions reached during the
extraordinary session."</P>
      <P>He was referring to the fact that President Chen might not accept
the legislature's move to topple the Cabinet and instead dissolve the
legislature, which would result in the holding of legislative
elections which would have to be conducted under a new format
following the passage of a package of constitutional amendments last
June.</P>
      <P>The amendments include the halving of the number of legislative
seats to 113 and implementation of a "single constituency, two votes"
electoral system, the latter of which has made the re-districting
scheme necessary.</P>
      <P>According to the newly amended law governing the election and
recall of public functionaries, the legislature should give its
consent to the re-districting plan 13 months before the current
legislature expires.</P>
      <P>If the legislature has not yet given its consent and a new
legislative election is approaching, then the re-districting scheme
mapped out by the Central Election Commission (CEC) will used,
"because the status of the Constitution is higher than the law,"
according to the CEC.</P>
      <P>The newly elected legislators will be sworn in for four-year
terms instead of the current three years, according to the amended
Constitution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SHOULD RESIGN IF FAMILY MEMBERS CONVICTED: ACADEMICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should resign if
any member of the first family is convicted of breaking the law, an
academic with the public interest group Taipei Society claimed
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-hung, a member of the Executive Committee of the Taipei
Society -- a public interest body founded by a group of liberal
academics who oppose nuclear power plants and social injustice --
claimed that Chen will have "no option" but to step down if any
member of his family is convicted.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties held a rally several days ago to demand
that Chen step down 10 days after the detention of his son-in-law,
Chao Chien-ming, following allegations of insider trading by an
opposition legislator.</P>
      <P>The subject of Chao's alleged involvement in insider trading, as
well as a series of suspected corruption scandals involving senior
officials in the administration, have aroused widespread public
anger.</P>
      <P>If Chen were to resign in the event that his son-in-law is
convicted of wrongdoings, Premier Su Tseng-chang, who was appointed
by the president, should also step down, said Hung, who is a
professor in cranial nerves with National Yang Ming University.</P>
      <P>After Chen and Su's resignation, Hung said, Vice President
Annette Lu would constitutionally become the president. As to who
would succeed Su will be a thorny issue facing the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), he added.</P>
      <P>Even if the president's son-in-law is found not guilty, Hung
claimed, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party is unlikely to relent in its muckraking
but will try to continue "dismembering" the first family until the
DPP collapses.</P>
      <P>At this critical juncture when the DPP is facing "life or death"
challenges, Su should consider reshuffling the Cabinet without being
held back by factional conflict, Hung said, adding that the DPP will
see a silver lining in the 2008 presidential election only if the DPP
administration improves its performance over the next two years.</P>
      <P>On the 2008 presidential election, Hung said that KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou -- widely viewed as the KMT's best bet in the next
presidential race -- might not win the election if he indulges in
muckraking over the first family and fails to put forth a campaign
platform.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Prof. Ku Chung-hua of National Chengchi University,
who is also a Taipei Society Executive Committee member, said Taiwan
is now being rattled by a political earthquake, where the "first
family volcano" is ready to erupt at any minute.</P>
      <P>Ku claimed that the greatest problem facing Chen is that he has
not realized that his and the first family's power has undergone
unlimited inflation, resulting in Chen's becoming distrusted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Yung-ming, another Taipei Society Executive
Committee member who is an Academia Sinica assistant researcher, said
that if Chen's son-in-law were to be convicted of wrongdoings, Chen's
resignation might help defuse a political crisis.</P>
      <P>But if Chao is not found guilty, the muckraking, mudslinging and
rumor-mongering conducted by the "pan-blue alliance" would only be
venomous campaign schemes targeting the 2008 presidential election,
Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OUSTING PRESIDENT TO `KEEP TAIWAN CLEAN': KMT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) demands that
President Chen Shui-bian step down to take responsibility for a
series of corruption scandals, regardless of whether the opposition
resorts to a presidential recall motion or a motion to topple the
Cabinet, KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Pan said
that what the KMT wants to achieve is to "wipe out corruption" --
something that has nothing to do with political affiliation.</P>
      <P>Although the legal threshold required to call a presidential
recall motion is high, Pan expressed the hope that lawmakers of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will join the KMT's lead to
oust Chen and "build a clean Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Even if the chances are slim for the presidential recall motion
to pass the Legislative Yuan without the DPP's support, the KMT will
try to make Chen the first president to face a recall motion in the
legislature's record, she added.</P>
      <P>Pan also accused Chen of trying to peddle influence among the
investigation authorities probing the insider trading case allegedly
involving Chen's son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, claiming that "it is
hard for the people to believe that Chen has not attempted to meddle
in the investigation on Chao's case." She asked Chen to give a clear
explanation of the issue in public.</P>
      <P>Local media reported that Chen met Investigation Bureau Director
Yeh Sheng-mao in secret over Chao's case after having apologized to
the public for any wrongdoings of his family members May 20.</P>
      <P>Shortly after Chen met Yeh, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin also
told local media that the investigation into Chao's part in the
insider trading case could be closed quickly, Pan said, arguing that
Shih's "inadequate remarks" suggest his intention to influence the
ongoing investigation.</P>
      <P>Turning to a media report that the main opposition KMT will
propose a motion in the next legislative session in September to
topple the Cabinet, Pan said that "all possible means will be
studied" to pressure Chen to step down.</P>
      <P>Should Chen dissolve the Legislative Yuan by that time, the KMT
would prepare for a new general election, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Office spokesman Lee Nan-yang denied that
Chen did not meet Yeh last month.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the Investigation Bureau also denied the
report, saying that Chen never met Yeh in secret over Chao, who has
been held in custody since May 25 for his alleged role in the insider
trading scandal involving Taiwan Development Corp. shares.</P>
      <P>Wu Lee-chen told a news conference Wednesday that Chen would only
question the Investigation Bureau chief over national security
affairs when necessary.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang called on the
Legislative Yuan Wednesday to hold a special session as soon as
possible to review urgent bills concerning the people's well-being
and the country's development, instead of engaging in "political
struggle."</P>
      <P>Speaking during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Su urged the
legislators to work to sustain the country's stability to ensure the
efficient operation of the government.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People
First Party put forth a proposal Tuesday to hold a special
legislative session, during which the opposition plans to press ahead
with a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Other bills that are likely to be raised for discussion include a
proposed budget for a flood-prevention project, proposed amendments
to the Statute Governing Relations Between Peoples of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area that would allow direct cross-Taiwan strait
transport links and the nomination of the state public
prosecutor-general.</P>
      <P>According to Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan, the
"pan-blue alliance's" campaign to recall the president and its plan
to launch a no-confidence vote against the premier contradict the
public's expectations for political stability.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the Executive Yuan hopes that during the upcoming
special legislative session, legislators will prioritize urgent bills
related to improving the country's economy and the people's
livelihoods and put off the controversial one concerning direct
cross-strait transport links.</P>
      <P>Su said that as typhoon season has begun in Taiwan, the passage
of the budget for the flood-prevention project is critical to the
government's efforts to protect people's safety.</P>
      <P>Also important are the special budget proposal for the expansion

    <HEADLINE>COURT DENIES BAIL FOR PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law, Chao
Chien-ming, detained since May 25 for his alleged role in insider
trading, will not be released on bail, a spokesman for the Taipei
District Court said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Liu Shou-sung noted that Chao, an osteopath, had
requested bail and to be allowed to communicate with others, but the
judge rejected his request after reviewing the evidence against him
and consulting with prosecutors over his role in trading of Taiwan
Development Corp. (TDC) shares.</P>
      <P>Chao said he wanted bail because his wife Chen Hsin-yu will give
birth to their third child and his detention has also taken a toll on
his mental and physical health.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also said that the case is still under
investigation, adding that the flow of capital yet unclear and that
more witnesses need to be summoned.
</P>
      <P>As the reasons for detaining Chao -- who it is feared would
collude with other suspects and destroy evidence -- have not
disappeared, the prosecutors noted, hence the need to keep him in
detention.</P>
      <P>While detaining Chao last month, the prosecutors said Chao played
a key role in the trading of TDC shares that allegedly has generated
huge profits for the Chao family.</P>
      <P>Chao has denied any wrongdoing since his detention, claiming that
the investment was done by his father, Chao Yu-chu, a retired school
principal.</P>
      <P>It has been found that Chang Hwa Commercial Bank (CHB) sold 12.45
million TDC shares it owned to three persons, including Chao
Chien-ming's mother, Chien Shui-mien, July 25, 2005, four days after
a dinner party attended by Chao Chien-ming and top CHB and TDC
executives.</P>
      <P>Chao allegedly obtained information that the financially troubled
TDC would soon be granted a NT$16.5 billion syndicated loan by 29
financial institutions -- news that boosted the price of TDC stocks.</P>

The new middle-class residents in the urban

voters who have yet to make up their minds --
some 11 million voters in all -- are massed

      <P>Hualien County's police bureau vowed to

      <P>According to tallies compiled by the traffic division of Hualien

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) passed unanimously Wednesday a resolution
calling for the inclusion of a proposal pushing for a recall of
President Chen Shui-bian on the agenda of a planned extraordinary
session of the legislature.</P>
      <P>All 59 KMT legislators present at a KMT legislative caucus
meeting agreed that the proposal calling for Chen's recall should be
put on the agenda and should be the first case discussed at the
extraordinary legislative session. It has not yet been decided when
or even if the extra session will be held.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the KMT's Central Policy Committee,
claimed that pushing for Chen's recall does not reflect the
escalation of the opposition's contention with the Democratic
Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>To avoid Taiwan from being left in a "blank run" for another two
years, the KMT must be instrumental in "allowing integrity to
overcome corruption," according to Tseng.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT caucus was to send the signatures of 40 more
KMT legislators to the Legislative Yuan department in charge of
meetings later in the day, increasing the number of opposition
"pan-blue alliance" legislators pushing for Chen's recall to 112,
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Tseng claimed that after being in office for six years, Chen is
presenting the people with a country where the leadership's integrity
is in doubt, the first family abuses its power and the government
continues refusing to open direct links with China, causing Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER, DPP CALL FOR OPPOSITION TO STOP POLITICAL FIGHTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called on main opposition
Kuomintang Wednesday to stop political fighting immediately.</P>
      <P>Su, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Ker Chien-ming, a DPP caucus
whip in the legislature, made the plea at a news conference in an
attempt to thwart a looming political storm before a meeting of the
Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The KMT later passed a resolution in the meeting to set in motion
the recall process for President Chen Shui-bian, whose leadership is
in doubt in the wake of a spate of corruption allegations implicating
his close aides and son-in-law.</P>
      <P>The DPP trio asked Ma to "refrain from doing anything rash on the
brink of the precipice" and lashed out at the KMT's promotion of the
presidential recall and the toppling of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As a former justice minister, Ma should not waver, not "undermine
the rule of law" for the sake of his quest for power, they said.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the "spirit of the rule of the law" is that the
perpetrator will take responsibility. He noted that Ma said a few
days ago that there is no direct evidence implicating Chen, even
though his close aides are mired in corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>"Despite his law training, he has changed because of his craving
for power," Su claimed. Ma has a Ph.D in law from Harvard University.</P>
      <P>Su noted that the political fighting has affected the stock
market, sending share prices plunging despite sound economic
fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Su said he vowed to improve social order, but expressed worry
about policing a public protest organized by the "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang and the People First Party to push for Chen's
recall and toppling the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan should review government budgets in
accordance with the Constitution, but major bills and key budgets
were left idle when the last session ended in chaos May 30, Su added,
blaming the opposition.</P>
      <P>Yu said the convening of an extraordinary session should focus on
the bills most related to the public, while the "pan-blue alliance"
feels the recall or toppling the Cabinet is more important.</P>
      <P>"Opposing President Chen should not do harm to Taiwan and the
rule of law," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Ker claimed the opposition's recall proposal is for the sake of
winning the year-end mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung,
putting the nation's economy on the back burner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MA URGES DPP LAWMAKERS TO JOIN RECALL EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou called on lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Wednesday to join his party's efforts to recall President
Chen Shui-bian, saying "it is important to stand by the people at
this historic juncture."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks following a weekly meeting of the KMT's
policy-making Central Standing Committee, in which the party decided
to launch a motion to recall Chen in a planned extra legislative
session in summer.</P>
      <P>Ma urged DPP legislators to support the motion, which requires
the endorsement of two-thirds of the legislature, so as to "give
people the chance to have the final say" in a referendum.</P>
      <P>"The KMT's bid to recall Chen is not aimed at private partisan
gain or whipping up confrontation between pan-blue and pan-green
camps," Ma claimed, calling on DPP lawmakers not to boycott the KMT's
recall motion in the legislature.</P>
      <P>"Only by doing so will people be allowed to make the final
decision in a referendum, the way it should be in a democratic
nation," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen should resign to assume responsibility, if he still has a
sense of duty and shame now that he has lost the people's respect and
trust amid the numerous corruption allegations implicating his family
members and aides, Ma argued.</P>
      <P>The motion to recall Chen is by no means driven by political
infighting and the public mustn't be misled into believing so, Ma
said, stressing that Chen's stepping down to assume responsibility is
"a must" that is in line with the core principles of a democratic
society.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman also announced the kickstart of a national
campaign to garner public support in calling for Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT wants Chen to quit the presidency out of
the nation's best interest, Ma warned there will be "no bright future
for the country" should Chen remain in the post.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang told a news conference
the same day at the Legislative Yuan that the party has decided to
initiate a presidential recall motion in the legislature and to make
it the priority in an extra session probably to begin June 13.</P>
      <P>The presidential recall motion is the key reason the KMT has
agreed to the extra legislative session, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu admitted it would not be easy to
railroad the motion through the legislature, but insisted the
pan-blue alliance must initiate the move "to leave a record in
history" of Chen being Taiwan's first president to face a recall
motion.</P>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the People First Party (PFP), said
earlier the same day that he sincerely invited Ma to join his party's
anti-corruption efforts to boot out Chen or topple the Cabinet, even
if the PFP risks losing its seats in the Legislative Yuan when a new
legislature is elected.</P>
      <P>Soong said he supports the KMT's plan to hold a demonstration
against Chen Saturday in Kaohsiung while the PFP will organize one in
Taipei the same day -- the second time in as many weeks.</P>
      <P>Recalling Chen is not just a task for the pan-blue alliance of
the KMT and PFP; rather, it is a question of Taiwan's democratic
values, Soong claimed, adding that the public must fully support
prosecutors and judicial investigators who have been working on
several cases.</P>
      <P>Soong has vowed to take people to the streets until Chen has
stepped down.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) aircraft will be
sporting an image of Taiwan-made fruit on their fuselage to help
promote the island's agricultural industry when they begin flying to
Japan in late June, a CAL official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It was the second time the Council of Agriculture (COA) has
advertised in cooperation with the nation's leading air carrier to
promote Taiwan's agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Last year, several CAL aircraft carried the image of the
butterfly orchid -- one of Taiwan's other key agricultural exports --
on its flights to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Middle East.</P>
      <P>After such a strategy, butterfly orchid exports doubled last year
over the previous year, reaching US$8.2 million.</P>
      <P>The COA expressed hope the new logo would increase the visibility
of the nation's high-quality agricultural products around the world.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Su Jia-chyuan said Taiwan-grown fruit is
"tremendously delicious" and exports should reach out to the world
amid an era of globalization and economic liberalization.</P>
      <P>At the moment when agricultural products of other countries are
flooding into Taiwan, Su expressed hope the new logos will
significantly elevate the popularity of Taiwan-grown fruit around
the world.</P>
      <P>CAL Chairman Wei Hsing-hsiung noted their newly purchased
A330-300 airplanes will carry images of nine of Taiwan's most popular
fruits, such as pineapples, bell fruit, papayas, oranges, bananas and
mangoes.</P>
      <P>The planes are scheduled to arrive in Taiwan June 21, with the

too much forced labor meted out to foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said the agency has been working on including
family helpers under the Labor Standards Law, but claimed that as the

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) decision
to launch a nationwide campaign to recall President Chen Shui-bian
has angered the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, whose Central
Executive Committee members threatened Wednesday to counter the move
yet failed to reach a consensus on how best to achieve it.</P>
      <P>Some DPP leaders at the Central Executive Committee meeting urged
party members to air their views on TV to "rectify" the KMT reasons
on why the president should be recalled, while others even proposed
mobilizing street demonstrations to "check and balance" the

      <P>But some feared the street-protest proposal might prod further
confrontation between the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) supporters, as well as those of the "pan-blue

      <P>The meeting did not reach a consensus on how to counter the KMT
campaign beyond forming an "ad hoc contingency" group to monitor the

(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following on the heels of a protest at the
CeBIT computer exhibition in Germany in March, a group of Greenpeace
International members protested Wednesday against COMPUTEX TAIPEI
2006 outside Taipei Exhibition Hall, claiming IT products contain
toxic materials.</P>
      <P>COMPUTEX TAIPEI 2006, the largest computer trade show in Asia and
second largest in the world, opened Tuesday for a five-day run with
more than 1300 domestic and international companies showing their
latest products, attracting at least 30,000 foreign buyers.</P>
      <P>Nine members of the international environmental group Greenpeace
held a banner reading "No Toxic in High-tech" and showed pictures
of electronic waste dumps in China, India, the Philippines and Niger,
expressing anger at the use of toxic materials in IT products.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-hui, head of the Greenpeace group, noted the amount
of electronic waste produced annually in the world is between 20
million and 50 million tons, or equal to the urban waste produced by
Taiwan in two to six years.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that because electronic products contain heavy
metals and toxic compounds, their mass production -- and even the
process of recycling -- creates enormous pollution problems.</P>
      <P>These toxic materials not only influence blood circulation, the
nervous system, and hormonal secretion of human beings, but also
cause serious pollution to the environment, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said Greenpeace forced computer giant HP in 2003 to stop using
toxic materials in computer manufacturing, and since then it has
demanded Samsung, Sony, Nokia and Acer to follow suit. Acer committed
to doing so eventually; it will publish a time schedule for achieving
this goal in the third quarter of this year.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday the media have been "excessively imaginative" by reporting
that he was forming an "informal alliance" with Vice President
Annette Lu in the wake of an opposition alliance's campaign to recall
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>In response to media questions concerning a China Times report
that Lu was preparing for a post-Chen Shui-bian era by trying to form
an informal alliance with Wang, the speaker said that Lu had called
him to discuss inviting political leaders for a "blue oceans" coffee
and that they did not talk about recalling the president or toppling
the Cabinet in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Asked if the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has agreed to see Lu
take over the presidency if Chen is unseated, Wang said that "this is
not an issue of whether the KMT agrees or not. Rather, this is an
issue that is clearly defined in the Constitution," he said.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, secretary-general of the KMT legislative caucus,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) decision
to launch a nationwide campaign to recall President Chen Shui-bian
has angered the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, whose Central
Executive Committee members threatened Wednesday to counter the move
yet failed to reach a consensus on how best to achieve it.</P>
      <P>Some DPP leaders at the Central Executive Committee meeting urged
party members to air their views on TV to "rectify" the KMT reasons
on why the president should be recalled, while others even proposed
mobilizing street demonstrations to "check and balance" the
opposition campaign.</P>
      <P>But some feared the street-protest proposal might prod further
confrontation between the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) supporters, as well as those of the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>The meeting did not reach a consensus on how to counter the KMT
campaign beyond forming an "ad hoc contingency" group to monitor the

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou called on lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Wednesday to join his party's efforts to recall President
Chen Shui-bian, saying "it is important to stand by the people at
this historic juncture."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks following a weekly meeting of the KMT's
policy-making Central Standing Committee, in which the party decided
to launch a motion to recall Chen in a planned extra legislative
session in summer.</P>
      <P>Ma urged DPP legislators to support the motion, which requires
the endorsement of two-thirds of the legislature, so as to "give
people the chance to have the final say" in a referendum.</P>
      <P>"The KMT's bid to recall Chen is not aimed at private partisan
gain or whipping up confrontation between pan-blue and pan-green
camps," Ma claimed, calling on DPP lawmakers not to boycott the KMT's
recall motion in the legislature.</P>
      <P>"Only by doing so will people be allowed to make the final
decision in a referendum, the way it should be in a democratic
nation," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen should resign to assume responsibility, if he still has a
sense of duty and shame now that he has lost the people's respect and
trust amid the numerous corruption allegations implicating his family
members and aides, Ma argued.</P>
      <P>The motion to recall Chen is by no means driven by political
infighting and the public mustn't be misled into believing so, Ma
said, stressing that Chen's stepping down to assume responsibility is
"a must" that is in line with the core principles of a democratic
society.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman also announced the kickstart of a national
campaign to garner public support in calling for Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT wants Chen to quit the presidency out of
the nation's best interest, Ma warned there will be "no bright future
for the country" should Chen remain in the post.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang told a news conference
the same day at the Legislative Yuan that the party has decided to
initiate a presidential recall motion in the legislature and to make
it the priority in an extra session probably to begin June 13.</P>
      <P>The presidential recall motion is the key reason the KMT has
agreed to the extra legislative session, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu admitted it would not be easy to
railroad the motion through the legislature, but insisted the
pan-blue alliance must initiate the move "to leave a record in
history" of Chen being Taiwan's first president to face a recall
motion.</P>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the People First Party (PFP), said
earlier the same day that he sincerely invited Ma to join his party's
anti-corruption efforts to boot out Chen or topple the Cabinet, even
if the PFP risks losing its seats in the Legislative Yuan when a new
legislature is elected.</P>
      <P>Soong said he supports the KMT's plan to hold a demonstration
against Chen Saturday in Kaohsiung while the PFP will organize one in
Taipei the same day -- the second time in as many weeks.</P>
      <P>Recalling Chen is not just a task for the pan-blue alliance of
the KMT and PFP; rather, it is a question of Taiwan's democratic
values, Soong claimed, adding that the public must fully support
prosecutors and judicial investigators who have been working on
several cases.</P>
      <P>Soong has vowed to take people to the streets until Chen has
stepped down.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will throw
its support behind an opposition plan to initiate a no-confidence
vote against the Cabinet if Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is
designated as the next premier, a party official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to TSU Secretary-General Lo Chih-ming, while the TSU
was against such a plan, it has changed its mind after a recent
meeting between TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang and former President Lee
Teng-hui, who is the party's spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that the struggle between the ruling and
opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan has stalled a number of
legislative and budget bills, Su thinks that it will be unhelpful to
the country's development if the situation continues, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Lee believes that the majority party in the legislature should
form the Cabinet and that Wang is the best candidate to be the next
premier, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Lee thinks that the appointment of Wang as premier will represent
the majority opinion of the legislature and harmonize relations
between the administrative and legislative branches, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Lee is planning to meet with Wang to discuss the possibility of
his idea, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Also, Lo said, the TSU's legislative caucus will meet before
Monday to make a final decision on the issue.</P>
      <P>In addition to a plan to push through a motion to recall
President Chen Shui-bian during a special legislative session
expected later this month, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
KMT and People First Party is also considering initiating a
no-confidence vote against Premier Su Tseng-chang after the
legislature reopens in September.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" claims that the president has lost the
people's trust and should be stripped of office following a string of

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT BELIEVES DARK CLOUD WILL PASS, BRIGHT DAY WILL COME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  8  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, facing an
opposition campaign to recall him, lambasted the opposition Thursday
for waging a "Cultural Revolution"-style purge of him and his family
and expressed optimism that the "overcast skies will eventually clear
up."</P>
      <P>He said that while he has been tolerating all sorts of
embarrassment, jeers and insults, his optimism is based on his
"confidence in Taiwan, in democracy, in the judicial system, and most
importantly, in the people."</P>
      <P>Responding for the first time to the opposition "pan-blue
alliance's" decision to kick off a nation-wide campaign both in
society and in the legislature to unseat him, Chen charged that this
is a "naked attempt to use political force to interfere in the
justice system and even to persecute the system."</P>
      <P>He made his remarks in a "journal of mood" that he published in
his electronic newspaper that is easily accessible on the
Presidential Office Web site.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that justice and fairness must not be a
tool of the strong with which political parties simply use their
numerical majority in the legislature to implicate people and to
overthrow a government duly elected by the people.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, it will lead to a replay of the public trial of
China's Cultural Revolution, which would be the greatest insult and
humiliation of Taiwan's democracy and rule of law," Chen wrote in his
"mood journal."</P>
      <P>He accused "some persons" of twisting the meaning of "judicial
justice" to become "brutal treatment" of the wife and children and
even "all relatives" of a suspected criminal. He was referring to his
son-in-law Chao Chien-ming, who has been detained on suspicions of
insider trading of Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) shares, a scandal
that is still evolving daily.</P>
      <P>The president said he is worried that things are developing in an
"abnormal" way in which some people are using the scandal as "a basis
of hatred" in an attempt "to kill" and to "take revenge."</P>
      <P>In the face of the recent "turmoil, " Chen said he has been in
pain and has felt guilty and apologetic, but most of all, has felt a
deep sorrow.</P>
      <P>"I am a man, an ordinary man, who makes mistakes but who corrects
himself when a mistake is made, " he said, without elaborating on
what kinds of mistake he has made.</P>
      <P>However, he deplored that if after implementing his grand project
of "building the nation with human rights, " he could only face a
country in which all moral standards and codes of conduct and all of
the basic ideas about democracy and the rule of law can be ignored so
that the media can be manipulated and all sorts of smearing campaigns
can be used to assassinate a person's character, value and dignity,
just for the sake of scoring political points and achieving
individual ambition, "then I must suspect that this is indeed an
extremely serious matter."</P>
      <P>The president said he has always believed in the principle that
all men and women are equal in front of the law and that whoever has
committed a crime must be sanctioned by the law, and not even he as
president can defend a wrong-doing or cover up a crime or interfere
in the judicial proceedings on meting out justice.</P>
      <P>"I will not allow myself to do that. Nor will the media and
public opinion allow a criminal act to go unpunished," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the separation of justice and politics is "the most
important indicator" of a democratic country. "We must not allow the
erroneous criminal act of the previous authoritarian regime, in which
justice served politics or was used as a pretext to purge political
opponents, to continue to exist. And we must totally oppose the mean
and heinous behavior of some political figures who are trying to take
advantage of an on-going criminal case under judicial investigation
as a tool of political struggle to realize their ambition of seizing
power," he added.</P>
      <P>The president said some people are claiming that only by
recalling the president or toppling the Cabinet can the judicial
authorities be provided with "a momentum" to boldly crack down on
irregularities. "This is simply the most naked attempt to use
political force to interfere with and even to persecute the judicial
system," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, he pointed out, some individuals and
civic groups that have been hostile to him have used all sorts of
smearing and attacking strategies to spread rumors among the people
and to create social turmoil, expecting that they will regain power
at an early date.</P>
      <P>He said personally, he has no problem standing the jeers,
ridicules and verbal insults, and out of his confidence in the people
of Taiwan, he said he believes that the current dark cloud will pass
and a bright day will eventually come.</P>

Thursday.</P>

driver's license, such as France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, as
it is a practical consideration that has nothing to do with politics.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recalling President Chen Shui-bian is the
last resort to prevent Taiwan from floundering, and the people should
bravely support the cause at this critical time, opposition People
First Party (PFP) lawmakers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmakers made the remarks at a news conference refuting
comments made by Chen in his latest electronic newsletter published
by the Presidential Office earlier the same day, claiming that he is
worried Taiwan's judicial system has been "twisted to serve political
ends."</P>
      <P>This is the first time Chen has responded to a plan announced
early this week by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP to recall Chen at a time when Chen's
spouse, son-in-law and close aids have been accused of involvement in
several high-profile corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Claiming that "Chen must not make comments like this as head of
state in a country ruled by law and order, " PFP legislative caucus
whip Lee Hung-chun suspected Chen's motives for airing such rhetoric
as being directed at prosecutors and investigators working on the
various cases.</P>
      <P>Lee blamed Chen's "feudal mindset" in making comments questioning
the standing of prosecutors and investigators and asked the public to
back pan-blue efforts to recall Chen, arguing that Chen lacks the
ability to conduct self-examination and has no sense of duty to step
down in response to public demand.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung opined that Chen's electronic
newsletter revealed his intention to fight back at a time when public
anger is mounting due to the series of scandals.</P>
      <P>"People's power will be the key to deciding Taiwan's future path
toward a degradation or further democratization," he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP have promised to join forces to launch a
presidential recall motion or a motion to topple the Cabinet, so as
to keep pressure on Chen and push him to resign.</P>
      <P>The KMT is planning a large protest against Chen in Kaohsiung
Saturday, while the PFP will organize a second rally in Taipei the

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Skype, which has pioneered a revolution in
global Internet communications, is considering establishing a product
certification center in Taiwan to meet increasing market demand,
senior officials of the Luxembourg-based company said in Taipei
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Computex Forum held at the Taipei World Trade
Center, Skype Vice Chairman and co-founder Geoffrey Prentice said
many Taiwan companies have made inquiries and sent their products to
be certified at Skype's R&amp;D and product certification center --
located in Tallinn, Estonia.</P>
      <P>Prentice said in 2005, Skype received applications for 350 kinds
of products from around the world requesting certification. Only half
passed testing and received Skype certification.</P>
      <P>Of about 60 companies that gained cooperative contracts with
Skype through certified products last year, half were Taiwanese
companies -- mostly makers of wireless electronic products --
prompting Skype to consider setting up a certification center in the
country to meet the demand, Prentice said.</P>
      <P>Today, more than 200 products in 33 categories have passed
testing and are Skype-certified. These products include Bluetooth
earphones, earphone mikes and webcams, said Manrique Brenes, a senior
engineer with Skype's R&amp;D center in Estonia who also spoke at the
forum.</P>
      <P>Skype, which was recently acquired by eBay Inc., is now the
world's leader in Internet voice communications, offering people new
ways to communicate in a global online era.</P>
      <P>Since its launch in August 2003, Skype has been downloaded more
than 163 million times in 225 countries and territories. Fifty-four
million people are registered to use Skype's free services, with over
3 million simultaneous users on the network at any given time.</P>

      <P>Also, 66.2 percent of respondents oppose the idea of initiating a

are in favor of such a measure, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by a private polling company for the DPP
from June 5-6 on 1,091 people. It had a margin of error of plus or
minus 2.9 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Among DPP supporters, only 3.2 percent are in favor of recalling
Chen, with as high as 93.6 percent opposing the proposal. Similarly,
93.1 percent of Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) supporters object to

26.6 percent who do not agree.</P>
      <P>Among opposition Kuomintang (KMT) supporters, 57.3 percent are

      <P>In the event a no-confidence vote passes against the premier,

percent backing the idea.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 53.2 percent of PFP supporters are in favor of a

    <HEADLINE>CORRUPTION SCANDALS A REFLECTION OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Suspects in a recent spate of corruption
scandals have profited from their proximity to presidential power,
and President Chen Shui-bian has angered the public by not having
conducted any self-examination, the legislative caucus of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As the public is increasingly frustrated by the president's
failure to see the cause and effect of a recent chain of scandals and
his plunging popularity, the caucus said it was the right time for
the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People First Party to kick off
a nationwide campaign to recall the president.</P>
      <P>In Chen's weekly online newsletter published by the Presidential
Office, the president accused the opposition of launching the recall
drive in a "naked attempt to use political force to interfere with
the judicial system." Chen also suspected opposition leaders of using
the campaign to "take back the power" they lost in 2000.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, KMT caucus secretary-general, said the president's
family members or top aides have been suspected of involvement or
detained in a string of scandals related to a land lease of Taiwan
Fertilizer Corp., Pacific Sogo Department Store vouchers, political
donations by former Tuntex Group chairman Chen You-hao and insider
trading of Taiwan Development Corp. stocks.</P>
      <P>The opposition is calling for public support nationwide for a
presidential recall "to unseat a corrupt regime, not to provoke a
confrontation" between the "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green
camp," she said.</P>
      <P>She added the president was merely trying to divert the public's
attention when he accused the opposition of trying to "seize power"
or waging a "Cultural Revolution"-style purging of himself and the
first family.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a deputy secretary-general of the caucus, said
recalling a president is the constitutional right of the people, who
alone decide whether a president should be recalled rather than any
political party.</P>
      <P>Tsai prayed the president would stand with the people to "protect
Taiwan with a government of integrity" rather than shift the blame
for corruption onto the opposition.</P>
      <P>Lei Chien, another caucus deputy secretary-general, said the
president's "mood journal" shows he was "trying hard to save his own
skin" and that of his family members.</P>
      <P>Lei said the exposed scandals show that a group of people taking
advantage of their close proximity to executive power have formed a
"non-institutional criminal structure" that has been plundering
public resources.</P>
      <P>She said that as more and more people are appalled by the greed
and insatiable appetite of "a criminal gang operating outside the
establishment and profiting from presidential power, " the
opposition's recall campaign to end corruption is fully legitimate.</P>

accountable for wrongdoing that is unrelated to him.</P>
      <P>As no solid evidence exists to indicate that the president has
been involved in various corruption scandals allegedly implicating
his spouse, son-in-law and close aides, pan-blue recall efforts are
actually intended to take power back, Chen Chin-jun argued.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan later the
same day, Chen Chin-jun said that the pan-blue alliance must not list
the presidential recall motion as the top priority on the agenda for
a proposed extra legislative session, thereby turning the meeting
into political struggle.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun claimed that President Chen has nothing to do with
the wrongdoing committed by his son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming -- who
has been held in detention since late last month for his suspected
role in an insider trading -- and insisted that lawmakers should
instead redress several key budgetary bills regarding a flood-control
project and the operation of various government agencies and
state-run enterprises.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun urged the pan-blue alliance to separate politics
from judicial matters, saying that efforts by KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong to remove Chen based on
"groundless accusations" are part of a scheme to conceal their
ulterior motives, and something that would only create social chaos.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS IN TAINAN EXTENDS SUPPORT TO EMBATTLED PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) caucus in the Tainan County Council
announced Thursday they will offer their utmost support to
beleaguered President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>They said they will invite the Tainan City Council caucus to
issue a joint statement to urge President Chen to "stick to his guns"
for the sake of the public's welfare and political stability.</P>
      <P>President Chen is facing mounting pressure by the opposition to
step down in the wake of a string of corruption scandals allegedly
involving senior aides and his son-in-law Chao Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-lai, DPP caucus whip in the county council, said that
if Chao -- who is currently under detention for his alleged role in
an insider trading case -- is found to be involved in criminal
dealings, he should be dealt with according to law, which he said is
"the norm in a democratic society."</P>
      <P>But there is no evidence to indicate that the president is
involved in any shady practices, Chen Chao-lai said. The opposition's
attempt to recall the president while the government is functioning
normally is only aimed at disrupting the country's political
stability, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-lai said his office has been inundated with calls over
the past several days protesting what they called the media's "siding
with the opposition" in a bid to force the first family into a
corner.</P>
      <P>He said his caucus has asked the DPP to mobilize its supporters
to counter forces against President Chen and to throw support
behind the president, who is from Kuantien, Tainan county.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tainan City Councilor Wang Ding-yu invited 10,000
people to sign up before June 16 to express support for the
president.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks as several hundred DPP supporters gathered
in front of his office, shouting slogans to cheer President Chen
and condemn main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The supporters said there is no evidence to implicate the
president in any corruption allegations, and that Ma's recall motion
was an "obvious attempt to humiliate President Chen."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SUITABLE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY: GERMAN ENVIRONMENTALIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has a better environment than Europe
for developing renewable energies, given its unlimited solar and wind
resources, a German environmentalist said in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the Taipei-based China Electric
Manufacturing Corp., Franz Alt, a TV journalist and author who is
also an environmentalist, said the energy question has become the key
question of modern developed and developing countries. Environmental
disasters are becoming ever more common, and 70 percent of all
environmental problems are energy problems, he claimed.</P>
      <P>The European Union authorities have estimated that all
traditional energies, including fossil energy, will be in short
supply globally by 2050, Alt said.</P>
      <P>There is no future for the culture of mankind without ecology.
And that means there is no future for the culture of mankind without 
renewable energy, Alt said, adding that environmental policy means
peace policy in a double sense: Peace with nature and peace
among peoples and societies.</P>
      <P>Alt said the change to solar energy can and must take place
within the next 50 years. "Only then have we an escape route from the
greenhouse effect," he claimed.</P>
      <P>The only path for Europe to a clean energy economy is to cut the
consumption of crude oil by about 60 percent while developing and
using renewable energy, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Alt said not only Europe should strive to develop renewable
energies, but so should Asian countries like China, Taiwan and India,
where the peoples' desire for quality life like that enjoyed in
industrially advanced countries is unavoidably demanding greater
consumption of energy.</P>
      <P>Alt recalled that during a visit with President Chen Shui-bian in
Taipei in 2001, he told the president that Europe is expected to
transform its economy to a renewable energy economy, using mainly
solar energy, by 2050. Chen responded by saying that Taiwan can
accomplish such transformation in 2030, thanks to the island's rich
resources of hotsprings and geothermal heat.</P>
      <P>Alt said he agreed with Chen's assertion, given Taiwan's rich
resources of sunlight and wind power, which he claimed are much
richer than those available in Europe.</P>
      <P>The German environmentalist, however, said that Taiwan has lots
to catch up in this regard, since an essential and much-talked-about
renewable energy law has yet to be legislated.</P>
      <P>Alt claimed that the amount of fossil energy that humans consume
in one day took "500,000 days to nurture."</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the Sun provides the Earth with energy that
is 15,000 times the daily energy required by the entire global
population.</P>
      <P>In Germany, he pointed out, nearly 1 million households are
powered by solar energy, while some 700 churches use electricity
generated by solar energy. Generating electricity with wind power,
Germany has cut CO2 production by 18 million tons.</P>
      <P>Renewable energy has also created over 1 million jobs across
Germany, according to Alt.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said to the top
U.S. liaison official with Taiwan Thursday that the political turmoil
"will not last long, " Presidential Office sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The sources said Chen displayed his confidence when Raymond F.
Burghardt, new chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan,
expressed concern about Taiwan's political situation and economic
performance during a meeting at the Presidential Office. Burghardt
arrived a day earlier for his first visit to Taiwan since assuming
his post in February.</P>
      <P>Chen is in deep trouble as he faces mounting pressure from the
opposition to oust him after a spate of corruption allegations
implicating his close aides and son-in-law.</P>
      <P>Addressing Burghardt's concerns, Chen said that whether
the opposition puts forward a motion for a recall or a no-confidence
vote to topple the Cabinet, it will have to follow Constitutional
procedures and legal regulations, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The president cited the example of the shooting of himself and
Vice President Annette Lu on the eve of the March 20, 2004
presidential election, which the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang and the People First Party claims was staged to
unfairly sway the outcome of the bitterly contested election. After
Chen won by a razor-thin margin, the opposition filed two separate
lawsuits, both of which failed.</P>
      <P>Whether it is opposition's call for an independent investigation
commission to probe the shooting or election-related lawsuits, they
followed legal procedure and the judicial authorities ruled
accordingly, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said he will respect the judicial authorities on this latest
spate of controversy and claimed that the "current upheaval won't
last long."</P>
      <P>Burghardt later had lunch with Chen. Also present were Tan Sun
Chen, the president's chief of staff, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen,
National Defense Minister Lee Jye, Foreign Affairs Minister Huang
Chih-fang, Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san, Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu, AIT Taipei Office Director
Stephen M. Young and his deputy, David J. Keegan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CGA ANNOUNCES TAIWAN'S LARGEST SEIZURE OF NARCOTICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
announced Thursday the largest seizure of narcotics so far in Taiwan
-- 202 kg of ketamine with a street value of about NT$150 million
(US$4.68 million) -- at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>Members of the drug smuggling ring had concealed the drugs
in boxes with 12 containers each, under the guise of powdered health
food. They intended to smuggle the contraband drugs from Europe to
Taiwan, coast guard officials said.</P>
      <P>A woman surnamed Huang was arrested while attempting to pick up
the delivery of narcotics at the airport, and police are currently
tracking down other suspects in the ring.</P>
      <P>With the government's rigorous crackdown on drugs, the price of
level 1 drugs (hard drugs such as opium, cocaine and heroin) and
level 2 drugs (amphetamines, marijuana and MDMA) has soared, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Ketamine, one of the level 3 drugs (also included FM2 or "raping
pills"), is a nonbarbiturate narcotic. As it costs far less than
heroin or amphetamine, it has become the favorite of drug
traffickers.</P>
      <P>Police estimated they have seized 298.26 kg of level 3 drugs in
the first four months of this year, up 454 percent from the same
period last year.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) warned
consumers Thursday that brand names should be chosen carefully when
buying peanut candies from Taiwan's food stores in order to avoid
aflatoxin poisoning.</P>
      <P>Health officials said the department had tested 108 samples of

-- all imported from Vietnam -- contained unacceptably high levels of
aflatoxin.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the amount of aflatoxin in some of the
candy reached 240.4 ppb (parts per billion), exceeding the 15 ppb
maximum limit set by the European Commission for peanuts and peanut
products.</P>
      <P>They said the DOH had ordered the removal and destruction of all
contaminated peanut candy from store shelves.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the three companies that had imported
the contaminated peanut products will face a fine of between
NT$30,000 and NT$150,000. In addition, these companies will be put on
a "black list", meaning that food products they import in future will

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
official on Thursday dismissed as sheer speculation that Vice
President Annette Lu has forged an alliance with Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng amid the political crisis facing President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a DPP legislative caucus whip, made the remarks
after news reports alleged that Lu had solicited Wang's cooperation
to form an alliance to "stabilize the political arena" as opposition
parties are launching a campaign to oust President Chen over a string
of corruption allegations implicating his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Furious at the alleged crimes of the first family, the opposition
is asking for the public's support and even support from DPP
legislators to recall the president or topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The reports claimed Lu had recently begun maintaining frequent
contacts with Wang, and had initiated a summit with Premier Su
Tseng-chang, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang, Judicial Yuan President
Weng Yueh-sheng and Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen, as well
as top leaders of the major political parties.</P>
      <P>The summit was originally scheduled for Thursday but was canceled
because of cool response from opposition figures.</P>
      <P>Denying the existence of the "Lu-Wang alliance, " Chen Chin-jun
said Lu's recent communication with Wang was mainly to solicit Wang's
help in establishing a parliamentary alliance among Pacific Rim
countries under the framework of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) ,
a non-governmental organization initiated by Lu and inaugurated in
Taipei last August.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun stressed that media speculation on the matter would
only add fuel to the flames, saying that Lu has conscientiously taken
into account the country's constitutional, diplomatic and legal
interest, and has acted not out of any personal gain.</P>
      <P>In addition, such speculation would just cause further

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) began
Thursday a four-day operation to move its head office in Taipei to a
smaller office building than its present location opposite the
Presidential Office to cut operational costs.</P>
      <P>The KMT signed an agreement in March to sell its building on
Chungshan South Road to the Evergreen Group, one of Taiwan's largest
shipping companies, for NT$2.3 billion (US$70.7 million).</P>
      <P>KMT officials admitted that financial difficulties and the
maintenance cost for the building -- at NT$40 million a year -- were
the main reasons that prompted the decision to sell the property and
relocate the head office.</P>
      <P>The new offices are in an eight-story building on Pateh Road
belonging to the KMT, which has leased some floors to business firms
and used other floors as campaign headquarters for elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Chan Chun-po told reporters Thursday that
office work will be back to normal June 12 and that a reception will
be held June 14 to mark the relocation.</P>
      <P>Chan said that although it was difficult to part with the old
location that has housed the KMT headquarters for more than 50 years,
the party must demonstrate its determination to rise again, starting
with a cost-saving plan for its offices.</P>
      <P>According to KMT officials, the maintenance of the Pateh Road
building will cost NT$8 million a year, much less than the upkeep of
the Chungshan South Road building.</P>
      <P>The Evergreen group has agreed to let the KMT use a basement

Taiwan, Japan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Chile, South Korea and
Vietnam playing the leading roles, while representatives from the

seven simulated emergency situations from the exercise collaboration
center, such as the WHO raising the alert level to phase 5 (infection

fire, Taiwan being asked to provide assistance to countries suffering
from avian flu, and a help call from Canada to track down a suspect
avian flu patient traveling alone.</P>

these situations within two hours.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has seldom taken part in such cross-border

Wall Street Journal: Justice Delayed For
Global Court, Ugandan Rebels Prove Tough Test

In August 2004, the International 
Criminal Court sent investigators to Uganda to 
gather evidence against a shadowy insurgency 
known as the Lord's Resistance Army, which
had terrorized Uganda's Acholiland region with 
murders, rapes and child abductions. Over two 
decades, the insurgents had kidnapped more than 
20,000 children and driven nearly two million 
people from their homes, the United Nations 
estimates. But the ICC quickly discovered how
difficult it can be to dispense justice in
corners of the world where political, military
and diplomatic forces have long failed to
produce stability.
Seven months after ICC investigators arrived in 
Uganda, a delegation of Acholi tribal leaders

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's stock market investors were urged
Thursday to stay cool and rational after the domestic bourse took a
4.2 percent nosedive that day as a result of the domestic political
upheaval and a slide in regional markets.</P>
      <P>Susan S. Chang, vice chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC), called for Taiwan investors not to sell
their stocks "irrationally" since most listed and OTC companies have
healthy fundamentals with good performances.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the Taiwan stock market's abrupt nosedive
Thursday -- down 280.93 points after the bourse plummeted 244 points
Monday -- mainly to the slide in markets around the world and
non-economic factors at home.</P>
      <P>Chang said the FSC will not tamper with the market unless
"incorrect or unfounded" information is disseminated to drive down
the bourse. She said no such news was reported that day.</P>
      <P>She quoted FSC tallies as indicating that turnover reported in
all listed companies in Taiwan totaled NT$4.13 trillion as of April

      <P>Meanwhile Hsu Sheng-hsiung, chairman of the Taipei Exporters and
Importers Association, said he is confident in Taiwan's economy and
considered Thursday's nosedive as only a temporary phenomenon that
will be corrected in a couple of days.</P>
      <P>Hsu called for the country to calm down in the face of political
restlessness, saying that the current political chaos should be eased
quickly before it undermines domestic consumption behavior.</P>
      <P>Recent scandals allegedly involving the first family and
President Chen Shui-bian's associates have driven Chen's approval
rating to a record low and have prompted the opposition to demand his
resignation. Members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party have
also expressed concern that Chen's woes might hurt the party in
upcoming elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO WORK WITH U.S. IN BARRING MACHINE TOOL SALES TO IRAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has promised to
work closely with the United States to prevent precision machine tool
shipments to Iran as part of their joint efforts to fight global
terrorism, Presidential Office sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, visiting American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt expressed concern during a lunch
with Chen about reports that Taiwan-made precision machine tools have
"unwittingly" been shipped to Iran.</P>
      <P>Burghardt was quoted as saying that the reports caught U.S.
attention more than a year ago. The U.S. government is concerned that
Taiwan-made precision machine tools might be used by rogue countries
to manufacture weapons.</P>
      <P>The top U.S. liaison official told Chen that the American
government is willing to provide Taiwan with state-of-the-art
detection equipment to prevent sensitive precision machine tools from
being exported to Iran or Iraq.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen assured Burghardt that Taiwan is willing to
strengthen cooperation with the United States in barring
sophisticated machine tools from being "unknowingly" sold to volatile
regions or countries.</P>
      <P>Burghardt arrived in Taipei Wednesday on his first visit to
Taiwan since assuming the AIT chairmanship in February this year. He
held wide-ranging talks with Chen at the Presidential Office before
the lunch.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen was also quoted as having told Burghardt
that Taiwan's current volatile political situation will not last long
and that the pall over him will be cleared eventually.</P>
      <P>Burghardt's visit comes at a time when Chen is beset by
opposition pressure to resign over a string of debilitating
corruption allegations implicating his son-in-law and former aides.</P>
      <P>The retired U.S. career diplomat has said the timing of his visit
has nothing to do with the country's recent political developments.</P>
      <P>"My visit is coincidental that it happens to be at the same time
as all of this is going on," he said during his talks with Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen told Burghardt that Taiwan's current political upheaval will
not affect its relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>Also present at the lunch were Tan Sun Chen, the president's
chief of staff, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, National Defense Minister
Lee Jye, Foreign Affairs Minister Huang Chih-fang, Minister of
Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman
Joseph Wu, AIT Taipei Office Director Stephen M. Young and his
deputy, David J. Keegan.</P>
      <P>The AIT represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of

    <HEADLINE>FORMER RIGHT-HAND MAN OF PRESIDENT LOSES APPEAL FOR BAIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court rejected Thursday an
appeal by a former senior Presidential Office staffer for release on
bail, saying that his continued detention is necessary for public
prosecutors to complete their investigation into his roles in a
number of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, who served as deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office from 2000-2004 and was considered President Chen
Shui-bian's right-hand man, was detained April 7 on suspicion of
having accepted bribes from a businessman in 2002 to help him solve
legal problems. He was accused by real estate developer Liang Po-hsun
of accepting NT$7.11 million for helping solve some legal problems
but failing to deliver on what he promised.</P>
      <P>Liang, 50, a former vice chairman of the Bank of Overseas
Chinese, was convicted in November 2002 for using his influence to
borrow NT$5.3 billion illegally from several branches of the bank
through dummy accounts in 1996-97. While applying for a deferred
prison sentence in March 2003, he absconded abroad and remains at
large, spending his time in China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Africa.</P>
      <P>Liang was also sentenced to one year and two months in a separate
case for committing forgery in real estate deals while he was
chairman of the Hsinchiehchung Construction Co.</P>
      <P>Public prosecutors have also been investigating Chen for alleged
involvement in other corruption scandals, including a profiteering
case involving the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit railway project,
stock playing at the Presidential Office and an ownership fight over
the Pacific Sogo Department Store, which has led to a controversy
over whether the first family accepted Sogo gift vouchers worth more
than NT$6 million.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled June 7 that because the
investigation of these scandals was still incomplete, Chen should be
detained for two more months.</P>
      <P>Chen filed an appeal with the Taiwan High court for his release,
but the high court ruled that it was necessary to detain Chen for two
more months because there were still reasons to believe that his
release would enable him to collude with other witnesses and destroy
evidence.</P>
      <P>The Taipei prosecutors had indicated earlier they were in no
hurry to indict Chen, as they have until Aug. 8 to take that action.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang called Thursday for
public confidence in Taiwan's stock market, saying that fundamentals
of the domestic bourse are sound but that political infighting should
be avoided to allow it to perform normally.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while answering questions from reporters

      <P>Asked whether the government will take measures to stabilize the

to the present political situation. "As long as there are no

he said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange tumbled by 280.93

regime experiences a collapse, a legislative caucus whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun made the comments after media reports quoted the

      <P>In response to media questions, Chen Chin-jun said the only
chance of a "third force" gaining prominence lies in a collapse of

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-U.S. TIES GOOD, STABLE: AIT CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's recent political developments will
not affect its relations with the United States because the two
countries have a solid foundation to shore up their bilateral ties, a
visiting U.S. envoy said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Raymond Burghardt, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) , was quoted as having made the remarks during a closed-door
meeting with Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, who arrived in Taipei Wednesday for his first visit
since assuming the post in Feburary this year as the top U.S. liaison
official with Taiwan in the absence of formal ties, told reporters
that his meeting with Wang focused on Taiwan-U.S. relations. Asked
whether Taiwan-U.S. relations are good, Burghardt said: "Of course,
good."</P>
      <P>For his part, Wang said Burghardt's visit comes at a time when
Taiwan's political situation is volatile and sensitive as opposition
parties have put forward a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian
over debilitating corruption allegations implicating his son-in-law
and associates.</P>
      <P>Wang said he told Burghardt that the recall motion will be
handled in accordance with legal procedures, but he added that he
didn't make any forecast on the case's possible developments.</P>
      <P>Burghardt also expressed concerns about certain key bills pending
the approval of Taiwan's opposition-controlled legislature, including
a long-stalled arms procurement package, Wang said, adding that he
told the U.S. envoy that the arms bill may be addressed at a planned
extra legislative session to be held later this month.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Burghardt met with President Chen Shui-bian
for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen said that an opposition campaign to
recall him over allegations of corruption involving his relatives
amounted to political interference with Taiwan's judicial system.</P>
      <P>Burghardt's visit comes a day after the main opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) Central Standing Committee voted to push for a
referendum to oust Chen.</P>
      <P>The KMT's move is "a blatant interference with the judiciary by a
political force" and a humiliation to Taiwan's democracy, Chen told
Burghardt.</P>
      <P>Chen said he supported an investigation into the allegations, but
stressed that the opposition should not turn a judicial process into
a political campaign.</P>
      <P>Burghardt told Chen that the timing of his visit has nothing to
do with Taiwan's recent political developments.</P>
      <P>"My visit is coincidental that it happens to be at the same time
as all of this is going on, " the retired U.S. career diplomat said
during his talks with Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen told Burghardt that Taiwan's current political upheaval will
not last long, nor will it affect relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>He also assured Burghardt that so long as China has no intention
of using force against Taiwan, he will honor his "four noes" pledge
during the remaining two years of his second and final four-year term
just as he has done in the past six year.</P>
      <P>As to his administration's constitutional re-engineering plan,
Chen said all constitutional amendment proposals should be addressed
in compliance with constitutional provisions. Given immature social
conditions and the current political turmoil, Chen said he doesn't
think that such sensitive issues as changes to national sovereignty
and national title will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's constitutional system, a presidential recall
referendum would only be held if a two-thirds majority in Taiwan's
221-seat legislature agrees -- an outcome that would require about 35
lawmakers from Chen's Democratic Progressive Party to side with the
opposition. That is considered extremely unlikely.</P>
      <P>Still, the KMT legislative caucus opted to move ahead with the
process, calculating that a prolonged public debate over corruption
allegations could further weaken the president and even force him to
resign, strengthening the hand of the opposition ahead of the 2008
presidential elections, political analysts said.</P>

President Chen Shui-bian's reaffirmation of his promises to the
United States on cross-strait issues, a U.S. State Department
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The United States attaches profound importance to these pledges,
which are a cornerstone of cross-strait peace and stability, " State
Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"We welcome President Chen's June 8 remarks as an important
contribution to stability, and we urge Beijing to take parallel steps
to fulfill its obligations for regional peace and stability,
including by reaching out to Taiwan's duly elected leaders, "
McCormack added.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Raymond Burghardt in Taipei Thursday, Chen said the promises
made in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses have remained
unchanged, including the "four noes."</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to his pledges that if China has no intention
to use force against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan independence,
will not change the official name of the country, will not include
the "state-to-state" concept on cross-strait relations in the
Constitution and will not promote a referendum to change the
cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Chen told Burghardt that these promises will remain in place in
the remaining two years of his term and that neither domestic nor
foreign pressures will alter his guarantees to the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>Also, Chen reiterated that sensitive issues concerning
sovereignty and changes to territorial boundaries and the national
title will be excluded from the process of constitutional reform.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting July 1, no disposal tableware will
be provided to patrons when they eat at restaurants of government
agencies, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) announced
Friday.</P>
      <P>Restaurants in public and private schools will also be banned
from providing disposable tableware to patrons starting Sept. 1, EPA
officials said.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the ban will help cut 2,600 tons of
disposable tableware annually, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsu-chang, a section chief of the EPA's Department of Waste
Management, said that the EPA has always encouraged government
agencies to use tableware that can be reused after being washed. The
policy will extend to restaurants in public and private schools,
he added.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will not apply to those who order take-out
food at the restaurants.</P>
      <P>Chang said that currently around 80 percent of the restaurants of
government agencies, colleges and universities provide tableware that
can be reused.</P>
      <P>EPA officials stressed that local environmental protection
officials will from July 1 begin carrying out inspections of
restaurants of government agencies to determine whether they are
complying with the regulations. The officials will issue warnings to
first-time offenders and request that the situation be improved. On
second inspection, if there is still no improvement, the restaurants
will be fined between NT$1,200 and NT$6,000 (US$36.92-US$194.6).</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMCHAM PUSHES FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Winnie Chi and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) said in Washington, D.C. Thursday that
setting up direct cross-Taiwan Strait links could fast-track a Free
Trade Agreement (FTA) between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AmCham President Thomas Johnson said at a press conference that
direct links would be a fast-track way for Taiwan to sign a free
trade agreement with the United States. "Such a move would help shore
up support in Washington, which has been lukewarm to Taiwan's request
to negotiate an FTA deal," Johnson said.</P>
      <P>"A U.S.-Taiwan FTA would make Taiwan a springboard for the United
States heading to the huge Chinese market, creating a win-win-win
situation for Taiwan, China and the United States," he added.</P>
      <P>The AmCham president, however, said that he saw only a less than
50 percent chance that such an agreement can be signed within the
next year given the current circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Trade Promotion Authority, which authorizes the U.S.
president to negotiate trade deals with other countries, expires in
July next year. Any FTAs not completed by then would have to be
re-negotiated, Johnson added.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan responds with sufficient political will, AmCham stands
ready to offer its support and assistance to help make an FTA a
reality," Johnson vowed.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that before Taiwan begins any FTA negotiations
with the United States, Taiwan should face and tackle several issues
first, including the need for more political transparency, deeper IPR
protection, improved health care policies and continued financial
reform.</P>
      <P>Johnson made the remarks at the press conference after he and an
AmCham mission discussed AmCham's newly-published White Paper on
Taiwan with U.S. government officials, members of Congress and think
tanks in Washington, D.C. in a "door knocking" tour. The policy paper
of the AmCham, which represents more than 500 companies, also urged
Taiwan to push on for an FTA with the United States.</P>
      <P>AmCham Executive Director Richard Vuylsteke said the U.S.
companies not only maintain business and trade operations in Taiwan,
they are also eyeing the even bigger market across the Taiwan Strait
in China.</P>
      <P>"Should there be cross-strait links, a lot of business interest
will surge on the U.S. side for an FTA for Taiwan, " Vuylsteke said.</P>
      <P>Quoting U.S. deputy trade representative Karan Bhatia as saying
in May after visiting Taiwan that he saw little chance for an FTA
between Taiwan and the U.S. within the next year, Vuylsteke said
U.S.-Taiwan FTA talks would be a long process, but the AmCham would
rather expect optimistically its happening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN APPRECIATES POSITIVE U.S. REACTION TO PRESIDENT CHEN'S REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government welcomes and appreciates the
United States' positive reaction towards President Chen Shui-bian's
latest reaffirmation of his promises on cross-Taiwan Strait issues,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that it remains Taiwan's position to maintain the
cross-strait status quo and to prevent the status quo from being
altered.</P>
      <P>He urged China to take the United States' opinion seriously and
engage in direct dialogue with the elected leaders of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Raymond Burghardt in Taipei Thursday, President Chen said
the statements made in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses,
including the "four noes," have remained unchanged and will remain in
place in the remaining two years of his term.</P>
      <P>Also, Chen reiterated that sensitive issues concerning
sovereignty and changes to territorial boundaries and the national
title will be excluded from the process of constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks received positive reaction from Washington, with
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack issuing a statement
Thursday calling them "an important contribution to (cross-strait)
stability" and urging Beijing "to take parallel steps to fulfill its
obligations for regional peace and stability, including by reaching
out to Taiwan's duly elected leaders."</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the fact that the United States has reacted
immediately to President Chen's remarks shows that communication
between Taipei and Washington is smooth and sound, and the meeting
between Chen and Burghardt has been the most direct and candid form
of communication.</P>
      <P>Huang denied a media report which claimed that Chen made the move
because the U.S. State Department had recently relayed a "secret
cable" to the president via ROC Representative to the United States
David Ta-wei Lee to urge Chen to reaffirm his promises on
cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Asked if it means a change in Taiwan's position since Chen has
only reaffirmed his "four noes, " instead of "five noes, " Huang said
the "principle and spirit" of the president's remarks have always
remained the same, which he said are to maintain the cross-strait
status quo and prevent the status quo from being changed.</P>
      <P>The "four noes" refer to Chen's pledges that if China has no
intention to use force against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan
independence, will not change the official name of the country, will
not include the "state-to-state" concept on cross-strait relations in
the Constitution and will not promote a referendum to change the
cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>The other "no" was that the abolition of the National Unification
Council (NUC) or the National Unification Guidelines "will not be an
issue."</P>
      <P>Chen announced in late February this year that the NUC would
"cease to function" and the guidelines would "cease to apply, "
triggering a dispute on whether the move was equal to abolishing the
NUC and the guidelines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHASE-OUT MECHANISM FOR FOREIGN LABOR BROKERAGE FIRMS TO KICK OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has studied the phase-out
mechanism for foreign labor brokerage firms if they fail to reach a
certain standard in a comprehensive assessment program, a Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>CLA Deputy Chairman Kuo Fong-yu made the remarks on the sidelines
of an award presentation ceremony sponsored by the CLA. The ceremony
honored excellent foreign labor brokerage firms, the first time the
council has honored them since Taiwan first introduced foreign
laborers in 1989.</P>
      <P>Kuo noted that a revised regulation concerning the approval and
management of private employment service operators will be completed
in August. A phase-out mechanism for those sub-standard operators
will be added in the revised regulation.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive assessment of foreign labor brokerage firms will
begin in the fourth quarter, the results of which will be used as a
basis in determining whether to renew their operation licenses, Kuo
said.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that in the future, there will be a three-tier
assessment system, compared with the current five-tier assessment
system. If the operators refuse to be assessed, or are given the
lowest level for two consecutive years and don't make improvements
during a given time, they will not be allowed to renew their licenses
and will not be able to set up branches. Instead, they will have to
bow out of the brokerage market, and the employers they serve will be
transferred to other brokerage firms.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following a move to recall President Chen
Shui-bian two days ago, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
called Friday for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to
draw a clear line in its relationship with Chen, saying it is the
only way for the DDP to survive and possibly thrive.</P>
      <P>In response to an advertisement in some newspapers placed by
several pro-independence groups to shift the focus away from the
campaign to recall the president, Ma reiterated that Chen should step
down of his own accord as such "diversion tactics" will be useless.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, made the remarks in reply to
media inquiries at Taipei City Hall, saying it's not moral or wise
for Chen to mobilize pro-independence groups to fight back against
the recall campaign by distorting the issue and representing it as a
conflict between ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the president's authority comes from the
Constitution as does the right to recall the president, adding that
since the president's power comes from the people, they have the
right to take it back from him.</P>
      <P>"Chen is fighting the public will since a majority of the people
in Taiwan favor his recall, " Ma said, stressing that he does not
think DDP members at this time should embrace Chen in their arms.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the alleged scandals in which the president's
son-in-law and senior aides are suspected of involvement, Ma said
Chen's leadership can be summed up in two words: "incompetence and
corruption."</P>
      <P>Therefore, he emphasized, the campaign to recall the president
has nothing to do with Taiwan's ethnic groups but has everything to
do with "integrity versus corruption" and "competence versus
incompetence".</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 12-year-old launched a "candy-raising"
drive in the central county of Changhua recently, aimed at collecting
200,000 pieces of candy that he wants sent to Africa, where he
believes some children might have only heard about candy but have no
chance of tasting it.</P>
      <P>Lin Hung-chun, a sixth grader from the Hoping Elementary School
in Changhua City, said he was inspired by a book written by Lien
En-chia -- a Taiwan doctor who worked in Burkina Faso as a draftee on
alternative military service -- and decided to raise funds to buy
some candies for African kids.</P>
      <P>After learning about Lin's wish, Changhua County Magistrate Cho
Po-yua instructed his office to initiate a "one student, one candy"
campaign, anticipating that funds can be raised from elementary
schools all over the County and the money used to procure some
100,000 pieces of candy.</P>
      <P>Cho himself donated 10,000 candies to support Lin's drive.</P>
      <P>Lin called for Changhua school children to save their "red
envelope" money received during holiday seasons to enable the African
children to have the "opportunity to taste candy."</P>
      <P>He said if possible, he hopes that 200,000 pieces of candy can be
procured before the end of the year so that he can take them to
Africa during the winter break in early 2007.</P>
      <P>Lin, a budding violin player, is a philanthropist despite his

      <P>While only 10 percent of the respondents to
a recent poll said they are satisfied with the quality of the
country's rail services, more than 90 percent expressed worry about
the safety of the system, according to the results of the survey
released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey, published on the 119th anniversary of the launch of
Taiwan's railway system, was conducted by the Consumers' Foundation
from June 1-7 among just 203 consumers.</P>
      <P>Of the respondents who expressed worry about safety, 50 percent
said they fear the trains are prone to breakdown, 50 percent
mentioned "constant" reports of track sabotage and 43 percent claimed
that the railway services are "very dangerous" for the physically

      <P>A total of 62 percent of the respondents expressed
dissatisfaction with the quality of the railway services because of

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) called on all "pan-green camp" supporters Friday to unite in
the face of what it claimed is a "persecution campaign" launched by
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, director of the DPP's department of information
and communications, said unity is needed to protect what he described
as "the Taiwan sovereigntist regime" when it is being challenged by
the opposition alliance.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" has launched a nationwide campaign to
recall President Chen Shui-bian, whose senior aides and son-in-law
have been detained or investigated on suspicion of involvement in a
string of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, a former justice minister, said that
the recall campaign has nothing to do with Taiwan's ethnic division
that is often whipped up by politicians seeking the ethnic vote
during elections.</P>
      <P>But an allegedly "misquoted" report Thursday about former
President Lee Teng-hui supporting a bid to replace Chen with Vice
President Annette Lu, with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
appointed premier, has shocked the DPP.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun called his "pan-green camp" ally, Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Su Chin-chiang, to clarify what was
happening. Su told Yu the report was wrong and that there is
"absolutely" no such plan on the part of the TSU, whose so-called
"spiritual leader" is Lee.</P>
      <P>In spite of the denials by the TSU and by Lee's office, Tsai said
it is regrettable that some media followed up on the "erroneous
report" Friday. He accused the media of deliberately using the story
to divide the DPP and the TSU and to deal a blow to Chen and his DPP
government.</P>
      <P>"When the 'pan-blue alliance' is doing all it can to persecute
Taiwan's sovereigntist regime, 'pan-green' political parties should
stand firmly together," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He called on the TSU to use caution "so as not to fall into the
'pan-blue alliance's' trap."</P>

      <P>The government agencies in charge of
indigenous affairs and land policy remain divided over the issue of
land requisition by indigenous people around Taiwan, government
sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) and the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) failed to reach consensus that day
over the concern about aboriginal citizens' rights to acquire the
land on which they traditionally live.</P>
      <P>CIP Vice Chairman Cheng Tien-tsai said the aborigines should be
accorded the right to claim ownership of the land on which they have
been living for generations -- a proposal that runs counter to the
version professed by MOI officials, who insist that the aborigines'
land claims follow the Slope Land Protection Act, which stipulates
that the potential land claimers must produce papers proving they
have worked the land for at least five consecutive years before being
eligible to make a claim.</P>
      <P>CIP and MOI officials met Friday for another meeting to discuss
details of an article to be included in one of the 11 complementary
acts under the Basic Law of Indigenous Peoples, which was promulgated
in February 2005.</P>

recent news report claiming that the "top authorities" have given a
secret order to intelligence units, demanding reinforced work to
collect information about Lu's public remarks and conduct.</P>
      <P>The report claimed the move was taken as "the authorities" are

close aides and the son-in-law of President Chen Shui-bian that are
threatening Chen's administration.</P>
      <P>Lu said that in a democratic country, no intelligence units would

      <P>She made the remarks during a book launch held by the
state-funded National Cultural Association.</P>
      <P>Lu is regarded as Chen's most likely successor if the opposition

is satisfied with President Chen Shui-bian's announcement Feb. 27
that he was ceasing the function of the NUC and the application of
the National Unification Guidelines.</P>

a day earlier with Chen, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and

      <P>The U.S. did not care much about the ceasing of the function of
the NUC because, unlike the "four noes" pledge made by Chen in his
2000 inaugural speech, "it doesn't touch on constitutional issues."</P>

in the Constitution, " and that's "a rather important inherent
difference," he added.</P>
      <P>The four things that Chen guaranteed he will not do during his

      <P>China will buy 200 tons of Taiwan bananas to
relieve an over-production problem, an official of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, deputy executive director of the KMT's Policy
Committee as well as director of the KMT's Department of Chinese
Affairs, said over production of Taiwan bananas has driven prices
down, resulting in big losses for farmers.</P>
      <P>He said that production of Taiwan bananas increased by 32 percent
this year. The wholesale price of bananas averaged NT$25.6 per kilo
in early May, but dropped sharply to NT$15.5 June 8, with wholesale
prices in southern Pingtung County plunging to as low as NT$6, even
lower than cost.</P>
      <P>He said that a KMT team contacted "its counterpart" in China June
7 over the matter and received a reply the next day that it would buy
200 tons of bananas.</P>
      <P>The KMT has asked the Taiwan Farmers' Association to supply the
bananas at a purchase price of a little higher than the NT$10.25 per
kilo the Taiwan Provincial Fruit Marketing Corp. is paying the

      <P>After honorary KMT Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese President Hu
Jintao met in China in April, China announced 15 new measures,

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spate of corruption allegations
implicating President Chen Shui-bian's close aides and son-in-law
have seriously undermined the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the party has to engage in serious soul-searching or risk
losing the "heart" of the people, a DPP heavyweight said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and a former premier, made the remarks at an informal gathering
with reporters. The SEF is a semi-official body set up to handle
cross-Taiwan strait civilian exchanges in the absence of formal ties
with China.</P>
      <P>Chang said that one corruption allegation after another have
literally destroyed the founding ideals of the party, which are
integrity, reform and love of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The only resort now for the party is to publicly announce its
respect for judicial authority and not cover up any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P> To err is human, but one has to "review modestly so
that the public can learn that the DPP has become a mature and
responsible party," said Chang.</P>
      <P>He urged the party to "reflect upon itself, reform and get
straightened up, " to avoid losing the heart of the people and
bringing about the demise of the party.</P>
      <P>He described the DPP leadership as "void and erratic " since
President Chen stepped down from his concurrent post of party
chairman to take responsibility for the losses in the legislative
election at the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that if there is a misstep between the party
and the administration, then the leadership would be void. Not only
would there be aspirants jockeying for major positions, but there
would be no possibility of forming accountable politics in times of
crisis.</P>
      <P>But he also said he has never been disappointed with the DPP 
"for a single day," saying that when the DPP was struggling to become
a party in the 1980s, it "never thought about taking the reins of the
country one day" and that it should not be timid when facing the
year-end mayoral election and the 2008 presidential election.</P>

      <P>In a separate telephone interview, PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun,
general secretary of the PFP's legislative caucus, rebutted claims by
legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that the
two opposition parties were trying to grab power from the DPP.</P>
      <P>Lee said such claims were untrue because if the president were
recalled, another member of the DPP -- Vice President Annette Lu --
would be his successor.</P>
      <P>According to the two PFP caucus whips, the rallies in Taipei and
Kaohsiung will feature a number of well-known figures as speakers,
including legislators and TV political commentators.</P>
      <P>They disclosed that PFP Chairman James Soong will speak to the
crowd as the Taipei rally draws to a close, while KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou will also speak at the Kaohsiung rally, symbolizing a
two-pronged attack on the scandal-ridden presidency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Launching a presidential recall campaign is
a political action that does not require evidence of presidential
misconduct as justification, the leader of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), made his remarks
as his party and its pan-blue ally People First Party (PFP) were
poised to stage mass rallies in Taipei and Kaohsiung to demand
President Chen Shui-bian step down to take moral and political
responsibility over a string of corruption scandals involving his
son-in-law and senior aides.</P>
      <P>He admitted that if the corruption investigations stop at the
point they are now, the opposition's recall campaign would be seen as
"falling short of legitimacy."</P>
      <P>However, he questioned Chen's accusation that the opposition is
trying to "extend the charges against one person [his son-in-law Chao
Chien-ming] to all relatives of that person."</P>
      <P>"I am not sure whether only one person has committed the crimes,
because up to this moment judicial authorities are still
investigating how many people might have violated the law," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Was the president showing his respect for the justice system when
he claimed only one person had committed the crimes? Ma asked, adding
that the president seemed to be "setting a limit" as to how the
judicial officials could probe alleged wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>He said based on the progress made so far by the prosecution's
investigations, it is "a reasonable assumption" that more people at
higher levels will be summoned for questioning in connection with the
corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>As for whom might be investigated, he said he would not speculate
due to lack of evidence, but added he was confident in the nation's
prosecutors who should have no fear when deciding whom to question
and where to search for evidence.</P>
      <P>Ma said he had expected the party's decision to recall the
president would be misread as a duel between the pan-blue alliance
and the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Since the decision was made by the KMT's Central Standing
Committee with the support of the party's legislative caucus, "we
will push it through," he claimed.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:
Surveillance and Betrayal Ended Hunt 

In recent weeks, American officials say,
they had begun following a man who they believed
could lead them directly to Abu Musab
al-Zarqawi: his "spiritual adviser," Sheik Abd
albu-Rahman. A member of Zarqawi's network,
cauptusabured by the Americans, had told them
the sheikalal was Zarqawi's most trusted
adviser.In a news release on Thursday morning, 
American military commanders hinted strongly that
a member of Zarqawi's inner circle had 
pointed the way, referring a meeting between
Zarkawi and the sheikalal. "Tips and
intelligence from Iraqi senior leaders from his
network led forces to al-Zarqawi," the release
said.

Wall Street Journal: Fateful Strike,
Zarqawi's Death, Completion Of Cabinet Raise
Hopes in Iraq
Two dramatic turns in Iraq -- the killing of 
the country's leading insurgent and the formation
of a full government -- mark a rare step 
forward in the effort to curb the cycle of 
violence that has beset the country and bogged 
down U.S. troops there. The airstrike against 
Zarqawi near the small town of Hibhib marked the
successful culmination of more than two years
of sustained pursuit by U.S. and Iraqi forces.
It provides a psychological boost after months
of seemingly endless bad news and also could
produce intelligence to further disrupt the
insurgent network. The more important
accomplishment in quelling Iraq's strife and
violence may well be the quieter one: the
completion of the long-awaited new government.
The government fell into place with the approval
of the two final, and most important, cabinet
members: the ministers of interior and defense.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will be able to deal with its current
political issue in a way that leaves its democratic system intact and
strong, visiting American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond
Burghardt said Friday.</P>
      <P>The top U.S.liaison official with Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic ties was referring to an ongoing opposition campaign to
oust President Chen Shui-bian over a string of corruption allegations
implicating his family members and aides.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with local reporters, Burghardt was asked about
his view on Taiwan's current political turmoil.</P>
      <P>"As chairman of the AIT, I'm going to very strictly adhere to the
principle that this is an internal matter and it's not something for
us to offer opinions about. As you said, Taiwan is a young democracy.</P>
      <P>Even in old democracies, there can be lots of political crises
and political dramas," Burghardt said.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said that not only he himself doesn't have a high sense
of anxiety about the political situation here, he is sure that
"people in Washington" don't have, either.</P>
      <P>Praising Taiwan has actually shown a lot of resilience as a
democracy, Burghardt said he remembers that there was a recall motion
against Chen while he was the AIT Taipei Office director in the year
2000.</P>
      <P>"That drama also came and went.So I have full confidence that
Taiwan will be able to deal with the current domestic political issue
in a peaceful way, in a way which somehow resolves the issue and then
will go on to continue to function as an efficient government, "
Burghardt said.</P>
      <P>As to whether he shared President Chen's optimism that the
current political turmoil will be short-lived, Burghardt said: "I'm
not going to predict how long this current political drama will last
or when it will fall into the next one. There will always be
political drama in Taiwan. So we'll see."</P>
      <P>Burghardt arrived in Taipei Wednesday for his first visit since
assuming the AIT chairmanship in February this year. He met with
President Chen, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and main
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou for wide-ranging talks
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since his arrival, Burghardt said he has heard a lot about
Taiwan's current political situation.</P>
      <P>"Of course I heard a lot about the domestic political
situation. Of course I was interested in the subject and it's an
important subject. But that was not the focus, not the reason of my
visit, " Burghardt said, adding: "I came with no message about that
issue. I came with no mandate to investigate anything. I came with no
instructions to bring back any views about the subject to Washington.
It was truly coincidental to the fact that I was here."</P>
      <P>Asked what's the current mood in Washington about cross-Taiwan
Strait issues and U.S.-Taiwan relations, Burghardt said relations are
in a good shape.</P>
      <P>"In general, the situation in the Taiwan Strait is quite stable.
It's certainly a lot more stable today than it was when I last
visited Taiwan in November 2004. And I think that most of us expect
that stability will continue over the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>But Brughadt cautioned that while the cross-strait situation is
stable, one can never be complacent. "One can never assume that they
don't need to be constantly tended, and constantly, carefully
managed."</P>
      <P>Burghardt further said he is particularly grateful to hear
President Chen's public reaffirmation of the "four noes" pledge.</P>
      <P>"That pledge to maintain the 'four noes' will continue to be very
important in terms of maintaining a stable situation, " Burghardt
stressed.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned the importance of Taiwan taking seriously its
self-defense. "Another issue is of course the maintenance of
deterrance.The US has the commitments that are made in the TRA.This
is a very serious commitment and we devote a lot of attention to
it. There are a lot of people involved in making sure...so it's
important to see that Taiwan also takes seriously its self-defense, "
he added.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party

flood-control legislation instead of political infighting.</P>

      <P>The opposition alliance's presidential recall campaign and
rhetoric have angered some "pan-green" supporters, who declared they

      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, the DPP chairman, said he and senior party officials
have been monitoring the situation and are planning to run newspaper
ads urging supporters to express their views in a peaceful and
civilized manner so as not to increase tensions.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, director of the DPP's department of information

southern Taiwan has caused a serious amount of damage affecting

      <P>Asked what's the current mood in Washington about cross-Taiwan
Strait issues and U.S.-Taiwan relations, Burghardt said relations are
in a good shape.</P>
      <P>"In general, the situation in the Taiwan Strait is quite stable.
It's certainly a lot more stable today than it was when I last
visited Taiwan in November 2004. And I think that most of us expect
that stability will continue over the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>But Brughadt cautioned that while the cross-strait situation is
stable, one can never be complacent. "One can never assume that they
don't need to be constantly tended, and constantly, carefully
managed."</P>
      <P>Burghardt further said he is particularly grateful to hear
President Chen's public reaffirmation of the "four noes" pledge.</P>
      <P>"That pledge to maintain the 'four noes' will continue to be very
important in terms of maintaining a stable situation, " Burghardt
stressed.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned the importance of Taiwan taking seriously its
self-defense. "Another issue is of course the maintenance of
deterrance.The US has the commitments that are made in the TRA.This
is a very serious commitment and we devote a lot of attention to
it. There are a lot of people involved in making sure...so it's
important to see that Taiwan also takes seriously its self-defense, "
he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Friday that
"soft power, " which Taiwan has spared no efforts to cultivate and
accumulate over the past half century, is Taiwan's best shield
against China's military threat.</P>
      <P>Lu cited some examples of this power -- democracy, human rights,
peace, love and high technology.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks during her meeting with over 30 foreign
delegates to the third Asia-Pacific Island Nations Summit sponsored
by the Universal Peace Federation (UPF), including former Japanese
parliamentarian Taykashi Aoyama, former South Korean National
Unification Board Minister Huh Moon Doh, and Maldives parliamentarian
Mohamed Saleen. </P>
      <P>Lu said that compared to China's great strength, Taiwan may
appear weak and small. However, Taiwan's case has proven that the
best way for a country to resist the military threat of a stronger
power is to "sharpen its own edge."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) called on the nation Friday to pool resources toward passing
flood-control legislation instead of political infighting.</P>
      <P>The party made the appeal on the eve of a "Super Saturday" when
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" will hold mass rallies in Taipei
and Kaoshiung to demand that President Chen Shui-bian step down to
take political responsibility for a string of corruption scandals
allegedly involving his son-in-law and senior aides.</P>
      <P>The opposition alliance's presidential recall campaign and
rhetoric have angered some "pan-green" supporters, who declared they
will organize counter-rallies to "check and balance" the pan-blue
gatherings.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, the DPP chairman, said he and senior party officials
have been monitoring the situation and are planning to run newspaper
ads urging supporters to express their views in a peaceful and
civilized manner so as not to increase tensions.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, director of the DPP's department of information
and communications, said recent heavy rainfall in central and
southern Taiwan has caused a serious amount of damage affecting
farmers and village dwellers.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged the pan-blue alliance to cancel its planned rallies
in northern and southern Taiwan and instead return to the Legislative

heavy rainfall may drench most of the island, particularly
mountainous regions, in the coming days.</P>

      <P>The new trend in Taiwan universities'
research is to respond directly to the practical needs in
corresponding industries, a spokesman of the Ministry of Education
(MOE) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example a display Wednesday at the MOE, the official
said the 14 exhibits of inventions -- made by research teams from 11
universities in Taiwan -- were closely connected to the demand side
during the research and development process. Therefore, he said, once
they were completed, they could be used directly in industrial
applications.</P>
      <P>The 14 inventions include an air-conditioned biochemical
protective suit, a portable water purifier with an enhanced oxygen
provider, a precise molding technique for cell phone cases, and
production process refinements for optical lenses of digital cameras.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the water purifier -- made by a research
team at National Formosa University -- can increase a clam's growth
rate by 80 percent to 100 percent and shorten the breeding period by
three to four months, generating an estimated net profit of NT$2.1
billion (US$64 million) for the clam industry.</P>
      <P>He added that besides the business profits, 2.4 billion tons of
water can be conserved if all clam aquafarms adopt the purifiers in

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Saturday urged the opposition to stop all activities related
to its decision to move to recall President Chen Shui-bian, and
instead make flood relief the top priority.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, director of DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, made the appeal as the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
canceled a plan to hold rallies to protest against President Chen in
Tainan and Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan due to torrential rains.
Instead, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou took part in a protest rally held
by the KMT's ally, the People First Party, in front of the
Presidential Office to demand that President Chen step down.</P>
      <P>The opposition has decided to push to recall President Chen,
believing his leadership is in doubt in the wake of a spate of
corruption allegations implicating his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Noting that days of torrential rainfall has wreaked havoc in
several places around central and southern Taiwan, Tsai said
President Chen Shui-bian would head to Chiayi and Yunlin later the
same day.</P>
      <P>He said the president is concerned about the people and has
chosen to side with the people, although related disaster-relief work
will be the responsibility of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged the opposition to stop political infighting and join
with the DPP in disaster-relief. It should also agree to convene an
extraordinary session immediately to review budgets related to
flood-fighting, he added.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP caucus whip in the legislature, echoed his
views, calling for the opposition to put aside political infighting
and address the people's woes.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will convene an informal
meeting next Monday during which the time and agenda for an
extraordinary session will be set, but Yeh said he regrets that the
the opposition plans to make President Chen's recall the top priority
on the extra session's agenda.</P>
      <P>"The opposition's intention to make the extra session a political
infighting arena is apparent," she said.</P>
      <P>With the flooding in the wake of days of torrential rainfall, she
said, the first-stage special budget for flood-fighting has become
more urgent.</P>
      <P>Major bills such as the budgets for state-owned enterprises,
special budgets to expand infrastructure, as well as the confirmation
of state public prosecutor-general, which remained unaddressed when

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that Taiwan is facing its fifth political crisis in history, and the
ruling and the opposition parties must put aside their differences
and work together with wisdom and rationality.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when she delivered a speech at a "Cultural
Discourse on National Identity" academic seminar sponsored by the
Council for Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Amid the opposition's calls to recall President Chen Shui-bian,
Lu said the current political crisis "is not the crisis of President
Chen, the first family or the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. It
is a crisis of overall constitutional rule and a national crisis."</P>
      <P>"One has to look at it from this perspective in order to get a
clear picture of current political developments, " she said, adding
that this is "by no means the individual problem of President Chen."</P>
      <P>The opposition has decided to push to recall President Chen,
believing his leadership is in doubt in the wake of a spate of
corruption allegations implicating his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>However, Lu said that recalling the president will not do any
good to any party and that this is why she had advocated a coffee
meeting with opposition leaders, in the hopes of creating space for
rational dialogue and communication to help Taiwan's political
stability. Her offer was rejected later.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the first political crisis was in 1971 when
Taiwan lost its U.N. seat to China, the second was in early 1979 when
the United States switched diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing.
The third crisis was the Kaohsiung Incident in which pro-democracy
activists were arrested in late 1979. The fourth political crisis was
the so-called "soft coup d'tat" in the wake of the shooting of
President Chen and herself on the eve of the presidential election in
March 2004.</P>

flooding caused by seasonal downpours has wreaked havoc in many areas
in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su made the call during a visit to the flood-affected southern
county of Chiayi, along with President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Concerned for the people and relevant disaster-control work in
the region, Chen had insisted on being driven to Minghsiung township
in the county after it was determined that he could not fly there due
to the bad weather, Su said.</P>
      <P>There shouldn't be differences among the political parties over
flood-control efforts, Su said, noting that there has been a public

politicians to focus on coming up with solutions to their livelihood
problems. He expressed the hope for cooperation between the central

      <P>During his briefing to Chen and Su, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen
Ming-wen said the Alishan mountainous area received 811.5 millimeters
of rainfall Friday, which caused flooding in three major rivers in
Chiayi, including the Peigang River, Puzih River and Pachang River.</P>
      <P>Most low-lying areas in the region were inundated, and more than
60 pumpers having been activated there to deal with the flooding,
Magistrate Chen reported, saying the county requires the central
government's help as at least 20 more pumpers are needed.</P>
      <P>The government has drafted a special flood-control budget
totalling NT$110 billion (US$3.39 billion) over eight years.</P>

participants in the protest rallies were in high spirits, and there
were only sporadic clashes with police.</P>
      <P>Soong said that "those who are corrupt must step down. Otherwise,
Taiwan will have no future."</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed the necessity of a recall, saying that in a
democratic society, the people are not the masters only on election
day.</P>
      <P>Faced with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's call for
putting aside all activities related to the recall decision and for
focusing on relief efforts for flood-affected areas in central and
southern Taiwan, he said that the legislature has in the past
approved large appropriations for flood-fighting but that the
administration has not used the money well.</P>
      <P>This shows that the legislature shouldn't pass another
multi-billion dollar flood-fighting budget requested by the Cabinet,
he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said the KMT will put forward the recall motion in the
extraordinary legislative session next week.</P>
      <P>Faced with a president who abuses power and whose administration
has been marked by several corruption scandals, the people have to
retrieve the power given to him in the election, Ma said.</P>
      <P>As long as the people think the president is incompetent, they
can recall him through legal procedures, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGES PREMIER TO FULFILL DISASTER PREVENTION AND RELIEF DUTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative caucus whip of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday that disaster prevention and relief is
the responsibility of Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Legislator Pan Wei-kang made the remarks after Premier Su urged
the opposition to stop political infighting and focus on relief works
in areas of central and southern Taiwan hit by flooding after days of
torrential rainfall.</P>
      <P>The premier called for the opposition to stop all activities
related to its decision to recall the president, urging the
legislature to pass a multi-billion dollar budget for flood-fighting
soon.</P>
      <P>Pan said Taiwan has entered into flood-prone period since May,
and disaster prevention and relief work is the responsibility of the
premier, which she said has nothing to do with the eight-year, NT$80
billion (US$2.46 billion) flood-fighting special budget bill that was
yet to be reviewed in the legislature when its last session ended May
30.</P>
      <P>Pan said that the special budget laying idle in the legislature
is mainly for the preliminary budget for county river dredging.</P>
      <P>The legislature has already passed the annual flood-fighting
budget of NT$24 billion for this year, and the Executive Yuan can
also use the emergency fund for major natural disasters, she noted.</P>
      <P>She said that "integrity versus corruption" is the theme of the
opposition's push for the president's recall, which she claimed is
the aspiration of the public.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that Su will fulfill his duty stipulated
in the Constitution and that he will also instruct the Ministry of
Justice to get to the bottom of a series of corruption allegations
against President Chen's son-in-law and close aides to live up to the
expectations of the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FLOOD BILL SHOULD BE PUT AT TOP OF LEGISLATIVE AGENDA: CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan looks forward to seeing
the NT$116 billion special flood-control budget bill put at the top
of the agenda for a planned extraordinary legislative session to be
held later this month, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks after an opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus whip said earlier the same day that the proposed
extra legislative session should discuss before any other topic a
motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian which was put forward by
opposition lawmakers on the final day of the last legislative session
which ended May 30 in chaos.</P>
      <P>"The KMT legislative caucus will agree to deal with the
flood-control budget bill only after the presidential recall motion
is addressed," KMT whip Pan Wei-kang said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>If recall motion were to be discussed first, Cheng said, the
ruling and opposition camps would definitely get into a deadlock, and
political confrontation stoked by the motion could delay or hobble
screening of the crucial flood-control bill.</P>
      <P>Noting that days of torrential rainfall has caused flooding and
landslides in many parts of the country, Cheng said the passage of
the long-delayed flood-control bill has become ever more urgent and
important.</P>
      <P>If the extra legislative session fails to pass the budget bill,
Cheng said, many flood-fighting projects that should be carried out
or put for an open tender this year will get stuck and residents in
flood-prone areas will have to endure the scourge of flooding for
another year.</P>
      <P>The legislature, where the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally
the People First Party jointly hold a slim majority, is scheduled to
hold a"conversation session" Monday to flesh out the agenda for a
planned extra session.</P>
      <P>While both ruling and opposition parties have a shared interest
in holding an extra session, they remain far divided over the topics
to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties have heaped pressure on President Chen to
resign since his son-in-law was detained in May on suspicion of using
insider information and dummy accounts to buy shares in a financially
troubled real estate developer.</P>
      <P>This week the KMT agreed to initiate a parliamentary vote to
"recall" Chen, although it is almost certain to fail as the
opposition lacks the two-thirds of seats in the legislature required
to hold a referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>Still, the "pan-blue" alliance opted to move ahead with the
process, calculating that a prolonged public debate over corruption
allegations could further weaken the president and even force him to
resign, strengthening the hand of the opposition ahead of the 2008
presidential election, political analysts said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong looks forward to a "satisfactory
solution" to Taiwan's partaking in the Government Procurement
Agreement (GPA) and has never adopted a negative stance on relevant
issues, a Hong Kong official stationed at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-based economic and trade news BNA reported earlier this
month that Taiwan completed its GPA partaking negotiations in
December 2002, but it has so far failed to join the system because
China opposes the designation of Taiwan's government agencies to be
subject to the GPA regulations, particularly its central government
organs, such as the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the
Ministry of National Defense. In Beijing's view, the names of those
agencies imply Taiwan's statehood.</P>
      <P>The BNA report also said as China is not a GPA signatory, its
opposition to Taiwan's participation in the WTO-affiliated GPA was
conveyed by Hong Kong on its behalf.</P>
      <P>The BNA quoted a Hong Kong delegate at the WTO as clarifying
Saturday that the Hong Kong government has never opposed Taiwan's
entry to the GPA and is hopeful that problems regarding Taiwan's
entry can be resolved fairly and satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong official further said that Hong Kong authorities
have never expressed opposition to any issues regarding Taiwan's GPA
entry, including the designation issue.</P>
      <P>The GPA commission passed last week a resolution initiated by the
European Union and the United States on the "GPA partaking formula, "
which is expected to help clear "political barriers" for Taiwan to
join the GPA soon.</P>
      <P>The resolution states that the names or terms used in protocols,
documents and appendices regarding a customs territory's partaking in
the GPA are mainly for defining its promises and bearing no
"sovereignty" implications.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined the WTO under the name of "Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" in January 2002. China
is also a WTO member, but has not joined the GPA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FEMALE VOLUNTEER RECRUIT PROGRAM SURPASSES MND EXPECTATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense's (MND's)
2006 volunteer recruit program, in which the military originally
targeted to recruit 100 female volunteer soldiers, has been met
enthusiastically by young women, MND officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Inquiries about the female volunteer recruit program were so
numerous that the MND decided to increase the number of openings from
100 to 604, MND officials said.</P>
      <P>For the first time in Taiwan's history, the military began to
recruit female volunteer soldiers this year in a program in which a
total of 8,504 volunteers, including females, were originally
expected to be recruited. The number has also been boosted to 13,500
by MND to meet the demand, the officials reported.</P>
      <P>According to Armed Forces Reserve Command officials, more than 20
percent of those who have visited the MND's Web site to enquire about
the volunteer recruit program have been women.</P>
      <P>The officials said that more and more women are showing interest
in joining the military, adding that this will make the armed forces'
recruitment efforts easier.</P>
      <P>The recruits will receive a minimum monthly salary of NT$27,775
(US$868). They will also be entitled to more pay for performing extra
duties. They will also be allowed to attend various professional
training programs that will help them find employment after they
leave the military.</P>
      <P>The MND launched the volunteer recruitment system in May 2005,
when the first batch of 472 volunteer soldiers were recruited.</P>
      <P>The Defense Ministry hopes that volunteer recruits will
eventually form the bulk of the nation's armed forces, or represent
at least a 60:40 ratio of volunteers to national service draftees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA PROMOTES NEW CHICKEN FEED WITH PROBIOTICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has
released a new kind of chicken feed containing probiotics with the
aim of replacing existing feed that is laced with antibiotics, a COA
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The official said that although imported chicken is cheap, local
customers still prefer domestic fowl. He added, however, that the
domestic chicken sometimes poses a health hazard because it is dosed
so heavily with antibiotics.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the solution to the problem is to invent a
probiotic substitute with the same effect as antibiotics, increasing
the incentive for chicken raisers to give up using antibiotics.</P>
      <P>According to COA research, the new chicken feed -- containing
bacillus natto and bacillus subtilis -- has proved effective against
coccidiosis, decreasing infection possibility by 2 percent and
reducing the death rate by 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The research results also show that the probiotic feed can
balance the bacterium groups in chicken intestines, as well as
reducing body fat and blood lipids.</P>

      <P>A shipment of 173 live songbirds that were
smuggled from China onto a beach on the outlying island of Kinmen
early Sunday have been destroyed, the Cabinet-level Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) reported later that day.</P>
      <P>The songbirds, including Japanese white-eyes, Siberian ruby
throats and Siberian yellow robins, were found in 20 cages that were
dumped on a beach on Little Kinmen Island, according to officers from
the CGA Kinmen operation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LITTLE CHANCE OPPOSITION RECALL MOTION WILL PASS: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  11  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is little chance that an
opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian will
pass the legislature, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
predicted Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a graduation ceremony at Southern Taiwan University
of Technology in Tainan, Wang said that if the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) follows that with a motion of no-confidence against the
Cabinet, "political turmoil will be unavoidable."</P>
      <P>He told the students, faculty and parents of graduating students
that recalling the president, toppling the premier and impeaching
top officials are the rights of the legislature.</P>
      <P>He said he expected the KMT-initiated recall-the-president motion
to be put on the legislative agenda Tuesday, when an extra session of
the legislature will likely begin.</P>
      <P>Later, in reply to media questions, Wang said the chances of the
motion passing are "not great" because the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" does not have enough votes.</P>
      <P>The alliance of the KMT and People First Party enjoy a slim
majority at the legislature, but fall short of a two-thirds majority
that is needed to pass such a motion.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its Taiwan Solidarity
Union ally, who together form the "pan-green camp, " are not likely
to support a motion to unseat Chen, even though his senior aides and
son-in-law Chao Chien-ming are being detained and investigated for
suspected involvement in a string of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>As KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has threatened to launch another
campaign to bring down the Chen government if the recall action
fails, Wang said it can be expected that Taiwan's political situation
will remain unstable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CONDEMNS ASSASSINATION REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
condemned Sunday remarks promoting an assassination of KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou spread by some unlicensed radio stations in southern
Taiwan, and demanded that Premier Su Tseng-chang and police
authorities bring the facilities in question to account.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus members issued the demand at a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang demanded that Su
immediately order the National Police Agency (NPA) to conduct an
investigation into the case and provide the public with a clear
explanation of what it is doing to apprehend those guilty of
fomenting the call to murder Ma.</P>
      <P>She also accused some "pan-green camp" elements of trying to
paralyze special telephone lines set up by the "pan-blue alliance" to
collect public endorsement for a recall motion against President Chen
Shui-bian, and asked the National Communications Commission and the
Directorate General of Telecommunications to probe the situation at
once.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao questioned Su's promise to improve
Taiwan's social order in six months when he took over the premiership
in late January this year, asking why Su has fallen short of taking
concrete action to wipe out unlicensed radio stations that air such
sensationalist remarks.</P>
      <P>Echoing Lai's comments, KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng blamed Su for
failing to give the order and blasted the Ministry of Justice, the
NPA and the Investigation Bureau for failing to initiate a probe into
the case. "This is not a Cabinet that the people can count on should
heads of relevant government agencies fail to give an explanation in
public," he said.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Fei Hung-tai said he suspects that the Democratic
Progressive Party government of using the unlawful radio stations to
air rhetoric about assassinating Ma to cement its power base.</P>
      <P>At a time when the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, the
People First Party (PFP) and the New Party have swung into full gear
to boot President Chen Shui-bian from office, either by calling a
motion to recall him or by toppling the Cabinet, due to a string of
serious corruption scandals implicating his family members and close
aides, some pro-DPP illegal radio stations in southern Taiwan began
spreading fanatic remarks igniting backers to assassinate Ma to
"protect" Chen and his so-called "Taiwanese regime."</P>
      <P>Over 30,000 "pan-blue" supporters protested Saturday on Kategalan
Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office demanding that Chen
step down to take responsibility for the series of corruption
scandals -- the second protest of its kind in as many weeks. Ma also
gave a speech at the rally.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong vowed to return to the venue this Friday
if a vote on the presidential recall motion is prevented from being
passed by "pan-green" lawmakers at an extra legislative session that
will begin this week.
</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" agreed to an extra legislative session
only after the presidential recall motion was included on its agenda
along with an eight-year NT$80 billion budget bill for a flood
control project.</P>
      <P>In response to KMT lawmakers' questions, ranking NPA officers
stressed that the agency will not tolerate violence and will provide
quick assistance to local police authorities when they need extra
forces to protect political party leaders.</P>
      <P>The NPA lacks the authority to raid illegal radio stations, but
it is poised to punish those who resort to violence at any time,
high-level NPA officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVENTORS WIN BIG AT INPEX 2006</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan inventors have again demonstrated
their ingenuity by winning numerous prizes, including six gold
medals, at the prestigious INPEX 2006 invention show held in
Pittsburgh.</P>
      <P>Displaying 27 new inventions at INPEX 2006, which took place June
7-10, Taiwan inventors took home six gold medals, four silvers and
one bronze, as well as two special prizes, representing the highest
honor of INPEX -- America's largest invention trade show -- said Chen
Tsung-tai, chairman of the Taiwan Inventor's Association, which
sponsored Taiwan's participation in INPEX 2006.</P>
      <P>All of Taiwan's 27 entries except for one earned a prize, Chen
said. The inventions, including a smoke-deterrent mask, switches made
of fabric and a supersonic wine vibrator which it is claimed makes
wine "tastier, " attracted American buyers who have offered money for
the requisition of the technologies and patent rights of some of the
inventions, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Some of the inventions were also prize-winners at the 34th Geneva
Inventions Show that was held in early April. Taiwan inventors won a
record-setting number of prizes then, including four special prizes,
15 gold medals, 13 silvers and six bronzes, marking the largest
number of honors that Taiwan has ever garnered in the annual
competition in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won two gold medals, seven bronze medals and two special
prizes in INPEX 2005.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by a Ministry of Economic Affairs
office in charge of investment and trade affairs in the United
States, Taiwan inventors won their first U.S. patent in 1973. Between
January 2000 and May 2006, nearly 5,000 Taiwan products have obtained
U.S. patent rights, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECALL MOTION JUST HORS D'OEUVRE OF LEGISLATURE BATTLEBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> The opposition's decision to launch a campaign to recall
President Chen Shui-bian, to be followed with a no-confidence motion
against Premier Su Tseng-chang if that fails, has triggered a new war
between the opposition "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green camp"
at the Legislative Yuan, which is to decide Monday on a time schedule
and agenda for an extra session.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng has predicted that there
is little chance that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -initiated
recall motion will pass the legislature because the opposition does
not have enough votes to pass the two-thirds threshold. So why are
the KMT and its ally, the People First Party (PFP), so adamant about
what appears to be a doomed political scheme?</P>
      <P>Analysts say the KMT wants to use the recall campaign to maintain
momentum to unseat the president, whose son-in-law and senior aides
are embroiled in a string of corruption scandals, using that momentum
to add pressure on a government led by what they see as a tainted
president.</P>
      <P>KMT strategists say if the recall motion cannot pass the
legislature during its summer extra session, the party in the fall
session will put forth a more feasible proposal to topple the Cabinet
led by Premier Su Tseng-chang, who was appointed without legislative
approval by the scandal-ridden president.</P>
      <P>These two legislative moves, plus street demonstrations, are
aimed at the ultimate goal of unseating what they claim is a corrupt
regime.</P>
      <P>A no-confidence vote on the premier requires only half of the
legislative votes, which is exactly what the "pan-blue alliance" has
in the current legislature.</P>
      <P>Liao Feng-teh, who is in charge of the KMT's organizational
development, has said KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou is aware of the risks
of the no-confidence motion, but the party has held "war games" for a
possible re-election following the overthrow of the Su Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun has
declared that he will ask the president to dissolve the legislature
if the opposition succeeds in bringing down the Cabinet, which he
points out is led by a competent premier who has nothing to do with
the corruption charges dogging the president.</P>
      <P>With "dissolving the legislature" as a firewall, the DPP is
confident that "pan-blue alliance" will not dare call a no-confidence
vote on Su.</P>
      <P>One reason for the DPP's confidence is that the KMT plan might
not be supported by its PFP ally, a small party that will likely be
"marginalized" in the envisioned legislative election, which will
elect only 113 -- or half of the current number of seats -- in a
"single constituency, two votes" system that is seen as unfavorable
to small parties.</P>
      <P>A DPP lawmaker points out that no-one in the current legislature
would like to end their terms in office and go into battle for a new
term so early. "Since there are so many conflicts of personal
interest and contradictions, it will not be difficult for the DPP to
abort the KMT plan," he added.</P>
      <P>Another DPP insider even foresees the prospect of the PFP
fighting the KMT for "pan-blue" nominations in the new election,
whereas the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union
will stand firmly together to create a battle line across which a
"united pan-green camp" will overwhelm a "divided pan-blue alliance"
to snatch the legislative majority.</P>
      <P>The rules of the next election battle will be a problem as the
zoning and other measures, including the design of the ballot, for
carrying out the election for a new Legislative Yuan have not yet
been completed by the Central Election Commission (CEC).</P>
      <P>Under the law, such an election must be held within 60 days of
the president disbanding the legislature. People will go to the polls
to cast their "two-in-one" ballots -- one for an individual candidate
and the other for a political party -- to elect 79 "regional" members
and 34 "national and overseas" members of the nation's seventh
legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang has said that just rezoning the constituencies will be a
point of contention, as disputes over this are still heard inside the
political parties. "When the CEC submits its new zoning draft to the
legislature, the parties will squabble endlessly over it, " he
predicts.</P>
      <P>Matching measures for implementing the "single constituency, two
votes" system have also yet to be adopted. An Executive Yuan proposal
for amending the election law for that purpose is still lying on the
Legislative Yuan's back burner.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan and the CEC could hurry up in presenting a
proposal for the new rules, but controversy cannot be avoided in the
legislature, whose members are good at little other than political
bickering.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LEADER BLAMES GOVERNMENT FOR LAX FLOOD RELIEF OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou criticized the Executive Yuan Sunday for failing to use
a reserve fund for relief operations in flood-affected areas in
southern Taiwan following more than 10 days of torrential rain across
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments after presiding over a ceremony at the
Taipei city government in which Ma, who is also Taipei mayor,
presented an official flag to a Taipei city task force that will head
for southern regions to assist in relief work there after flooding
caused by heavy rainfall wreaked havoc in local townships.</P>
      <P>Ma blamed the Cabinet for mixing up flood prevention projects and
flood relief operations at this critical time on the grounds that the
government, instead of using a reserve fund -- an allocation of
NT$7.5 billion in budget per year -- to better conduct the ongoing
flood relief operations, it is asking for a special budget of NT$80
billion for an eight-year flood control program.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ma's criticism, Government Information Office
Director-General Cheng Wen-tsan claimed that Ma "lacks a full
understanding of the matter, " arguing that the Executive Yuan hopes
for the NT$80 billion budget to clear the Legislative Yuan in the
coming extra session to allow construction of relevant flood control
projects to be started earlier and therefore to help with flood
relief more quickly.</P>
      <P>The reserve fund is aimed at conducting relief operations, while
the flood prevention program will help wipe out the cause of flooding,
and the two are complementary, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan the same
day, KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang urged President Chen
Shui-bian not to try to pass the buck of the current flooding in
southern Taiwan to the opposition "pan-blue alliance" by claiming
that it is a result of the failed passage of the NT$80 billion budget
bill at the "pan-blue"-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The flooding is proof of the DPP government's incompetence over
the past six years, according to Pan, who questioned what the
government has effectively done with so much resources and budgets
every year. She made it clear that the "pan-blue" camp will no doubt
seek to recall Chen because of his inability to lead, his abuse of
power and corruption.</P>
      <P>Pan said that Chen must never lie again to the public and pointed
out that the passage of the NT$80 billion budget is no guarantee of
no more flooding.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" and the "pan-green" camps agreed to hold an extra
legislative session that will begin this week, in which both the
presidential recall motion and the NT$80 billion flood control
project have been listed as top key issues for discussion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, damage to the agriculture sector resulting from recent
torrential rain has totaled NT$550 million (US$17.2 million) ,
according to the newest statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>COA officials said that prices of vegetables and fruit, which
have surged by over 20 percent in recent days, will stabilize in two

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese ban on its media from commenting
on Taiwan's political turmoil was cited Sunday by the Taiwan
authorities as an indication of the country's backwardness in terms
of democratic development.</P>
      <P>Johnnason Liu, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
said China is worried that political comments in its media on
Taiwan's political struggles could inspire its people to seek more
freedom of the press and freedom of expression, both of which are
hallmarks of democracy.</P>
      <P>China might be able to silence its media but it has difficulty
prohibiting its people from discussing Taiwan on the Internet and its
limitations on freedom of speech could prompt a backlash among its
people, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>A mature democracy should give its media free scope to discuss
political developments in other places, which would help its people
understand the outside world, Liu said, adding that China should
allow its media to freely cover Taiwan's events, warts and all.</P>
      <P>China's Central Propaganda Department imposed the ban last month
when Chinese media were scrambling to carry stories about the
political scandals unfolding in Taiwan involving members of the first
family and President Chen Shui-bian's close aides.</P>
      <P>The Chinese media have monitored closely the development of the
scandals that have snowballed into a political struggle with the
opposition Kuomintang and People First Party seeking to oust the
president and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party rallying behind
the beset president.</P>

      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Huang Chih-fang
has postponed publicizing a "diplomatic strategy" report and
assigning of key personnel to several overseas posts as the domestic
politics turned tense over an opposition campaign to recall President
Chen Shui-bian, officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>They said that while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs looked like
"a pool of stagnant water" now, cooperation projects and exchanges of
visits were still going on, with major operations being conducted in
a low profile.</P>
      <P>Since he took over the post four months ago, Huang has weathered
such diplomatic storms as the president's decisions to cease the
function of the National Unification Council (UNC) and to cancel
transit schedules in the United States, and Huang's own visit to the
United Arab Emirates.</P>
      <P>The UNC controversy, both at home and abroad, is one of the
reasons for the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of Kuomintang and
People First Party to launch a campaign to recall the president, who
the alliance charged with creating tension with Taiwan's key ally,
-- the U.S. -- and across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The alliance's unseat-Chen Shui-bian campaign was triggered by
the recent judicial investigation and detention of Chen's son-in-law
Chao Chien-ming and senior aides, who are embroiled in a string of
corruption scandals including insider trading and influence peddling.</P>
      <P>The officials said another reason for Huang to delay his

Security Council's national security report, which created a

      <P>Besides putting off his "diplomatic strategy" report, Huang has
also deferred appointments of two deputy ministers and top diplomats

      <P>The minister has instructed his staff to explain to the

    <TEXT>Taiwan inventors have again demonstrated
their ingenuity by winning numerous prizes, including 13 gold medals,
at the prestigious INPEX 2006 invention show held in Pittsburgh.

Displaying 27 new inventions at INPEX 2006, which took place June
7-10, Taiwan inventors took home 13 gold medals, 11 silvers and 9
bronzes, as well as three special prizes, representing the highest
honor of INPEX -- America's largest invention trade show -- said Chen
Tsung-tai, chairman of the Taiwan Inventor's Association, which
sponsored Taiwan's participation in INPEX 2006.

All of Taiwan's 27 entries except for one earned at least a prize,
Chen said. The inventions, including a smoke-deterrent mask, switches
made of fabric and a supersonic wine vibrator which it is claimed
makes wine "tastier, " attracted American buyers who have offered
money for the requisition of the technologies and patent rights of
some of the inventions, according to Chen.

Some of the inventions were also prize-winners at the 34th Geneva
Inventions Show that was held in early April. Taiwan inventors won a
record-setting number of prizes then, including four special prizes,
15 gold medals, 13 silvers and six bronzes, marking the largest
number of honors that Taiwan has ever garnered in the annual
competition in Switzerland.

Taiwan won two gold medals, seven bronze medals and two special
prizes in INPEX 2005.

According to tallies compiled by a Ministry of Economic Affairs
office in charge of investment and trade affairs in the United
States, Taiwan inventors won their first U.S. patent in 1973. Between
January 2000 and May 2006, nearly 5,000 Taiwan products have obtained
U.S. patent rights, the officials said.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS MEET TO DECIDE WHETHER EXTRA SESSION NEEDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan held an informal
meeting Monday to discuss whether and when an extraordinary session
will be convened as well as the session's agenda.</P>
      <P>Legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who convened negotiations
among legislators across the political spectrum at 10 a.m. Monday
over the much-talked-about extra legislative session, said that if a
consensus cannot be reached on the schedule and agenda of the session
in Monday's informal meeting, a vote will be held to decide matters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ker Chien-ming, a legislative caucus whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , made an appeal to the
opposition lawmakers to let pressing bills concerning the people's
welfare, including a flood-prevention budget, top the agenda of the
extra session.</P>
      <P>Ker termed the opposition Kuomintang's and the People First
Party's intention of putting a motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian at the top of the extra session's agenda as "using the
extra session as a tool of political dogfighting and mudslinging."</P>
      <P>Ker called for the opposition legislators to forsake their
"political persecution bid" and instead focus their energy on bills
pertaining to the people's wellbeing. He said that if the opposition
insists on putting the recall motion at the top of the extra
session's agenda, a vote at the informal meeting will then be
unavoidable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Chairman James Soong planted himself at the PFP
legislative caucus Monday to ensure that the recall motion is placed
at the top of the agenda.</P>
      <P>Soong said a day earlier that PFP-initiated street rallies will
not cease until the day the president is unseated.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has also planned a series of new
public rallies islandwide calling for the recall of Chen, including
one in the central county of Changhua on June 17 and another in
Taipei City on a day yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP enjoys a slim
majority in the legislature but falls far short of the two-thirds
majority that is needed to pass a recall motion.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its Taiwan Solidarity
Union ally, who together form the "pan-green camp, " are not likely
to support a motion to unseat Chen, even though his senior aides and
son-in-law Chao Chien-ming are being detained and investigated for
suspected involvement in a string of corruption scandals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has the highest incidence of urenia,
a kidney disease, in the world, with 385 new cases for every 1
million people every year, a National Cheng Kung University Hospital
doctor said Monday.</P>
      <P>Nephrologist Sung Junne-ming also said the counties of Yunlin,
Chiayi and Tainan in southern Taiwan have the highest incidence of
urenia in Taiwan, averaging 514 new cases per one million people
annually.</P>
      <P>Sung noted that a U.S. kidney research organization found that
the number of patients in Taiwan that require dialysis is around
42,000, or the highest figure in the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan spends up to NT$25 billion (US$769.23 million) on dialysis
every year. This, along with the NT$40 billion spent on dealing with
related complications, accounts for the largest portion of national
health insurance spending.</P>
      <P>He said that the early symptoms of kidney disease are not
apparent and that 50 percent of the patients have no symptoms in the
initial stages and could easily miss early treatment.</P>
      <P>He urged people in high-risk groups for kidney disease, such as
seniors, smokers, those from families with a history of kidney
disease, and those with high blood pressure, diabetes, or urine with
abnormal levels, to be on guard.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will donate computer equipment and
send information engineers to its diplomatic allies in Africa to
establish "Taiwan Information Centers, " Minister of Foreign Affairs
Huang Chih-fang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the information centers will provide computer
hardware, Internet connection and engineers to teach locals how to
connect to cyberspace and the wider world.</P>
      <P>He said that the idea of establishing the information centers
came to him when he visited several African countries in April. He
said he found that young people in Taiwan's diplomatic allies in
Africa are eager to learn about computers and gain access to
information but that governmental institutions in these countries
have trouble acquiring enough computer hardware.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that establishing the information centers won't
cost much and will help many African people as well as win friendship
from their governments.</P>
      <P>He said that many countries admire Taiwan's achievements in
high-tech and computer technology and hope that Taiwan can help them
digitize their government administrative operations and make them
more efficient. He added that Taiwan is going to make more efforts in
this direction in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS SET SCHEDULE, AGENDA FOR EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan decided Monday to
convene an extraordinary legislative session June 13-30 to handle 14
bills, including an opposition-initiated motion to recall President
Chen Shui-bian and a flood-control budget bill.</P>
      <P>After two rounds of voting at an informal meeting, legislators
from across the political spectrum finalized the time schedule and
agenda of the extra session at a time when the opposition has been
heaping pressure on Chen to step down while the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party insists that an extra session should be convened
only to review budgets related to flood-fighting and other issues
pertaining to the people's welfare.</P>
      <P>The voting on the legislative extra session's schedule and agenda
proceeded in an unexpectedly calm atmosphere at the Legislative Yuan,
except for some slight pushing and pulling during debates.</P>
      <P>Other bills that the legislators decided to deal with in the
upcoming extraordinary session include a budget bill for an overhaul
of Shihmen Dam, budget bills for state-owned enterprises, special
budgets to expand infrastructure, and revisions to the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Bills concerning the redistricting for legislative elections, an
amendment to an act on treatment for retired presidents and vice
presidents, as well as development projects in offshore areas -- all
matters that remained unaddressed when the last session ended May 30
-- have also been included in the extra session's agenda.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong said that PFP-initiated street rallies will not cease until the
day the president is unseated.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has also planned a series of new
public rallies islandwide calling for the recall of Chen, including
one in the central county of Changhua on June 17 and another in
Taipei City on a day yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP has
decided to push to recall President Chen, believing his leadership is
in doubt in the wake of a spate of corruption allegations implicating
his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" enjoys a slim majority in the legislature
but falls far short of the two-thirds majority that is needed to pass
a recall motion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will nominate a candidate to run in the year-end Taipei mayoral
election before the party's national congress opens July 17, DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Monday. </P>
      <P>Yu declined to talk about who is likely to represent the DPP in
the election, only indicating that Legislator Yu Chin, whose
application to run in the DPP primary was withdrawn last month due to
a lack of required documents, has not given up his efforts to win the
nomination.</P>
      <P>Because of Yu Chin's determination to run in the Taipei election,
former Premier Frank Hsieh, regarded as the DPP's best bet for the
Taipei mayoral race, has continued to decline calls for him to run,
according to the party.</P>
      <P>Hsieh has said that he will only consent to run if there are no
others within the party seeking the nomination.</P>
      <P>In order to persuade the influential and popular politician to
represent the party in the election, efforts are being made to

    <HEADLINE>FRENCH PRIEST DOUBLES AS RECYCLER TO SUPPORT HANDICAPPED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>French Catholic Father Yves Moal, who has
been preaching in Taiwan for the past 40 years, is supporting a home
for the handicapped in Hualien, eastern Taiwan with funds he earns by
collecting recyclable garbage.</P>
      <P>Moal, who is better known in Taiwan by his Chinese name, Father
Liu Yi-feng, preaches at his church located in Yuli, Hualien every
Sunday, manages the Andrew Handicapped Center located in the annex of
the church and toils at a dump in a Yuli suburb as a recycler in
between.</P>
      <P>Moal earned NT$10 by selling a bundle of used newspapers eight
years ago, which began his garbage collecting career. Today, Father
Liu is a symbol of "turning dirt into fortune" in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently, Moal's Andrew Handicapped Center accommodates 43
mentally and physically challenged people aged between eight and 40.
Of them, four adults work at the church's dump, earning
money for themselves and for the church as well.</P>
      <P>The dump, where residents of nearby boroughs send their
recyclable waste, has been a hen laying golden eggs for the church.
An average of NT$500,000 is generated from the plant each year for
Moal, enabling him to operate the handicapped center and support the
residents' daily lives. The center also gets government subsidies.</P>
      <P>Moal, who was assigned to Taiwan at the age of 25 as a missionary
by the Paris Foreign Mission Society, is often mistaken for a garbage
collector, but when asked if he ever gets tired of his "dirty work,"
the energetic father says: "There's gold in that garbage."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SETS TONE FOR EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) set the tone Monday for the coming
extra legislative session, deciding to focus attention on a
flood-fighting budget bill while seeking to hold off discussion of
some disputed bills.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan resolved earlier that same day that an extra
session will be held June 13-30, and voted to list 14 bills on its
agenda, including an opposition "pan-blue alliance"-initiated
presidential recall motion and the flood prevention project bill.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said following a DPP
legislative caucus meeting that the party is determined to push the
flood control budget bill through the legislative session but will
oppose the motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian until the end.</P>
      <P>Amid the many corruption allegations implicating family members
and close aides of Chen that have pushed the DPP's public approval
rating to ever-descending record lows, Lin said the party will run
advertisements in local media in an attempt to clear the many
suspicious cases with what he claimed is "concrete evidence."</P>
      <P>The next round of the DPP's publicity campaign will center on
"democracy versus political infighting, " "truth versus blowing out
scandals" and "law and order versus corruption," Lin said.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-ming demanded that main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou first heed bills
related to public interest instead of engaging in political strife.</P>
      <P>Ker urged Ma to firmly stand his ground and not to be blackmailed
by its "pan-blue alliance" partner the People First Party (PFP) ,
which initiated the presidential recall motion that the ruling party
claims would "hinder" national development.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-jin warned the "pan-blue alliance" of
"serious consequences" if the two parties provoke confrontation. The
Taiwan people are hoping for political stability and a normal life,
she added.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen told a news conference that her
party gave a thumbs-up to the Legislative Yuan's decision to hold an
extra session and said the KMT will seek to promote the passage of
the presidential recall motion, the flood control budget bill and
other bills critical to people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Insisting that the presidential recall motion and the flood
prevention project bill are not contradictory and that both matters
can be dealt with in the extra legislative session, Cheng said the
DPP must not turn a deaf ear to what she claimed is "the people's
call" for Chen to step down and must not try to divert public
attention from the issue by releasing "misinformation."</P>
      <P>Attempting to do so will just underscore the DPP's image of
inability to govern the country over the past six years, she added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the DPP's plan to mobilize supporters to take to
the streets to protect Chen and what his party has taken to calling
his "Taiwanese regime, " Cheng told the DPP that as the governing
party, it should not "boss people around on the streets."</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting public pressure for Chen to step down,
the DPP should realize that it is not right to shun the issue and
should instead face up to the public anger by taking concrete
measures, she said.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong has vowed to return to Kategalan
Boulevard Friday to stage a protest if a vote on the presidential
recall motion is again disrupted by the pan-green lawmakers of the
DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang expressed deep
disappointment Monday after the Legislative Yuan decided to include a
motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian on the agenda of an
extraordinary session of the legislature set to be held June 13-30.</P>
      <P>The Procedure Committee passed the proposal of the main

and said the case will be reviewed June 21-23 and June 26 on the

      <P>The opposition initiated the recall motion, believing Chen's
leadership is in doubt following a spate of corruption allegations
against his son-in-law and close aides.
</P>
      <P>The premier expressed disappointment after a luncheon with ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Ker
Chien-ming, DPP caucus whip in the legislature. Ker later said that

      <P>Cheng Wen-tsan, minister of the Government Information Office,
said that over the past six years, the extraordinary session of the
legislature has had simple missions and each time it has achieved
fruitful results.</P>
      <P>Cheng expressed the hope that this extraordinary session will be
no exception and that it will focus on issues related to the public
and the economy.</P>
      <P>He lashed out at the opposition parties for "putting politics
before public interest" and expressed hope that the opposition
parties will focus on bills related to flood-control, budgets for
state-owned enterprises and for 10 new construction projects, saying
that national development should not stop because of the stalled
bills.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
Monday that people can still claim unemployment pay if they take a
short-term job.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that since jobless people need time to adjust
when seeking new jobs, if they land a job but leave before two weeks,
it will be regarded as a case of "uncertain employment."</P>
      <P>However, those who are on fixed-term contracts, such as temporary
staff or replacement teachers, will be deemed as involuntary
departures if they leave when their contracts expire and will be
eligible for unemployment pay one month after they leave their old
jobs and have not landed a new job.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP FACTION PLEDGES FULL SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Tide faction of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pledged Monday to support
President Chen Shui-bian in his bid to "continue leading the Taiwan
sovereigntist regime."</P>
      <P>The New Tide faction, seen as the most disciplined and cohesive
among the DPP's factions, threw its support behind a besieged Chen
after the legislature decided to go ahead with an
opposition-initiated motion to recall the president, whose senior
aides and son-in-law are being detained or investigated for suspected
involvement in a string of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai, convener of the New Tide faction, said
his group opposes the recall motion and an expected no-confidence
motion against Premier Su Tseng-chang, claiming that the campaigns
are nothing but a tool of the opposition's "political struggle"
against the DPP government.</P>
      <P>Lai was referring to James Soong, chairman of the People First
Party (PFP) , who called on "conscientious" members of the New Tide
faction to rebel against the party hierarchy by demanding that the
president step down to take moral, social and political
responsibility for the suspected wrongdoings of his senior aides and
family members.</P>
      <P>Lai rebutted Soong by claiming that governing power is temporary
while the country and its people last forever. "Now the people are
suffering floods, but the 'pan-blue alliance' is waging a political
struggle that will never be accepted by the people," Lai claimed.</P>
      <P>Former New Tide convener Tuan Yi-kang also responded to Soong's
attempt to drive a wedge between the New Tide and their DPP comrades,
saying it is dangerous in Taiwan society, which is plagued by a
tinder box of ethnic division, for a political leader to seek
personal gains at the cost of igniting that tinder box.</P>
      <P>Tuan went on to accuse KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who claims to
be a "moderate" in politics, of having been forced by Soong into
doing things that please radicals in the "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Soong was trying to provoke DPP animosity toward the New Tide and
to create a division in the DPP, Tuan said, adding that such a
strategy might work for the short term but will only serve to
aggravate political confrontations.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chung, convener of the faction's legislative caucus, said
the faction has been criticizing the DPP government's mistakes and
mis-steps, but he pointed out that there are simply no legitimate
reasons for recalling the president.</P>
      <P>By calling itself the "Taiwan sovereigntist regime, " the DPP
government and its "pan-green camp" ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union
are suggesting that both Ma and Soong have their roots in China and
are therefore unfit to lead a Taiwanese government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`NO NEED' TO SEARCH HOME OF PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW: PROSECUTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcers did not search the Taipei
residence of Chao Chien-ming, President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law
who has been detained over insider trading, because "there is no need
to do so, " a prosecutor at the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Pang-liang, Assistant Director of the Taipei District
Prosecutor's Office, said investigators have already gathered
sufficient evidence from Chao's alleged accomplices in the case, and
prosecutors in charge of the investigation believe after consulting
with detectives from the Investigation Bureau it is unnecessary to
search Chao's home.</P>
      <P>He denied news reports that day that Yen Ta-he, chief of the
Taipei District Prosecutor's Office ordered investigators in a
meeting May 21 not to search Chao's house, which used to be President
Chen Shui-bian's apartment before he was elected in 2000.</P>
      <P>Lin said Yen did huddle with two leading investigators -- not a
dozen investigators as reported -- over the case May 21, but he only
exchanged views with them about how to subpoena Chao's father Chao
Yu-chu, who is also involved in the case, and the issue of searching
the workplaces and residences of people involved in the case was not
broached.</P>
      <P>The decision to search or not to search a place is taken jointly
by the prosecutors and investigators through thorough discussion,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to opposition lawmakers' criticism that
prosecutors were pressed by their superior into making Chao's house
off-limits to investigators, although he had been held in custody
since May 25 pending the conclusion of the investigation.</P>
      <P>Lin also explained that Dr. Huang Fang-yen, a close friend of the
first family who was accused by an opposition lawmaker of relaying to
first lady Wu Shu-jen a huge amount of gift vouchers given by a
businessman, has been subpoenaed by the prosecutors but has asked for
leave of absence until next month.</P>
      <P>Lin said the prosecutors leading the investigation of that
allegation will decide what to do next.</P>
      <P>Huang, the deputy superintendent of the Shin Kong Hospital in
Taipei, is currently in the United States for treatment of prostate
cancer.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers claim that he fled the country after being
tipped off by friends in government that he was targeted for
questioning by investigators looking into the alleged scandal
surrounding the first lady.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEEDS TO BREAK MYTH OF 'GIFTED EDUCATION CLASS': SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academics and experts in education called
on the government, the educational sector and parents Monday to work
together in an effort to break the myth of the "gifted education
class" -- a system criticized for having seriously distorted Taiwan's
gifted education system.</P>
      <P>They made the call during a forum held at the College of
Education of National Taiwan Normal University by the private
Education Reconstruction Front to review the education reforms that
the government has carried out over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>"Why must the child be in a gifted class? " was the topic of the
forum amid public concern over the issue after four county and city
governments in central Taiwan held a joint examination May 13 to
select "gifted" sixth-grade students in order to place them in
so-called "excellent classes" in junior high school.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-yuan, a Tamkang University associate professor of
economics, blamed the existence of such "special classes" on the
demand of Taiwan people for a "university degree, " saying that most
people regard university as the only way for them to find a good job
or to have high social status.</P>
      <P>However, the trend among youths to spend all their energy on
seeking a "perfect" academic performance has only caused problems
like "over education, " which sees many university graduates seek an
advanced education merely because they want a higher social status or
a better job, and the problem of "distorted gifted education," which
sees a concentration of education resources on the "gifted class"
students.</P>
      <P>The May 13 gifted students selection examination drew protests
from many teachers and parents who claim the test is a tactic by
public junior high schools to "divide their future students into
classes according to their academic performance."</P>
      <P>Over 20,000 students from elementary schools in Taichung City and
the counties of Taichung, Changhua and Nantou took part in the joint
exam to strive for a place in one of the few privileged "gifted
classes."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said
Monday that the ministry is studying subsidies and other social
welfare measures to deal with declining birth rates and an aging
society.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks at a meeting with academics, experts and
leaders of social welfare groups in Kaoshiung, southern Taiwan, which
is part of the ministry's preparation for one of the topics on the
agenda of a planned national economic conference -- how to deal with
the impact of an aging society and declining birth rates, as well as
a national pension system.</P>
      <P>Ministry of the Interior (MOI) officials said the birth rate was
9.06 percent in 2005, compared with 49.97 percent in 1951. The
elderly aged over 65 were 9.74 percent in 2005, compared with 2.5
percent in 1949 and 7 percent in 1993.</P>
      <P>To avoid younger generations having to shoulder the heavy
responsibility of supporting the elderly at a rate of every 3.3 young
person having to support one elderly person in 2026 from the current
7.4 youths, the ministry is studying whether to promote subsides for
birth, nursing and the opening of a national pension system.</P>
      <P>Lee said the national pension system will mainly target those who
have yet to be covered by social security, estimated at around 2.7
million people.</P>
      <P>He also said the ministry is studying whether to have the surplus
of the public welfare lottery and a hike in business tax by 1 percent
to finance the extra spending. If there is still a shortfall, then
the central government will appropriate budgets, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU MAY STAGE RALLY JUNE 27 TO PROTEST PRESIDENTIAL RECALL VOTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), a minor
opposition party in league with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), said Monday it might stage a rally June 27 to "surround
the legislature with 100,000 people, " at a time when the legislature
will likely be voting on an opposition-initiated motion to recall the
president.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, executive director of the TSU's Policy Committee,
said the mass rally is aimed at protesting the "pan-blue alliance's
unreasonable campaign" to recall President Chen Shui-bian and at
protecting "Taiwan's sovereign regime" led by Chen.</P>
      <P>The recall move by the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
alliance has triggered a sense of crisis in the TSU and its
"pan-green camp" ally, the DPP, as they perceived Taiwan's sovereign
government in danger of being toppled by the KMT and PFP, and led by
Ma Ying-jeou and James Soong -- whose roots in China have led people
like TSU's spiritual leader, former president Lee Teng-hui, to call
the former KMT government "an alien regime."</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, Vice President Annette Lu will
replace Chen if he is recalled.</P>
      <P>Ho said the pan-blue alliance's motion to recall the president,
which he claimed is "unlikely to pass the legislature, " is but a
prelude to a future no-confidence motion against Premier Su
Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>If the opposition succeeds in toppling Su's Cabinet -- which is
possible given the alliance's slim majority in the legislature -- it
will force the president to choose between sacking Su and dissolving
the Legislative Yuan, Ho said.</P>
      <P>If Chen dissolves the current legislature, the pan-blue alliance
will try to win two-thirds of the 113 seats in the new legislature,
he said, noting this will provide the pan-blues another chance to
launch a second presidential recall motion.</P>
      <P>He called on Chen to beware of the pan-blues' strategy and to
"stand firm and never give in to opposition pressure."</P>
      <P>For his part, he said the TSU would like to help Chen by holding
a mass rally to surround the legislature on June 27 to protest the
pan-blue alliance's attempt to overthrow "Taiwan's sovereign regime."</P>

      <P>According to Tsung, blood donation centers in schools usually
close over the summer vacation. However, summer is the season when
people do more outdoor activities and get into more accidents, and
therefore in need of more blood transfusions, Tsung added.</P>
      <P>As the main theme of this year's World Blood Donor Day, which
falls in June 14, is "commitment, " Tsung encouraged current and
future blood donors to make a pledge to donate regularly.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two coast guard vessels are on their way to
open seas near Japan's Iwo Jima island in the Pacific Ocean to
intercept a Taiwanese fishing boat whose skipper was allegedly killed
by Chinese crewmembers last weekend, officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Paohsing and Hohsing patrol vessels, with SWAT team officers
and criminal investigation agents aboard, have been assigned to help
the Hsinglung fishing boat from the Suao fishing port in northeast
Yilan County, the officials said, adding that the two patrols are
expected to catch up with the Hsinglung in three or four days.</P>
      <P>According to a report from Taiwan's representative office in
Yokohama, the Japanese coast guard received a distress call from the
Suao-based fishing boat June 10. In addition to relaying the message
to Taiwan, Japan's coast guard dispatched a surveillance plane to
search for the Taiwanese fishing boat.</P>
      <P>Japanese coast guard officers discovered that the Taiwanese
skipper, identified as Chen Mu-tsai, was killed Saturday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu quoted the report
by the Yokohama representative office as saying the boat is being
"closely monitored" by Japanese coast guard authorities.</P>
      <P>Lu said the Hsinglung, which had been operating in high seas near
Iwo Jima since March this year, is sailing northwestward. As Japan is
not in a position to deal with the case, Lu said Taiwan's coast guard
authorities have decided to dispatch two patrol vessels to intercept
the boat.</P>
      <P>The latest reports said the boat's Taiwanese first mate, Huang
Chin-hsing, has remained missing since Saturday.</P>
      <P>Besides the Taiwanese skipper and first mate, the Hsinglung crew
also included eight Chinese fishery workers. </P>
      <P>It was the second time that the boat's two Taiwanese crew members
have been overpowered by Chinese fishery workers onboard. In August
200, Chen and Huang were held hostage by nine Chinese crewmen who
then steered the Hsinglung to Hawaii. The Chinese crewmen were
arrested by U.S. immigration authorities upon arrival. At first, Chen
and Huang were also taken into custody and the Hsinglung was
impounded by U.S. authorities because the Chinese crewmen accused the
duo of having helped them sneak into Hawaii.</P>
      <P>The Yilan Prosecutor's Office sent personnel to the United States
to look into the case. Chen and Huang were indicted on charges of
helping smuggle Chinese fishery workers into the United States, but
they were later acquitted.</P>

premium quality rice, a COA spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the trading center located in Tainan, southern

Hualien, eastern Taiwan, opens July 6.</P>
      <P>The northern Taiwan center in Taoyuan City and the central Taiwan
center in Yuanlin township, Changhuan County, will begin to provide
services in the second half of November.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that officials from the COA's Agriculture and

buyers with suppliers.</P>
      <P>He said all rice products offered at these centers must meet
requirements of Grade 1 and Grade 2 of the Chinese National

places of origin, names of rice varieties and certification to prove
they were harvested less than one year ago.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that there are no restrictions on buyers,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A dozen pro-Taiwan independence groups
announced Monday that they will rally on Kategalan Boulevard Saturday
to show support for President Chen Shui-bian amid the opposition's
efforts to recall him.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the groups, including the Northern Taiwan
Society and the World United Formosans for Independence (WUFI), made
the announcement at a joint news conference in which they urged the
public to take to the streets "to display their support for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to Northern Taiwan Society Chairman Wu Shu-min, the
current woes faced by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration are mainly the result of its failure to make a "clean
sweep" when it took over the presidency from the Kuomintang (KMT) six
years ago, claiming that many corruption scandals originated from the
KMT era.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the recent string of corruption scandals allegedly
involving Chen's family members and close aides, Wu said he will send
a letter to Premier Su Tseng-chang and Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin
asking them to treat political figures and all people that have
committed wrongdoings with the same standards.</P>
      <P>WUFI Secretary-General Mao Ching-feng asked the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" not to further rehash relevant cases and demand
Chen's resignation, claiming that more political maneuvering will only
lead to greater confrontation.</P>
      <P>The June 17 rally was originally feared likely to bring to
a boil the confrontation between the "pan-blue alliance" and the
"pan-green camp," as the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) were to
hold a demonstration a day earlier at the same venue and said that
they would never leave if "pan-green" lawmakers disrupt a
presidential recall motion at the Legislative Yuan Friday.</P>
      <P>But a new development suggested that the confrontation might be
headed off as PFP Chairman James Soong said late Monday that they
might hold the demonstration at a later date, pending the agenda of
the Legislative Yuan as to when to deal with the presidential recall
motion.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, he will visit the Legislative Yuan Tuesday to
make sure PFP lawmakers vote to have the presidential recall motion
included at the Procedure Committee to allow the motion to be handled
Friday along with a bill relating to a budget for a flood control
project.</P>

Prisoners' Ruse Is Inquiry Focus at Guantanamo

Three detainees at the United States
military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
tried to conceal themselves in their cells --

prevent guards from seeing them commit suicide,
Military officials said one focus of an

      <P>Bilateral tourism has also been cordial, with tourist visits

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Hong Kong newspaper questioned Tuesday
why Chinese media cannot expose high-level corruption as media do in
Taiwan, whose president is facing a recall motion in the legislature
as a result of media reports about corruption scandals allegedly
involving the president's family and close aides.</P>
      <P>A columnist said in the Ming Pao daily that ever since the first
family of President Chen Shui-bian came under fire for its suspected
involvement in a string of corruption scandals, Beijing has reacted
with unusual silence.</P>
      <P>Some reports said Beijing has even ordered a blackout of reports
about suspected irregularities involving members of Taiwan's first
family, the Ming Pao article said.</P>
      <P>It noted that Beijing is doing so apparently not to help Chen
save face but instead out of fear that such reports could lead to an
"association of thoughts" by the Chinese people who might ask why
Chinese media cannot monitor the government like their Taiwan
counterparts.</P>
      <P>The article said when Beijing Deputy Mayor Liu Zhihhua was
dismissed for leading a "corrupt and decadent life, " not a single
national media outlet in China reported the facts about the dismissal
and Chinese authorities went so far as to ban reports of the Liu
incident.</P>
      <P>Comparing Taiwan media's aggressive exposure of high-level
wrong-doings and Chinese media's overwhelming silence over similar
incidents in China, people would come to the conclusion that only a
free press can put a stop to corruption, according to the article.</P>
      <P>It asked how anyone could believe that the Chinese leadership's
efforts to promote competency and integrity could be effective in
stamping out corruption when the deputy mayor of the capital city
cannot remain clean after years of such efforts by the central
government.</P>

      <P>The government of Tainan City, a historic
city in southern Taiwan, has decided that culture and tourism will be
two themes of its administrative policy in 2007.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai has named Hsieh Shih-chie,
secretary-general of the city government, to serve as the convener of
a preparatory commission of the upcoming "year of culture and

    <HEADLINE>DPP OPPOSITION TO RECALL MOTION WILL BE RECORDED IN HISTORY: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Timothy J.P. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Tuesday that if the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) makes an all-out effort to block the legislature's motion
to recall the president, depriving the people of their voice in the
matter, it will "leave a poor record in history."</P>
      <P>Ma reminded the DPP lawmakers that they came to power because
they used to respect the people's will.</P>
      <P>The recall motion must receive the support of two-thirds of the
legislators in a vote before it can be put to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Ma explained why he had made an about-face in the recall
campaign. He said he opposed the campaign at first because it would
likely be interpreted as an attempt to wage a political battle to
seize power, but now, nearly 70 percent of the people support the
move to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>He said that although he knows it will be difficult to pass the
motion at the Legislative Yuan, the motion will leave a mark in
history and encourage the judicial authorities to shed any fear of
political pressure in their investigation and prosecution of all
those involved in corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in reply to media inquiries after a city
government meeting. He reiterated his call for the president to step
down on his own accord as this would be the least costly for society.</P>
      <P>Ma said Chen's speech on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival
showed that he had no remorse, an incident which the KMT chairman
said made him change his attitude about moving to recall the
president.</P>
      <P>He also said that the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People
First Party finally decided to propose a motion to recall the
president at the upcoming extra session of the legislature rather
than at the regular session in September because a delay would
increase the anxiety of the whole society.</P>
      <P>Citing the latest poll showing that almost 70 percent of the
people now support the recall campaign, Ma said introducing the
motion won't stir up too much trouble.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the decision to move to recall Chen was made
from the bottom up and was endorsed by a KMT plenary meeting and its
legislative caucus, so it was a sound decision.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong urged ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators Tuesday to draw a line between themselves and President
Chen Shui-bian, asking why the DPP should "tie its soul to Chen and
trample on Taiwan's democratic values."</P>
      <P>To express the PFP's determination to recall the president, Soong
sat in the PFP legislative caucus office for the second consecutive
day to monitor proceedings of a recall motion that was referred to
Committee of the Whole of the legislature Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The recall motion is a milestone in Taiwan's democratic
establishment, Soong said, adding that Taiwan will become a
third-rate country if it can't pass the examination.</P>
      <P>Soong stressed that the reason why the PFP is pushing for a
recall referendum is to promote the sense of right and wrong and the
value of justice, which he said transcend the "pan-blue" and
"pan-green" political divide.</P>
      <P>He warned that the moral foundation of the country will be
destroyed if it allows corruption scandals to be left undealt with.</P>
      <P>Soong said saving Taiwan at all costs is the PFP's main purpose
at this point in time, adding that he would like to salute the
legislature for having launched the recall process.</P>
      <P>PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng pointed to the recent
example of "people power" forcing the prime minister to step down in
Thailand.</P>
      <P>"If the Thais can do it, we in the Republic of China can too," he
added.</P>
      <P>The legislature is set to debate the motion later this month in
an extraordinary session, while the president will have a chance to
answer opposition charges against him before the legislature 
votes on the motion on June 27.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan sent an official
letter to President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday asking him to make a reply
to an opposition-initiated motion to recall him, an unprecedented
legislative move to recall a president in the history of the Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>The opposition claimed they were proposing the recall based on
doubts of Chen's integrity and competency as his senior aides and
son-in-law have been detained or investigated in connection with a
string of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>The president has until June 20 to decide whether or not to
answer the opposition charges.</P>
      <P>Whether he responds or not, the Legislative Yuan will move ahead
to debate the motion June 21-23 and June 26 before putting it to a
vote June 27.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said some "pan-blue
alliance" lawmakers had hoped to invite first lady Wu Shu-jen to a
Committee of the Whole meeting dealing with the recall motion.</P>
      <P>The opposition accused Wu of involvement in illicit business
deals and accepting favors from some businesspeople, accusations that
the Presidential Office has denied.</P>
      <P>Wang said that if both the ruling and opposition parties agree to
the proposal to invite Wu, "then I will agree." But, he added, this
must be negotiated by both sides. If the negotiations break down,
then nothing can be done about it, he stressed.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is planning
to hold three large-scale public presentations in the northern,
central and southern regions of the island to introduce and publicize
the opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian,
KMT spokeswoman Chen Li-wen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a news conference at the KMT headquarters, Chen indicated that
the party plans to hold the first public presentation in Changhua,
central Taiwan on June 18, with the second one to be held in the
southern city of Kaohsiung June 24. </P>
      <P>Then, on June 25, the KMT will hold a large rally at the historic
Sungshan Tobacco Factory in downtown Taipei, along with a planned
presentation on the recall motion, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The KMT executive branch is taking over the operations of an
initiative campaign launched by the largest opposition party's caucus
at the legislature to collect signatures of voters supporting the
motion, and it is preparing to hold a signature drive at all KMT
chapters around the country in an effort to seek national support for
the motion to recall Chen, whose family and government have been
dogged by a spate of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan began the operations to review the recall

      <P>A vote in the legislature on the motion has been scheduled for

    <HEADLINE>PAN-GREENS TO PUSH FOR REFERENDUM TO RECLAIM KMT'S 'ILL-GOTTEN' ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators from the "pan-green
camp" unveiled Tuesday their plan to initiate a referendum on the
reclamation of the "ill-gotten" assets owned by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The legislators went to the Central Election Commission to pick
up a form for a public signature drive for the referendum, saying
that they hope to collect at least one million signatures although
only 80,000 are required.</P>
      <P>The move, jointly promoted by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , was retaliation
against the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance's" campaign to recall
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Citing a media report estimating the value of the KMT's assets at
NT$600 billion (US$18.4 billion) , the legislators argued that the
assets should be returned to the nation and distributed to the
people, with each person expected to get a share of NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Lin Chung-mo, the "pan-green camp"
decided to resort to a referendum because the "pan-blue alliance" has
taken advantage of its majority in the Legislative Yuan to block a
law on the handling of the KMT assets.</P>
      <P>Trong Chai, another DPP legislator, urged KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou to put forward a written statement to explain how his party
is going to deal with its assets, just like President Chen has been
required to present a written statement to the legislature to defend
himself.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Liao Pen-yen said while his party believes that
authorities should get to the bottom of the insider trading
allegations surrounding the president's son-in-law, it is "very fair"
that an exhaustive investigation is launched on the KMT assets.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, head of the TSU's policy committee, claimed that
using "people power" to resolve the issue of the KMT's ill-gotten
assets is the most suitable method.</P>
      <P>Ho accused the KMT and PFP of focusing only on political struggle
and ignoring the people's welfare for promoting a motion to recall
the president during an upcoming extra legislative session.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Lo Cih-ming said the public will be able to
sign their names in support of the referendum on the KMT assets
during an anti-recall event set for June 17.</P>
      <P>The TSU's candidates for the year-end elections for Taipei and
Kaohsiung city councilors will also help collect signatures from the
public, Lo said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said Tuesday that the DPP will set up
service centers in villages and boroughs islandwide to better
solidify grass-roots support in view of a new electoral system.</P>
      <P>At a hand-over ceremony for new head of DPP's Taichung city
office, Lin stressed that the party should strengthen solidarity
among villages and boroughs in preparation for future elections
instead of waiting for the splitting of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that according to a package of revisions to the ROC
Constitution passed in 2005, which include the downsizing of the
legislature and changes to the electoral system, the seventh
legislature beginning from 2008 will see the number of seats reduced
from the current 225 to 113, while the electoral system will be
changed from the current "multiple seats for each constituency" to a
"single seat, two ballots" system.</P>
      <P>Under the new electoral system, each voter should cast two
ballots -- one for a political party and the other for a candidate.</P>
      <P>Noting that the presidential, legislative and city and county
chief elections in the future will all be "one-on-one" fierce
competitions in each constituency, Lin said the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First Party will have to
collaborate in choosing the best candidates to vie for the posts.</P>
      <P>For the DPP, the solidarity among the party members of all
spectrums is extremely important, in addition to introducing the best
candidates for the elections, Lin stressed.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP headquarters will strength its services in
villages and boroughs in the future by offering more lectures and
training courses to grass-roots supporters.</P>

(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Any motion to recall the head of state
is "not child's play" and has to be considered carefully, which
explains why Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) seems to have been
proceeding slowly in moving to recall President Chen Shui-bian,
visiting KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lien said at a news conference attended by foreign correspondents
based in Singapore that he hasn't discussed the issue with KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, but the political ramifications of such a
motion are sure to be far-reaching and should be considered carefully
in advance.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that the threshold to recall the president is
very high and that the legislative procedures are also complicated,
adding that it is only natural for the KMT to act cautiously rather
than hastily.</P>
      <P>Now that the KMT has decided to move to recall the president,
Lien said, the party should spare no efforts to achieve its goal by

    <HEADLINE>MOJ CLARIFIES FIDH REPORT ON TAIWAN'S CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Tuesday
that Taiwan has not violated any human rights principles in its
handling of capital punishment cases or in its treatment of death-row
inmates, but it promised to refer to other countries' measures to
refine the existing system.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a report issued by FIDH -- the
French acronym of the International Federation for Human Rights -- on
Taiwan's use of capital punishment.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that an international organization has
issued a "country report" on Taiwan's use of capital punishment. The
FIDH groups 141 human rights organizations around the world with an
aim to obtain effective improvements in the protection of victims,
the prevention of human rights abuse and the prosecution of those
responsible.</P>
      <P>FIDH Vice Chairwoman Siobhan Ni Chulachain unveiled the report at
a news conference in Taipei Monday, during which she also offered
suggestions for Taiwan's government and its private sector on how to
further improve the county's human rights records. Chulachain will
present the report to President Chen Shui-bian on behalf of the FIDH.</P>
      <P>The report is expected to catch the attention of major world
human rights bodies, such as the Amnesty International and the U.N.
Human Rights Council, and may affect Taiwan's international image,
analysts said.</P>
      <P>The FIDH report made a case for Taiwan to craft a timetable for
phasing out capital punishment. Taiwan is one of 72 countries in the
world that have not abolished the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The report also claimed that Taiwan has violated the U.N.'s
minimum requirements for treatment of death-row inmates by demanding
that death-row inmates wear leg irons on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>In response, MOJ officials said the FIDH report was incorrect,
stressing that local prisons and reformatory centers have been
ordered not to use handcuffs, leg irons or legcuffs, shackles or
other such restraining gear for punitive purposes.</P>
      <P>Under prison management rules, the officials said, leg irons and
handcuffs are used only for protective purposes, meaning that only
death-row inmates who are emotionally unstable or likely to flee or
commit suicide are restrained in accordance with regulations set
forth in the Criminal Procedure Code.</P>
      <P>"We have not been in violation of relevant U.N. rules, " an MOJ
official said.</P>
      <P>As to the FIDH's suspicions that local death-row inmates might
have been forced to donate their organs before execution, the MOJ
official said such speculation and concerns are unfounded.</P>
      <P>Of the 12 death-rown inmates executed between 2003 and the
present, seven donated their organs of their own free will. None of
their organ donations ran against medical ethics principles, the
official stressed.</P>
      <P>On the FIDH's criticism that Taiwan fails to allow death-row
inmates to meet with their families before their execution, the
official said preparations for execution have indeed proceeded in
secret with a view to ensuring security and avoiding causing anxiety
or adding to the suffering of the family members. In fact, the
officials said, death-row inmates invariably have enough time to meet
their beloved ones. Prison authorities consistently inform their
families immediately after the execution.</P>
      <P>The official further said the MOJ will work with other government
agencies to revise laws that prescribe "capital punishment" as the
only penalty, in tandem with the principle of gradually phasing out
the death penalty.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Government designated the
Chihai residence of the late President Chiang Chin-kuo in suburban
Taipei as a historical site Tuesday, enabling the preservation of the
1960s building, which is on military property.</P>
      <P>The residence will be opened to the public after its restoration,
officials of the City Department of Cultural Affairs (CDCA) said.</P>
      <P>The Chihai Residence, located close to Navy headquarters in
northern Taipei, was being used by the Navy to house foreign guests
before Chiang moved in at the beginning of his term as minister of
defense in 1969.</P>
      <P>The son of late President Chiang Kai-shek lived there until his
death in 1988. During that period, many key political decisions were

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER: PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD MORE IMPORTANT THAN RECALL MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday he
respected the legislature's right to set forth a motion to recall
President Chen Shui-bian, but said the consideration of people's
daily lives is more important.</P>
      <P>In response to a ruling party lawmaker's question at the
Legislative Yuan, Su expressed concern that the recall motion --
which is unlikely to pass -- would cause social unrest.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Kuo Jung-tsung
asked for Su's comments on the legislature's decision to refer the
opposition "pan-blue alliance's" proposal to a plenary session,
setting in motion a grueling legislative bid to recall the president.</P>
      <P>Su said it was the legislature's duty to review all proposals,
some of which should have been passed in the previous session,
including bills governing workers' retirement pension funds, a budget
for flood-control projects and management regulations involving
state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>If these major proposals -- which directly affect people's
livelihood -- fail to gain legislative approval during this extra
session because too much time is spent on political bickering over
the recall motion, the nation's economic development may be adversely
affected and unemployment could rise, Su said.</P>
      <P>Kuo furher asked Su's response in the event the "pan-blue
alliance" of Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) propose a
no-confidence motion against him in September after failing at an
presidential recall attempt.</P>
      <P>In response, Su said if his Cabinet failed to win the confidence
of the legislature, he would respect whatever it decided to do
according to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>"Since the Constitution says the Legislative Yuan is the highest
authority representing public opinion, I believe it will act
prudently," he said.</P>
      <P>People just want to see the government operating in an effective
and responsible way, Su said, adding that the Executive Yuan has been
working hard to meet the expectations of both the public and the
legislature.</P>
      <P>"And I think the legislature knows what the people's expectations
are, and will act accordingly," he said.

    <HEADLINE>DPP VOWS TO FIGHT AGAINST NPSU-PROPOSED EXPANSION OF 'MINI LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Tuesday that it strongly objects to a draft bill on
amending a statute on outlying islands development, claiming that it
would leave Taiwan's offshore islands wide open to China and
downgrade Taiwan to a Chinese province.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun made the comments while
answering reporters' questions following the party's legislative
caucus meeting in which Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu reported on the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the law amendment proposal initiated by
opposition People First Party (PFP) lawmaker Feng Ting-kuo and the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) aims to allow people from Taiwan
proper to freely travel to and return from China via Taiwan-held
outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu while permitting Chinese
people to enter the three islands without the Taiwan government's
approval and document verification.</P>
      <P>Under the opposition-proposed amendments, local governments on
Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu would be entitled to sign agreements with
China and the central government in Taipei would have the legal
obligation to assist the three local authorities in executing the
accords signed by them with China.</P>
      <P>Arguing that such a revision to the law would compromise Taiwan's
national dignity and turn the country into a province of China, Chen
said that the DPP would resort to "violent means" against the
amendment's passage in the Legislative Yuan, if the "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP insist on handling the
draft bill in the ongoing extra session.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-jin warned against "serious consequences"
should the Legislative Yuan approve the amendment, which would permit
people from Taiwan and China to freely travel between the two sides
via the three Taiwan-held outlying islands without government
approval.</P>
      <P>The measure requiring the central government to help the three
local governments implement their agreements with China would
seriously damage the constitutional system and cripple the central
government's power in these areas, she said.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment bill, put forth by the NPSU, was returned to
the legislature's Procedure Committee due to DPP opposition to
dealing with it. It remains uncertain when the bill can be assigned
to a standing committee for deliberation.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposal to expand the exiting "mini three links"
was one of 14 important draft bills included on the agenda of an
extra legislative session which began June 13 and ends June 30.</P>
      <P>The current "mini three links" ferry services allow residents on
Kinmen and Matsu islands to directly travel to and from Fujian ports
of Xiamen and Mawei.</P>

      <P>The attorney of Chao Chien-ming, President
Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law, requested that the Taipei District Court
release Chao on bail Tuesday -- the second time since Chao was
detained in late May due to his suspected involvement in an insider
trading case.</P>
      <P>Wellington Ku made the request by presenting to the Taipei
District Court two newspaper reports which claimed that Chao would no
longer be able to escape, collude with other suspects or destroy
evidence after being released on bail.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court said that it would make a ruling on
Ku's bail request as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Ku first tried to convince the Taipei District Court to release
Chao on bail June 6 on grounds that Chao's wife, Chen Hsin-yu, is
expected to give birth in July, but the court turned down the
request.</P>
      <P>Chao has been held in custody since May 25 after information
obtained by prosecutors suggested his alleged role in an insider
trading involving shares of Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC).</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Chao has remained tight-lipped about
his role in the affair, but recently admitted that he gained advance
knowledge TDC stocks would surge while at a banquet with three other
suspects in the case, and prior to his mother's substantial purchase
of TDC shares from Chang Hwa Commercial Bank.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Sung Tseng-chang said Tuesday
during an extra legislative session that the government urgently
requires a special budget to dredge Shihmen reservoir in Taoyuan
County to prevent water shortages.</P>
      <P>Su noted that typhoons that have hit Taiwan over the past four
years have brought a tremendous amount of silt into the reservoir,
greatly increasing the water turbidity. The reservoir provides water
to Taoyuan and other counties in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2004 alone, typhoon Aere brought 973 mm of rain in just four
days, seriously increasing the reservoir's turbidity and rendering
its filtration pumps unable to cope with the amount of silt. As a
result, the reservoir was unable to supply water, causing a water
shortage in Taoyuan that lasted for 18 consecutive days and creating
serious consequences for residents and the investment climate in the
area, Su added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the daily amount of water used by residents and
industry is 105 tons, but by 2021 the demand is expected to surge to
132 tons daily, Su said, adding that there must be dredging and an
improvement project as soon as possible in order to resolve the water
shortage problem and increase the reservoir's function and
durability.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung noted that the
first phrase of the Shihmen reservoir dredging and improvement
project will include increasing the capability of water purification
plants and the conservation of land near the reservoir, and estimated
it will cost NT$14 billion (US$432 million) in the period from
2006-2008.</P>

      <P>Southern Pingtung County has the nation's
third highest tuberculosis (TB) incidence rate after Hualien and
Taitung, a county health bureau official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official made the statement during a question-and-answer

tuberculosis in the county, which means 110 to 120 people contract
tuberculosis among every 100,000 people.</P>
      <P>The county councilor claimed that this high tuberculosis
incidence is caused by X-Ray machines being left idle because of a
lack of radiologists.</P>
      <P>The health official replied that the lack of personnel is due to
a national budget shortage, but since there are other X-Ray
inspection trucks that make two trips per year to indigenous
villages, tuberculosis screening is considered sufficient. Official

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Finance (MOF) official
traveled to China Tuesday to investigate whether two Chinese towel
makers have sold their products to Taiwan at prices far lower than
fair market value.</P>
      <P>The visit follows Taiwan's levying from June 1 of a 237.7 percent
provisional anti-dumping tax on all Chinese towel exports to Taiwan,
with the exception of those from two Chinese companies that have been
subject to lower anti-dumping taxes of 109.3 percent and 107.7
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The two companies -- one in Kunshan, Jiangsu Province and the
other in Zhejiang Province -- replied to an initial anti-dumping
survey conducted by the MOF earlier this year, while the other seven
Chinese companies surveyed did not respond. The nine companies
account for 35 percent of the total Chinese towel exports to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOF official is accompanied by an accountant, MOF sources
said, adding that the official will investigate whether the data
provided by the two companies is correct. The investigative results
will serve as reference in determining whether the temporary
anti-dumping taxes imposed on them should be adjusted when the
ministry announces a formal anti-dumping tax on Chinese towels in
mid-September.</P>
      <P>The official is scheduled to conclude his visit and return to
Taipei June 22.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time Taiwan has formally sent an official on
an anti-dumping visit to China under the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), MOF sources said, adding that the Chinese mission
at the WTO formally informed Taiwan last week of its consent to the
MOF official's visit. The two companies have also expressed welcome
to the official's visit.</P>
      <P>Unless the seven other major Chinese towel corporations respond
to the MOF's questionnaires before the ministry completes its
anti-dumping investigations, the 237.7 percent anti-dumping tax
imposed on their products is not expected to be changed when the
ministry decides upon the formal anti-dumping tax.</P>
      <P>According to general international trade practices, a provisional
anti-dumping measure usually does not last for more than four months.
The MOF is scheduled to announce the formal tax rate Sept. 16.</P>
      <P>The ministry began the anti-dumping procedures against Chinese
towel imports after local towel makers filed complaints and staged
many rounds of demonstrations to call for government attention to
their plight due to the influx of extremely cheap imports from China.</P>

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) officials
announced Tuesday that based on a 2005 health survey, an estimated
860,000 Taiwanese over the age of 15 suffer from kidney
disease, despite the decrease in prevalence among the population to
3.8 percent from 4.1 percent in 2002.</P>
      <P>The prevalence of kidney disease is rising to become an illness
that is threatening the health of the country, warned officials of
the Bureau of Health Promotion under the DOH.</P>
      <P>At present, some 50,000 kidney disease patients in Taiwan must
undergo dialysis regularly, according to Taiwan Society of Nephrology
Chairman Huang Chiu-chin, who also noted that the number of patients
in the third to fifth stages of chronic kidney disease has surpassed
that of the island's diabetes patients.</P>
      <P>A nephrologist at National Cheng Kung University Hospital
recently revealed that Taiwan has the world's highest incidence of
uremia, a kidney disease, with 385 new cases per every 1 million
people every year, and that Taiwan spends up to NT$25 billion (US$769
million) on dialysis -- the sole treatment for uremia -- every year.</P>
      <P>Since the early symptoms of kidney disease are not apparent and 50
percent of patients have no symptoms in the initial stages and so are
likely to miss early treatment, Huang said he believes regular
health checkups are recommended to avoid disease, suggesting that
people who experience a combination of symptoms such as edema,
headache, fatigue or frothy urine should consult a doctor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OFFICIAL VISITS CHINA FOR ANTI-DUMPING PROBES(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Finance (MOF) official
traveled to China Tuesday to investigate whether two Chinese towel
makers have sold their products to Taiwan at prices far lower than
fair market value.</P>
      <P>The visit follows Taiwan's levying from June 1 of a 237.7 percent
provisional anti-dumping tax on all Chinese towel exports to Taiwan,
with the exception of those from two Chinese companies that have been
subject to lower anti-dumping taxes of 109.3 percent and 107.7
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The two companies -- one in Kunshan, Jiangsu Province and the
other in Zhejiang Province -- replied to an initial anti-dumping
survey conducted by the MOF earlier this year, while the other seven
Chinese companies surveyed did not respond. The nine companies
account for 35 percent of the total Chinese towel exports to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOF official is accompanied by an accountant, MOF sources
said, adding that the official will investigate whether the data
provided by the two companies is correct. The investigative results
will serve as reference in determining whether the temporary
anti-dumping taxes imposed on them should be adjusted when the
ministry announces a formal anti-dumping tax on Chinese towels in
mid-September.</P>
      <P>The official is scheduled to conclude his visit and return to
Taipei June 22.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time Taiwan has formally sent an official on
an anti-dumping visit to China under the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), MOF sources said, adding that the Chinese mission
at the WTO formally informed Taiwan last week of its consent to the
MOF official's visit. The two companies have also expressed welcome
to the official's visit.</P>
      <P>Unless the seven other major Chinese towel corporations respond
to the MOF's questionnaires before the ministry completes its
anti-dumping investigations, the 237.7 percent anti-dumping tax
imposed on their products is not expected to be changed when the
ministry decides upon the formal anti-dumping tax.</P>
      <P>According to general international trade practices, a provisional
anti-dumping measure usually does not last for more than four months.
The MOF is scheduled to announce the formal tax rate Sept. 16.</P>
      <P>The ministry began the anti-dumping procedures against Chinese
towel imports after local towel makers filed complaints and staged
many rounds of demonstrations to call for government attention to
their plight due to the influx of extremely cheap imports from China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOME 860,000 TAIWANESE SUFFERING FROM KIDNEY DISEASE(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) officials
announced Tuesday that based on a 2005 health survey, an estimated
860,000 Taiwanese over the age of 15 suffer from kidney
disease, despite the decrease in prevalence among the population to
3.8 percent from 4.1 percent in 2002.</P>
      <P>The prevalence of kidney disease is rising to become an illness
that is threatening the health of the country, warned officials of
the Bureau of Health Promotion under the DOH.</P>
      <P>At present, some 50,000 kidney disease patients in Taiwan must
undergo dialysis regularly, according to Taiwan Society of Nephrology
Chairman Huang Chiu-chin, who also noted that the number of patients
in the third to fifth stages of chronic kidney disease has surpassed
that of the island's diabetes patients.</P>
      <P>A nephrologist at National Cheng Kung University Hospital
recently revealed that Taiwan has the world's highest incidence of
uremia, a kidney disease, with 385 new cases per every 1 million
people every year, and that Taiwan spends up to NT$25 billion (US$769
million) on dialysis -- the sole treatment for uremia -- every year.</P>
      <P>Since the early symptoms of kidney disease are not apparent and 50
percent of patients have no symptoms in the initial stages and so are
likely to miss early treatment, Huang said he believes regular
health checkups are recommended to avoid disease, suggesting that
people who experience a combination of symptoms such as edema,
headache, fatigue or frothy urine should consult a doctor.</P>

faster than many Western countries, the report said Taiwan faces
great pressure in raising social security funding.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT NOT TO RESPOND TO OPPOSITION CHARGES: DPP CAUCUS WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will not present
any official statement defending himself over an opposition motion in
the Legislative Yuan to unseat him, a parliamentary whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Claiming the recall initiative is basically a "derivative" of
infighting within the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) over the year-end
Taipei mayoral election, Ker Chien-ming, the DPP legislative caucus
convener, said it's meaningless for Chen to give any reply to the
opposition's charges against him.</P>
      <P>According to Ker, DPP party bigwigs and lawmakers were initially
divided over whether Chen should refer to the legislature a written
statement defending himself.</P>
      <P>"After a 'brainstorming' discussion, we have come to the
conclusion that the president shouldn't dance to the tune of the
'pan-blue alliance,'" Ker said.</P>
      <P>"Our 'no response' recommendation will be presented to the
president for reference," Ker added.</P>
      <P>The legislature officially kickstarted the legal process Tuesday
to consider the recall motion against Chen on the opening day of an
extra legislative session. The "pan-blue alliance" holds a slim
majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>In addition to referring the motion to the Committee of the Whole
for review, the legislature also filed a letter to Chen explaining
why the opposition wants to oust him.</P>
      <P>The opposition claimed they were proposing the recall based on
doubts of Chen's integrity and competency as his senior aides and
son-in-law have been detained or investigated on suspicions of
involvement in corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Ker said the reasons enumerated by the opposition were nothing
more than mudslinging and exaggerated personal attacks on Chen.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the recall motion was initiated by the PFP in an
attempt to muster the support of "pan-blue" loyalists for PFP
Chairman James Soong's bid for the Taipei mayorship, Ker said main
opposition KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou at first disagreed with such a
drastic move but later made an about-face for fear of drawing a
backlash from "pan-blue" extremists leading to the defeat of KMT
mayoral candidate Hau Lung-pin in the year-end race.</P>
      <P>Ker further said the "pan-blue alliance" originally opposed the
DPP's proposal to hold an extra legislative session to screen an
urgent flood-control budget bill but later made an about-face simply
because it intends to "turn the session into a theater for the
'recall drama.'"</P>
      <P>Given the fact the opposition is using the recall motion for
political gain, Ker said, it would be to no avail for Chen to make
any response.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang echoed Ker's view, saying Chen
should instead clarify to the public all the allegations against him
and his family as well as address the public on his administration's
achievements over the past six years and the true cause behind this
round of political strife.</P>
      <P>The president has until June 20 to decide whether or not to
answer the opposition charges. Whether he responds or not, the
legislature will move ahead to debate the motion June 21-23 and June
26 before putting it to a vote June 27. If more than two-thirds of
the legislators vote in favor of it, the motion will then be put to a
national referendum for ordinary citizens to decide whether to unseat
Chen two years before his second and final four-year terms expire.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both KMT legislative whip Pan Wei-kang and her PFP
counterpart Lee Hung-chun claimed that Chen's silence could be seen
as tacit recognition of the legitimacy of the recall motion.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) gave mixed reactions Wednesday to President
Chen Shui-bian's decision not to present any official statement
defending himself against a recall motion initiated by the opposition
in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The legislature had asked President Chen Tuesday to reply to the
recall motion, which is unprecedented in the history of the Republic
of China. The opposition initiated the recall motion based on doubts
of the president's competency and integrity in the wake of a spate of
corruption allegations against his son-in-law and close aides. </P>
      <P>Regardless of whether President Chen responds or not, the
Legislative Yuan will go ahead and debate the motion June 21-23 and
June 26 before putting it to a vote June 27.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim of the DPP said she is in favor of
ignoring the motion, noting that the president himself has not been
implicated in any of the corruption allegations against his
son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>"If the president replies, it will make him look like a
defendant, " she said, adding that "it is senseless for him to be
interrogated by the public."</P>
      <P>"As long as the president comes forward to address all misgivings
clearly prior to the legislative vote, the public will accept it, "
she claimed.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung said the opposition-initiated recall
motion is based on "political reasons, not legal ones, " and the
president has no need to respond.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the legislature, said that the recall
initiative springs from the infighting within the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) over the year-end Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has no need to dance to the tune of the opposition," Ker
said.</P>
      <P>However, DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng said a reply from the
president would provide a stage for the DPP and himself. If the
"president defends himself well, it will strip the recall motion of
any legitimacy and scuttle the momentum the opposition is trying to
build up to topple the Cabinet," he said.</P>
      <P>A legislative caucus whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) ,
an ally of the DPP, said that the president's ignoring of the recall
motion is "the right direction."</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator David Huang said that the opposition only wants to
use the upcoming extraordinary session as a stage to humiliate the
president, adding that there is no need to "play a duet with them."</P>

recently while calling for the quit of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said Ma feels regret for making such
reckless remarks as chen will end up in a "foul death" a few days ago
while criticizing President Chen's "irresponsible" attitude in
dealing with incessant corruption allegations involving his family

      <P>Ma was so angry with President Chen's lack of sincerity in
addressing the alleged scandals which have caused social unrest that
he could not stop himself from using rude language in talking about
Chen, according to the spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>After making such comments as "condemning him (President Chen) to
die a foul death one day after he is overthrown by the people, " Ma
feels terribly sorry for failing to exercise self-discipline and
because he believes such imprudent remarks have a bad influence on

      <P>Citing Ma's apology, the spokeswoman said that the KMT chairman

    <HEADLINE>TAITRA LEADS FARMERS' ASSOCIATIONS TO BEIJING FOR FRUIT EXPORT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) official is leading a delegation of
representatives of 18 farmers' associations around Taiwan to Beijing
for negotiations on fruit exports to China.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Secretary-General Chao Yung-chuan said that the aims of
the delegation, being led by TAITRA's deputy secretary-general, are
related to business and that the delegation will not be engaging in
any official negotiations at the commission of the government.</P>
      <P>Although the Chinese government announced last year that it would
grant tariff-free treatment to several categories of Taiwan fruits,
it continues to be reluctant to engage in talks directly with TAITRA,
the sole organization designated by Taiwan's government to negotiate
with Beijing on the issue.</P>
      <P>In the past, TAITRA usually led Taiwan exporters to negotiate
with importers of foreign countries for the export of Taiwan
products. However, this time, it is leading representatives of
farmers' associations to make direct contacts with Beijing importers.</P>
      <P>Chao said the direct contacts between fruit producers and
importers will help Taiwan farmers better understand the real market
demand in China, which he said will be beneficial to future trade.</P>
      <P>In addition to organizing trade shows in China, TAITRA will also
invite Beijing buyers to attend the 2006 Taipei International Food
Show slated for June 21-24 to better promote Taiwan products,
according to Chao.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREQUENCY OF ASSASSINATION THREAT BROADCAST DETERMINED: NCC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) said Wednesday the commission has determined the
frequency of an unlicensed radio station's recent broadcast in which
the life of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was
threatened.</P>
      <P>Ke Chi-sen, director of the NCC Department of Broadcasting
Affairs, said in a meeting called by the KMT legislative caucus that
the commission had determined the frequency of the radio broadcast
after an NCC monitor in southern Taiwan picked up the broadcast of
the unlicensed radio station in which listeners were encouraged to
end the life of Ma to scuttle the KMT's attempt to oust President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The broadcast could have originated from anywhere in the southern
counties Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung, Ke said, adding that the
contents of the broadcast were transcribed by the NCC which
discovered that several people who called in to the radio show
claimed to have made the threatening remarks.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said Taiwan's social order would be
jeopardized and national security endangered if Ma were to be killed
or wounded as a result of an underground radio's broadcast inciting
of violence.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a deputy whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said
that similar threats were made against former Premier Frank Hsieh and
Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao last year and that
police moved quickly to deal with both cases.</P>
      <P>The police and prosecutors, however, have been slow in responding
to the threats against Ma's life, Kuo claimed.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ching-hsiang, director of the Department of Prosecutorial
Affairs under the Ministry of Justice, said the law enforcement
authorities formed an ad hoc committee Tuesday to deal exclusively
with the assassination threat case, adding that any such threat
inciting of violence will not be tolerated and will be dealt with
according to the law.</P>
      <P>Huang Jung-tiao, an official with the National Security Bureau,
who was also present at the meeting, said that the Ma assassination
threat rumors have been heard since the three-in-one elections last
December and that the bureau has been moving to boost security for Ma
on the one hand and to speed up the gathering of relevant information
on the other.</P>
      <P>Most of the unlicensed radio stations in southern Taiwan support
President Chen and have therefore been broadcasting messages critical
of the KMT's attempt to recall Chen over scandals involving his
in-laws and close aides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, CHINA AGREE ON CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has reached an agreement with China
on measures with regard to four kinds of cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flight services, including the launch of special charter cargo
flights, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman (MAC) Joseph Wu announced
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The other measures are the regularization of cross-strait charter
passenger flights for special holidays and the operation of charter
services for emergency medical needs and humanitarian purposes, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The agreement was established by the Taipei Airlines Association,
which was authorized by the MAC to conduct talks with China on the
issue, with the Beijing-based Civil Aviation Association.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MAC will coordinate with the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications as soon as possible to work out
rules related to the measures' implementation before accepting
applications from airline companies interested in operating the
services, Wu said.</P>
      <P>While only airlines from Taiwan and China will be allowed to
operate the charter services, their destinations must be those agreed
upon by authorities of both sides, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the special charter cargo flights are designated
for Taiwan businesspeople with operations in China who need to ship
machinery, facilities or related parts and components across the
strait for their operations.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will continue to negotiate with China to pave the
way for the launch of regular charter cargo flights in the future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, regular charter passenger flights will be available
during the Chinese New Year, Tomb Sweeping Festival, Dragon Boat
Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays between Taoyuan and
Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Xiamen in
China, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The duration of the holiday charter services will be 14 days
before and after Chinese New Year Day and seven days before and after
Tomb Sweeping Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival,
he said.</P>
      <P>Six airlines from each side will be allowed to join the services,
with a total of 168 flights available per year, he said, adding that
passengers eligible to take the flights are Taiwan residents with
legal permits to enter and exit China and Taiwan as well as foreign
and Chinese workers and dependents of Taiwan businesspeople.</P>
      <P>While the emergency medical charter flights are intended for the
delivery of personnel and medical facilities for emergency medical
needs, the humanitarian charter flights are designed for relief and
rescue efforts, the transportation of the physically challenged and
other special circumstances agreed upon by both sides, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION TRIES TO COPY U.S. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" tried
Wednesday to copy the congressional hearing system used in the United
States as Taiwan's legislature was set to "review" a historic motion
for recalling President Chen Shui-bian later in the month.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
said that if the new measure is adopted, the KMT and its "pan-blue
alliance" ally the People First Party (PFP) will likely invite the
president and his wife to answer charges against them at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Kao Sze-po said the measure, being drafted by a
lawyer, will offer a forum "like a court hearing" in which the
defendants have ample time to explain themselves while helping to
"find all the facts for the nation."</P>
      <P>"The review process is a major incident that will set a precedent
in the constitutional history of the Republic of China and must not
be seen as a ploy of political struggle or partisan bickering, " Kao
claimed.</P>
      <P>Under the alliance's proposal, the intended recallee can attend
the legislative "Committee of the Whole" review in person or by
delegating a legislator to stand in for him, while the motion
initiator and co-sponsors can also delegate a person to state the
reasons for the recall bid.</P>
      <P>Both sides can produce evidence to support their statements and
invite witnesses to make statements as well as to be cross-examined.
After the statements and cross-examinations, both sides will make
concluding statements for the legislators and the people to make
their own judgments.</P>
      <P>Hung Hsiu-chu, convener of the KMT Ad Hoc Recall Group, said it
is unfair for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which claims
referendum as a universal right for all people, to "twist" the
opposition's proposal "for the people to judge the president's
integrity and competency" an attempt to wage political war and seize
power.</P>
      <P>If the motion is approved by two-thirds of the 221 legislators,
it will then have to be endorsed by more than 50 percent of voters in
a national referendum to become effective.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, secretary-general of the KMT caucus, urged the DPP
and its "pan-green camp" ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union to support
the alliance's proposal for instituting a long-lasting measure for
the review process.</P>
      <P>The legislature is scheduled to hold plenary meetings to review
the motion June 21-23 and June 26 to debate the recall motion before
putting it to a vote June 27.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER RESPECTS PRESIDENT'S NO RESPONSE DECISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that he respects President Chen Shui-bian's decision not to
respond to a recall motion initiated by the opposition in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang said the legislature had already sent a letter to the
Presidential Office, asking Chen to defend himself.</P>
      <P>He said he respects the president's decision, although he claimed
it would have been better for the president to respond to the
request.</P>
      <P>The opposition initiated the recall motion based on doubts over
the president's competency and integrity in the wake of a spate of
corruption allegations involving his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether Chen responds or not, the Legislative Yuan
will go ahead and debate the motion June 21-23 and June 26 before
putting it to a vote June 27.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, a legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said the recall motion is the by-product of
political infighting between the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP), which make up the "pan blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Ker claimed that the recall motion was initiated by the PFP in an
attempt to muster the support of "pan-blue" loyalists for PFP
Chairman James Soong's bid for the Taipei mayorship. Main opposition
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou at first disagreed with the move but later
made an about-face for fear of drawing a backlash from "pan-blue"
extremists that might lead to the defeat of KMT mayoral candidate Hau
Lung-pin in the year-end election, Ker added.</P>
      <P>Ker claimed that there is no evidence that Chen and first lady Wu
Shu-jen are implicated in the corruption allegations, and said the
DPP will back the president's decision not to respond.</P>
      <P>But he also said the president needs to give a public
explanation, adding that the Presidential Office has begun to prepare
a report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT legislative caucus asked if the president's
decision is because he is "afraid to face the public."</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a KMT caucus whip, claimed that "not defending
himself is tantamount to acquiescence."</P>
      <P>Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said Chen's performance over the past
six years has grossly violated the pledges he made in his
inauguration day, adding that the people entrusted him with power and
can take away that power.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-hua claimed the president's decision is
"because the statement can't be altered randomly and is subject to
scrutiny under the sun."</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative caucus said that "it regretted" the
president's decision.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, a PFP legislative whip, claimed it is because the
president "cannot possibly explain all doubts about his integrity."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Kung
Wen-chi sponsored a public hearing at the Legislative Yuan Wednesday
calling for the legislation of an autonomy act allowing indigenous
people living in the Taroko National Park in eastern Taiwan to own
and run their own areas.</P>
      <P>Kung, himself an aborigine legislator representing indigenous
people around the country, said the Taroko people -- whom as a whole
were acknowledged by the government as Taiwan's 12th aboriginal tribe
only two years ago -- want an exclusive law to allow them access to
autonomy, self-governance and self-determination to help free them
from exploitation.</P>
      <P>The Taroko National Park -- traditionally home to the Taroko
people -- located in eastern Taiwan's Hualien County, has been
exploited by two cement companies and a tourism hotel with complicity
of the Taroko National Park Administration since 2004, triggering
protests by the Taroko tribal men, who have said that only by
enacting a new law can their rights and interests be protected, Kung
said.</P>
      <P>Kung said the Taroko people have reached a preliminary consensus
on the autonomy need after the tribe convened 29 rounds of meetings
since July 2004. The bottom-up legal proposal has also been endorsed
by international indigenous organizations, including the Asian
Indigenous Peoples Pact and the Peruvian Quechua Tribe, he added.</P>
      <P>The proposed act, authored by Teyra Yudaw, chairman of the Taroko
National Autonomy Promotion Committee, stipulates that the Taroko
people can establish their own Taroko national parliament, a Taroko
self-governance authority and an elders council as the group's
legislative, administrative and judicial nerve centers to help the
Taroko people rule themselves, uphold their rights and protect the
homeland that their ancestors have handed down through the
generations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC ANNOUNCES NEW MEASURES ON CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu announced Wednesday four kinds of special charter flight
services between Taiwan and China, but said that relevant details
cannot be made public due to a tacit agreement between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at an Executive Yuan news conference in which
he also announced that Taiwan and China have agreed to open special
charter cargo flights, institutionalized holiday charter flights, and
charter flights for emergency medical assistance and humanitarian
purposes. Beijing officials also called a news conference to make the
announcement simultaneously with the Taiwan side.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Taiwan and China agreed to first launch the four
kinds of charter flights, although the two sides remain divided over
setting up charter cargo and passenger flight services on a regular
basis.</P>
      <P>Asked when the cross-Taiwan Strait special charter cargo flights
could be put in place, Wu said that Taiwan companies will be able to
file applications within two weeks of the relevant measures being
worked out.</P>
      <P>Noting that applications for the special charter cargo flights
will be screened on a case-by-case basis by the Civil Aeronautics
Administration based on the model of this year's Lunar New Year
holiday charter flights, he added that the planned holiday charter
passenger flights could be institutionalized for the first time for
this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the two sides will continue working on
establishing cross-strait charter flights for both passenger and
cargo traffic on a regular basis, the MAC head said.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director-General Cheng Wen-tsan
told reporters following the news conference that the development
underlines the fact that government-to-government negotiations are
necessary to forge direct transport links between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The development also makes it clear that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance's" previous demand that a deadline be set for opening cross-
strait direct transport links was "irrational," Cheng claimed, adding
that bilateral legislation without two-way negotiations authorized by
the governments through due process are useless.</P>
      <P>Cheng promised that the government will handle cross-strait
affairs cautiously and responsibly to best secure Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Tui, vice minister of transportation and
communications, commented that the cross-strait charter cargo flight
services that the two sides have agreed upon is not comprehensive
enough to meet Taiwan businessmen's needs.</P>
      <P>He said that the scope of the service, limited to the transport
of production equipment by China-based Taiwan businessmen between the
two sides, should be expanded and he called for further two-way
negotiations to push for overall normalization of cross-strait
charter services.</P>
      <P>In view of what the government claimed are "the breakthroughs" in
cross-strait relations, sources in Taiwan's aviation industry
expressed regret over the many restrictions remaining -- in
particular the failure to open charter passenger flights on weekends.</P>
      <P>It will be very difficult for carriers to attract enough
passengers if passenger flights on weekends are not added to the

    <HEADLINE>'ARROGANCE' BEHIND PRESIDENT'S REFUSAL TO ANSWER RECALL MOTION: KMT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou claimed Wednesday that if President Chen Shui-bian refuses
to defend himself at the Legislative Yuan, which will review a motion
to recall him later in the month, it will lead the public to think
that arrogance is behind the president's decision.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in reply to media questions during a tea
party celebrating the moving of the KMT's head office to a new
address in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, replying to a legislative invitation is "a
privilege and an obligation." He added that "he can give up a
privilege but cannot give up his obligation."</P>
      <P>Ma said the recall motion has been put on the legislative agenda
and the president should respect the legislature by explaining to it
why he should not be recalled.</P>
      <P>"Even if the president is very very unhappy, and very very
unwilling to make a reply, he should make a reply," Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>It will be a chance for him to defend his name and to show his
respect for the Legislative Yuan, he added.</P>
      <P>As a popularly elected president, Ma went on, Chen has a duty to
respect "the highest institution representing public opinion."</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general to the president, said the
president was still considering whether to accept a Legislative Yuan
invitation to defend himself when it reviews the opposition-initiated
recall motion June 21-23 and June 26.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER REJECTS CPC OIL-HIKE PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san
stated categorically Wednesday that "it is not possible" for the
state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to increase fuel prices again
following price hikes as recently as mid-April.</P>
      <P>Maintaining stable consumer prices is a national economic policy,
Hwang said, suggesting that the CPC make efforts to tap new resources
and economize on expenses instead of taking more money out of
consumers' pockets.</P>
      <P>The state-managed company has to operate based on the interests
of the country and its people, the minister said.</P>
      <P>The CPC had submitted a proposal to the Commission of National
Corporations under the Ministry of Economic Affairs to seek
permission to raise domestic fuel prices again.</P>
      <P>The proposal points out that the CPC is faced with financial
difficulties and is short of cash to buy crude oil, liquefied
petroleum gas and liquefied natural gas since international crude oil
prices have skyrocketed.</P>
      <P>Hwang said it is understandable for the CPC to try to extricate
itself from its financial problems. However, raising fuel prices is a
"national business " and any changes have to be made based on the
interests of the country and people, he noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In his first public response to a recall
motion in an extraordinary session of the Legislative Yuan, President
Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that he will respect it as long as the
opposition adheres to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an event marking the third anniversary of the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy, the embattled president said he will "give
it respect" if the opposition leaders abide by the Constitution. The
foundation is funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng serving as its chairman.</P>
      <P>"Democracy has not come easy. Soliciting democracy is a right and
defending democracy is a responsibility," he said.</P>
      <P>The opposition-dominated legislature, which doubts the
president's competency and integrity in the wake of a series of
high-profile corruption allegations involving his son-in-law and
close aides, began the recall motion proceedings Monday.
</P>
      <P>The legislature will debate the motion June 21-23 and June 26
before putting it to a vote June 27. If the motion gets a two-thirds
endorsement of the legislature, which is considered very unlikely as
the opposition only maintains a slim majority in the 221-seat
legislature, it will be put to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>The president also urged the opposition leaders "to put aside
election feuds and calculations so that the judicial part can be left
for the justice and the politics can be left to politics."</P>
      <P>Let the judicial authorities probe and rule on all the
allegations so that the nation can return to a normal and peaceful
situation after the recent political turmoil, Chen urged.</P>
      <P>On the detention of his son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, since May 25
on suspicion of insider trading, he said he and his family have
suffered tremendously in recent days.</P>
      <P>He said he regrets that he has not set Chao, a half-son in
traditional Chinese thinking, straight, but added that he will face
justice and will support and rely on the justice system.</P>
      <P>Everyone is equal before the law and everyone will have to face
the law with no exception, he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that times have changed and that during the previous
authoritarian era, one had to challenge existing system in the
pursuit of freedom, democracy, human rights and justice, but said
"that era has passed."</P>
      <P>He said democracy is the most important agenda in Taiwan, and
that the Constitution and rule of law must be the norm.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT SAVES 6-8 HOURS OF TRANSPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of four kinds of cross-Taiwan
Strait charter flight services, including special charter cargo
flights, will significantly benefit humanitarian efforts between
Taiwan and China, a consultant for International SOS said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Special cross-strait charter cargo flights will save six to eight
hours of flying via third places and about half of the costs
otherwise required for emergency medical or humanitarian
transportation, said Tsai Hsing-han.</P>
      <P>Currently, emergency medical or humanitarian flights across the
Taiwan Strait must transit via a third place and change aircraft,
causing money and time losses for passengers in need, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>According to International SOS, about 500 to 600 Taiwan people are
transported back to Taiwan from around the world via the
International SOS mechanism each year. Most of the total are
transported back to Taiwan from China, with the passengers' insurers
paying the transport bills. The bill for a patient under intensive
care averages about US$70,500 for a one-way trip.</P>
      <P>Similar flights from Taiwan's offshore areas, including the
islands of Kinmen and Matsu, to a hospital in Taiwan proper, cost
about NT$400,000 (US$12,500) per trip, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Tsai's remarks came in the wake of an announcement by the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) earlier in the day that
Taiwan has reached an agreement with China on measures with regard to
four kinds of cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight services, including
the launch of special charter cargo flights.</P>
      <P>The other measures are the regularization of cross-strait charter
passenger flights for special holidays and the operation of charter
services for emergency medical needs and humanitarian purposes, MAC
Chairman Joseph Wu said.</P>
      <P>The agreement was established by the Taipei Airlines Association,
which was authorized by the MAC to conduct talks with China on the
issue with the Beijing-based Civil Aviation Association.</P>
      <P>Six airlines from each side will be allowed to offer the
services, with a total of 168 flights available per year, Wu said,
adding that passengers eligible to take the flights are Taiwan
residents with legal permits to enter and exit China and Taiwan as
well as foreign and Chinese workers and dependents of Taiwan
businessmen.</P>
      <P>While the emergency medical charter flights are intended for the
delivery of personnel and medical facilities for emergency medical
needs, the humanitarian charter flights are designed for relief and
rescue efforts, the transportation of the physically challenged and
other special circumstances agreed upon by both sides, Wu said.</P>

      <P>Agricultural losses resulting from several
days of torrential rain have climbed to NT$1.15 billion, according to

      <P>The amount includes NT$922.97 million in crop damage, affecting
25,478 hectares of cropland, with the non-harvested areas totalling
5,023 hectares, COA officials said. Most severely damaged was rice,
watermelons, grapes, peaches, pears, persimmons, tangerines, spring
onions and peanuts.</P>
      <P>Livestock damage amounted to NT$20.61 million, with 490 pigs,
283,000 chickens, 65,000 ducks and 15,808 geese dead, the officials

      <P>As relief measures for the agricultural sector, the government
will provide farmers in Hsinchu and Taichung counties with relief

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
accused the government Wednesday of deceiving the public with an
announcement on direct charter flight services between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Lee Hung-chun made the accusation at
a news conference after Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu announced earlier in the day that Taiwan and China have
agreed to open four kinds of direct charter flight services --
special charter cargo flights for China-based Taiwan businessmen,
holiday charter passenger flights, charter flights for emergency
medical assistance and flights for humanitarian purposes.</P>
      <P>Questioning why the government failed to set up charter passenger
flights on weekends, which would be far more useful for Taiwan
businessmen with operations in China, Lee said that charter passenger
flight services that will be put in place for four major national
holidays have little meaning.</P>
      <P>The MAC was just trying to deal with the opposition's demand for
establishing full direct transport links across the Taiwan Strait by
making a "small compromise, " he claimed, adding that the PFP will
continue pressuring the government to widen the scope of direct
transport links to boost Taiwan's economy in the current extra
legislative session ending on June 30.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei District Court turned down a request
Wednesday to release on bail Chao Chien-ming, President Chen
Shui-bian's son-in-law who is under detention for suspected
involvement in an insider-trading scandal.</P>
      <P>The court said Chao's reason for the request -- that his wife was
expecting their third child in July -- had nothing to do with the
prosecution's reasons for keeping him under custody.</P>
      <P>The court noted that Chao's testimony was insufficient to be seen
as a confession of crime and that there are witnesses who have yet to
be questioned in connection to the case.</P>
      <P>According to the court, there are still concerns that if he were
freed he might seek to collude with others in an attempt to destroy
evidence.</P>
      <P>On June 6, according to the court's ruling against granting the
request, Chao admitted that during a dinner party at a Japanese
restaurant he heard Tsai Ching-wen, a board member of Waterland
Securities Co., Su Teh-chien, chairman of the Taiwan Development
Corp. (TDC) , and businessman Yu Shih-yi talking about selling TDC
shares and about a plan to secure a syndicate loan to bail out TDC.</P>
      <P>However, Chao denied passing on the information to his father
Chao Yu-chu, claiming he had not contributed any money toward buying
TDC shares. Rather, he told investigators, it was Tsai who approached
his father to buy the shares.</P>
      <P>Tsai has been freed after confessing wrongdoing. Yu and Su are
still being detained.</P>
      <P>The president has apologized for Chao's involvement in this
much-reported scandal. On Wednesday, he again blamed himself for

Since World War II, the industrialized world

could produce. Industrialized countries tapped
the cheap resources of poor ones. Now this
mutual dependency is unraveling and a new

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CONFIDENT TAIWAN WILL WEATHER CURRENT POLITICAL STORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that he has full confidence in Taiwan's democracy and that he
believes the people, in their utmost wisdom and ability, will
definitely join him in weathering the current political storm so the
country will soon return to normal.</P>
      <P>The president, who is facing a presidential recall motion in the
legislature, made the remarks while meeting with seven Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) county magistrates and city mayors from
southern Taiwan who came to Taipei to voice support for Chen during
the crisis.</P>
      <P>Thanking the seven DPP local government chiefs, Chen said he
hoped to have the chance to express his ideas and views to the
public, outlining his administration's achievements as well as
describing how difficult it has been over the past six years as head
of Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>He said he faced a recall campaign in 2000 after his
administration announced a suspension of construction on the fourth
nuclear power plant in a move to realize his campaign promise of
building a nuclear-free country.</P>
      <P>"At that time, the opposition parties wanted to recall me simply
because of a difference in views [on the nuclear power policy], " he
said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Chen continued, his decision to cease the
function of the National Unification Council also triggered calls for
him to step down.</P>
      <P>"I made that decision to consolidate Taiwan's democracy, hoping
the people's right to decide on their own future would not be
deprived. But the opposition claimed I should be recalled for doing
just that," he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the opposition's current recall campaign, the
president said the opposition originally said the motion required
some criminal evidence but then changed its own rationale by claiming
a recall is a political action that requires no damning evidence.</P>
      <P>He accused the opposition of using a judiciary investigation into
his son-in-law's suspected involvement in insider trading of Taiwan
Development Corp. (TDC) shares as a political tool to recall him.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted a former Kuomintang (KMT) official as saying that
while the KMT was the ruling party, "Courts are run by the KMT."
After the DPP came to power, some people continued to say "Courts are
run by the DPP," he added.</P>
      <P>But six years after the DPP's rule, it has been proven that
Taiwan's courts are not operated by the DPP, because whomever has
committed a crime will be investigated and punished by the law
without exception, not even the president's son-in-law and his
son-in-law's father, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>He boasted this feature as a proud legacy in Taiwan that
indicates the value and meaning of a transfer of power from one
political party to another.</P>
      <P>"This is absolutely not a liability," he claimed.</P>
      <P>He assured his party comrades that as president of Taiwan, he
will definitely carry on under the burden of the cross that is placed
on him.</P>
      <P>"I will never give up, discount or cede my duties as president, "
he added.</P>
      <P>So tomorrow, Thursday, he said he will visit outlying islets in
Kinmen, near China, to demonstrate the execution of his duty as
commander-in-chief of Taiwan's armed forces.</P>
      <P>"While the opposition parties are waging a political struggle
against me, I want to do my job with regard to maintaining national
security."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AIMS TO PHASE OUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
Taiwan is determined to phase out capital punishment in a gradual
manner in tandem with the general world trend.</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation while meeting with Siobhan Ni
Chulachain, vice chairwoman of the Paris-based International
Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chulachain presented a report on Taiwan's use of capital
punishment authored by the FIDH in terms of the findings of its field
surveys. The report made a case for Taiwan to craft a timetable for
phasing out capital punishment. Taiwan is one of 72 countries in the
world that have not yet abolished the death penalty.</P>
      <P>Chen told Chulachain that abolishing capital punishment is
Taiwan's ultimate goal. As local society has not yet shaped a
consensus on the issue, he said, seeking the support of the public
and the legislature is a critical part of the work to that end.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of a national consensus, Chen said his
administration has continued laying groundwork for an eventual
elimination of death penalty, including revising the Criminal Code to
raise the ceilings of prison terms for multiple convictions and set
new requirements for parole of life imprisonment convicts. These new
regulations, which will take effect July 1 this year, are
complementary measures in preparation for eventual abolishment of
capital punishment.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said Taiwan has gradually reduced the number of
death sentence and execution. In 1998, Chen said, Taiwan executed 32
death-row inmates, but the number plunged to three in 2005, and no
execution has been made so far this year.</P>
      <P>"These figures signify our efforts toward the 'no capital
punishment' goal," Chen said.</P>
      <P>To better protect local people's human rights, Chen said Taiwan
will set up a national human rights commission in line with relevant
U.N. conventions and will push for domestic legislation of
international conventions regarding civil rights and political rights
protection.</P>
      <P>The FIDH groups 141 human rights organizations around the world
with an aim to obtain effective improvements in the protection of
victims, the prevention of human rights abuse and the prosecution of
those responsible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INCOMPETENCY CAN BE REASON FOR RECALLING ELECTED OFFICIALS: KMT CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou called for President Chen Shui-bian Thursday to "get it
right that recalling does not have to hinge on committing a crime and
that incompetency and dereliction of duty can be reasons for
recalling an elected official."</P>
      <P>Replying to media questions after chairing a meeting of city
government officials, whom he also leads as mayor, Ma said that for
example, the governor of California was recalled three years ago
because he did not handle well the power rationing issue.</P>
      <P>Gray Davis was at the time also suspected of embezzling political
donations, which contributed to his low popularity of a little over
20 percent, Ma said, noting that "the governor did not commit a crime
but was still recalled."</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the Legislative Yuan is the first hurdle for passing a
recall motion which sets a threshold of a two-thirds majority vote,
which offers good protection to the intended recallee, Ma said. "And
yet, the president does not want to answer the legislature's charges.
It is unfair, " he added.</P>
      <P>In many other countries, Ma said, a motion for recalling the
president is initiated by the people and so it is not a problem for
the president to make a reply directly to the people.</P>
      <P>"If (President Chen) wants to report to the people, why can't he
report to the legislature, the highest organ representing the
people?" Ma asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN ACCUSES OPPOSITION OF USING JUDICIAL CASES TO TRY TO USURP POWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian accused the
opposition Thursday of taking advantage of judicial cases to try to
usurp power by initiating a motion to recall him over the insider
trading allegations against his son-in-law.</P>
      <P>In the latest edition of his online newsletter, Chen wrote that
over the past six years since the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
came to power, a tug-of-war between pro-reform and anti-reform forces
has been going on in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The political storms, including presidential recall campaigns
and no-confidence votes against the Cabinet, that I have faced
repeatedly since my inauguration in 2000 are all the result of this
political struggle, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the differences over the direction, objective
and method of reforms should be resolved through discussion and
should not be turned into a politicized debate.</P>
      <P>"What is more unacceptable to us is for some political parties or
individuals to take advantage of judicial cases to try to usurp
political power," he said.</P>
      <P>The president said he is sorry that he failed to make everyone
happy about his performance, although he has tried very hard to do a
good job to improve the freedom, democracy, prosperity and stability
of Taiwan over the past six years.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his being elected by the people to the presidency
means "responsibility and obligations rather than fame or power" and
that from the day he was sworn in, he accepted the responsibilities
and obligations handed to him by the people.</P>
      <P>"Everyday during my term, I must do the best job possible and
honestly exercise the power granted by the Constitution. I will not
cross the line or drag my feet, nor will I be influenced by the
recent uproar," he said.</P>
      <P>Expressing confidence in Taiwan's judiciary, democracy and
people, Chen said it is unnecessary for him to "dance to the tune of
others" and that he believes the people will give him their support
as long as he persists in "doing the right thing and walking the
right path."</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is set to review an opposition-initiated
motion to recall Chen next week and has requested Chen to present a
written statement to the legislature to respond to the charges made
against him before the review process starts.</P>
      <P>It is likely that Chen will ignore the request, with DPP
officials dismissing the rationale of the recall campaign as
"reckless" and "ridiculous" and suggesting that the president report
directly to the people.</P>

      <P>The prosecution will decide whether or not
to summon first lady Wu Shu-jen according to the law, based on the
on-going investigation into the ownership fight over Pacific Sogo
Department Store, a prosecutor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Lin Pang-liang of the Taipei District Court
said that the prosecution has summoned most witnesses or suspects in
connection with a financial bail-out and ownership fight for the
store and that it is now probing the flow of vouchers.</P>
      <P>It was the use and sale of Pacific Sogo gift vouchers that the
first lady was allegedly involved in. "Depending on the needs of the
investigation of the case, we will decide whether or not to summon Wu
Shu-jen," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As to media reports that the prosecutors may visit Wu's residence
to conduct their questioning, Lin said it is too early to speculate
how the prosecution will go about questioning Wu if it decides to do
so.</P>
      <P>"Every step will be followed according to the law, and what
should be done will be done," he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-wen, spokeswoman for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
urged the judicial authorities not to "draw a red line" for

      <P>Taiwan is a democracy and all men and women are equal before the

privileges to members of the first family when it comes to
investigating alleged crimes.</P>
      <P>While encouraging the working-level judicial officials to "just
do your job in finding all the facts about alleged irregularities, "
Cheng called on top officials of the judicial branch to "resist

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey found that the typical breakfast
of elementary school children in Taiwan is excessive in calories and
deficient in calcium.</P>
      <P>Judging from the breakfast menus provided by more than 600
parents around the island, professor Chen Chun-jun from Taipei
Medical University found that nearly 80 percent of children in the
country ingest less than 300 milligrams of calcium for breakfast, or
one-third of the daily amount suggested for children.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the main foods eaten for breakfast by Taiwan
children are bread, rice porridge, hamburgers, sandwiches, and egg
cakes, with milk tea and soybean milk being the main beverages.</P>
      <P>In general, the average breakfast eaten by children in Taiwan is
excessive in calories and deficient in calcium, Chen said, adding
that some beverages containing caffeine even affect calcium
absorption.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that insufficient calcium will affect children's
growth and learning capability.</P>
      <P>In addition, food deficient in calcium will make children prone
to be nervous and irritable, which can be aggravated by lack of
quality sleep, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that parents prepare breakfasts that are higher in
calcium for their children, saying that fresh milk, tofu, cheese,
fried fish and green soybean are all good choices. He said this will
help improve their children's concentration and calm their mood
during the morning, which he pointed out is the best period of the
day for learning.</P>

irregularities surrounding the use and sale of Pacific Sogo
Department Store vouchers turned out to be a sham.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi of the Kuomintang (KMT) made the vow at a Legislative
Yuan public hearing on a Sogo gift voucher saga that was boycotted by
all invitees, including first lady Wu Shu-jen and Bureau of
Investigation Director Yeh Sheng-mao.</P>
      <P>Evidence shows Wu has used some of the suspicious vouchers, Chiu
told the public hearing sponsored by legislative caucuses of the KMT
and People First Party (PFP) , which form the "pan-blue alliance" in
Taiwan's politics.</P>
      <P>He has previously claimed that a group of seven ladies -- wives
of senior officials and rich businessmen -- had jointly bought the
vouchers and that "old vouchers" issued by the store's former
management had been exchanged for new ones in larger denominations.</P>
      <P>"All these claims can be verified," he stated.</P>
      <P>He challenged Formosa Television and the Liberty Times newspaper
"to quit the market," as well, if the two media outlets' reports were
proven untrue when they alleged his stories about the Sogo vouchers
"had mistaken incident A for incident B" and were a "big sham."</P>
      <P>In connection with the ownership fight over the department store,
the prosecutors summoned Ma Yung-cheng, former deputy
secretary-general to President Chen Shui-bian, for questioning
Thursday. This was the second time Ma has been called in for
questioning in relation to the suspected acceptance of favors.</P>
      <P>Also under questioning was Chen Che-nan, another senior aide to
the president, who is under detention on charges of fraud in an
influence-peddling case and has been indicted in connection with the
Kaohsiung rapid transit scandal.</P>
      <P>Judicial sources said Ma and Chen, both right-hand men of the
president, would face each other in a cross-examination about their
respective roles in the Sogo saga.</P>

      <P>The celebrated marching band of Taipei
First Girls High (TFGH) School has been invited to take part
beginning June 30 in an American parade marking the 230th anniversary
of the Declaration of Independence of the United States, a TFGH
source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Chin Pu-tsung presented the Republic of China
national flag to the 160-member TFGH marching band at a ceremony held
at the high school. He gave his blessing to band members, exhorting
them to demonstrate all the talent and energy of Taiwanese girls, and
to be "sunshine Mulans" -- a reference to an ancient Chinese heroine
who posed as a man to join the army in place of her aged father and
was later commended by the king for her service.</P>
      <P>The TFGH marching band is scheduled to take part in an

performing at Longweed Gardens in the state of Pennsylvania July 2,
and at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C. July 3,
the TFGH source said.</P>
      <P>TFGH's marching band is considered a source of pride for Taiwan

    <DATELINE>Berlin,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-li &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading travel publisher in Germany,
Polyglott Tours &amp; Travel AG, published a new guidebook this month
that is considered the most useful and detailed German-language
source of information for traveling in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 106-page color travel guide contains comprehensive summaries
of Taiwan's history, culture and politics, while recommending four
key tours in the island's northern, central, southern, and eastern
regions, and covering 12 major sightseeing attractions including the
capital city of Taipei, the wood sculpture township of Sanyi and
Kenting National Park.</P>
      <P>The guide also provides detailed information about special folk
traditions and cultural life in Taiwan, such as the night markets,
hot springs, tea ceremony, local religion and traditional puppet
shows.</P>
      <P>The author, Guenter Whittome, also reminds his readers --
would-be travelers to Taiwan -- of the existence of many cultural
differences, such as the custom of not leaving chopsticks upright in
bowls or the acceptability of making lip-smacking noises while
dining.</P>
      <P>For instance, Whittome notes in his new book that most Taiwanese
are not accustomed to paying the check separately while dining with
friends because one of them will "fight to pay."</P>
      <P>Whittome, who holds a degree in Sinology from Hamburg University,
said in an interview with CNA Wednesday that to refresh the German
media's outdated image of Taiwan, he spent more than half a year
writing the guidebook hoping his compatriots would better understand
modern Taiwan and how its culture differs from China's.</P>
      <P>Whittome has resided in Taiwan for three years, and is currently
working as a translator in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau in Frankfurt has ordered 10,000 copies of
the book to send free copies to Europeans who are preparing to travel
to Taiwan, office director Chan Wei-ting said.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan guidebook is expected to be on shelves of
bookstores around Germany and German-speaking countries including
Austria and Switzerland, according to Polyglott.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES PUBLIC NOT TO POLITICIZE PEIYI FREEWAY PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the public
Thursday not to politicize the upcoming official opening of the Peiyi
Freeway, which he called "a major construction project that
belongs to all of the people."</P>
      <P>Responding to allegations that the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government has hastened construction work at the expense of
safety considerations in an attempt to take credit for the project,
Chen said "the credit and honor do not go to myself alone just
because the project has been completed during my term."</P>
      <P>The president said such "politicized defamation" is severely
damaging to the morale of the thousands of workers who built the
Peiyi Freeway.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in the latest edition of his online
newsletter, in which he paid tribute to the 25 workers who died
during the construction of the Hsuehshan Tunnel -- the centerpiece of
the 55-km Peiyi Freeway linking Taipei to the northeastern county
of Yilan. The 13-km tunnel -- the fifth longest of its kind in the
world and Southeast Asia's longest -- is set to be inaugurated
Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Hsuehshan Tunnel is one of the most
difficult construction projects in the world owing to fragile
geological conditions and bountiful underground water deposits, which
have caused several accidents and seriously hindered the progress of
construction.</P>
      <P>However, the difficulties were finally overcome with the
persistent efforts of the government and construction workers over
the past 15 years, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that two presidents and eight premiers have
witnessed the tunneling project since its inception on July 15, 1991,
and that each of these leaders have contributed toward the Peiyi
Freeway and Hsuehshan Tunnel projects.</P>
      <P>"The Peiyi Freeway belongs to all of the people. The painting
inside the Hsuehshan Tunnel is also colorful, definitely not
completely blue or green," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the inauguration of the Hsuehshan Tunnel will
mark the Peiyi Freeway's official opening to traffic, which will
significantly cut down travel time between Yilan and the Western part
of Taiwan to 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>"This is not only the third historic milestone in the development
of Yilan's outbound transportation but it's also a sign that the
development of Yilan is entering a new stage," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"This is a major event for Yilan and Taiwan, and a cause for
great celebration by the whole nation," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday that a U.S.-based representative of the "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) has informed him
the United States "welcomes him for a visit."</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks amid news reports that the long-stalled
arms procurement package with the United States has affected
Taiwan-U.S. relations. Taiwan's diplomatic corps has attempted to
arrange Wang's meeting with U.S. officials, but the United States had
declined the request on grounds that "the arms procurement project
has yet to make headway," according to the reports.</P>
      <P>The multi-billion-dollar arms deal -- including the purchase of
eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
batteries -- has been blocked for two years by the
opposition-dominated legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Yuan Chien-sheng, the U.S.-based representative of
the KMT and PFP, has conveyed the United States' welcome gesture and
that the U.S. also wants to learn about the reasons behind such
reports.</P>
      <P>Wang has canceled his planned trip in late June to the United
States because of an extraordinary session of the Legislative Yuan
slated for June 13-30.</P>
      <P>Wang received Stephen Yates, former deputy national security
adviser to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, earlier in the day, and
Yates expressed concern about the political turmoil in the
wake of a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian initiated by the
"pan-blue alliance" in the legislature.</P>
      <P>The opposition argues the President's leadership has been cast in
doubt in the wake of a series of corruption allegations against
Chen's son-in-law and close associates.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Pushy, " one-sided legislation of a law
governing the opening of direct transport links between Taiwan and
China can never supersede official negotiations between the two sides
on the issue, a government spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said the administration
will promote cross-Taiwan Strait interaction, including the opening
of direct transport links, only when Taiwan's identity is championed
and the government's power of authority secured.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced a day
earlier that Taiwan had reached agreement with China on measures with
regard to four kinds of cross-strait charter flight services -- the
launch of special charter cargo flights, the regularization of
cross-strait charter passenger flights for special holidays, the
operation of charter services for emergency medical needs and flights
for humanitarian purposes.</P>
      <P>The opening of the new measures is not only poised to provide
better services for people traveling across the Taiwan Strait but has
been met favorably by U.S. liaison officers stationed in Taiwan, Cheng
claimed.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Cheng said, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang and the People First Party has continued to push for
the passage of a cross-strait direct transport links bill and the
bill will be screened during the June 13-30 extraordinary legislative
session.</P>
      <P>Cheng reiterated that cross-strait exchange programs can be
implemented only after government-authorized negotiations are
completed to ensure that such policies, including cross-strait
transport links, are safe and that Taiwan's interests are not
compromised.</P>
      <P>Cheng ridiculed some politicians for what he described as
"wishful thinking" that direct transport links can be opened as a

water, extreme temperatures, shock and vibration, and are suitable

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>State-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar)
recalled all its nutritional yeast products Thursday after public
prosecutors in Tainan, southern Taiwan, detained a former Taisugar
executive and an importer for supplying hog feed to the company to
produce health products for human consumption.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors at the Tainan District Court arrested Lin
Ying-hua, a manager in charge of food production at Taisugar's
Hsinying plant, and Tseng Teh-fu, former owner of an import firm that
supplied performance protein powder to Taisugar to manufacture
nutritional yeast products, including vitamin yeast, flavored vitamin
yeast and yeast candy.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors searched six locations in Tainan City and Tainan
County Wednesday and questioned eight people, including four Taisugar
employees.</P>
      <P>According to Yen Jung-sung, chief prosecutor at the Tainan Public
Prosecutor's Office, Taisugar stopped producing material for its
yeast products in 1993 when the production cost increased to
NT$150-NT$200 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>Instead, the company began to procure the material -- performance
protein powder -- from abroad through an import firm, Hua Wei Trading
Co., managing to lower the cost to NT$38-NT$50 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>Yen said the performance protein powder imported by Hua Wei from
Egypt and Belgium at about NT$10 per kilogram was meant to be used
for hog feed only and that the customs import declaration forms
stated clearly that the material was not for human consumption.</P>
      <P>However, the import firm had the material repackaged and sold it
to Taisugar for producing nutritional yeast products. For 13 years,
consumers, including many children, have been using these nutritional
supplements without knowing that they have actually been eating hog
feed, Yen said angrily.</P>
      <P>Taisugar admitted Thursday that there were "some problems" with
the company's internal controls. A spokesman said the company will
begin an investigation to find those responsible for the negligence.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Rapid Descent
Bet on Huge Plane Trips Up Airbus

Airbus's high-stakes bet on a giant plane is
running into serious trouble, creating a major
crunch for one of Europe's industrial titans as
it battles Boeing Co. for dominance of the
passenger-jet market. Airbus announced Tuesday
that deliveries of its double-decker A380,
designed to be the world's largest passenger
jet, would face a further six months of delays
because of the unexpected complexity of wiring
the aircraft. Shares in European Aeronautic
Defence &amp; Space Co., which owns 80% of Airbus,
fell 26% yesterday as investors panicked about
the A380 and other bad news. EADS said the delay
would shave US$2.5 billion in operating profit
between 2007 and 2010.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGES BUSINESSMEN TO EVALUATE BEFORE INVESTING IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  15  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen should evaluate
prudently before investing in China amid its changing economic
climate, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a seminar on the impact of cross-Taiwan Strait relations on
local laborers, Wu noted that Taiwan businessmen with operations in
China are facing increasing social, legal, economic, personal
security, tax, anti-dumping, and electricity deficiency problems due
to China's rapidly changing economy.</P>
      <P>According to statistics, the number of Taiwanese businessmen with
operations in China surpassed 600,000 currently, and the number of
cases involving Taiwanese businessmen's personal security increased
from 67 in 2001 to 133 in 2005.</P>
      <P>With the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor in
China, the social order is deteriorating rapidly, making it almost
impossible for the police to reach trouble spots in time, according to
Wu.</P>
      <P>In addition, conflicts between management and labor, the lack of
rule of law, and the corrupt government have made investments by
Taiwan businessmen more risky, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Taiwan businessmen should also pay heed to several
factors in their investments in China such as increasing operating
costs there, the "saturated Chinese market" and the continued
appreciation of China's currency, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government will present more incentives in an attempt
to persuade overseas Taiwan businessmen to invest in Taiwan based on
the "active management, effective liberalization" policy announced by
President Chen Shui-bian in his New Year's Day speech.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOI CHIEF TO BE SUMMONED IN SLANDER SUIT AGAINST PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bureau of Investigation (BOI) Director Yeh
Sheng-mao and so-called media pundit Chang You-hua will be summoned
to appear in court July 20 to testify in a slander suit filed by
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong against President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Soong is suing the president for alleging that he met with a
senior Chinese official in the United States in early 2005, an
allegation that Soong claims is groundless but Chen claims is "based
on something."</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-hao, the president's legal counsel, said Chen based his
allegations on "intelligence" gathered by national security
authorities and the Bureau of Investigation, as well as statements
made by Chang and reports carried in the United Daily News (UDN).</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court summoned a UDN reporter Thursday for
questioning about the case regarding the alleged secret meeting
between Soong and Chen Yunlin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs
Office.</P>
      <P>The reporter said at the hearing that his source in national
security circles told him that Soong met with Chen Yunlin, but he
refused to identify his source.</P>
      <P>Responding to the reporter's testimony, Soong's lawyer Lee
Tien-fu said Soong stayed in Las Vegas Jan. 3-9, 2005, while Chen
Yunlin made a transit stop in San Francisco Jan. 7, 2005 on his way
back to China after a U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>When Soong met with a senior U.S. official Jan. 14, Chen Yunlin
had long since left the U.S., Lee said, adding that even if the U.S.
official had indeed arranged for a Soong-Chen meeting as claimed by
the UDN reporter, it could not have taken place as Chen had left for
home by that time.</P>
      <P>The presiding judge said a second hearing will be held July 20,
when Yeh and Chang will be subpoenaed.</P>
      <P>Soong filed the slander suit against the president last June on
the grounds that the "unfounded claim" of his meeting affected voter
confidence in his integrity. Since the president has never produced
evidence proving that the meeting took place, Soong demanded the
president run an apology in local newspapers for one day and pay a
symbolic NT$1 in damages. Last October, Soong expanded his
compensation demand, asking the president to run an apology in
newspapers for three days and pay NT$50 million in damages.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang, accompanied by
three former premiers, rode a jeep through the 12.9-km Hsuehshan
Tunnel in 20 minutes Friday, officially inaugurating the longest
tunnel in Southeast Asia and the fifth longest in the world.</P>
      <P>The Hsuehshan Tunnel, known as a "construction miracle, " is the
centerpiece of the 55.3-km "Chiang Wei-shui Freeway" linking Nankang
in the northern city of Taipei to Suao in the northeastern county of
Yilan.</P>
      <P>The opening of the freeway to traffic -- after 15 years of
painstaking construction at a cost of more than NT$100 billion
(US$3.11 billion) -- will significantly cut down travel time between
Taipei and Yilan, as well as reduce travel time between Nankang and
Suao to 45 minutes from nearly three hours.</P>
      <P>Before taking the ride, Su and his predecessors, Frank Hsieh, Yu
Shyi-kun and Chang Chun-hsiung, as well as officials from the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications attended a ceremony
held at the Shihting Service Stop to pay tribute to the 25 workers
who died during the construction of the Hsuehshan Tunnel.</P>
      <P>The Hsuehshan Tunnel was one of the most difficult construction
projects in the world owing to the fragile geological conditions and
bountiful underground water deposits, which caused several accidents
and seriously hindered the progress of construction.</P>
      <P>Two presidents and eight premiers have witnessed the tunneling
project since its inception on July 15, 1991.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and the Yilan County government jointly
proposed in January this year that the tunnel be named the "Chiang
Wei-shui Freeway" to commemorate Chiang, a physician and a native of
Yilan who was known as a historic trailblazer in Taiwan's democracy
movement during the period of Japanese colonial rule.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Friday that
domestic differences over cross-strait trade policy have narrowed and
that there is room for expansion in this policy.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while delivering a speech on Taiwan's
current economic situation and its prospects at the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>She noted that cross-strait issues and globalization have been
major issues for nearly half a century but that they have only become
the focus of public debate over the last decade. In other words, she
said, the problems accumulated over the past 50 years have surfaced
during the past decade, and this is why Taiwan has gone through a
period of confusion amid disagreement.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai said that she personally feels that following this
turbulent period, the differences on these issues have narrowed. As
such, there is room for cross-strait policy to be expanded and
adjusted, she added.</P>
      <P>The level of cross-strait policy adjustment will be deliberated
at a conference on policy options and initiatives for Taiwan's

      <P>Taiwan and Nicaragua signed a free trade
agreement (FTA) in Taipei Friday, a move that is expected to
strengthen bilateral cooperation in trade and investment.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san and Nicaraguan
Minister of Industry, Development &amp; Commerce Alejandro Arguello
signed the FTA at the ministry on behalf of the respective
governments, ending nearly two years of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Nicaragua is the third country to sign an FTA with Taiwan after
Panama and Guatemala. The FTA will go into effect after it has been
approved by the legislatures of both countries.</P>
      <P>The ministry hopes that it will be put into practice early next
year, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>He said the signing of the FTA signals closer trade cooperation
between the two countries and a giant step forward for Taiwan on the
international trade stage.</P>
      <P>Both sides can complement each other economically through the
removal of trade barriers and can boost trade opportunities through
increased trade, investment and technology cooperation relations.</P>
      <P>Economic officials said that after the FTA goes into effect,
Nicaragua will provide immediate tariff-free treatment for 3,374
products from Taiwan (accounting for 51.1 percent of its exports to
Nicaragua). In turn, Taiwan will immediately remove tariffs on 5,797
products provided by Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>Fifteen years after the FTA goes into effect, 97.3 percent of
Nicaraguan products will go freely into the Taiwan market, while 95.1
percent of Taiwan products will be able to enter the Nicaraguan
market freely, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that a Central America FTA signed between Nicaragua

FTA would provide opportunities for Taiwan businesses to tap the
North American market.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Activists representing 75 civic groups from
around the country met at a news conference Friday to demand that the
people's environmental rights be included in the Constitution to
better protect the environment.</P>
      <P>Major propositions of a draft constitutional amendment
stipulating the people's environmental rights -- authored by the
Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) -- include that the
people should have the right to oppose to regulations or policies
that undermine their environmental rights and that the people should
have the right to determine or oversee public development projects
carried out in their communities.</P>
      <P>Other propositions of the draft also stipulate that the
government should come up with policies and measures to enhance
sustainable use of national resources; that "people should be allowed
to live in harmony with nature;" and that Taiwan should be made
nuclear-free.</P>
      <P>TEPU Secretary-General Ho Tsung-hsun said that only when the
people's environmental rights are written into the Constitution can
environmental protection and soil and water conservation be secured
under the law.</P>
      <P>Ho expressed hope that such a constitutional amendment proposal
-- a bottom-up initiative combining the strength of private groups
and civic societies -- will let the Taiwan people perceive more
deeply the importance of their environment and understand that
environmental rights are their right.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Professor Shih Hsin-min said people in
the United States and Europe have become environmentally conscious
since the 1970s and some U.S. states have even enacted laws governing
matters concerning the relations between people and the environment.</P>
      <P>Shih said it is right and crucial that Taiwan consider including
environmental rights into the Constitution. By doing so, the Taiwan
people would not only improve the Constitution, they would also be
doing the right thing as members of the global village, Shih added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Wei-chin, a man in his early 20s and a TEPU
volunteer, staged a skit at the news conference in which he pasted
paper notes indicating mudslides, nuclear waste and
mercury-contaminated dirt on his naked body.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO RUN ADS TO COUNTERATTACK MOTION TO RECALL PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will run advertisements in the media from Saturday in attempt
to counter an opposition legislative motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian, a DPP official said Friday.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang noted that the DPP has made
several TV ads to highlight the party's goal of boosting the economy
and increasing the welfare of the people amid the current political
upheaval.</P>
      <P>Tsai described Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, as the "source of political turmoil" in Taiwan after Ma
revealed his plan to solicit support from the public for a campaign
organized by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" to oust Chen over a
string of corruption allegations implicating his son-in-law and close
aides.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the DPP will not exclude the possibility of
posting frequent ads before June 27, when the recall motion will be
put to a vote in the legislature, "to avoid Taiwan falling into
chaos."</P>
      <P>Asked whether DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun will participate in a
rally to be organized by some pro-DPP groups Saturday to
counterattack the "pan-blue alliance" recall motion, Tsai said Yu's
schedule had not been fixed.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Saturday's rally will be aimed at seeking to
stabilize the political situation and boost the economy, Huang said
the DPP will try to render assistance to the participants, but
expressed hope that the rally will be conducted "rationally and
peacefully."</P>
      <P>Organizers said they hope to attract some 50,000 people to the
rally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HSINCHU ENCOURAGES MORE RESIDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 60 government agencies and
private organizations in the northern city of Hsinchu have planned
nearly 100 sporting events this year in the hope of encouraging more
residents to play sports or exercise, Hsinchu Mayor Lin Cheng-tze
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin revealed the city's plan to boost the sports participation
rate at a news conference Friday, expressing his hope that the number
of participants will surge to 100,000 people in 2006.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of the Multiplied Sports Population Project that
the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sport (NCPFS) launched
in 2002 in an effort to encourage people to improve their fitness and
in the hope that everyone in the country will develop the habit of
participating in sport or exercise.</P>
      <P>The project was proposed after a survey released in 2001 showed
that at least 33 percent of Taiwan's population had not engaged in
sports or exercise in the past three months. As the average weight of
adults is climbing each year, losing weight and keeping fit have come
to play an important role in the lives of the people, according to
the NCPFS.</P>
      <P>Under the project, a goal is set at increasing the number of
participants in sports by 50,000 each year from 2002 to 2007 through
teaching sports novices how to exercise.</P>
      <P>As of December 2004, schools, sports organizations, and local
governments throughout Taiwan had offered a total of 6,857 programs
to Taiwan citizens, thereby increasing the number of people
participating in sports by 1.6 million, the NCPES said.</P>
      <P>The planned sports-promotion programs in Hsinchu cover swimming,
dancing, mountain climbing, roller-skating and ball sports. Detailed
information about the events is available at the city government Web
site at http://www.hceb.edu.tw/index.aspx.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health authorities in the eastern county of
Hualien cautioned the public Friday against Japanese encephalitis in
the wake of one confirmed case of the disease in the county.</P>
      <P>According to Shih Jen-hsing, head of Hualien's health bureau, six
suspected cases of Japanese encephalitis have been reported in
Hualien this year, with one case having been confirmed.</P>
      <P>Shih urged the public to avoid pigsties, animal housing and places
where mosquitoes multiply to reduce the risk of contracting the
mosquito-borne virus.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the Japanese encephalitis virus usually multiplies
among pigs first before it is spread to human via mosquitoes, Shih
noted.</P>
      <P>The outbreak peaks two to three weeks after the Japanese
encephalitis virus antibody-positive rate among pigs exceeds 50
percent, with the peak season running approximately one month, Shih
said.</P>
      <P>Tests conducted May 27 on pigs in Hualien indicated that the
positive rate had reached 54 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that while Japanese encephalitis has become an endemic
disease in Taiwan, the country reports only 10 to 20 confirmed cases
of the disease per year owing to the government's efforts to control
the disease over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>In Hualien County, eight confirmed cases were reported in 2004
and three confirmed cases were reported in 2005, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO ENFORCE CONSENSUS REACHED IN CONFERENCE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that the
Cabinet will put into force any consensus reached at a conference on
sustainable economic growth slated for July 27-28.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a preparatory meeting of the conference, Su assured
the public that consensus reached will be implemented by the
Executive Yuan "with full vigor and urgency," while majority opinions
will be referred to Cabinet agencies for future reference.</P>
      <P>Su appealed to all prospective participants in the conference to
contribute their foresight and wisdom on structural, chronic and
controversial issues that Taiwan faces so as to help the government
map out policy options and initiatives for the country's sustainable
economic growth.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the conference's top goal is to mend
differences and shape consensus on those issues to pave the way for
necessary legislation and solutions.</P>
      <P>It is undeniable that Taiwan is facing various major challenges,
ranging from an increasingly graying society and declining birth rate
to a lack of a social security system and imbalanced manpower
resources.</P>
      <P>Finding a way to secure a balance between economic development
and environmental conservation is another major challenge facing
Taiwan, Su said, adding that divided opinions on financial reforms
and building Taiwan into a regional finance hub in the Asian-Pacific
region also need to be smoothed out.</P>
      <P>Most of all, Su said, in the face of China's rise, finding ways
to retain Taiwan's competitiveness and "economic identity, " and
secure a dynamic balance between global markets and the Chinese
market, is probably the greatest challenge that Taiwan is facing and
needs to tackle immediately.</P>
      <P>Su declared that the results achieved in the coming six weeks by
the preparatory meeting -- which will be divided into five panels --
will be the key to success of the July 27-28 conference.</P>
      <P>Su himself, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Vincent
Siew, a former premier who is now chairman of the Chunghua
Institution for Economic Research, will serve as co-conveners of the
sustainable growth conference.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 12-member advisory group has been formed to offer
counseling on the agenda and policy options to be addressed during
conference. Among the members are former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung,
former Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker P.K. Chiang and former vice
premiers Wu Rong-i and Lin Hsin-i, as well as CommonWealth Magazine

      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat whose skipper was
allegedly killed by Chinese crewmen on the high seas near Japan's
Iwo Jima island in the Pacific Ocean will be escorted back to Taiwan
next week, coast guard officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that one of two patrol vessels sent to help
the boat, the Hsinglung, from the port of Suao in Yilan County,
intercepted the vessel early Friday about 95 nautical miles west of
Iwo Jima.</P>
      <P>After coast guard officers boarded the fishing boat, two Chinese
crewmen admitted in an initial investigation that they killed
the skipper, Chen Mu-tsai, with a knife, and that his body was put on
ice in his cabin.</P>
      <P>Chief engineer Huang Chin-hsin and the other crewmen are safe,
the coast guard officers said.</P>
      <P>The Hsinlung has eight Chinese crew, with only Chen and Huang
being Taiwanese.
</P>
      <P>It is the second time that the boat's two Taiwanese officers have
been overpowered by Chinese fishery workers. In August 2004, Chen and
Huang were held hostage by nine Chinese crewmen who then took the
Hsinglung to Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Chen had served as skipper on the ship for more than a decade,
and because he had often run into trouble with crewmen hired from
Pingtang, Fujian Province, he hired crewmen from Zhangzhou, also in
Fujian this year, but had problems with them also.</P>

Congress Erupts in Partisan Fight Over Iraq War 

The U.S. House and the Senate engaged in
angry, intensely partisan debate on Thursday
over the war in Iraq, as Republicans sought to
rally support for the Bush administration's
policies and exploit Democratic divisions in an
election year shadowed by unease over the war.
It was one of the sharpest legislative clashes 
yet over the three-year-old conflict, and it came
after three days in which President Bush and 
his aides had sought to portray Iraq as moving 
gradually toward a stable, functioning democracy,
and to portray Democrats as lacking the will to 
see the conflict through to victory.

Wall Street Journal: In Military-Spending
Boom, Expensive Pet Projects Prevail

Five years after the Sept. 11 attacks
changed American military priorities, the U.S.
defense machine is still churning out weapons
made for old-style, conventional conflicts, even
as it needs new tools to battle terrorists and
insurgents. One big reason is the sclerotic
nature of the procurement process, in which the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pro-independence groups will stage a mass
rally on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office
Saturday to denounce an opposition-initiated campaign to recall
President Chen Shui-bian over corruption allegations implicating his
family and close aides.</P>
      <P>"The rally is part of our efforts to stabilize the political
turmoil arising from the presidential recall motion launched by the
'pan-blue' alliance of the Kuomintang and People First Party, "said
Yang Wen-chia, secretary-general of Taiwan Society North, one of the
event's organizers.</P>
      <P>The rally will feature themes of "sense and sensibility, " Yang
said, adding that pro-independence heavyweights -- including Koo
Kuan-min, a former senior presidential adviser -- will deliver
speeches at the rally to condemn the pan-blue alliance for mounting
the recall campaign for its own political gain at the expense of
social stability and harmony.</P>
      <P>Yang added he is hopeful that the rally can attract at least
50,000 people to attend.</P>
      <P>Over the past two consecutive weekends, pan-blue supporters have
rallied at the same location to pressure Chen to step down to assume
responsibility for the alleged involvement of his son-in-law and
aides in insider trading or illicit business deals.</P>
      <P>The opposition hopes to soon gain sufficient support in the
legislature to put the recall motion to a vote in a public
referendum.</P>
      <P>However, Yang said the bid to unseat Chen is unjustified because
the president was not personally implicated in any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Two "pan-green" camp parties -- the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union, both known as pro-independence
sympathizers -- have encouraged their members to take part in the
rally to call for a speedy end to the "recall drama" and an immediate

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday Taiwan
will continue helping its African allies combat diseases, such as
AIDS, malaria and avian influenza.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge while attending a reception hosted by the
joint trade office of African countries in Taipei to celebrate Africa
Day.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the United Nations and the World
Health Organization, Chen said over 60 percent of HIV carriers live
in areas south of the Sahara desert, including Taiwan's diplomatic
allies of Malawi and Swaziland.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, Chen said, Taiwan has posted public health and
medical personnel in Malawi to assist in AIDS prevention and control.
In July 2004, Taiwan's medical mission at Malawi's Mzuzuin Central
Hospital opened an AIDS outpatient department with pharmaceutical
support from the United Nations. The department, also known as
Rainbow outpatient service, has since offered the AIDS drug ARV to
patients free of charge.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan medical mission in Malawi has also developed a
fingerprint identification system (FPIS) to monitor AIDS patients'
use of AIDS drug.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Rainbow outpatience service has become one of the
best AIDS screening centers in Malawi and has laid a solid basis for
Taiwan to set up an AIDS research center in Africa. At present, Chen
said Taiwan is preparing to open a similar FPIS center in Swaziland
to help with that country's AIDS prevention and control program.</P>
      <P>In the past few months, Chen went on, Taiwan has sent medical
personnel to Burkina Faso and Chad to assist in fighting avian flu
infections, offering epidemic-fighting drugs and medical supplies.
Over the years, Chen said, Taiwan has also spared no efforts to help
Sao Tome and Principe -- as well as the Gambia -- fight malaria amd
other tropical diseases.</P>
      <P>"All these efforts signify our determination to assist our
African allies fight diseases and promote public health," Chen said,
adding that over the past decades, Taiwan has also assisted its
African allies in agricultural and fishery development as well as in
medical services, education and infrastructural construction.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday Taiwan
will continue helping its African allies combat diseases, such as
AIDS, malaria and avian influenza.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge while attending a reception hosted by the
joint trade office of African countries in Taipei to celebrate Africa
Day.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the United Nations and the World
Health Organization, Chen said over 60 percent of HIV carriers live
in areas south of the Sahara desert, including Taiwan's diplomatic
allies of Malawi and Swaziland.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, Chen said, Taiwan has posted public health and
medical personnel in Malawi to assist in AIDS prevention and control.
In July 2004, Taiwan's medical mission at Malawi's Mzuzuin Central
Hospital opened an AIDS outpatient department with pharmaceutical
support from the United Nations. The department, also known as
Rainbow outpatient service, has since offered the AIDS drug ARV to
patients free of charge.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan medical mission in Malawi has also developed a
fingerprint identification system (FPIS) to monitor AIDS patients'
use of AIDS drug.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Rainbow outpatience service has become one of the
best AIDS screening centers in Malawi and has laid a solid basis for
Taiwan to set up an AIDS research center in Africa. At present, Chen
said Taiwan is preparing to open a similar FPIS center in Swaziland
to help with that country's AIDS prevention and control program.</P>
      <P>In the past few months, Chen went on, Taiwan has sent medical
personnel to Burkina Faso and Chad to assist in fighting avian flu
infections, offering epidemic-fighting drugs and medical supplies.
Over the years, Chen said, Taiwan has also spared no efforts to help
Sao Tome and Principe -- as well as the Gambia -- fight malaria amd
other tropical diseases.</P>
      <P>"All these efforts signify our determination to assist our
African allies fight diseases and promote public health," Chen said,
adding that over the past decades, Taiwan has also assisted its
African allies in agricultural and fishery development as well as in
medical services, education and infrastructural construction.</P>
      <P>In addition to chiefs of the African diplomatic missions in
Taipei, King Mswati III of Swaziland, who is currently on a six-day

      <P>Environmental protection activists are
preparing to hold a nude protest rally June 26 at Fulung Beach in
Kungliao Township, Taipei County in a bid to save the beach from
coastal erosion caused by the construction of a nearby wharf for the
Fourth Nuclear Power Plant.</P>
      <P>Calling for the public to join the event, Ho Chung-hsun,
secretary-general of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union,
explained at a news conference Saturday that the idea behind holding
such an alternative protest is that "it is preferable to be naked
rather than having nuclear power."</P>
      <P>Ho indicated so far there are 13 male citizens, ages 25 to 45,
who have signed up for the protest activity. Coming from various
professional backgrounds, they are all joining the planned protest
for the same reason -- to oppose the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>The construction of the wharf, designed to import heavy machinery
to the power plant, has caused extensive damage to the nearby ecology
and marine biology, which was formerly home to over 120 kinds of
coral and numerous marine creatures.</P>
      <P>Now there is dying coral covered by sand from the construction
site of the wharf and increasing coastal erosion, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Once the plant begins commercial operations in the near future,
oceanic pollution on the northeast coast is expected to turn for the
worse as a result of steaming waste water emissions from the nuclear
power plant, Ho claimed.</P>
      <P>Information about the June 26 rally is available at the Web site
of the non-profit union at http://www.tepu.org.tw.</P>

      <P>Collision with birds may be responsible for
a fatal Air Force trainer jet crash occurring Saturday in southern
Chiayi County, Air Force officials said.</P>
      <P>However, they said, until the cause of the crash is determined,
other possible causes will not be ruled out, such as human error,
engine failure and environmental factors.</P>
      <P>The wreckage of the F5F aircraft was found ablaze in a crop field
in the county's Taipao city at 7:26 a.m., 26 minutes after taking off
from Taitung air base on a routine training flight.</P>
      <P>While pilot Chou Chieh-wei was killed in the crash, his trainee
Hsia Wen-yu sustained severe injuries but was reportedly in stable
condition after emergency treatment.</P>
      <P>According to Pan Kung-hsiao, chief inspector of the Ministry of
National Defense's Air Force Command Headquarters, the plane was
carrying out basic training at Chiayi air base with another trainer
jet when the accident took place.</P>
      <P>The plane had operated normally and didn't divert from its
designated route before the crash, and accounts by witnesses indicate
the two pilots did not try to escape by parachute, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Pan said the plane had flown for 6,595 hours, adding that Chou
had 2,638 hours of flying experience and Hsia had more than 400
hours.</P>
      <P>Pan said as bird feathers and bloodstains were found on the
landing gear of the other trainer jet that flew behind the crashed
plane, the military suspects the crash may have resulted from a bird
collision.</P>
      <P>The real cause of the crash will only be established after the
release of an investigative report on the accident, Pan said.</P>
      <P>If engine failure is to blame for the crash, the military will
ground all aircraft using the same model of engines for inspection,
he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu Yu-tien, director of political warfare at the Air

      <P>Pre-schoolers in Taipei go to bed the
latest and have the shortest sleeping time compared with kids in
Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai and Seoul, according to the results of an
international survey released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The results were publicized by Tsai Chun-mei, a professor of
early childhood education at National Taipei University of Education.
The survey was conducted by a Japanese educational research and
development institute between March and June 2005 on 6,134 mothers
with children ages 3 to 6 from the five East Asian cities.</P>
      <P>The results show pre-schoolers in Taipei sleep an average 9
hours and 28 minutes per night, the shortest among the five cities
surveyed. Preschoolers in Tokyo have the longest sleeping time --
a nightly average of 10 hours and 6 minutes.</P>
      <P>While 75.8 percent of Tokyo children hit the sack before 9 p.m.,
only 26.4 percent of Taipei kids do so -- the lowest ratio among the
five cities surveyed.</P>
      <P>On how frequently they watch television, children in Taipei
have the third highest frequency after Tokyo and Seoul, the survey
shows.</P>
      <P>The time spent by Taipei children watching TV is the second
highest after Tokyo, with frequency of computer use among Taipei
children also second highest after Seoul.</P>

of sleep every night, and advised parents to ensure children follow
good sleeping habits in order to keep them healthy.</P>
      <P>Tsai warned that kids' eyesight may be negatively affected if too
much time is spent watching television or playing computer games,
suggesting children not be allowed to watch television for more than
two hours per day.</P>

      <P>State-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar)
should offer compensation and apologize for the sham health products
it produced from hog feed, the Consumers' Foundation said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The foundation's officials made the appeal after public
prosecutors of the Tainan District Court detained a former Taisugar
executive and an importer earlier this week to investigate the
procurement of hog feed to produce health food products for human
consumption.</P>
      <P>Taisugar has used the performance protein powder to manufacture
nutritional yeast products including vitamin yeast, flavored vitamin
yeast and yeast candy for the past 13 years.</P>
      <P>The foundation argues that although no evidence indicates
ingesting animal feed causes damage to humans, Taishugar has not
acted in good faith with regard to food safety regulations or
consumer protection.</P>
      <P>Taisugar's "viciousness" has destroyed the faith of consumers,
they said. According to food safety regulations, counterfeit food or
food additives should not be sold -- they should be seized and
destroyed immediately, they said.</P>
      <P>They demand that Taisugar propose a means of compensating
consumers based on sales of the four products made from hog feed
over the past 13 years.</P>
      <P>The company should also set up a foundation and put funds toward
making amends and compensation, they said.</P>
      <P>In addition, they are calling on Taisugar to set up a task force
to handle consumer complaints about refunds or compensation.
The foundation is also asking to meet Taisugar officials to discuss
matters concerning compensation.</P>

United States Special Operations troops

The investigation is the last of 12 major

Wall Street Journal: Profit Goals, A
Longtime Loser, Pro Soccer Begins To Score in
U.S.

The U.S. men's soccer team plays Italy in
the World Cup Saturday, and a loss would all but
end U.S. hopes of advancing to the second round
of the tournament -- arming critics who say
soccer in America is forever stuck in neutral.
But a funny thing is happening back home. Five 
years after nearly going out of business, Major 
League Soccer, the top U.S. league, is showing 
signs of growth, stability and even
profitability. MLS is attracting well-heeled
investors from the major U.S. sports leagues and
from traditional soccer countries. The Austrian
maker of the energy drink Red Bull is spending
more than US$100 million on the league's New
York team, and the owner of one of Mexico's most
popular soccer clubs has started a team in Los
Angeles. MLS teams are enjoying a US$700 million
stadium-building spree that will result in
seven of the league's 13 teams playing in venues
designed for soccer by next year. And the
league's exposure on television is increasing.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
put aside their political disputes and negotiate measures to protect 
the rights and personal safety of Taiwanese businesspeople operating
in China, known locally as "Taishang," the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with CNA, a SEF official said that
although "Taishang" have tried to keep a low profile and behave
prudently in China, many of them have often fallen victim to
criminal activities and accidents.</P>
      <P>As China's economy is transforming rapidly, the gap between
the rich and the poor is also widening quickly, the official said,
adding that Taiwanese businesspeople, with their brilliant economic
success, have become the envy of the Chinese and thus the target of
criminal rings there.</P>
      <P>According to statistics, the number of "Taishang" has
now surpassed 600,000, with the number of cases involving threats to
their personal security increasing from 67 in 2001 to 133 in 2005.</P>
      <P>Among various cities in China, Dongkuan, in Guangdong province,
saw the largest number of cases involving the personal security of
Taiwanese businesspeople in recent years, accounting for 27 percent
of cases, followed by Shenzhen, also in Guangdong province, with 13
percent.</P>
      <P>According to the official, there are over 80,000 Taiwan
businesspeople living in Dongkuan, a rural village turned
industrialized city thanks to Taiwanese investment.</P>
      <P>However, China-based Taiwanese will never understand that
their contribution has at the same time led to murder cases again and
again, the official added.</P>
      <P>The SEF official urged governments on both sides to engage in
talks and to ink an agreement as soon as possible to seek a solution
to this problem.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yueh, an associate professor in China studies at Tamkang
University, urged China-based Taiwanese to make a prudent evaluations
before investing in China -- and to think how they might save their
lives so they can spend the money they've earned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that
there is still much room for improvement in terms of the country's
law and order situation, and urged government agencies to work harder
toward achieving that goal.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while presiding at a meeting on
improving social order, the third such meeting since assuming the
post in late January.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan quoted the premier as
saying that various indicators suggest that Taiwan's law and order
situation has improved.</P>
      <P>Cheng cited a number of examples, such as crackdowns on places
selling ecstasy and illicit video game parlors, as well as the
confiscation of guns.</P>
      <P>A public survey conducted by the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission in late May showed nearly 30 percent of people
in Taiwan think the law and order situation has improved, compared
with 40 percent who said it is "about the same," and slightly more
than 10 percent who believe it has deteriorated.</P>
      <P>The premier is not yet content with the results, and believes that
all government agencies must work harder to deliver on his
promise to the people, according to Cheng. The premier recently
pledged to either improve law and order within six months or
step down.</P>
      <P>The premier instructed the Financial Supervisory Commission
and the Ministry of Finance to step up monitoring and regulation of
dummy banking accounts, as well as pre-paid cellphones.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior, the National Police Agency and the
National Communications Commission should work together to
strengthen telecommunications regulations to stem fraud,
the premier said.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that a lot of major economic criminals have
fled the country and sought refuge in China, and that he has
instructed related government agencies to seek judicial assistance
from the other side of the Taiwan Strait to extradite criminals
and bring them to justice.</P>
      <P>On cracking down on illegal gambling activity and prostitution,
the premier has asked the ministry of Economic Affairs and
Ministry of Justice to rigorously carry out a policy of cutting
off the water and electricity supply to these businesses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN'S SUPPORTERS RALLY AGAINST RECALL CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pro-independence bigwigs and their
supporters came out in droves Saturday for a rally in Taipei to
denounce an opposition-initiated campaign to recall President Chen
Shui-bian over corruption allegations implicating his family and
close aides.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators waved flags and blew air horns at the rally at
the wide Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office in a
display of support for the embattled president. Braving blistering
mid-afternoon heat, some demonstrators held signs saying, "Society
Needs Stability, " while others sold T-shirts that bear catch phrase
"Protect Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The rally was organized by major pro-independence groups, with
the support of two "pan-green camp" parties -- the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>Special booths were step up at the rally site for demonstrators
to sign their names against the opposition-initiated presidential
recall motion.</P>
      <P>Many rally-goers also lined up to sign their name in support of a
campaign for a referendum on forcing the main opposition Kuomintang
to return to national coffers its ill-gotten party assets allegedly
amassed during its 54-year rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pro-independence bigwigs took turn addressing the rally,
condemning the KMT-led opposition alliance for stirring up the
current political turmoil simply for their own political gain.</P>
      <P>Koo Kuan-min, a former senior presidential adviser, said KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeo's recent remarks "President Chen would die a
miserable death if he fails to resign" prompted him to revisit
several bloody incidents during the KMT's authoritarian rule,
including the murder in Taipei of Chen Wen-cheng, a pro-independence
U.S.-based scholar.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming said prosecution authorities should
look into whether any irregularities involving in the sale of a
Taipei City Government-owned bank to the private Fubon business group
several years ago as Ma concurrently serves as Taipei mayor. Lo also
questioned the legality of the sales of a large amount of the KMT's
ill-gotten or controversial real estate holdings since Ma took the
party's helm.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said the
recall campaign is mainly a political struggle for the opposition to
seize power.</P>
      <P>"At this turbulent time, we must stand united to bolster the
home-grown DPP administration. We must not give in to opposition
threats because the president himself has done nothing wrong, " Yu
said, adding that the DPP will not let down its supporters and will
conduct soul-searching and self-reflection to live up to public
expectations.</P>
      <P>Some of the demonstrators said they were tired of watching the
opposition demonstrate in the streets the past two weekends and that
they wanted their voices to be heard.</P>
      <P>The political turmoil was sparked by allegations that Chen's
son-in-law, Chao Chien-min, was involved in insider trading. Chao was
arrested on May 24 and the probe continues. </P>
      <P>The opposition is hoping to pass a motion on June 27 setting up a
public referendum to recall Chen. But many doubt the opposition,
which holds a slim majority in the legislature, will be able to
muster up the two-thirds majority it needs to approve the measure.</P>
      <P>The president and other high-ranking officials didn't appear at
the protest. KMT Chairman Ma said Saturday's protest showed that the
ruling party was failing to reflect on its leader's shortcomings.</P>
      <P>The rally was generally peaceful, but police wrestled a shirtless
man with a knife to the ground and grabbed the weapon from him. It
was not immediately clear what the man planned to do with the knife.</P>
      <P> On Sunday, the opposition plans to continue its protest
campaign with a rally in the central city of Changhua.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) Chairman Yu
Cheng-hsien apologized Saturday for the sham health products the
state-owned company produced from animal feed.</P>
      <P>"We feel deeply regret for causing public anxiety over our
company's negligence and lax internal control with regard to food
safety," Yu said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>The statement further said the company has retained a lawyer to
file a damages suit against the supplier of the "performance protein
powder, " which was meant for hog feed rather than for human
consumption, and will donate all the sum of money paid by the
supplier to consumer protection groups.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taisugar said it will complete recall of all its
nutritional yeast products containing the "performance protein
powder" by the noon of June 22. Consumers are welcome to call
toll-free 0800026168 for any question about relevant issues.</P>
      <P>For the past 13 years, the company had used the "performance
protein powder" for production of at least four popular Taisugar
health products, including vitamin yeast, flavored vitamin yeast and
yeast candy.</P>
      <P>The company began the recall operation Thursday after public
prosecutors in the southern city of Tainan detained a former Taisugar
executive and an importer who allegedly imported the material from
Egypt and Belgium for sale to Taisugar.</P>
      <P>To prevent recurrence of similar misdeeds, Taisugar said it will
commission a government-sanctioned third party to review all
materials or ingredients to be used for foodstuff production when
taking delivery of those products from suppliers.</P>
      <P>All of Taisugar's material suppliers and contract foodstuff
processors must be subject to unannounced spot checks by the third
party, in addition to obtaining food safety licenses from health
authorities, Taisugar said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the company said it will conduct a comprehensive review
of all of its long-term and certain specific suppliers of raw
materials to ensure food safety.</P>
      <P>The company has also launched an across-the-board investigation
to find those responsible for the negligence and mete out
disciplinary measures.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the Consumers' Foundation pushed Taisugar to
apologize and offer compensation for its failure to act in good faith
with regard to food safety regulations and consumer protection over
the past 13 years.</P>
      <P>Arguing that although no evidence indicates ingesting animal feed
causes damage to humans, the foundation said Taishugar's negligence
has destroyed the faith of consumers and should offer due
compensations to consumers. The foundation urged Taisugar to set up
a task force to handle consumer complaints about refunds or
compensation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROOM FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT IN LAW AND ORDER: PREMIER SU(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that
there is still much room for improvement in terms of the country's
law and order situation, and urged government agencies to work harder
toward achieving that goal.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while presiding at a meeting on
improving social order, the third such meeting since assuming the
post in late January.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan quoted the premier as
saying that various indicators suggest that Taiwan's law and order
situation has improved.</P>
      <P>Cheng cited a number of examples, such as crackdowns on places
selling ecstasy and illicit video game parlors, as well as the
confiscation of guns.</P>
      <P>A public survey conducted by the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission in late May showed nearly 30 percent of people
in Taiwan think the law and order situation has improved, compared
with 40 percent who said it is "about the same," and slightly more
than 10 percent who believe it has deteriorated.</P>
      <P>The premier is not yet content with the results, and believes that
all government agencies must work harder to deliver on his
promise to the people, according to Cheng. The premier recently
pledged to either improve law and order within six months or
step down.</P>
      <P>The premier instructed the Financial Supervisory Commission
and the Ministry of Finance to step up monitoring and regulation of
dummy banking accounts, as well as pre-paid cellphones.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior, the National Police Agency and the
National Communications Commission should work together to
strengthen telecommunications regulations to stem fraud,
the premier said.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that a lot of major economic criminals have
fled the country and sought refuge in China, and that he has
instructed related government agencies to seek judicial assistance
from the other side of the Taiwan Strait to extradite criminals
and bring them to justice.</P>
      <P>On cracking down on illegal gambling activity and prostitution,
the premier has asked the ministry of Economic Affairs and
Ministry of Justice to rigorously carry out a policy of cutting
off the water and electricity supply to these businesses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS ON PROTECTION OF 'TAISHANG'(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
put aside their political disputes and negotiate measures to protect 
the rights and personal safety of Taiwanese businesspeople operating
in China, known locally as "Taishang," the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with CNA, a SEF official said that
although "Taishang" have tried to keep a low profile and behave
prudently in China, many of them have often fallen victim to
criminal activities and accidents.</P>
      <P>As China's economy is transforming rapidly, the gap between
the rich and the poor is also widening quickly, the official said,
adding that Taiwanese businesspeople, with their brilliant economic
success, have become the envy of the Chinese and thus the target of
criminal rings there.</P>
      <P>According to statistics, the number of "Taishang" has
now surpassed 600,000, with the number of cases involving threats to
their personal security increasing from 67 in 2001 to 133 in 2005.</P>
      <P>Among various cities in China, Dongkuan, in Guangdong province,
saw the largest number of cases involving the personal security of
Taiwanese businesspeople in recent years, accounting for 27 percent
of cases, followed by Shenzhen, also in Guangdong province, with 13
percent.</P>
      <P>According to the official, there are over 80,000 Taiwan
businesspeople living in Dongkuan, a rural village turned
industrialized city thanks to Taiwanese investment.</P>
      <P>However, China-based Taiwanese will never understand that
their contribution has at the same time led to murder cases again and
again, the official added.</P>
      <P>The SEF official urged governments on both sides to engage in
talks and to ink an agreement as soon as possible to seek a solution
to this problem.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yueh, an associate professor in China studies at Tamkang
University, urged China-based Taiwanese to make a prudent evaluations
before investing in China -- and to think how they might save their
lives so they can spend the money they've earned.</P>
      <P>A China-based Taiwanese businessman recommended that his
compatriots abide by China's laws, keep a low profile and avoid
talking about politics while investing in China in order to prevent
any trouble.</P>

promise Sunday, claiming that if elected, he will work to win for the
city the right to host the 2020 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Hsieh had secured the right for Kaohisung to host the 2009 World
Games when he was mayor of the southern port city.</P>
      <P>During a hiking activity in suburban Taipei, Hsieh claimed that
Taiwan has "too much politics and too few sports, " which he said are
"very apolitical."</P>
      <P>By launching an Olympic bid for Taipei, the capital city of
Taiwan, he said, the people of Taiwan will have a common goal that
will keep them from political bickering and ethnic division.</P>
      <P>The host city of the 2020 Olympics will be selected in 2013.
Hsieh said Taipei should not be absent from the bidding. The next

will use the Kaohisung rapid transit scandal to attack him during the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT MAY RESPOND TO RECALL MOTION TO THE PEOPLE: DPP WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian may report
directly to the people in response to the opposition's motion to
recall him, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, the head of the DPP legislative caucus, said Chen
may report directly to the people via his online newsletter rather
than providing a written statement as requested by the opposition in
response to opposition lawmakers' recent initiation of a recall
motion against him over the insider trading allegations against his
son-in-law.</P>
      <P>When and how the president will report to the people in this
regard, however, has yet to be decided, Ker said.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is set to review a motion initiated by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party to recall Chen Monday, and the alliance has requested Chen to
present a written statement to the legislature to respond to the
charges made against him before the review process starts.</P>
      <P>Ker rejected the "pan-blue alliance" request that the media be
allowed to cover the debates in the review process for live
broadcast, saying there is no such precedent in the history of
Taiwan's legislature.</P>
      <P>Ker also dismissed a "pan-blue alliance" plan to hold a
"testimony-style public hearing" at the Legislative Yuan where
"legislators from the two rival sides could debate the recall
motion," ridiculing the plan as pointless as "none of the legislators
is the president."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh Yi-ching, chief secretary of the DPP legislative
caucus, said that the legislature must review the recall motion in
accordance with the law and that "no gimmicks should be allowed
during the process to turn it into a media event."</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun, another DPP legislative caucus whip, said that
holding a testimony-style public hearing in the Legislative Yuan
would be illegal, adding that the DPP caucus will not "dance to the
tune of others."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA BIGGEST BENEFICIARY OF CROSS-STRAIT AVIATION DEAL: ANALYSTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is the biggest beneficiary of the
latest aviation deal between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
policy planners and academics said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>They were referring to a cross-strait agreement announced
Wednesday on a framework for charter flights for holidays and special
cases, including emergency medical and humanitarian missions and
shipments of machinery and parts for Taiwan-funded companies in
China.</P>
      <P>The agreement marks rare progress in the often-rocky cross-strait
relations, and it surprised many pundits as it came at a time when
Taiwan's political situation has been volatile, with an
opposition-initiated motion proceeding in the legislature to recall
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers invariably scoffed at the surprise
agreement, describing it as a "minor event" used by the president in
an attempt to draw attention away from corruption allegations
implicating his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the opposition's disparagement, a source familiar
with cross-strait policy planning said they were off the mark. As far
as cross-strait relations are concerned, the official said, China
holds the key in setting the tone for nearly every major issue, with
the latest charter flight deal being no exception.</P>
      <P>To Beijing, the official said, the just-concluded charter flight
deal was easy to achieve, adding that it has generated enormous
advantages in China's favor, particularly in courting the hearts and
minds of the Taiwan people and projecting a peacemaker image in the
international community.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the two sides reached consensus on the
four-point aviation deal in late May after several rounds of talks in
Macau between the Taipei Airlines Association and the Beijing-based
Civil Aviation Association (CAA) , both of which were authorized by
their respective governments to reach a deal.</P>
      <P>At first, Taiwan intended to unveil the deal at a Dragon Boat
Festival gathering in Taipei of Taiwan businesspeople operating in
China, known locally as "Taishang, " but CAA officials rejected the
idea, saying that they had yet to ask the top officials. On June 13,
they finally agreed that the deal could be announced.</P>
      <P>The "odd" timing made some observers believe that China might
have realized that it should keep cross-strait issues separate from
Taiwan's political situation if it doesn't want to miss opportunities
to improve relations.</P>
      <P>But the official said that Beijing should have made a careful
political calculation in choosing the timing since "economics serving
politics" is the norm in China.</P>
      <P>Given the high threshold for a presidential recall motion to be
passed under Taiwan's constitutional system, the official said,
Beijing might believe that the opposition's campaign is doomed to
fail.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese leadership probably believes that if they hold out
an olive branch at this turbulent moment, they will most likely be
able to win the hearts of the Taiwan people, or at least soften
pro-independence activists' aversion or hostility to China, " the
official said, citing as proof the fact that the legislative caucus
of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union reacted relatively
mildly to the charter flight deal.</P>
      <P>Those in diplomatic circles also lauded China's wisdom for its
"extraordinary" timing in announcing the charter flight agreement.
While international news media have been giving prominent coverage to
Taiwan's political chaos, they have said Beijing could earn credit
for its "willingness to contribute to cross-strait peace or concern
for the Taiwan people's benefit" by putting aside its traditional
distaste for taking any steps that could be seen as helping President
Chen because it often reviles him as a radical proponent of Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Moreover, local academics said the aviation deal serves China's
long-term strategic interests of eventually uniting the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait. Once the door is open, they claimed, it could be
an "irreversible trend" toward eventual unification.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait charter flight issues, mainland policy planners
said Taiwan would best benefit from the opening of regular cargo
flight services, given the large number of Taiwan-funded companies in
China. However, China would not budge an inch on this regard because
it can hardly compete with Taiwan in this market with its far smaller
air cargo fleet.</P>
      <P>As to the opening of charter passenger flights on a regular basis
or on weekends as strongly lobbied by China, policy-making officials
said Taiwanese carriers have little interest unless the two sides
come to terms on allowing ordinary Chinese residents to sightsee in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For years, Taiwan people have made more than 3 million visits to
China annually while the annual number of visits to Taiwan by
mainland Chinese have fallen short of 200,000. Until this huge
imbalance is addressed, the officials said, Taiwanese carriers will
not be able to profit from regular cross-strait charter passenger
flight services.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fourteen university professors launched a
signature-collecting campaign Sunday aimed at urging scandal-ridden
President Chen Shui-bian to gracefully step down so as to avoid huge
costs to society.</P>
      <P>Professors Lee Ming and Kan Yi-hua of National Chengchi
University called their signature drive the "Intellectuals' Campaign
Urging Chen Shui-bian to Step Down."</P>
      <P>As the president is no longer trusted by the people, he should
demonstrate grace and step down, they said, adding that the
initiators of the campaign will visit presidential advisers and
ruling and opposition parties to express academia's views.</P>
      <P>"The campaign is not aimed at protesting against the president.
Rather, it aims to urge the president to make a wise decision because
he should take the moral and political high ground for the first
family's suspected involvement in different sorts of irregularities,
" Lee said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that "Taiwan is facing political deadlock and cannot
handle another confrontation resulting from the 'pan-blue' and
'pan-green' standoff."</P>
      <P>"President Chen should by no means try to worsen the standoff and
cause the country's political and economic engine to rev in neutral,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted Lin Tse-hsu, a famous official during the Ching
dynasty, to voice his and the other co-sponsors' feelings when they
decided to kick off the campaign: "Were it to benefit the country, I
would not care even about my life, much less would I try to evade my
responsibility for the sake of personal fortune."</P>
      <P>Kan said the campaign will try to solicit the support of college
and middle and elementary school teachers in a bid to show that the
country's intellectuals are expecting the president to "be
responsible to the people by setting an example of gracefully
stepping down."</P>
      <P>To date, the president has not been able to give the people a
reasonable explanation of his suspected abuses of constitutional
powers, people's anger at high-level corruption scandals, and
suspected involvement of his senior aides and son-in-law in insider
trading and other criminal charges, Kan said.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Kan added, the president has failed to engage in any
soul searching over the spate of corruption and abuse-of-power
charges.</P>
      <P>"Since his integrity is being severely challenged and his
political morality strongly suspected, he has confused Taiwan's value
system and blocked Taiwan's chances to upgrade itself," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Professor Sui Tu-ching of National Chengchi University said he
joined the campaign knowing that he could be "given a political tag."
Still, he said, "I have to point out that the president's attempts to
distance himself and his wife from his senior aides and son-in-law
have blurred the subject of the ethics debate."</P>
      <P>"No one is demanding that the president take legal responsibility
for the suspected involvement of his senior aides and close family
members in a string of corruption scandals. But as president, he must
take political responsibility," Sui said.</P>
      <P>Other professors launching the campaign include Cheng Chung-chien
of National Chengchi University, Chih Kai-chung of National Tsinghua
University and Chu Ko-yi of National Chung Hsing University.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHAIRMAN ENDORSES KMT'S AD TO EXPLAIN REASONS BEHIND RECALL MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ran an
advertisement endorsed by the party's chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, in
print media Sunday, explaining its reasons behind its decision to
launch a recall motion against President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>While speaking to reporters after attending a commencement
ceremony at Shih Chien University, Ma stressed that the KMT must
stand up and speak for the people at this critical time when the
nation's leader has drifted away from the core values of "integrity,
honesty and clean government."</P>
      <P>Ma said that it is extremely important that prosecutors and
investigators maintain their independence and neutrality during their
investigation into corruption scandals surrounding Chen's close aids
and family members.</P>
      <P>Ma, who served as minister of justice 10 years ago in the
previous KMT government, called on his old colleagues to stick to
that stance, "because judicial dignity and fairness must take
precedence of private partisan gain."</P>
      <P>"The judicial system must firmly resist political pressure,
fairly handle every case and get to bottom of every corruption
scandal, " he argued, insisting that the KMT must not overlook
mistakes made by high-level government officials and the first family
and that this is the reason why the party wants to initiate the
presidential recall motion at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"At this historic juncture, the KMT wants to recall Chen to help
build a clean, honest, healthy and dignified life for younger
generations, " Ma said, adding that "the KMT would let the people
down if it failed to do so."</P>
      <P>"If the KMT were to hold back from the presidential recall
initiative out of fear of mob violence of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , how would we be able to teach our children
to be straight, " Ma questioned, pointing out that "the answer is
right on the minds of Taiwan parents."</P>
      <P>Ma said that he was encouraging and demonstrating his respect to
his former co-workers in the judicial sector.</P>
      <P>"As long as prosecutors and investigators stand on the right side
of justice, the people will throw their support behind them, our
children will appreciate them, and they will be remembered in
history," he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT head also urged conscionable DPP lawmakers to back the
presidential recall motion for Taiwan's younger generations, because
"it is a major issue in Taiwan's constitutional history."</P>
      <P>"The move to recall Chen is not aimed at provoking confrontation
between the 'pan-blue alliance' and the 'pan-green camp, and it is by
no means a political strife, " he reiterated.</P>
      <P>"It is a choice between clean government and corruption, and a
choice between the truth and lies," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LEADS S. KOREA IN GDP BY PURCHASING POWER: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's per capita gross domestic product
(GDP) surpassed South Korea's by over US$6,000 in 2003 based on
purchasing power parity (PPP) adjustments, Taiwan's top economic
planner said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , said Taiwan's PPP-adjusted per capita GDP for
2003 was US$24,558, surpassing South Korea's US$17,900, indicating
that Taiwanese people enjoyed a higher living standard than South
Koreans.</P>
      <P>Noting that major international economic institutions use PPP to
measure a country's per capita GDP, Hu said the measure, which
excludes inflation and currency fluctuation rates, more accurately
gauges a country's per capita national income and general living
standards.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by the Swiss International Institute
of Management and Development, Hu said Taiwan's PPP-adjusted per
capita GDP reached US$24,676 in 2004, ahead of South Korea's
US$18,686.</P>
      <P>Due to the "time lag" in compiling PPP-adjusted measures, no data
is available to make a comparison for the year 2005, he said.</P>
      <P>Hu acknowledged that South Korea is a respectable competitor
judging from its robust economic development and brilliant trade
performance. However, he said he disagrees with those academics who
complain that Taiwan has lagged behind South Korea in economic growth
in the last two years.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, head of the National Central University's Taiwan
Economic Development Research Center, said recently that "South Korea
has emerged as the second largest source of Taiwan's trade deficit
after Japan. I'm not surprised by its overtaking Taiwan in terms of
per capita GDP in 2005. With South Korea's towering ambition, I think
that country is likely to surpass Taiwan even in terms of
PPP-adjusted per capita GDP in the near future."</P>
      <P>Chu also said that Taiwan's government should not become
complacent by accepting moderate growth and should map out a
forward-looking economic development policy to accelerate growth.</P>
      <P>According to recent statistics issued by the Bank of Korea, South
Korea's economic growth rate was estimated at 4 percent for 2005,
slightly lower than the 4.7 percent registered in 2004. Nevertheless,
its per capita GDP reached US$16,291, marking an impressive 14.8
percent year-on-year increase.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's per capita GDP amounted to US$15,271 for
2005, up 7 percent from the previous year's level. By comparison,
Taiwan went from leading South Korea by US$100 in per capita GDP in
2004 to trailing it by US$1,020 in 2005.</P>
      <P>Hu attributed this mainly to the greater appreciation of the
Korean won against the U.S. dollar, which rose 11.8 percent against
the greenback while the new Taiwan dollar only rose 3.9 percent
during the same period.</P>
      <P>Hu said currency exchange rate changes have nothing to do with a
country's competitiveness and only reflect international capital
movements during a specific period. Therefore, he said, it might be
too early to conclude that Taiwan has fallen behind South Korea.</P>
      <P>"It is unfair to say that the government has failed in efforts to
rev up Taiwan's economy simply because one set of figures show South
Korea surpassing Taiwan in per capita GDP for one single year, " Hu
argued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT 'LEAST QUALIFIED' TO LAUNCH RECALL MOTION: TSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) accused
the Kuomintang (KMT) Sunday of instigating political strife by
launching a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian at the
Legislative Yuan, warning the KMT "not to go too far."</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus whip Ho Min-hao made the comments while
answering questions from reporters in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ho termed the KMT "the most corrupt political party" and claimed
that KMT Chairman Ma Jing-jeou is the "least qualified" to launch a
presidential recall motion on the grounds that "the KMT has yet to
return its ill-gotten assets to the people."</P>
      <P>"The KMT should not go overboard with the recall motion and
instead should shift its attention to issues related to the people's
welfare," he suggested.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the TSU will go on promoting an endorsement
campaign to force the KMT to return its property to the people, Ho
said that his party hopes to collect over 82,000 signatures -- the
legal threshold to call a referendum -- before an ongoing extra
legislative session ends June 27.</P>
      <P>"Even if the TSU is unable to collect the required number of
signatures by that date, the party will continue with the campaign to
demand that the KMT return its ill-gotten assets," he said.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People
First Party have also initiated a national endorsement campaign to
display public backing for their presidential recall motion at the
Legislative Yuan, which requires the support of two-thirds of all the
legislators in a vote in order to be put to a referendum.</P>
      <P>The motion has no chance of passing without significant support
from "pan-green" lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the TSU as the "pan-blue alliance" only holds 114 seats in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP MUST STEP OUT OF SCANDALS CLOUD TO WIN MUNICIPALITY ELECTIONSBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has nominated two
strong candidates for the year-end mayoral elections in Taipei and
Kaohsiung. But it must be able to portrait itself as a party of clean
politics and competent leadership in order to beat opposition party
rivals that are ready to focus the campaign debate on a string of
corruption scandals in which President Chen Shui-bian's senior aides
and close family members are being investigated for suspected
involvement.</P>
      <P>Analysts said Sunday that Frank Hsieh and Chen Chu, the DPP's
mayoral candidates for Taipei and Kaohsiung, respectively, have no
reason to feel upbeat about their prospects in the December elections
as the DPP's popularity has plunged to a new low following the
detention of Chao Chien-ming, son-in-law of the president, and Chen
Che-nan, his former senior aide at the Presidential Office, on
suspicions of insider trading, fraud and other charges.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) have claimed that they will keep hounding
former premier and Kaohsiung mayor Frank Hsieh for his suspected role
in the Kaohisung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) scandal since three of
the city government's department chiefs have been indicted in
connection with the scandal.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, former chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs, is
also suspected of making policy mistakes leading to the mismanagement
of Thai workers whose riot in August last year brought to light a
series of irregularities involving KRTC management and city
government. Even Hsieh himself has advised Chen Chu not to run in
Kaohsiung for that reason.</P>
      <P>As Chen Che-nan, who has been in detention for over two months,
and Chao Chien-ming and his family members are being investigated on
a host of corruption charges, calls for the president to step down
have grown louder each day and an opposition initiated motion for his
recall is waiting to be handled at the Legislative Yuan, the nation's
highest law-making body.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that in addition to a joint effort by the
Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the DPP to clear people's
doubts about the high-level corruption scandals, the party needs also
to tell the public about the government's achievements over the past
six years in order to win back the swing votes -- from voters that do
not have a strong attachment to a political party but whose ballots
usually decide which side wins in Taiwan elections.</P>
      <P>In this regard, Chen Chu can boast of the DPP's achievement made
by Hsieh and his successor, Acting Mayor Yeh Chu-lan, and Hsieh can
cite the impressive performance of Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP
mayor of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Another advantage of the two DPP candidates is that their
campaign pledges will win the endorsement of the Executive Yuan and
the DPP, who have the power and resources to boost their respective
campaigns.</P>
      <P>For example, the opening of the Hsueshan Tunnel on the
Taipei-Ilan freeway in mid-June and the scheduled launch in late
October of the high-speed railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung can be
seen as pluses in the DPP government's administrative record.</P>
      <P>A third possible advantage for Hsieh would be a decision by PFP
Chairman James Soong to run for Taipei mayor while KMT nominee Hau
Lung-bin refused to budge, creating a three-way race with the
"pan-blue" vote being split and the "pan-green camp's" chances
therefore being boosted. A similar situation occurred in the 1994
Taipei mayoral elections, when DPP's Chen Shui-bian beat KMT's Huang
Ta-chou and New Party's Jaw Shau-kong.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that if Soong, who has yet to announce his bid,
were to win 10 percent of the vote, Hsieh's chances of beating Hau
would "dramatically increase." However, KMT strategists claimed that
"pan-blue supporters" in Taiwan's capital would not be so forgetful
as to repeat the 1994 debacle.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  18  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance"
organized a demonstration Sunday in Changhua City in central Taiwan,
calling for President Chen Shui-bian to step down amid the many
corruption scandals in which his family members and close aides are
alleged to have been involved.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong, along with Taichung Mayor Jason Hu,
Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng and Changhua County
Magistrate Cho Po-yuan, led a crowd of about 10,000 people to ask for
Chen's resignation in a downtown market.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the "pan-blue" efforts to get Chen to step down are
aimed at building a dignified life for Taiwan's younger generations,
arguing that a head of state that has lost the people's respect and
trust should voluntarily resign.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the Taiwan people will no longer tolerate the
corrupt Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government and that the
PFP will seek to topple the Cabinet should the "pan-blue alliance's"
recall motion fail to pass during the current extra legislative
session which is scheduled to end June 30.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" demonstration in Changhua City will be followed by
two similar rallies -- one in northern Taiwan and one in southern
Taiwan -- in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>On the sidelines of the Changhua demonstration, the two parties
set up a service center to collect signatures in a nationwide
campaign as a means of displaying their support for the "pan-blue"
lawmakers' presidential recall motion at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT's Kaohsiung county branch has collected more
than 27,000 signatures over the past two days. KMT officials urged
the public to join the campaign to demonstrate their anger with the
corrupt DPP government.</P>
      <P>The KMT's campaign has been endorsed by some 500,000 people
across Taiwan so far.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUNSHINE CAN BE USED TO TREAT ACUTE LIVER FAILURE: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Believe it or not, those suffering from
acute liver failure can be treated by simply watching the sun at
sunset and sunrise, an expert on Chinese medicine said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Pan Nien-chung, a former professor of naturopathy at the China
Medical University in Taichung, told a seminar on Chinese medicine in
Taipei that the sun's rays at sunrise and sunset -- with a wave
length of between 3,000 Lux and 9,000 Lux--- can stimulate the
mitochondrion in the human body to generate an energy which will
improve the function of the liver and help it to heal itself.</P>
      <P>He suggested that patients suffering from acute liver failure,
also known as fulminant liver failure, gaze at the sun's red rays for
fifteen to thirty minutes every day. Pan cited the example of a
university student who suffered from hepatic encephalopathy because
of acute liver failure. Doctors treated him with artificial light
over a one-month period and put him on a balanced diet.</P>
      <P>One month into the treatment, Pan said, the patient's liver was
restored to normal functioning levels.</P>
      <P>Dr. Hsu Chin-chuan, executive director of the non-profit Liver
Disease Prevention &amp; Treatment Research Foundation was reserved about
the theory, saying he couldn't comment on it before reading Pan's
report thoroughly.</P>
      <P>Acute liver failure is a rare but potentially fatal disease. The
mortality rate without supportive management and/or liver
transplantation is in excess of 70%.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Former Antiterror
Officials Find Industry Pays Better

Dozens of members of the Bush administration's domestic security
team, assembled after the 2001 terrorist attacks, are now collecting
bigger paychecks in different roles: working on behalf of companies
that sell domestic security products, many directly to the federal
agencies the officials once helped run. At least 90 officials at the
Department of Homeland Security or the White House Office of Homeland
Security -- including the department's former secretary, Tom Ridge; the
former deputy secretary, Adm. James M. Loy; and the former under
secretary, Asa Hutchinson -- are executives, consultants or lobbyists
for companies that collectively do billions of dollars' worth of
domestic security business. More than two-thirds of the department's
most senior executives in its first years have moved through the
revolving door. Federal law prohibits senior executive branch
officials from lobbying former government colleagues or subordinates
for at least a year after leaving public service. But by exploiting
loopholes in the law -- including one provision drawn up by department
executives to facilitate their entry into the business world -- it is
often easy for former officials to do just that.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, June 18 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty students from across America and
Taiwan will participate in a two-week intensive congressional program
that focuses on deepening each participant's knowledge of
international relations with an emphasis on U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Foundation announced Sunday that the fourth annual
student Ambassador Program will begin June 18 in Los Angeles,
Calif., and conclude June 30 in Washinton, D.C.</P>
      <P>The Ambassador Program provides a rare opportunity to meet with
U.S. congressmen and senators to discuss U.S. policies toward Taiwan,
according to Terri Giles, executive director of the Formosa
Foundation.</P>
      <P>"This is the only program of its kind in the country. Our focus
on devising strategies in support of Taiwan and speaking directly to
members of Congress gives our students a direct understanding of the
challenges that we face," Giles said.</P>
      <P>Beginning June 18, the participants will undergo training in Los
Angeles with a series of workshops, seminars, and hands-on training
in the art of advocacy. Each session is designed to enhance the
students' knowledge of current U.S.-Taiwan policy and sharpen their
communication and networking skills.</P>
      <P>On June 23rd, the participants travel to the U.S. capital to meet
directly with members of Congress to discuss several issues of
concern to Taiwan, including the island's bid to join the WHO,
Washington's one-China policy, high-level diplomatic visits between
the two countries, and a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Foundation's Ambassador Program was first launched in
2003 with the goal of broadening the involvement of future leaders in
understanding and influencing U.S.foreign policy. Over the past three
years, 70 students have taken part in the program and have held more
than 400 meetings with members of Congress and their staff.</P>
      <P>Based in Los Angeles, the Formosa Foundation is a non-profit
organization dedicated to promoting greater understanding of the
relationship between Taiwan and the United States and preserving and
enhancing democracy, human rights and freedom for the people of

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO PUSH FOR NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE AGAINST CABINET IF RECALL FAILS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the opposition's move to oust President
Chen Shui-bian fails, the Kuomintang (KMT) will unite with other
parties to push for a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet, a KMT
spokeswoman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-wen made the remarks as the Legislative Yuan is set to
vote June 27 on a recall motion initiated by the opposition. The
motion requires the support of two-thirds of all legislators in order
to be put to a referendum. As the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) only holds a slim majority in
the 221-seat Legislature, the motion has no chance of success unless
a significant number of "pan-green" lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union give their support.</P>
      <P>The opposition initiated the recall motion June 12, believing
President Chen's leadership is in doubt after his son-in-law and
close associates were implicated in a series of corruption
allegations.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that a KMT think tank, a policy commission and the KMT
legislative caucus have formed a task force to study the issue of
toppling the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The main opposition party will also work with its allies, the
PFP and Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, to coordinate the move to
topple the Cabinet, she said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that the KMT is considering mobilizing 1
million people to take part in a rally in front of the Presidential
Office to call for the president to step down, Cheng said that this
is unlikely but that the party will not rule out any possibility.</P>
      <P>"The KMT is prepared to engaged in long-term efforts to oust the
president," Cheng said, adding that "the process will be moderate and
rational so as to cut social costs to the minimum."</P>
      <P>She cited the example of the Watergate scandal as an example,
saying that former U.S. President Richard Nixon only resigned in
1974, or two years after the Watergate scandal first came to light.</P>
      <P>The KMT will build up the pressure through a recall vote and a
no-confidence vote and throw its weight behind the prosecutors in
their probe into the corruption scandals, Cheng said. "We've had no
such means to bring down President Chen in one move," she stressed.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has never ceased trying to
win for Taipei the right to host the 2020 Olympic Games and will take
gradual steps to reach the goal, National Council on Physical Fitness
and Sports (NCPFS) Vice Minister Chen Yu-hsin said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated the government's determination after former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
candidate for Taipei mayor -- announced Sunday that winning for the
capital city the right to host the 2020 Olympics is one of his key
campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Hsieh proposed the Olympic bid for Taipei during
his service as premier between January 2005 and January 2006. Since
then, the NCPFS has been working to map out plans to achieve the
"ultimate goal," he noted, adding that at the current stage, efforts
are being made to seek for the right to host single-event
international sports games, as well as the Asian Games and World
Games.</P>
      <P>Taipei will host the 21st Deaflympic Games in 2009, the same year
that will see Kaohsiung host the World Games, Chen mentioned,
suggesting that these are opportunities for Taiwan to show its
ability to host major sporting events to make its case for its bid to
host the 2020 Olympics.</P>
      <P>During a hiking activity in suburban Taipei, Hsieh, who had
secured the right for Kaohsiung to host the 2009 World Games when he
was the mayor of the southern port city, reiterated his determination
to win the right for Taipei to host the Olympics.</P>
      <P>With the host city of the 2020 Olympics to be selected in 2013,
the candidate to run in the year-end Taipei mayor election said that
Taipei should not be absent from the bidding.</P>

      <P>The daughter of Lei Hsueh-ming, a retired

Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung was adopting a delaying tactic by requesting
the court to summon former Chief of the General Staff Hau Pei-tsun in
a case in which Lei has accused Hsu and President Chen Shui-bian of
slander.</P>
      <P>Lei Chien, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker, is attempting
to clear her father's name and claimed that Hsu's request has nothing
to do with the case.</P>
      <P>Also being sued is William Lai, another DPP legislator, who along
with Hsu and the president, claim that Lei and other members of the
navy's frigate procurement group took a bribe of US$20 million in
connection with the purchase of Lafayette frigates from France.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Hau should appear in court to explain why he "suddenly"
changed his mind about buying Korean Ulsan-class frigates and decided
upon the French frigates instead.</P>
      <P>Hau's deputy at the time, Hsia Tien, and Kuo Yun, a former chief
of Taiwan's military procurement mission in the United States, should
also face the court, he added.</P>
      <P>Lei Chien said Hsu had threatened to present a list of "bribe
takers" to the court when it holds a hearing on the case, but claimed
that what he put forth was a list of "irrelevant names" that he
argued should be investigated -- which Lei Chien claimed was a delay
tactic.</P>
      <P>Lei Hsueh-ming filed the lawsuit in December 2005, accusing the

(By Yang Ming-chu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent detention of President Chen
Shui-bian's son-in-law in Taiwan has caused a ripple in mainland
Chinese society, with many voices there expressing "envy" of Taiwan's
democracy, a Japanese daily reported Monday.</P>
      <P>An article carried in Monday's Sankei Shimbun said Beijing's
mouthpieces, the People's Daily News and the Xinhua News Agency, had
reported the detention of Chen's son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, on
suspicion of insider stock trading, with the aim of letting the
Chinese people know how "corrupt" Taiwan society is.</P>
      <P>However, the People's Daily and Xinhua reports had the opposite
effect. Many Chinese readers said they were "impressed" with the
"true democracy" that they saw in reading about Chao's detention and
about the recall motion initiated by opposition legislators to recall
President Chen, the Sankei Shimbun reported.</P>
      <P>Many messages about Taiwan's "enviable" democracy and China's
"true decay" appeared on Chinese chat rooms on the Internet in the
days after the reports.</P>
      <P>One Chinese citizen wrote that "in China, even the son-in-law of
a village leader would not be arrested if he were to commit the same
crime as Chao did."</P>
      <P>"None of the children of high-ranking officials have been
detained for insider trading or other kinds of corruption," he wrote.</P>
      <P>The Sankei Shimbun report also said that Beijing University had
originally planned to invite Legislator Chiu Yi from Taiwan's
opposition Kuomintang, who initially made the allegations about
Chao's insider trading, to visit the prestigious university to give a
speech to "help ignite an anti-corruption fire in China."</P>
      <P>Chinese authorities, however, later decided not to allow Chiu to
visit for fear that such a speech would have an "undesirable" impact
on Chinese society, the Sankei Shimbun reported.</P>
      <P>In response, Chiu, who continues to appear on TV talk shows in
Taiwan to make allegations against members of the first family, noted
that he doesn't think that President Chen would use his power to
deprive him of his freedom of speech.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the present Legislative Yuan is
dissolved, a new legislative election will have to be conducted under
the new electoral system, Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman
Chang Cheng-hsiung said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while fielding questions at the Home
Affairs Committee in the legislature, which is reviewing a draft
re-districting scheme submitted by the CEC.</P>
      <P>The opposition has threatened that if an initiative to recall
President Chen Shui-bian fails, it will follow with a push for a
no-confidence vote against the Cabinet in September when the new
legislative session opens.</P>
      <P>The opposition is seeking a two-pronged approach -- ousting the
president and toppling the Cabinet -- in an attempt to build up
pressure on Chen, believing his leadership is in doubt in the wake of
a series of corruption allegations against his son-in-law and close
associates.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if Chen dissolves the legislature, then the draft
re-districting scheme will no longer be needed to be approved by the
legislature and the CEC's draft scheme will then be followed, he
said.</P>
      <P>The new legislature would be the seventh legislature, he added.</P>
      <P>But Legislator Chang Hsien-yao of the opposition People First
Party said a re-election should be held after a legislature is
dissolved, and the term of the legislators begun from scratch.</P>
      <P>The time between the dissolution of a legislature and the forming
of a new one should be deemed a legislative recess, according to
additional constitutional provisions, he said.</P>
      <P> Quoting Constitutional Interpretation No. 31 by the Council of
Grand Justices, Chang Hsien-yao also argued that the new legislature
would still be counted as the sixth, instead of the seventh
legislature.</P>
      <P>Under a package of constitutional amendment that was adopted last
June, the 7th legislative election to be held in late 2007 will be
conducted under the new electoral system of "single constituency, two
votes" under a re-districting scheme and the halving of the number of
225-seat legislature to 113.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECALLING PRESIDENT `NATIONAL CONSENSUS': KMT CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou and KMT-affiliated city mayors and county magistrates
issued a pledge Monday demanding that President Chen Shui-bian
quickly step down so that a "clean Taiwan" can be built.</P>
      <P>KMT-affiliated speakers from city and county councils around
Taiwan are also slated to issue a statement June 21, supporting the
KMT-proposed nationwide endorsement campaign and a recall motion at
the Legislative Yuan to boot out Chen from the presidency to take
responsibility for a spate of corruption scandals allegedly involving
his family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that recalling Chen is "not just the KMT stance but a
national activity driven by grassroots members of society" for the
sake of Taiwan's younger generation, as over 70 percent of Taiwan's
territory and population is governed by KMT mayors and magistrates.
Ma said that he fully appreciated the support of KMT local government
chiefs for the presidential recall campaign.</P>
      <P>The national endorsement campaign to express public anger with a
corrupt government has so far collected more than 700,000 signatures,
and the number is expected to exceed 1 million, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman also accused the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) of "immorally" resorting to what he called "ethnic
confrontation" to counter the presidential recall motion, claiming
that the DPP lacks the guts to take on responsibility.</P>
      <P>Unlike a head of state that can serve as many as eight years in
two tenures, a political party must engage in sustainable growth, he
said, warning that the DPP should not bet its future on a president
he described as "suspiciously unclean."</P>
      <P>The KMT's presidential recall motion is "not aimed at instigating
political strife" but is a move in line with the principles of
accountability in politics, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Ma called on the DPP to rethink its core values of "a clean
government and loving the motherland and the people" that it broached

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LEGISLATORS TO DEMAND PRESIDENT DEFEND HIMSELF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 50 opposition legislators will go
to the Presidential Office Tuesday to demand that President Chen
Shui-bian defend himself in writing before June 20, the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus decided in a caucus meeting
Monday.</P>
      <P>The legislature referred a motion to recall the president to the
Committee of the Whole for review June 13, and the president has the
option of defending himself in an official statement within one week
prior to the review.</P>
      <P>Whether or not the president chooses to exercise this option, the
committee is scheduled to meet June 21-23 and June 26 to review the
motion before it will be put to a vote during a plenary session June
27.</P>
      <P>The KMT has decided to pass a screening agenda in a vote June 21,
lest the four-day review turn into a free-for-all.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Chan Chun-po said the party think tank has
prepared relevant information and has invited those related to
financial reforms to the review meeting, so as to highlight the
legitimacy of the recall motion.</P>
      <P>Although financial reforms is one of the goals set by the
president, the opposition has criticized them as favoring special
conglomerates.</P>
      <P>Chen has so far ignored the opposition demands that he defend
himself in writing to the opposition-dominated legislature for the
spate of corruption allegations involving members of his family and
close aides that the opposition thinks puts his leadership in doubt.</P>
      <P>The opposition claimed that if the president does not defend
himself -- which he is under no obligation to do -- "it is tantamount
to admitting his wrongdoing."</P>

    <HEADLINE>VETERAN INVENTOR HIRED BY TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE AS PROFESSOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prize-winning veteran inventor was hired
as an untenured professor by the Nan Kai Institute of Technology
(NKIT) Monday.</P>
      <P>NKIT broke the law to engage Teng Hung-chi -- a five-time gold
medalist in the International Exhibition of Inventions and a winner
of the highest citation of the Nuremberg International Invention
Exhibition, the Genius Achievement Award -- on the grounds that
winning gold medals in these two major invention expositions is
"tantamount to winning Olympic gold, " said NKIT President Wang
Kuo-ming.</P>
      <P>Wang said his institute decided to hire Teng after convening a
series of meetings and conducting several assessment meetings with
former Minister of Education Wu Jing and Hsueh Wen-chen, director of
the Creativity Center of the Industrial Technology Research
Institute, qualifying Teng to become an untenured professor even
though he lacks a doctoral degree, which is required by law.</P>
      <P>Speaking upon receiving an employment document from NKIT, Teng
said he hopes that his 25 years of experience as an inventor could
serve as some kind of inspiration to young people who are also
interested in the field.</P>
      <P>Teng, a holder of two master's degrees, said he invented his
first innovative gear at the age of 17 -- an infrared-controlled
toilet faucet -- after deciding that flushing the toilet was "too
complicated and effort-consuming."</P>
      <P>That inspired him to continue his career as an inventor for 25
years, he noted.</P>
      <P>Teng is the holder of patent rights for over 200 high technology
products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER REBUKES KMT HEAD FOR `MISUSING' RIGHT TO RECALL PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Chang Chung-hsiung rebuked Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , Monday for creating a "bad example" in
the implementation of the Constitution by pushing at the legislature
for a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The former premier made the statement at a news conference that
he called at the Legislative Yuan, in which he urged the legislature
to be "cautious" in using its right to recall the president.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed it is hard to find a similar case in other
countries to the one in Taiwan and expressed his belief that a misuse
of the right to recall the president at the legislature will cost the
country in terms of constitutional chaos and political unrest. He
also suggested that the legislators take what historic cases exist as
references.</P>
      <P>Citing a landslide vote in 1954 of the National Assembly to
recall then-Vice President Lee Chung-jen, Chang said that Lee was
unseated because of his alleged involvement in several unlawful deeds
including embezzlement and long stay in the United States.</P>
      <P>In the U.S., the impeachments of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton
during their presidential tenures were also formed based on "concrete
evidence" that showed their illegal conduct, Chang said, claiming
that it is "not possible for Ma" -- who holds a doctorate in law from
Harvard and has served as minister of justice -- not to know the
conditions for initiating an impeachment of the head of state, which
is that the person has to have been proved to have done something
illegal.</P>
      <P>The opposition initiated the motion to recall Chen in mid-May
after the judicial authorities began investigating corruption
allegations involving his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence as yet to show Chen is in any way involved
in the allegations.</P>
      <P>Urging the KMT chairman to think carefully before putting forward
the move to unseat Chen, Chang warned that the case will serve as a
bad model in the country's constitutional history.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) denied Monday that his party has proposed a quid pro quo deal
for President Chen Shui-bian to step down over the series of
corruption scandals involving his senior aides and family members.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who also serves as Taipei mayor, told
reporters that there is no truth in reports that the KMT expects Vice
President Annette Lu to pledge either in public or in private that if
Chen agrees to resign, allowing her to succeed as president, she will
grant amnesty to Chen over the scandals that might implicate him.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its ally, the People First Party, have launched a
campaign to recall the president after he ignored their demand that
he resign. Chen's senior aides and family members are engulfed in a
series of corruption scandals, with his son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming,
still in custody and likely to face charges over six corruption
cases. Chen himself has not been implicated in any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Ma also categorically denied a rumor that if the plan to recall
the president fails he will quit his post as Taipei mayor and lead
the people to continue the campaign to depose Chen by taking the
issue to the streets.</P>
      <P>Asked why he placed an advertisement in newspapers Sunday, urging
public prosecutors to be impartial in probing the corruption
scandals, Ma explained that he was speaking as a former colleague to
the prosecutors, urging them to resist political pressure from
high-level officials that might attempt to influence the
investigation.</P>
      <P>He said he placed the ad because the prosecution's progress on
those cases has not met the expectations of the public.</P>
      <P>Ma said the public prosecutors and investigators should not be
biased for or against those involved in the corruption cases, but
should be impartial.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The tiniest gold wire -- about one-fourth
the diameter of a human hair -- will be put on display June 23 in the
Museum of Gold in Taipei County's Jinguashi, in Ruifang township,
when the former gold-mining village begins its annual gold festival.</P>
      <P>Chu Hui-liang, director of the Cultural Bureau under the Taipei
county government, which sponsors the festival, said the gold wire,
on loan from an American scientific research institute, has a
diameter of 0.0125 mm, making it the thinnest thread that gold can be
made into because of its physical characteristics.</P>
      <P>With this diameter, one gram of gold could be made into a thread
more than 100 meters in length, Chub said.</P>
      <P>Another exhibit in the museum that underlines the metal's amazing
malleability is a piece of gold paper, also borrowed from the same
American research institute, with a thickness of one-thousandth of a
millimeter, or one-hundredth the thickness of a piece of copy paper.
In addition to the gold thread and paper, Chu said the museum also
boasts the world largest gold ingot, weighing 220 kg.</P>
      <P>The museum is the centerpiece of the Gold Ecological Park in
Jinguashi, which is built in the compound of a now-defunct mining
company that owned several gold mines in the mountain village. The
village fell into disrepair when the gold was exhausted, but has
enjoyed rejuvenation with the increase in tourism.</P>
      <P>The, festival, which will also feature outdoor concerts and a
sculpture exhibition, will last until Sept. 10. It is part of the
county government's efforts to turn Jinguashi into a resort.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative committee passed a draft
re-districting plan submitted by the Central Election Commission
(CEC) Monday, but expressed reservations about the re-drawing of
constituencies for Taichung city and six counties.</P>
      <P>The Home Affairs Committee started to review the re-districting
scheme Monday and legislators from across the party spectrum agreed
to the re-districting plan for eight cities and counties -- Taipei
City, Kaohsiung City, Nantou County, Yunlin County, Chiayi County,
Tainan County, Tainan City and Kaohsiung County -- as well as 10
cities and counties that will only have one lawmaker ro represent
them.</P>
      <P>But they failed to see eye to eye to Taichung city and
six counties -- Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Miaoli County, Taichung
County, Taichung City, Changhwa County and Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Legislators from across the party spectrum submitted their views
on the re-districting of the seven cities and counties and handed
them to the legislative caucuses for coordination before the draft
re-districting scheme is handed to the plenary session for
discussion.</P>
      <P>The committee also passed a resolution demanding that the CEC
form a task force as soon as possible to deal with the possible
dissolution of the present legislature.</P>
      <P>The opposition has decided to take a two-pronged approach -- a
recall of President Chen Shui-bian and a no-confidence vote against
the Cabinet -- to build up pressure on the president, believing that
his leadership is in doubt in the wake of a string of corruption
allegation against his son-in-law and his close associates.</P>
      <P>But if the president dissolves the legislature after a
no-confidence vote, then the new legislative election will have to be
conducted under the new electoral system, the CEC stated recently.</P>
      <P>The CEC also said that if the president dissolves the
legislature and the draft re-districting scheme has not been approved
by the legislature, the new election still has to follow the new
electoral system.</P>
      <P>But the legislative committee decided that the matter needs to be
further discussed, that the CEC has no right to interpret the
Constitution and that the CEC must retract its statement.</P>
      <P>According to a package of constitutional amendments passed last
June, starting from the seventh legislature to be elected in late
2007, the Legislative Yuan will have only 113 seats and will be
elected every four years. While 73 seats will be elected from
regional districts, there will be six seats for aboriginal
representatives and 34 seats for at-large and overseas expatriate
representatives.</P>
      <P>The regional seats will be distributed among special
municipalities, counties and cities according to their populations,
with each locality enjoying at least one seat and one legislator
elected from each district. The at-large and overseas expatriate
seats will be allocated to political parties that win at least 5
percent of the votes, according to the proportion of votes they
garner, with each party required to reserve at least 50 percent of
the seats for women.</P>

Souleiman Ghali grew up as a Palestinian

Islamic Society of San Francisco to have a
mosque to shape an "American Muslim identity" of
tolerance and respect for other faiths. But the 
future of his effort is now threatened by
a voice from within. His mosque was hauled into 
court this spring by a fiery imam whom it fired

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It would be a "lack of respect for the
Constitution" on the part of President Chen Shui-bian if he chooses
not to file a defense statement at the legislature in response to the
opposition's recall motion over a spate of corruption allegations
implicating his family members and close aides, the opposition People
First Party (PFP) claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping made the remarks after a newspaper
reported in recent days that Chen may opt to make a report about the
allegations on TV instead of filing a statement to defend himself at
the Legislative Yuan as the opposition "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers
require before they call a vote in the legislature to recall him.</P>
      <P>A defense statement from Chen given to the Legislative Yuan would
fall in line with the country's constitutional system and help make
it become "standard practice," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Should Chen exercise his choice to skip a report at the
Legislative Yuan, it would "reflect his intention" to shun the
legislature's surveillance and highlight his lack of respect for the
Constitution, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Hsieh accused Chen and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) of resorting to ethnic disputes as a means of maintaining power
-- something for which he claimed the Taiwan people will have to pay
a huge price.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed disappointment with the DPP for its failure to
get rid of Chen's "dragging" and questioned how the DPP government --
which likes to style itself as a "Taiwanese regime" -- could use the
"indigenous Taiwanese" ticket as an excuse to pass the buck of "being
unclean."</P>
      <P>An "indigenous regime" should not equal a corrupt government and
the DPP should conduct deep self-examination, he said.</P>
      <P>The PFP is poised to seek to topple the Cabinet should an
opposition Kuomintang-initiated presidential recall motion fail to
clear the Legislative Yuan in a June 27 vote before its current extra
session ends June 30, Hsieh said, adding that the party will stand
firm on this stance even if a new legislature were to be elected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN URGES NOT TO OVERPLAY MA ATTACK REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun urged the party's supporters Monday to remain
calm at this time of political turmoil, which he said was whipped up
by an opposition-initiated presidential recall motion.</P>
      <P>Yu issued the statement urging DPP members and supporters to
"maintain a cool head" and to refrain from sensationalist
speculation in order to avoid falling into a trap set by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP), which he said has "engaged in political strife" by
seeking to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the remarks about attacking Ma aired by
underground radio stations in southern Taiwan were merely an
emotionally charged response to pan-blue efforts to recall Chen.
Local media must not rehash the issue so as to avoid social
confrontation and violence, not to mention bloodshed, he urged.</P>
      <P>The kind-hearted Taiwanese would not allow politically motivated
assassinations in this democratic era, and DPP backers
are only disgruntled over pan-blue attempts to boot out a popularly
elected head of state, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The opposition's series of demonstrations and activities to that
end are viewed by DPP supporters as disparaging of Taiwan's
judicial system and its directly elected president, the DPP chairman
added.</P>
      <P>The pan-blue alliance has initiated a motion in the Legislative
Yuan to recall Chen before its current extra legislative session ends
June 30 on grounds that Chen should take responsibility for several
corruption scandals allegedly involving his family members and close
aides, arguing Chen has lost the respect and trust of Taiwan's
public.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) designated June 19 as "Taiwan NGO's Day of Democracy for
Myanmar" on Monday -- the same day as the birthday of renowned
Myanmar pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi as well as the first
day of operations of the new UN Human Rights Council.</P>
      <P>Taiwan NGOs have also launched a campaign to collectively call on
the military junta of Myanmar to release the Nobel Peace Prize
laureate and long-time non-violence advocate from house arrest.</P>
      <P>A news conference for the campaign was held at Taipei's Youth
Hub, with Taiwan Labor Front (TLF) executive board member Sun Yu-lien
stressing that Taiwan must not be absent from the "crucial issue of
human rights violations in the Asian region" after it succeeded in
gaining support for its democratization from many international
groups and figures.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan NGOs organizing the campaign include the TLF, the
Taiwan Association for Human Rights, the Peacetime Foundation of
Taiwan and the Awakening Foundation. So far, 45 groups have endorsed
the move to call for Aung San Suu Kyi's freedom, according to
organizers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) has
achieved some success in persuading legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), to support a motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian, a PFP legislative caucus whip said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun, general secretary of the PFP's
legislative caucus, told reporters that some 10 to 20 legislators
from the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and TSU are dissatisfied with
the president's performance and may support the motion for Chen's
recall, which was initiated by the "pan-blue alliance" of the PFP and
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Lee declined to elaborate on the identities of the PFP and TSU
lawmakers or their views toward the president.</P>
      <P>Lee disclosed that many TSU and DPP legislators have told him
privately that they were sick of the series of corruption scandals
embroiling the president's aides and family members.</P>
      <P>He said the pan-green legislative caucuses apparently have no
intention to protect the president because they offered no resistance
when the motion was introduced in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee added that some pan-green legislators even told him privately
that they support the PFP and KMT taking the issue to the streets.</P>
      <P>A two-thirds majority vote is required in the 221-member
legislature to pass the recall motion, after which the issue would be
decided in a national referendum. This means the PFP and KMT require
the support of 36 legislators from the DPP and TSU to ensure that the
motion is carried.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
confirmed Monday that if the motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian fails to pass the legislature, the PFP's legislative caucus
will push for a motion to topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>In a move to echo a similar pledge by the PFP's ally, the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang, convener of
the PFP's legislative caucus, said the PFP will do everything it can
to push for a no-confidence vote in the legislature and to dismiss
the Cabinet if the presidential recall bid fails.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to vote on the motion June 27,
yet it is expected to fail because the KMT and PFP only control the
221-seat legislature by a slight majority, falling short of the
two-thirds majority needed to carry the motion.</P>
      <P>Saying the PFP will place the nation's long-term interests above
those of the party, Lu vowed that if the motion to recall Chen fails,
the PFP will be "dead set" on toppling the Cabinet, although the
consequences of such a move may prove unfavorable to the PFP.</P>
      <P>Political analysts have warned the PFP that in the event of the
Cabinet's collapse, the president may dismiss the legislature and
trigger a re-election of all legislators -- a situation that would be
unfavorable to the PFP and other small parties under the new "single
constituency, two votes" system.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties want to recall the president because they
claim that he is incompetent in running the nation, as evidenced by a
series of corruption scandals involving his senior aides and family
members.</P>
      <P>A two-thirds majority vote would be required for the recall
motion to pass in the legislature, after which the issue would be put

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO RESPOND TO RECALL MOTION IN TELEVISED SPEECH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will deliver a
televised speech Tuesday evening in response to an
opposition-initiated motion to recall him, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen said Monday.</P>
      <P>The president's speech will come a day before the Legislative
Yuan begins debate on the recall motion, instigated by the opposition
"pan-blue" alliance of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) on grounds the president has lost the public's trust
after a spate of scandals allegedly involving his family and close
aides.</P>
      <P>Claiming the recall motion lacks legitimacy, Tan Sun Chen said
the president decided to forgo his option of issuing a written
rebuttal to the opposition-controlled legislature to defend himself
against the recall campaign.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said, the president will speak to the public on
various issues, including his stance on ongoing judicial
investigations into his son-in-law's alleged involvement in an
insider trading scandal.</P>
      <P>"Through his speech, the president hopes his dedication to the
country over the past six years and the truth [of the alleged
corruption scandals] will be understood by his fellow compatriots, "
said Tan Sun Chen.</P>
      <P>The Constitution gives the president the option of making a
written statement to the legislature, which will hold a vote June 27
on the recall motion whose passage will require a two-thirds
majority. If the motion passes -- it is seen unlikely as the
opposition only holds a slim majority -- then a nationwide
referendum would be held on whether the president should be forced to
step down over the corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen's son-in-law Chao Chien-ming was detained
May 24 on suspicions of insider trading, Tan Sun Chen said the
prosecution has been conducting a thorough investigation, although so
far there has been no evidence to suggest the president or the first
lady was involved in any illegal dealings, he added.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the move to unseat the head of state is a very
"solemn" event, Tan Sun Chen argued that the opposition's bid to
instigate a recall campaign "based on flawed reasoning" cannot be
justified, adding that the recall motion "seems nothing more than a
facade of ugly political wrangling so the opposition can make a power
grab."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MRT SYSTEM IN KAOHSIUNG FACING LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With Thai laborers working for the mass
rapid transit (MRT) system in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan starting to
leave this Thursday, the system is facing a labor shortage problem,
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said the KRTC currently employs 1,398 Thai laborers
for the MRT system, but 171 of them will start to leave Thursday
after their two-year contract expires. By the end of this year, a
total of 580 of the Thai laborers in four groups will leave Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the construction of the MRT system is now entering into the
final track-laying stage, the officials expressed
concern that labor shortage could affect the full opening of the
system scheduled for October 2007.</P>
      <P>Large contractors of the MRT system have complained about the
labor crunch, asking the KRTC to provide additional laborers or hire
more foreign laborers, but the company is reluctant to do so after a
Thai labor riot in August 2005 for alleged harsh treatment by a
management company hired by the KRTC.</P>
      <P>Affected by the riot, which led to the uncovering of a corruption
scandal in which a former close aide of President Chen Shui-bian
was implicated, the KRTC has stopped importing foreign
labor, and has instead turned to local laborers, which have proved
hard to find, and "borrowed" laborers from other sectors.</P>
      <P>KRTC officials said that one section of the two lines of the MRT
system -- from Kaohsiung International Airport to a downtown
department store -- is scheduled to open this October, adding that
finding foreign laborers to work on this section will be made a
priority.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIVE CAA METEOROLOGISTS INDICTED OVER TAA CARGO PLANE CRASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
meteorologists were indicted Tuesday over their alleged failure to
issue a bad weather warning that led to a tragic plane crash in
December 2002.</P>
      <P>The five CAA staff members were charged with dereliction of duty
and involuntary manslaughter as their failure to issue SIGMET
warnings allegedly led to the crash of a Macau-bound TransAsia
Airways (TAA) cargo plane Dec. 21, 2002, which killed two pilots.</P>
      <P>Prosecutorial investigations found that the crash was caused by
ice accumulation around the plane's major components, resulting in
the aircraft's loss of control and plunge into the seas, the
indictment said.</P>
      <P>According to the investigations, both Hong Kong and Japanese
aviation authorities had issued SIGMET warnings to aircraft in the
Taiwan Strait both before and after the TAA air tragedy.</P>
      <P>The SIGMET (significant meteorology) reports are designed to
provide information concerning en-route weather phenomena which may
affect an aircraft's safety.</P>
      <P>But the CAA failed to issue similar alerts before the ATR-72
TransAsia Airways cargo aircraft plowed into the Taiwan Strait in bad
weather, the indictment said, adding that the CAA meteorology center
didn't issue the ice accumulation warnings until after the TAA cargo
plane crash. Their negligence left pilots unaware of the need to take
timely steps.</P>
      <P>The indicted CAA staffers are Liu Chao-ming, a chief
meteorologist, and four weather analysts -- Wang Tai-yuan, Yu
Shou-liang, Tsai Chia-cheng and Hsu Ching-hui, who were on duty at
the time.</P>
      <P>The ATR-72 aircraft, powered by twin propellers, took off from
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in northern Taiwan at 1:05 a.m.
Dec. 21, 2002, but disappeared from radar screens at 1: 56 a.m. that
day.</P>

      <P>Organizers of a protest rally
against President Chen Shui-bian delivered to Taiwan's liaison office
in San Francisco Monday a statement signed by the rally participants
in which they expressed their discontent with what they called the
corruption-ridden administration headed by Chen.</P>
      <P>Around 500 Taiwanese expatriates gathered Sunday in San
Francisco's Chinatown to voice their protest against Chen, who is
faced with a recall motion at the legislature after the judicial
authorities began investigating corruption allegations involving his
son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Nearly 40 overseas Taiwanese groups organized the protest rally,
including an association of members of Taiwan's opposition People
First Party in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is
launching a campaign in the United States to try to win support for
President Chen from Taiwanese living in the country.</P>
      <P>Lee Han-wun, an executive member of the DPP's U.S. West Coast
chapter, said Monday that more and more grassroots DPP members are
asking to "fight back" as part of efforts to defend Chen and prevent
him from being unseated.</P>
      <P>"President Chen should not be the target of a recall motion
because he hasn't done anything illegal, " Lee said, adding that the
DPP is seeking to collect the signatures of 1 million people in
Taiwan and abroad to counter the opposition-initiated recall campaign
against the president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 60% THINK SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL EVIDENCE NEEDED FOR RECALL: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 60 percent of the people believe
that a recall of President Chen Shui-bian is only warranted if there
is substantive criminal evidence against him, the results of a new
poll conducted by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-feng, director of the DPP's Survey Center, unveiled the
results of the poll amid an opposition-initiated recall motion to
unseat President Chen.</P>
      <P>The opposition initiated the recall motion believing that Chen's
leadership is in doubt in the wake of a series of corruption
allegations implicating his son-in-law and close associates.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,028 valid questionnaires were collected in the June
18 poll which is said to have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1
percentage points.</P>
      <P>The poll showed that 64 percent of the respondents think that the
opposition should submit substantive criminal evidence before
initiating a recall motion, while 23 percent said they agree with
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's comment
that "a recall is a political move and doesn't require substantive
(criminal) evidence."</P>
      <P>Forty-eight percent of those polled expressed the hope that the
opposition will not proceed with its plan to push for a no-confidence
vote against the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People
First Party (PFP) has insisted that the recall motion be placed at
the top of the agenda in the extraordinary legislative session being
held June 13-30, but 71 percent of those polled said they are against
this and believe that bills related to the people's welfare should be
dealt with first.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said that if the recall motion fails,
his party will push for a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet, but
the poll showed that 71 percent of the respondents think that there
is no need to topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Chang said the figures show that Soong's views are "based on his
party's own interests and in total disregard of the people's will."</P>
      <P>On a series of "sensational revelations" by elected officials in
what they called "whistle-blowing" moves for media coverage, 44
percent of the respondents said they trust the media reports, while
36 percent said they do not.</P>
      <P>Forty-four percent said the purpose of such revelations has to do
with the ongoing political infighting, and not with monitoring the
government as claimed by those who have made the revelations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is expected to sign a free trade

    <HEADLINE>DEVELOPING KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY BEST PRESCRIPTION FOR AGING SOCIETY: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Building a knowledge-based economy is the
best way to deal with a fast-aging society like Taiwan's, a senior
official of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, CEPD chairman, was commenting on a population
estimate that by 2014, people 65 years of age and older will account
for 13 percent of Taiwan's total population, an indication that
Taiwan society is aging faster than advanced countries in Europe and
North America.</P>
      <P>The problem will be exacerbated by declining birth rates, as
those of the younger generation tend to have few if any children even
after marriage, according to a report by the CEPD's department of
manpower planning.</P>
      <P>Hu said it is time that Taiwan began preparing for an aging
population and fewer new births, both of which he said are bound to
have an impact on the economy.</P>
      <P>One way to cope with the problem is to raise the mandatory
retirement age as some Western countries have done, he said, noting
that the government is planning to follow suit.</P>
      <P>A more pertinent strategy is to focus on developing the knowledge
economy, which will better accommodate late retirement, he pointed
out, adding that for that purpose, Taiwan's high-tech industry has
already begun to invite retired Japanese engineers over to share
their experiences.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the government is also studying ways to remove
barriers for young couples to raise children. For instance, he said,
the Ministry of the Interior has mapped out some measures that will
be publicized at the planned Taiwan Economic Sustainable Development
Conference to be held in late July for feedback.</P>

      <P>"Many countries have offered free education to their younger

money well spent as free meals will make kids happy and help make the
country stronger.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GRAYING OF SOCIETY TO ACCELERATE AFTER 2019: CEPD REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The graying of Taiwan's society is expected
to accelerate after 2019 when the country's population is forecast to
begin declining, according to the latest population report released
by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The report shows that Taiwan's total fertility rate (TFR)
declined from 1.68 in 2000 to 1.12 for 2005, marking a 33-percent
drop. The TFR refers to the average number of babies born to women
during their reproductive years.</P>
      <P>As a result, the population growth rate will drop from 0.3
percent in 2006 to 0.03 percent in 2018, the report said.</P>
      <P>The working age population, meaning all those between the age of
15 and 64, will account for about 70 percent of the total population
over the next 15 years, with the percentage beginning to drop from
that time.</P>
      <P>The working population is forecast to drop to 55 percent of the
total population by 2051, the report said. As a result, the younger
generations' burden of supporting retired citizens will increase
sharply, from the current figure of 7.2 working age people having to
support one senior to 3.3 working age people having to support one
senior in 2026, with the figure dropping to 1.5 by 2051.</P>
      <P>The percentage of people over the age of 65 will increase from 10
percent in 2006 to 13 percent in 2014 and then rise sharply to 37
percent by 2051. The number of people over 75 years old will rise
from 950,000 in 2006 to 1.26 million in 2016 and 3.69 million in
2051, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The CEPD report also concluded that Taiwan's population will peak
at about 23.2 millions in 2018 and then begin declining from 2019.</P>
      <P>A CEPD official noted that it remains to be seen whether Taiwan's
fertility rate can be boosted gradually in the future, adding that
the government should draw up adequate policies to increase
incentives for women to get married and have children.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of opposition People
First Party (PFP) posed 10 questions to President Chen Shui-bian
Tuesday as he planned to report directly to the people instead of
responding to charges made against him in a presidential recall
motion in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Caucus convener Lu Hsueh-chang urged the president to answer the
10 questions rather than try to evade reporters' questions during a
televised speech scheduled for 8: 00 p.m. Tuesday, titled "Report
directly to the people."</P>
      <P>First, Lu said, "Did first lady Wu Shu-jen accept any Pacific
Sogo Department Store vouchers, or did she not?"</P>
      <P>Second, he asked, "Did your son-in-law Chao Chien-ming buy Taiwan
Development Corp. shares and peddle his influence to help some people

      <P>Fourth, Lu said, "Did your former deputy secretaries-general Chen
Che-nan and Ma Yung-cheng buy and sell stocks while they were serving

      <P>Fifth, he went on, "Was Chen Che-nan involved in the Kaohsiung

      <P>Sixth, Lu said, "Was Ma Yung-cheng involved in the appointments
of senior managers of merged banks and holding companies, or was he
not?"</P>
      <P>Seventh, he enquired, "Did you and Huang Fang-yen, vice president
of Shin Kong Hospital, interfere in selling Taiwan Fertilizer Corp.
land, causing NT$2.5 billion in losses to the nation's coffers, or
did you not?"</P>
      <P>Eighth, Lu said, "Why do you still refuse to step down after

that Wu Shu-jen met former Tuntex Corp. Chairman Chen You-hao and
received Chen's political donations?"</P>
      <P>Ninth, he asked, "Did your former chief aide-de-camp Yu Lian-fa
join others in the Presidential Office in buying and selling stocks,
or did he not?"</P>
      <P>Tenth, Lu asked, "Since your wife, secretaries, family doctor and
lawyer and accountant, in-laws and other relatives are all involved
or suspected of involvement in various scandals, can you stay in your
job without the slightest compunction? Can the people of Taiwan still
call you 'the son of Taiwan'? Or should they call you 'the shame of
Taiwan'? Do you love Taiwan, or new Taiwan dollars?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIRMAN WOULD QUIT POLITICS FOR CHEN'S OUSTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Tuesday that he would quit politics if
President Chen Shui-bian steps down.</P>
      <P>Soong made the pledge at the PFP's caucus headquarters at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Soong stressed that the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) will undoubtedly seek to
topple the Cabinet should a KMT-initiated recall vote against Chen
fail to pass the current extra legislative session.</P>
      <P>If the recall bid fails -- and it is likely to be so -- the PFP
would ask the Legislative Yuan to open another extra session to deal
with a no-confidence vote proposal, he said.</P>
      <P>"I would be willing to pull out of the December's election for
Taipei mayor, not be premier and even quit politics if Chen steps
down, " he claimed, and courted "pan-green" lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) to back the recall vote, which requires two-thirds approval in
the legislature.</P>
      <P>The pan-blue alliance controls only a slim majority in the
Legislative Yuan, and it would be difficult to pass the recall
measure in the legislature without joint efforts from its pan-green
peers.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, the PFP decided to seek a no-confidence vote
to topple the Cabinet -- led by Premier Su Tseng-chang -- only after
Su proclaimed that he would back and help solidify Chen's leadership.</P>
      <P>The PFP would risk all its legislative seats in exchange for
Chen's ouster if a new legislature were to be elected, Soong said.</P>
      <P>The PFP was not opposed to Su in the beginning, but his recent
attitude toward a "corrupt center" after Chen promised to cede power
to him late last month is proof that Su is no longer suitable to
serve as premier, he argued.</P>
      <P>He urged conscionable DPP lawmakers to join recall efforts in
order to build a "clean" and "democratic" Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The PFP chairman said that he would "conditionally" support Vice
President Annette if she were to replace Chen -- if she abided by the
Republic of China Constitution, did not promote de jure Taiwan
independence and respected the independence of the judicial system.
</P>
      <P>Speaking with reporters at the same venue later the same day,
Soong said that he "doesn't have the slightest intention" to serve in
any Cabinet posts even if Chen opted not to dissolve the Legislative
Yuan following a no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>The PFP's purpose to topple the Cabinet is aimed at electing a
new Legislative Yuan that would give the pan-blue alliance a
two-thirds majority needed to recall Chen, Soong explained, adding
that the PFP would not cling to power if a new Cabinet is formed.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the PFP would call for another extra session
at the Legislative Yuan to launch a no-confidence vote in case the
presidential recall vote fails to gain approval in the present extra
session ending June 30.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong is planning to stage a four-day sit-in with PFP
lawmakers and supporters at the Legislative Yuan starting Wednesday
to "deliver moral encouragement" to Chen and the DPP and TSU
lawmakers when the law-making body begins screening the presidential
recall vote through June 26, PFP legislative caucus whip Lu
Hsueh-chang announced later the same day.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the activity is aimed at "looking for Taiwan's
conscience" and is directed at the president who "should face up to
his mistakes." He also urged "pan-green" lawmakers to heed the
public's wishes and bravely cut their connections to a corrupt
government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN TO RESPOND TO PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS WEDNESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou will deliver a speech on television Wednesday in response
to President Chen Shui-bian's Tuesday's address, a KMT spokeswoman
said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-wen said that Ma will address the nation in a live
broadcast at 8 p.m. Ma will not take questions from the media which
could interrupt the full expression of his views, she added.</P>
      <P>Cheng's words came after President Chen's decision to 
respond to an opposition-led recall motion in a televised address at
8 p.m. Tuesday in a hall of the Presidential Office. The media is
invited to attend, but will not be allowed to pose questions.</P>
      <P>Chen's aides said recall the recall motion lacks legitimacy, the
president has chosen to give his "first report to the people" in the
past six years to respond to 10-point charges raised by the
opposition in its recall bid.</P>
      <P>Ma, for his part, will also elaborate on reasons for unseating
Chen and make a major announcement, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>She questioned the president's "refusal to give a written
rebuttal to the legislature," arguing it was because Chen is unable
to answer all corruption allegations surrounding his son-in-law and
close associates.</P>
      <P>She said the KMT will harbor no illusions about President Chen's
address, expecting him only to describe the recall bid as political
infighting and to try to shift focus away from a series of scandals.</P>
      <P>Cheng urged members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to
seriously consider "drawing a clear line" with the scandal-ridden
president, whom Cheng said is "incapable of defending himself" and
likely to become a liability to the party.</P>
      <P>The Constitution gives the president the option of submitting a
written statement to the legislature in advance of a review of the 
recall motion by the legislature's Committee of the Whole June 21
before a vote held June 27, which requires two-thirds majority to
pass.</P>
      <P>If the motion succeeds -- viewed as highly unlikely since the
opposition holds only a slight majority -- then a nationwide
referendum would be held on whether the president should be forced to
step down over the corruption allegations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A passion for recalling President Chen
Shui-bian seems to have extended from Taiwan proper to its outlying
island, when a Kinmen county councilman tore down the president's
photo in the council's building Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a meeting to interrogate Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng
regarding county affairs, the Kinmen county councilman Tsai Shui-you
strongly criticized members of the first family and Chen's close
aides for alleged involvement in a string of corruption scandals, as
well as President Chen's "long-term neglect" of Kinmen affairs.</P>
      <P>In an expression of fury, the independent councilman Tsai tore
Chen's photo down from the wall with the help of councilman Hung
Yun-tien, also without political affiliation. They then gave a
"thumbs down" gesture to show the public's opinion in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>As there were no council members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party present at the Kinmen County Council, the act of
tearing down Chen's photo did not provoke confrontation as it did
when a similar gesture occurred in the Taipei City Council.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Chen failed to honor his promises to Kinmen's
people while campaigning in the county in 2000, Tsai said President
Chen was now caught up in several corruption scandals implicating his
son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>"Chen should step down over the current political upheaval and
his incompetence," Tsai stressed.</P>
      <P>Spurred on by reports of alleged corruption scandals involving
the first family and Chen's incompetence, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" has made a motion in the legislature to recall President
Chen, and is soliciting public support for the campaign.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged the people of Kinmen not to count on Chen's word, and
that the island should "go its own way" to boost its own economy.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Lee said he respected the "public's opinions" in
Kinmen, while the Kinmen County Council noted that tearing down
President Chen's photo was only a personal act carried out by two
councilmen and not a result of the council's decision, and that the
photo will be returned to its proper place within a few days.</P>

      <P>A junior high school in Miaoli, central
Taiwan was ordered Tuesday by a court to pay a student NT$660,181
(US$20,253) in compensation for administering corporal punishment
that put the student in the hospital for 16 days.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the judgment, the Humanistic Education Foundation,

      <P>According to the Humanistic Education Foundation, it took the
student's family about 19 months to win the case.</P>
      <P>The foundation added, however, that no compensation is enough to
heal the psychological wounds that the student suffered in addition
to the physical injuries inflicted upon him.</P>
      <P>The student was admitted to hospital for 16 days to treat the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou must be held accountable for any mob violence that may
break out June 27 when the Legislative Yuan holds a vote to recall
President Chen Shui-bian, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang made the remarks at a news
conference at the party's headquarters.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the DPP's head office received information
suggesting that "some elements" plan to infiltrate the crowd of
"pan-blue" supporters gathering outside the Legislative Yuan June 27,
and if the opposition-led presidential recall bid fails to pass the
legislature that day, these elements intend to incite riots, possibly
using molotov cocktails.</P>
      <P>While urging Taipei city law enforcement authorities to be fully
prepared for any given scenario, Tsai claimed that Ma must be held
fully responsible in case of violent contingencies.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged the KMT and its "pan-blue" alliance partner, the
People First Party (PFP) , to stop making politically motivated
attacks and to focus instead on quality of life issues. The pan-blue
efforts to recall Chen will turn out to be in vain and its plan to
topple the Cabinet can only fail, he predicted.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" alliance has organized a series of demonstrations
and activities in recent weeks to demand Chen's resignation over a
spate of corruption allegations involving his family and close aides,
fueling tensions between the "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green

      <P>The Yilan County Farmers' Association
(YCFA) set up Tuesday a trade association to promote the county's
organic agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>The Organic Agriculture Production and Trade Promotion</P>
      <P> Association has 30 farmers as its members for the time being but</P>
      <P> is sure to increase, a YCFA official said. </P>
      <P>Yilan county, located in the Lanyang Plain and surrounded by
mountains, has become known as the "garden of Taipei" since a freeway
linking it with Taipei opened June 17, the anonymous YCFA official

local farmers since the freeway has connected the once-remote county
with the Taipei metropolis.</P>
      <P>The eastern county's efforts to promote organic food have

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's logic that he
should not be implicated by his son-in-law's suspected criminal
offenses simply won't wash, said James Soong, chairman of the
opposition People First Party (PFP), Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Soong, who says he is "dead set against" continuing to have a
"corruption-tainted" Chen as president of the Republic of China,
asked, "Where does Chao Chien-ming's influence come from?"</P>
      <P>Chao, Chen's son-in-law, is in detention on suspicions of
influence peddling and involvement in a high-profile insider trading
case. The prosecution is probing whether he had accepted bribes to
secure government jobs for friends.</P>
      <P>Had Chao not been "empowered" by the influence of the Chen
Shui-bian regime, Chao would not have been suspected of involvement
in a complicated string of corruption scandals, Soong said.</P>
      <P>Chao's father, mother, brother and brother's wife have all been
investigated on suspicion of buying Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC)
shares based on insider information the corporation would be bailed
out by a huge syndicated loan. Chao Yu-chu, Chao's father, is also
suspected of embezzling NT$10 million belonging to the Taiwan Table
Tennis Association.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chen's senior aide, former deputy secretary-general
Chen Che-nan, has been indicted on charges of fraud and for
involvement in the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) scandal.
First lady Wu Shu-jen is speculated to have accepted business favors
and gift vouchers from a department store.</P>
      <P>In spite of all these suspicions, plus the controversy over the
March 19, 2004 shooting incident, the president has not shown any
remorse, Soong argued.</P>
      <P>He claimed that if Taiwan's politicians continue calculating only
their personal interests, Taiwan will be hijacked. He is adamant
about "bringing down such a corrupt regime, " simply because he wants
to be able to "face history," he added.</P>
      <P>As to why he is pushing for a no-confidence vote against Premier
Su Tseng-chang in case the legislature's presidential recall motion
fails, Soong said the move's sole aim is to recall President Chen
through a new legislature that would be elected after the Cabinet has
been toppled.</P>
      <P>With its slim majority in the current legislature, the "pan-blue
alliance" of the PFP and Kuomintang (KMT) can easily pass a
no-confidence vote against Su and is likely to win more than
two-thirds of legislative seats -- sufficient to push for another
presidential recall motion.</P>
      <P>Soong claimed he wouldn't mind if his PFP wins "not a single
seat" in the envisioned new legislature, as long as the legislative
election is held according to law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday he is confident that a presidential
recall motion introduced by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its
ally, the People First Party (PFP), will not succeed.</P>
      <P>Presiding over a changeover ceremony at the DPP's Taipei County
office, Yu said his confidence is supported by the results of a DPP
poll showing 71 percent of respondents are opposed to recalling
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The DPP poll's findings are contradicted by other poll results.
The China Times released results Monday showing that 53 percent of
respondents think Chen is no longer fit to serve as president, with
42 percent supporting the motion for his recall and another 40
percent opposing the move.</P>
      <P>Yu also opined that a subsequent motion by the KMT and PFP to
topple the Cabinet through a no-confidence vote would fail as well,
because the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and PFP remains divided on
the issue.</P>
      <P>Citing examples, he said KMT lawmakers, including Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Legislator Hsu Shu-po, do not support
the motion to topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman urged his KMT counterpart Ma Ying-jeou to "halt
the horse at the edge of the cliff" for the sake of Taiwan's
political stability.</P>
      <P>Noting the poll results also show Ma's popularity rating plunged
13 percent after he endorsed the motion for a presidential recall, Yu
said this indicates Ma should reconsider his decision.</P>
      <P>The legislature is scheduled to vote on the recall motion June
27. The KMT and PFP, which hold a slight majority in the 221-seat
legislature, will need the support of 36 legislators from the DPP and
its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, to ensure the motion's
passage, after which the issue would be put to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and the PFP have vowed that if the recall motion
fails, they will push for a no-confidence vote in the legislature to
topple the Cabinet. DPP leaders have warned that if the Cabinet
should collapse, they will ask the president to dismiss the
legislature, forcing new elections to be held.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Television System (CTS) will not be
a propaganda machine for any political party, CTS said in a statement
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The statement was released apparently in response to news reports
quoting former CTS President Chiang Hsia as saying that CTS has been
"tinted blue" under the leadership of new CTS President Li Yuan,
meaning that the TV company is politically tilted toward the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party.</P>
      <P>Chiang is a high-profile supporter of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP). During her presidency from 2004 to 2006, CTS
was widely criticized as a publicity machine of the DPP.</P>
      <P>The CTS statement noted that CTS joined the Taiwan Public

    <HEADLINE>CDC WARNS OF POTENTIAL DENGUE FEVER OUTBREAK IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An outbreak of dengue fever is likely to
occur in southern Taiwan, where the dengue-carrying mosquito has
multiplied following the recent heavy rain, the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The results of a CDC vector survey show that the larval
infestation density of the aedes aegypti mosquito has been rising
rapidly in Chiayi County, Tainan County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung
County, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, Penghu County and Taitung
County after days of torrential downpours, with Kaohsiung County,
Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County and Penghu County registering the
highest levels of increase.</P>
      <P>While only 7.2 percent of the villages and boroughs surveyed
registered a high risk level of a potential outbreak according to
their Breteau indexes -- the total number of water containers having
larvae or pupae of aedes aegypti per 100 houses -- in the first week
of June, the ratio climbed to 10.4 percent in the second week and
further to 25.9 percent in the third week.</P>
      <P>The figures compare with 4.8 percent, 5.8 percent and 14.4
percent recorded in the same periods of last year, CDC officials
said.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi noted that 30 dengue
fever cases have been reported in Taiwan this year, two of which were
indigenous cases and 28 of which were contracted overseas.</P>
      <P>The overseas cases include 11 from Vietnam, nine from Indonesia,
four from Thailand, two from Malaysia, one from the Philippines and
one from Madagascar, and 17, or 60 percent, of these cases were
discovered through quarantine inspection at airports, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said half of the overseas cases involved Southeast Asian
nationals married to Taiwanese citizens or children of such
marriages.</P>
      <P>He urged people to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in light
colors and to use anti-mosquito products if they are planning to
visit Southeast Asia during the summer vacation.</P>
      <P>They should seek medical treatment immediately and disclose their
travel history should they develop dengue fever-like symptoms such as
high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, severe joint pains,
muscle aches, general weakness, nausea, vomiting and rash after
returning from their trips, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Also, the public should clean water containers inside and outside
their homes to prevent infestations of mosquitoes, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Reconstruction, Army
Cancels Contract for Iraqi Prison

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it had canceled
a US$99.1 million contract wi th Parsons, one of the largest
companies working in Iraq, to build a prison north of Baghdad after
the firm fell more than two years behind schedule, threatened to go
millions of dollars over budget and essentially abandoned the
construction site. The move is another harsh rebuke for Parsons, only
weeks after the corps c anceled more than US$300 million of the
company's contracts to build and refurbish hospitals and clinics
across Iraq.

Wall Street Journal: Battlefield Conversion, Employees of
Contractor Barred From Iraq Resurrect Its Business

The Bush administration's effort to rebuild Iraq has been marred
by mismanagement and instances of corruption. U.S. audits have found
evidence that hundreds of millions of dollars was spent without
proper authorization, given to contractors who performed shoddy work,
or paid to firms charging unreasonably high prices. The audits have
also found cases where corrupt contractors and U.S. and Iraqi
government officials stole money. The U.S. has budgeted US$20.9
billion specifically for Iraq reconstruction, not counting money for
smaller projects that comes from the military's budget.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>LUNG STEM CELLS FOUND BY ACADEMIA SINICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Genomic Research Center of Academic
Sinica declared Tuesday that it had found lung stem cells, proving
the long-held theory of the existence of adult stem cells in the
lungs.</P>
      <P>The research team also found the fact that lung stem cells are
the primary target of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
viruses and that the infection of stem cells results in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) -- or fatal lung failures that
claim the lives of 50 percent of SARS patients who later develop
ARDS.</P>
      <P>Dr. John Yu, the head of the team, said that due to constant
contact with air, lung cells are more fragile than cells in other
organs, therefore scientists have long believed there should be stem
cells in the lungs to regenerate cells and maintain respiratory
function.</P>
      <P>Yu added that in their research, they not only found stem cells
in the bronchoalveolar junction, but also discovered that lung stem
cells renew lung cells at an interval of 25 days, which is also the
key period between the peak SARS virus load and the development of
ARDS.</P>
      <P>During the 2003 SARS epidemic, Yu noticed for the first time the
25-day lag from time of peak virus load to onset of ARDS. Yu at that
time hypothesized that the lag time might reflect the duration of
the stem cell regenerative cycle, so the team set a goal of spotting
stem cells in the lungs.</P>
      <P>The team later grew lung cells in vitro and found only one
specific group of cells was targeted by the SARS viruses. When
verifying the group, they found the cells bear the Oct-4 and SSEA-1
markers -- the same markers for embryonic stem cells, convincing them
that they had discovered lung stem cells.</P>
      <P>The team has also proved that the high death rate among SARS
patients is because the viruses attack stem cells, stopping the cell
regeneration process and causing lung failure.</P>
      <P>Yu explained that an "experienced" virus will not attack stem
cells and cause the death of its host, for viruses seek symbiosis --
to receive benefits from the host as long as possible. Yu added that
since SARS viruses are relatively new and "inexperienced, " they will
"wrongly" target stem cells.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that since the SARS viruses are still young and have
shown no signs of evolving, any SARS epidemics that break out will
still attack stem cells.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that they have now successfully developed lung stem
cells in vitro and that they have been working on stem cell therapy
for ARDS and other lung failure diseases.</P>

      <P>Urbanization is increasing in Taiwan, with
nearly 69.4 percent of the country's population living in urban areas
by 2005, according to the latest report on urbanization released
Tuesday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The report shows that Taiwan's total population reached 22.77
million at the end of 2005, with 15.8 million people, or 69.4 percent
of the population, residing in urban areas, which accounted for only
16.9 percent of Taiwan's territory.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's cities and counties, the greater Taipei area and
Keelung registered the largest extent of urbanization, with its
population totaling 6.65 million last year, representing 29.2 percent
of the island's population, followed by the Kaohsiung area in the
south, with a population of 2.76 million.</P>
      <P>According to United Nations statistics, 2 percent of the world's

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
by choosing not to respond to a legislative motion to recall him, he
was acting according to the Constitution and "that absolutely does
not mean" he is in contempt of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Instead, Chen chose to "report to the people" in a televised

Hokkien dialect spoken by a majority of the people in Taiwan. About
30 percent of Taiwan's population, who speak Mandarin, Hakka or
aboriginal languages, do not speak Hokkienese.</P>
      <P>He refused to allow journalists to ask questions after his speech
because he said he did not want the discussion to get "off focus." He
noted that he might stage another occasion for journalists to ask him
questions.</P>
      <P>Under the law, he had until Tuesday to answer charges against him
listed in the opposition-initiated recall motion at the legislature.
"Very clearly, the Legislative Yuan told me in its official notice
that its Committee of the Whole would still go ahead to screen the
motion if the intended recallee declines to answer," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said he wrote back to Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
telling him that he would not reply to the motion but would instead
make a report to the people.</P>

constitutional provisions, including constitutional amendments and

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS CAMPAIGN TO RECALL HIM 'CONSTITUTIONALLY DISPUTABLE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
the opposition-backed campaign to recall him is "constitutionally
disputable" because he is a popularly elected leader with a fixed
term.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving Graham Watson, leader of
the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European
Parliament, a day before the Legislative Yuan was set to start
reviewing a motion to recall him. The motion was proposed by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First
Party in the wake of a recent spate of corruption allegations against
Chen's close aides and members of his family.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that this is not the first time the opposition has
initiated a campaign to recall him and that the previous time they
did so was simply over a disagreement with the ruling party on a
public policy -- the decision to scrap the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant
project in 2000.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he respects the opposition's moves as long as they
are constitutional and that he believes the people of Taiwan have
enough wisdom and ability to deal with such a political issue.</P>
      <P>On the opposition's plan to launch a no-confidence vote against
Premier Su Tseng-chang if the presidential recall motion fails to
pass the legislature, Chen said any actions taken by the opposition
must follow the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Claiming that political stability, Taiwan's democratic foundation
and the country's future are what the people are most concerned
about, Chen said he will report to the public directly to let them
judge for themselves if it is justifiable for the opposition to
initiate a motion to recall him.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that after the 2004 presidential election, the
opposition refused to accept the outcome of the election and occupied
the boulevard in front of the Presidential Office for one week until
a recount of more than 16 million ballots proved that he won the
election.</P>
      <P>He stressed that any election disputes should be resolved through
judicial means and that the presidential recall motion should also be
carried out in accordance with constitutional and legal procedures.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed Tuesday that
if his wife Wu Shu-jen is found to have accepted Pacific Sogo
Department Store vouchers, he will step down.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated the pledge he made in an earlier
Presidential Office news release during a televised speech intended

      <P>"That promise remains effective as of now and will remain

aide, Ma Yung-cheng, to find out what was going on, he said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that no-one should interfere with the judicial

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
he and his wife, Wu Shu-jen, have nothing to do with the insider
trading case of the Taiwan Land Development Corp., although their
son-in-law and his parents are implicated in the scandal.</P>
      <P>Appearing on television to defend himself and the first lady

      <P>Chao has been in the custody of the Taipei District Court since
late May to answer questions from public prosecutors about his

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vigorously
defended his performance in a nationally televised speech Tuesday in
an effort to woo public support for him in his dispute with the
opposition "pan blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) . </P>
      <P>Knowing that the KMT and PFP have little chance of mustering
enough votes to pass a recall motion against him in the legislature,
the president took to the airwaves to dispute the causes listed by
the two opposition parties in their recall motion rather than defend
himself at the legislaure.</P>
      <P>He defended his wife Wu Shu-jen, who is alleged to have helped a
business tycoon take over a loss-making department store in return
for huge amounts of gift vouchers in that store, describing the
allegations as "groundless" and vowing to step down if the
allegations, which are already being investigated by prosecutors, are
proved to be true.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue of his son-in-law Chao Chien-ming, who has
been detained on suspicion of involvement in the insider trading of
stocks in a state-own company, the president said he would give the
law enforcement officials a free hand in investigating the case and
that Chao should face the legal consequences of his behavior.</P>
      <P>Chen said this is also his approach to the case involving his
former deputy chief of staff, Chen Che-nan, in detention for taking
bribes from businessmen.</P>
      <P>As for his political foes' claims that he usurped the
constitutional power of the premier by naming his confidants to senior
posts in the administration and dictating policy to the Cabinet, Chen
claimed he was exercising his power following the Constitution, which
was in place long before he was elected.</P>
      <P>The Constitution does not oblige the president to name a premier
from the majority party in the legislature, Chen argued in response
to the "pan blue" charge that he named premiers from his Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) "unconstitutionally" because the DPP does not
control a majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen said his promise May 31 to stop exercising power beyond
those provided for the president in the Constitution should not be
considered an acknowledgement that he had wrongfully usurped the
powers of the premier.</P>
      <P>Instead, Chen argued, it means he will no longer serve as the
supreme policy coordinator between the ruling DPP and the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He disputed critics' claims that he practices cronyism by packing
the administration with his fund raisers and followers, claiming that
those people were appointed because of their knowledge, expertise and
experience. "Why brand those able men as my confidants?" he asked.</P>
      <P>He said he will not shelter any member of his ruling team and
will let justice run its course if they are found to be involved in
any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Chen also defended his decision to cease the function of the
National Unification Council in February, a decision branded by the
KMT and PFP in their recall motion as a diplomatic bungle that
damaged U.S. trust in his administration, saying that the decision,
including its wording, was taken only after more than 50 negotiation
sessions with the U. S. and only after it was fully understood by
Washington.</P>

Progressive Party (DPP) "unconstitutionally" because the DPP does not
control a majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen said his promise May 31 to stop exercising power beyond
those provided for the president in the Constitution should not be
considered an acknowledgement that he had wrongfully usurped the
powers of the premier.</P>
      <P>Instead, Chen argued, it means he will no longer serve as the
supreme policy coordinator between the ruling DPP and the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He disputed critics' claims that he practices cronyism by packing
the administration with his fund raisers and followers, claiming that
those people were appointed because of their knowledge, expertise and
experience. "Why brand those able men as my confidants?" he asked.</P>
      <P>He said he will not shelter any member of his ruling team and
will let justice run its course if they are found to be involved in
any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Chen also defended his decision to cease the function of the
National Unification Council in February, a decision branded by the
KMT and PFP in their recall motion as a diplomatic bungle that
damaged U.S. trust in his administration, saying that the decision,
including its wording, was taken only after more than 50 negotiation
sessions with the U. S. and only after it was fully understood by
Washington.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
announced a recess soon after the extraordinary legislative session
began to review an opposition-initiated motion to recall President
Chen Shui-bian Wednesday as "pan-green camp" lawmakers decided to
boycott the process.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), which together with its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
forms the "pan-green camp, " said the DPP legislative caucus has
decided to be absent from all four days of the review process,
beginning Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party has pushed to recall President Chen, believing his
leadership is in doubt in the wake of a spate of corruption
allegations implicating his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>Huang Shih-cho, a TSU party whip, said TSU legislators will vote
against the recall motion during the four days of the extra session
set aside exclusively for debates on the motion.</P>
      <P>Huang dismissed the "pan-blue alliance's" plan to hold a
"testimony-style public hearing" during the extra session, ridiculing
the move as "the setting up of a clandestine tribunal to try the
president."</P>
      <P>He said that if the TSU fails to stop the "recall tribunal, " the
TSU legislators may follow the DPP in boycotting the four-day review
process.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOOLS URGED TO MAKE GOOD USE OF SEX OFFENDER DATA BASE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Schools and youth social welfare
institutions can make good use of a data browsing system the Ministry
of the Interior (MOI) recently inaugurated to get information on sex
offenders, an MOI official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Tzu-ling, executive secretary of the ministry's committee in
charge of domestic violence and sexual offense prevention, said that
the system was inaugurated in April and that the number of sex
offenders recorded has reached 131 so far.</P>
      <P>LIn estimated that the number will increase, although no schools
have applied to look into the information so far.</P>
      <P>She said that the number of sexual offenses totaled 3,233 cases
in 2005, and the victims in 1,962 cases, or 61 percent of all the
cases, were under 18 years old.</P>
      <P>To prevent sexual offenders from becoming repeat offenders, the
MOI has stipulated that those who are convicted for sex crimes are
required to register their home, school and work addresses and other
information at police stations every six months for a period of seven
years after their release if they were older than 18 when they
committed their offense.</P>
      <P>Lin urged schools, kindergartens, nurseries and youth social
welfare institutions to make use of the system, saying that when they

    <HEADLINE>RECALL CAMPAIGN A BATTLE AGAINST CORRUPTION, INCOMPETENCE: KMT CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou Wednesday defined the KMT-led campaign to recall President
Chen Shui-bian as a battle against a "corrupt and incompetent"
government.</P>
      <P>Ma said this is an issue of right and wrong, and he denied that
the KMT is initiating a political struggle to try to usurp power.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while releasing a joint statement with
speakers of 14 county and city councils controlled by the KMT, in
which they called on legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union to support the
presidential recall motion so as to allow the people to decide
whether to unseat Chen.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan started reviewing the motion Wednesday and
is set to vote on it June 27. If more than two-thirds of the
legislators vote in favor of it, the motion will then be put to a
national referendum.</P>
      <P>As the KMT and its ally, the opposition People First Party,
control only a slim majority in the legislature, the odds of the
motion passing the legislature are believed to be slim.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that the recall campaign has won the support of a lot
of people since it was started two weeks ago, saying that 990,000
people had signed their names to endorse the motion as of Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed the "corrupt and incompetent" administration led by
Chen over the past six years has lost the people's trust and respect,
with the president's wife, aides and son-in-law and his son-in-law's
family all playing a role in various corruption scandals or the
management struggles of financial holding companies.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, these people were able to interfere in trading
involving millions of New Taiwan dollars because they were Chen's
confidants, in-laws or close friends, and the public can no longer
tolerate such a situation.</P>
      <P>On Chen's claim that he was not aware of the situation and none
of these undertakings has anything to do with him, Ma said this shows
that Chen has not done a good job as the president.</P>
      <P>He stressed that KMT must let Chen hear the voices of the people,
who Ma said are expecting the president to give them an answer but
are disappointed.</P>
      <P>Denying the recall campaign is aimed at usurping power, Ma noted
that the DPP will remain in power even if Chen is unseated.</P>
      <P>He urged the DPP to stand on the side of justice, integrity and
"right" by supporting the recall motion.</P>

MOVING FULL BLAST against communist rebels, defense officials

      <P>The previous evening, Chen gave a televised address that Lu
described as "a comprehensive report" to defend his position
regarding a string of corruption allegations involving his family and
aides in response to the recall motion that aims to hold Chen
accountable.</P>
      <P>The corruption cases should be left for the judicial system to
deal with and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" should not make
accusations without solid evidence, she said, urging both camps to
maintain "cool heads" should the presidential recall vote fail to
pass the Legislative Yuan June 27, as "everything should proceed in
line with the Constitution."</P>
      <P>The vice president also reiterated her oft-stated view that
Taiwan must forge its own "blue sea strategy" to create new
opportunities to ensure national security and improve the people's
livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , described Chen's TV performance as
"prudent."</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Chen gave a concrete and clear response to the
opposition's speculation about his role in the many corruption
scandals and displayed his full respect for the judicial system by
not mentioning individual cases being investigated by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>However, DPP lawmaker Lee Wen-chung said his performance showed
that Chen is "an eloquent lawyer rather than a president wishing to
apologize, " because he failed to directly answer several questions
key to the people, such as whether first lady Wu Shu-jen accepted
huge amounts of gift certificates from the Sogo Department Store.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed the
relevant authorities Wednesday to work out measures to prevent and
control juvenile delinquency, which he said is likely to increase
during the upcoming summer vacation.</P>
      <P>Su said during a weekly Cabinet meeting that summer vacation is
the period when teenagers can easily be tempted to engage in
activities such as "late-night loitering, " illegal car racing,
fighting and drug abuse.</P>
      <P>Also, Su said, teenagers might fall victim to scams when they try
to find summer jobs and he ordered the Ministry of Education (MOE) ,
the Council of Labor Affairs, the National Youth Commission and the
Government Information Office to step up publicity to remind students
to pay attention to this problem.</P>
      <P>The authorities should also cooperate with the private sector to

      <P>The 2006 Taipei International Food Show
opened at the Taipei World Trade Center Wednesday with exhibitors
from 32 countries participating.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chih-jen, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) , presided over a ceremony at the Taipei
International Convention Center to officially open the show, which
will run through June 24.</P>
      <P>Foodtech Taipei and Taipei Pack, as well as a dozen seminars
concerning the food industry are also being held concurrently with
Food Taipei 2006 at the same venue, said officials from TAITRA -- the
key sponsor of the show.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan and Hsu
jointly cut the ribbon to open the Taiwan Foods Pavilion -- the
largest of all the national pavilions taking part in the show --
where 72 companies put their flagship or latest products on display.</P>
      <P>The 1,548 sq. ft. Taiwan Pavilion is divided into eight sections,
featuring fruit and vegetables, tea, fish products, rice, husbandry,
forestry and processed food products.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Su said the Taiwan Pavilion serves two
purposes -- to allow consumers from around the world to find out more
about Taiwan-produced quality foods or signature foods with local
features on one hand, while on the other, tipping domestic consumers
that they can source "almost all kinds" of high-quality foods from
within Taiwan, saving on expensive imports.</P>
      <P>Also praising Taiwan-produced foods, Hsu said Taiwan and its
farmers are one of the luckiest groups in the world in terms of
producing high-quality agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Hsu said many Japanese importers have shifted from other Asian
countries to Taiwan for their food imports, after realizing that
Taiwan foods cannot be replaced by counterparts from other Asian
countries, where food may be cheaper in price but can suffer from
shabby quality.</P>

      <P>A rally to be oranized by the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) June 24 in southern Kaohsiung city to
demand President Chen Shui-bian's resignation will be held as
planned, despite reported pressure from the central government, KMT
spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the comments at a news conference at the KMT
headquarters.</P>
      <P>Saying that the KMT applied to sponsor the rally at the National

has already announced it to the public, Cheng stressed that the party
will not go back on its decision to stage the protest and she accused
the central government of exercising strong pressure on local

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER QUESTIONS 'INTEGRITY' THEME OF OPPOSITION'S RECALL BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang questioned Wednesday
the "integrity" of the opposition, which has made "integrity" the
theme of its recall bid to unseat President Chen Shui-bian over his
incompetence and corruption allegations against his family and close
associates.</P>
      <P>He also urged the opposition to stop political infighting and
focus on issues related to public welfare in the hope that a special
budget for flood prevention can clear the legislature as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>Su was responding to the opposition-initiated recall motion to
oust Chen, which began a four-day review at the legislative
Committee of the Whole Wednesday before the matter is put to a vote
June 27.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party initiated the recall, convinced that Chen has
lost the public trust in the wake of a string of corruption
allegations implicating his son-in-law and close aides.</P>
      <P>However, Su questioned the legitimacy of the recall bid, which
has "safeguard Taiwan with integrity" as its theme.</P>
      <P>He said that a man will be dealt with harshly if he robs others,
but pointed out that "a party, " referring to the KMT, has stolen
hundreds of billions of dollars from the nation, has refused to
return it, and has used it to line its own pockets.</P>
      <P>As early as 2001, the Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog
body, had requested that the Executive Yuan look into the matter
thoroughly, Su said. The results show that land under the KMT name
but rightfully belonging to the nation amounted to 145 hectares, with
a market value of more than NT$20 billion (US$615.38 million).</P>
      <P>But the KMT has only returned two hectares of ill-gotten assets
so far, he said.</P>
      <P>"Can a party who has robbed from the nation billions of dollars
call itself a party of integrity?" he asked.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan has requested the Legislative Yuan to
review a draft bill concerning the party's ill-gotten assets since
2002, but has been blocked by the KMT for the 42nd time and has not
cleared the legislature.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the opposition-dominated legislature has also
blocked an arms procurement package from the United States for the
56th time, even though Taiwan is under growing threat from China, and
asked how this can be construed as "safeguarding Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan requested an extraordinary legislative session
to speed up the passage of a number of priority bills, Su went on,
but he lamented that the opposition has made the recall bid a
priority even though it is unlikely to pass because it will require
the consent of two-thirds of the lawmakers in the 221-seat
legislature, where the opposition only maintains a slim majority.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's resolution to oblige
appointed officials at the Executive Yuan to attend its debate over a
motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian is not binding, a spokesman
for the Executive Yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, minister of the Government Information Office,
said after a weekly Cabinet meeting that Minister without Portfolio
Hsu chih-hsiung invited officials from related agencies to study the
resolution passed earlier that day by the Committee of Whole at 
the legislature and determined that it is not legally binding.</P>
      <P>The legislature cannot exert its power to investigate executive
actions and wrongdoing before a law regulating its exercise is
enacted. Until then, the legislature's resolution means nothing more
than the lawmakers' desire.</P>
      <P>The government spokesman cited an interpretation of the Council
of Grand Justices that the legislature cannot compel officials to
attend its sessions or administer punishment to those who ignore its
requirements unless such moves are provided for under the law.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also denied the Committee of Whole's power to
order the executive branch to come up with official documents for its
examination, saying that the power belongs to individual committees
and not the Committee of Whole which is made up of all
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's decision is in line with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party efforts to boycott the recall motion by
walking out of the chamber en masse.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will start
a new publicity campaign next week to step up domestic marketing of
agricultural products, COA Chairman Su Jia-chyuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su said the COA will place advertisements at major crossroads,
subway stations, railway stations and airports to introduce Taiwan
consumers to domestic agricultural products.</P>
      <P>He made the announcement while attending the opening of the 2006
Taipei International Food Show.</P>
      <P>Su said it is the COA's dream to bring about new breakthroughs in
Taiwan's agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>According to Su, local farmers should realize that they must
produce the freshest, safest and highest-quality products in order to
compete with the rest of the world, while consumers should also
change their consumption habits and should not make price the only
consideration when selecting agricultural products.</P>
      <P>The government, meanwhile, should adopt a new concept and
prioritize marketing, Su said.</P>
      <P>He noted that in the past, the government thought that it was a
matter of course for local consumers to buy domestic agricultural
products, but this is not the case now that more and more foreign
agricultural products are being imported into the country.</P>
      <P>Likening the agricultural sector to the heart of a country, Su
said many industrial products will be of no use if there is no
agriculture to sustain the lives of the people, and that the
government must therefore attach importance to the agricultural
sector.</P>

      <P>A student from Kaohsiung County who won a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition legislators who initiated a
legislative motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian urged their
"pan-green camp" rivals Wednesday to help pass the motion so the
people will have a chance to vote on it in a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Ting Shou-chung of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
challenged ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmakers to honor the president's wish that
it should be the people, not the legislators, who decide whether or
not he should serve until his official term expires in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"The president said last night that he was willing to allow his
fate to be decided by the 23 million people of Taiwan," Ting said.</P>
      <P>Ting made his remarks as the Legislative Yuan's Committee of the
Whole began to review the recall motion, focusing on the subject of
"a declining economy" that the opposition has blamed on Chen's poor
leadership.</P>
      <P>Ting, Luo Shih-hsiung of the KMT and Lu Hsueh-chang of the People
First Party (PFP) said Chen's government does not have a good record
in terms of integrity, as can be seen from a string of corruption
scandals that are being investigated by judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>Moreover, they claimed, the government is almost broke, while
unemployment has risen and the suicide rate has soared -- a track
record that they claim proves that the president and his government
are incompetent and no longer fit to rule the country.</P>
      <P>"We are pushing the recall motion to stop high-level corruption
and keep the government engine from revving in neutral, " they
claimed, adding that the motion is by no means intended to provoke
political feuding between the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
PFP and the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the TSU.</P>
      <P>Since it is the president's wish to give the population a chance
to judge his administrative record, the "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers
called on their "pan-green" rivals to help the motion clear the
two-thirds majority threshold in the legislature so that the people
can pass their judgment in a referendum.</P>
      <P>They suggested that the legislature invite Chen, his wife Wu
Shu-jen and former DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung to confront each
other in the legislature in regard to the controversy over whether Wu
accepted political donations from former Tuntex Group Chairman Chen
You-hao.</P>
      <P>Chen, a criminal on the run in the United States and China,
claims that he met Wu in the company of Shen and handed cash to her
for political campaign funds, an accusation Wu denies. However, Shen
himself has recently confirmed that such a meeting did take place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PER CAPITA GDP MIGHT REACH US$30,000 IN 2015: CIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan could enjoy a per capita gross
domestic product (GDP) of US$30,000 in 2015 with proper economic
policies, Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) Chairman
Vincent Siew predicted Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Siew's remarks were part of a report on Taiwan's economic
prospects in 2015 conducted by five of Taiwan's major economic think
tanks -- CIER, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the Taiwan
Thinktank, the Taiwan Research Institute and Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>The report, which was commissioned by Premier Su Tseng-chang, is
expected to be published Friday, the 25th anniversary of CIER.</P>
      <P>At an interview with CNA, Siew noted that the success of future
markets will hinge on who can provide the best value-added services
to clients.</P>
      <P>With the research of the think tanks, Siew said he believes
Taiwan can see its GDP jump significantly by promoting what he
described as "3B" (bridge, brain and branding).</P>
      <P>"Bridge means Taiwan should open its market further and make more
connections with the rest of the world, " Siew said, suggesting that
Taiwan open direct links with China and not impose too many
limitations on its marine transport to and from China.</P>
      <P>"Brain means Taiwan should try its best to attract and cultivate
talent, while branding means domestic companies should set up their
own brand names," he added.</P>
      <P>The report envisions an economic outline for Taiwan in 2015 with
the hope that the country's economic growth might top 5 percent, the
per capita GDP can reach US$30,000, and the unemployment rate can be
reduced to under 4 percent, while the production of specialists such
as accountants and lawyers will account for 45 percent of the total
service industry.</P>
      <P>Noting that the future economic battlefield will be a global
competition in value-added services, Siew claimed that Taiwan has a
good chance thanks to its advantage in scientific development and
talent cultivation.</P>
      <P>However, the success will need far-sighted policies and various
incentives provided by the government to the service industry.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's unique economic characteristics, in which small-
and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) are full of dynamism, Siew
suggested that the government incentives should not focus on giant
companies, but rather on the SMEs, which Siew said can increase the
country's development space and avoid Taiwan companies being
marginalized.</P>
      <P>With the production of the service industry accounting for more
than 70 percent of Taiwan's GDP, Siew urged the service industry to
elevate its professionalism and internationalization.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will change its nomination regulations for the next legislature
if the current legislature is dissolved, the DPP Central Standing
Committee proposed at its weekly meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The participants in the meeting proposed that the DPP Central
Executive Committee should nominate the party's candidates if the
current legislature is dissolved by the president, forcing a new
legislative election to be held within 60 days of the dissolution.</P>

      <P>The proposal will be submitted for discussion at a DPP congress

Chen Shui-bian over what the party claims is his incompetence,
coupled with corruption allegations against his family and close
associates, fails.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng said that after Chen delivered a
"report to the nation" Tuesday in response to an opposition-initiated
recall motion, the DPP legislators were "in high spirits" and "up in
arms for a possible fight."</P>
      <P>It would rather have the legislature dissolved than give in to
the demands of the opposition, Gao said.</P>
      <P>DPP Central Standing Committee member Cheng Pao-Ching said the
DPP should study other complementary measures to deal with possible
situations in hot or controversial constituencies.</P>
      <P>The party has initially planned that for constituencies with more
than one hopeful, public polls will be conducted as a reference as to
who should be picked. For constituencies with no hopefuls, the party
chairman will recruit them, drawing from political appointees and
respected figures from all walks of life.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Deputy Speaker Chung
Jung-chi condemned President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday for snubbing
the legislature's invitation to respond to a legislative motion aimed
at ousting the head of state.</P>
      <P>Chung chaired a Committee of the Whole meeting to review the
opposition-initiated recall motion, a motion Chen chose to ignore by
speaking directly to what he called "the whole population" in his
native Hokkien dialect Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>The president chose not to respond, not to explain, and not to
cooperate with the legislature, Chung said. Rather, the president
chose to ignore the legislature's execution of its official duties,
he accused.</P>
      <P>"The president's behavior is regrettable and incomprehensible,
and I must protest and denounce it in my capacity as chairman of the
Committee of the Whole meeting," Chung said.</P>
      <P>He also upbraided Economic Affairs Minister Hwang Ing-san,
Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng

been in decline.</P>
      <P>While the Cabinet ministers boycotted the first meeting to review

Hsiang-neng were present.</P>
      <P>The legislature will hold three more such meetings before voting
on the motion on June 27. If more than two-thirds of legislators
approve the motion, it will then have to be endorsed by half of
voters in a national referendum to go into effect.</P>

House Plan May Delay Immigration Overhaul 

U.S. House Republican leaders said Tuesday
that they would hold summer hearings around the
nation on immigration before trying to
compromise with the Senate. The unusual decision
to set a new round of hearings on legislation
already passed by the House and the Senate
places a serious roadblock in the way of
President Bush's drive for major changes in
immigration policy.

Wall Street Journal: Twisting Trail,
U.S. Falls Behind In Tracking Cattle
To Control Disease

When the first U.S. case of mad-cow disease
was discovered in December 2003, then-Secretary
of Agriculture Ann M. Veneman pledged to hasten
creation of a national identification system for
tracing livestock quickly during a disease
outbreak. Today, more than two years later, the
U.S. still has no national ID system for most
farm animals, including chickens and beef
cattle. An ID system would assign each animal a 
unique number, and record all its movements as
it travels to new ranches, farms or other
destinations. This tracking information could
prove critical in controlling outbreaks of
contagious diseases.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade in passports and use of counterfeit
will be punishable according to a draft package of amendments to the
existing passport statute, a Cabinet spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after the Cabinet approved at its
weekly meeting a draft package proposed by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) that is in step with the government's decision to
crack down on passport-related crime.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang was quoted as having said at the Cabinet
meeting that the government is determined to meet international
standards of safety and convenience now that countries around the
world have stepped up travel document security as part of the global
war on terrorism in the wake of the "911" terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>This new round of revisions focuses on two points -- the
inclusion of regulations providing for the inscription of personal
data and photo into the passport's built-in chip and the prevention
of passport-related crime, the premier added.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA-drafted amendments, those involved in the
trade of passports, those who use their passports as collateral that
may lead to damaging the public interest, or anyone who otherwise
improperly uses passports may face a maximum five-year prison term
plus a fine of up to NT$500,000.</P>
      <P>The same penalties apply to those who provide their personal data
and identification cards to criminal rings or other individuals to
apply for passports, as well as anyone involved in passport forgery
or tampering.</P>
      <P>The draft package will be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
approval in the near future, the spokesman said, adding that relevant
government agencies will strengthen communications with legislative
caucuses of various political parties to ensure the smooth passage of
the amendment package at an early date.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou used half an hour of televised remarks Wednesday to respond
to President Chen Shui-bian's two-hour speech the previous evening,
urging Chen to step down before losing more respect from the people
and calling on ruling party members to engage in a "competency and
integrity competition" with his party.</P>
      <P>The recall motion the KMT and People First Party (PFP) are
pushing in the legislature is not aimed at provoking a fight or
seizing power, Ma told his "friends" in the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Rather, he said, the motion is aimed at creating a clean and
competent government that would make Taiwan's democracy a source of
pride for its population.</P>
      <P>"Let's not engage in a competition of corruption. Let's engage
ourselves in a competition of competency and integrity for the
dignity of our people, for our democracy and for the future of our
children," he urged his DPP rivals.</P>
      <P>Ma reminded Chen that in ancient China, even an emperor would
confess guilt in the face of social chaos and economic hardship
brought about by the ruler's incompetency and negligence of duty.</P>
      <P>Ma said when Chen's son-in-law and senior aides were charged with
various criminal offenses, the president can no longer claim he
should not be implicated.</P>
      <P>"You have political responsibility to accept, although no
criminal evidence has been found to be not in your favor," he said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that throughout the two-hour speech, the president had
not squarely faced opposition charges as listed in the recall motion.
Instead, the president tried to evade real answers to the
opposition's questions and tried to fan ethnic divisions in Taiwan's
polarized society.</P>
      <P>If Chen insisted on creating even greater division in society
just for the sake of saving his own political career, he would only
cause ever more serious harm to Taiwan, Ma said, urging "President
Chen" to make the best choice both for himself and for Taiwan --
before it is too late.</P>

      <P>The Health Bureau of Chiayi County in

NT$200,000 Wednesday for using animal feed to produce sham health
food.</P>
      <P>A spokesman said the bureau imposed the heaviest penalty possible
under the Food Sanitation and Management Act because Taisugar's
nutritional yeast products made of imported hog feed posed a serious
hazard to consumers' health.</P>
      <P>Taisugar recalled all such products June 15 after public

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD'S JAPAN VISIT WOULD BE GOOD: DPP OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  21  (CNA)
(By M. C. Yang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It would be good if Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou could visit Japan in July as planned, and he
should use the opportunity to explore Japanese viewpoints, a
ranking official of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Visiting DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung made the remarks to
Taiwanese reporters in Tokyo, where he has attended a U.S.-Japan-
Taiwan security forum and met with several influential figures of the
Liberal Democratic Party -- Japan's ruling party.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, he has been asked repeatedly about "a critical
2008" or "a stormy 2008" during his current visit in Japan, and
suggested that Ma clarify his stance toward Taiwan's future ties with
China.</P>
      <P>The year 2008 is critical because Beijing will host the Olympic
Games and China may further fan nationalistic sentiment among its
population to underscore its status as a big power, he claimed.</P>
      <P>In the same year, the United States will also hold presidential
elections, and Washington is likely to tighten its stance toward
China in bilateral trade and economic relations, Lin speculated.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan will also elect a new president in 2008, the newly
elected head of state must be capable of speaking for Taiwan's people
and be fully aware of where to lead the nation in a complicated
international situation, Lin stressed, adding that Taiwan cannot
afford to have a president who is unpredictable.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Japan-U.S. security alliance is extremely important
to Taiwan, and Taiwan's advantage lies in its democratization and a
booming foreign trade despite facing threats from China.</P>
      <P>It would be good if Ma visited Japan next month and he should use
the occasion to gain an understanding of how the Japanese view him,
Lin said, adding that his positions regarding cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, self-determination and the Japan-U.S. security alliance
would be thoroughly examined by 2008 if he wants to take part in the
next presidential race.</P>
      <P>Ma should make his stance better known to Japan during his
coming visit, Lin suggested.</P>
      <P>The international community has been closely watching Ma and will
continue to do so, especially where he would lead Taiwan and the
possible impact of his election in Asia, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Ma, chairman of Taiwan's largest opposition party, has widely
been viewed as the KMT's best bet for the 2008 presidential election
in a polarized society split by ethnic issues and the
independence-unification dispute.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma

shown any remorse while addressing the nation a day earlier, saying
it was another indication the president is no longer fit to rule the
country.</P>
      <P>For example, Ma said, Chen assured the public that his wife Wu
Shu-jen "did not directly accept" the controversial Pacific Sogo
Department Store gift vouchers.</P>
      <P>"What does that mean, not directly? Did she accept the vouchers,
or not? If she took them indirectly, from whom?" Ma asked.</P>
      <P>The president used two full hours to address the nation without
giving a clear answer to a question that most people are most
interested in, Ma said during a half-hour of televised remarks
responding to Chen's address.</P>
      <P>Titling his speech "Recovering Taiwan's Justice and Conscience,"
Ma called on ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) members to
retrieve the party's founding values of "integrity, diligence and
love of country" and to be ambitious enough to engage in a
"competition of competency and integrity" rather than a "competition
of corruption" with the KMT and other opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Ma also urged judicial prosecutors and investigators to do their
jobs professionally and conscientiously, reminding them that getting
at all the facts about high-level corruption would not cost them
their career since politicians come and go and since they are paid by
the people, not by politicians.</P>
      <P>"I know you must be under great pressure when investigating high
officials and relatives of a president, as my experience as minister
of justice has taught me," Ma said, encouraging the prosecution and
investigators to set an example of "what professionals should be
doing in a great democracy."</P>

Ma Ying-jeou urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Wednesday to "clean its own house" at a time when a legislative
motion is at stake to recall President Chen Shui-bian over corruption
allegations involving top aides and family members.</P>
      <P>In a 30-minute televised rebuttal to Chen's two-hour speech in
his defense a day earlier, Ma said the DPP's support for Chen will
only "cause him [Chen] more harm."</P>
      <P>The KMT would not like to see the DPP sink deeper into a moral
quagmire, Ma stressed, adding that the two parties should compete in
a constructive manner rather than fighting against each other.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT and DPP should compete by showing to the
public which is cleaner and more capable, rather than constantly
trying to "fight and kill."</P>
      <P>Noting that DPP heavyweights have refrained from criticizing the
president's family members who have been implicated in corruption
scandals, Ma said, "This is not the Democratic Progressive Party we

      <P>The KMT chairman added that he is "very disappointed" the DPP has
chosen to side with corruption.</P>
      <P>He also said the KMT will focus efforts on the recall motion

      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday
that there is a discrepancy between the words and deeds of main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the comments after Ma ripped into President Chen
Shui-bian in a 30-minute televised speech, in which Ma urged Chen to
resign because "his incompetence and corrupt family" were dragging
down Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Ma were truly concerned about the country's social stability
and economic well-being, Hsieh said, Ma should not have let his party
initiate the legislative motion to recall President Chen.</P>
      <P>Long before the recall motion -- which has stirred political
turmoil and drived down the stock market in recent weeks -- Hsieh
lamented that the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally, the People First
Party, have spared virtually no efforts to stymie government
operations by blocking the passage of many critical bills, including
special budget appropriations for flood prevention projects and
investment rules governing state-run enterprises.</P>
      <P>Deeds speak louder than words, Hsieh said, adding that he cannot
but doubt Ma's sincerity when Ma said the president should step down
for the sake of people's livelihoods or to save the government from
"revving in neutral."</P>
      <P>Ma's verbal assault came one day after President Chen gave a
two-hour televised address defending himself against the
opposition-led campaign for his recall.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed concern about the ongoing political upheaval,
saying it seemed the nation is gradually heading toward an "abyss of
mutual destruction."</P>

democratically elected government.</P>
      <P>Beijing has consistently rejected Taiwan's olive branch since the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power in
2000. Wu said Beijing should understand that maintaining cross-strait
peace and stability requires dialogue.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the two sides should sit down to talk for mutual
benefits, " Wu said, adding that the approach of "replacing
confrontation with communication is the best guarantee for lasting
peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Wu also told Huckabee that the ROC government wants to improve
cross-strait relations by opening the door to Chinese tourists and
direct charter flight services on a regular basis. The two sides have
commissioned intermediary bodies to negotiate technical details and
concrete results can be achieved in the near future, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"We plan to receive 400,000 to 500,000 Chinese tourists a year so
that they can experience the liberal and democratic atmosphere here,"
he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday
that there is a discrepancy between the words and deeds of main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the comments after Ma ripped into President Chen
Shui-bian in a 30-minute televised speech, in which Ma urged Chen to
resign because "his incompetence and corrupt family" were dragging
down Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Ma were truly concerned about the country's social stability
and economic well-being, Hsieh said, Ma should not have let his party
initiate the legislative motion to recall President Chen.</P>
      <P>Long before the recall motion -- which has stirred political
turmoil and drived down the stock market in recent weeks -- Hsieh
lamented that the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally, the People First
Party, have spared virtually no efforts to stymie government
operations by blocking the passage of many critical bills, including
special budget appropriations for flood prevention projects and
investment rules governing state-run enterprises.</P>
      <P>Deeds speak louder than words, Hsieh said, adding that he cannot
but doubt Ma's sincerity when Ma said the president should step down
for the sake of people's livelihoods or to save the government from
"revving in neutral."</P>
      <P>Ma's verbal assault came one day after President Chen gave a
two-hour televised address defending himself against the
opposition-led campaign for his recall.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed concern about the ongoing political upheaval,
saying it seemed the nation is gradually heading toward an "abyss of
mutual destruction."</P>
      <P>"I'm hopeful that Ma will take the lead to reverse this ominous
trend since the pan-blue alliance holds a slight majority in the
legislature," Hsieh added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN URGES DPP TO 'CLEAN ITS OWN HOUSE'(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Wednesday to "clean its own house" at a time when a legislative
motion is at stake to recall President Chen Shui-bian over corruption
allegations involving top aides and family members.</P>
      <P>In a 30-minute televised rebuttal to Chen's two-hour speech in
his defense a day earlier, Ma said the DPP's support for Chen will
only "cause him [Chen] more harm."</P>
      <P>The KMT would not like to see the DPP sink deeper into a moral
quagmire, Ma stressed, adding that the two parties should compete in
a constructive manner rather than fighting against each other.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT and DPP should compete by showing to the
public which is cleaner and more capable, rather than constantly
trying to "fight and kill."</P>
      <P>Noting that DPP heavyweights have refrained from criticizing the
president's family members who have been implicated in corruption
scandals, Ma said, "This is not the Democratic Progressive Party we
have come to know."</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman added that he is "very disappointed" the DPP has
chosen to side with corruption.</P>
      <P>He also said the KMT will focus efforts on the recall motion
pending in the legislature. As for whether the KMT and its ally, the
People First Party, will push for a no-confidence vote in the
legislature to topple the Cabinet if the recall bid fails, Ma said he
would address the matter after the final results of the recall motion
are known.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou claimed Wednesday that President Chen Shui-bian had not
shown any remorse while addressing the nation a day earlier, saying
it was another indication the president is no longer fit to rule the
country.</P>
      <P>For example, Ma said, Chen assured the public that his wife Wu
Shu-jen "did not directly accept" the controversial Pacific Sogo
Department Store gift vouchers.</P>
      <P>"What does that mean, not directly? Did she accept the vouchers,
or not? If she took them indirectly, from whom?" Ma asked.</P>
      <P>The president used two full hours to address the nation without
giving a clear answer to a question that most people are most
interested in, Ma said during a half-hour of televised remarks
responding to Chen's address.</P>
      <P>Titling his speech "Recovering Taiwan's Justice and Conscience,"
Ma called on ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) members to
retrieve the party's founding values of "integrity, diligence and
love of country" and to be ambitious enough to engage in a
"competition of competency and integrity" rather than a "competition
of corruption" with the KMT and other opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Ma also urged judicial prosecutors and investigators to do their
jobs professionally and conscientiously, reminding them that getting
at all the facts about high-level corruption would not cost them
their career since politicians come and go and since they are paid by
the people, not by politicians.</P>
      <P>"I know you must be under great pressure when investigating high
officials and relatives of a president, as my experience as minister
of justice has taught me," Ma said, encouraging the prosecution and
investigators to set an example of "what professionals should be
doing in a great democracy."</P>

    <HEADLINE>A RICH CHINA MAY EAT UP TAIWAN: BUDDHIST LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Rome,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Hwang Kwang-chun and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan Buddhist leader used an analogy of
religious equality Wednesday to predict that some day, when China
becomes a rich country, it may "eat up Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Master Hsing Yun of the Buddha Light Foundation based in southern
Taiwan told a gathering of overseas Chinese that Taiwan has cringed
at the idea of unifying with China because of its perceived poverty.</P>
      <P>"Now China is becoming richer and richer, and some day in the
future it would not be incredible that it might eat up Taiwan as the
ideas of inequality, such as rich and poor and big and small, are
involved here," Hsing Yun said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that any system of belief is aimed at helping
believers believe in his or her own mind.</P>
      <P>"We say we feel comfortable at home. By the same token, our minds
need a home to 'be at home, ' and what religions do is find that home
for our minds," he said.</P>
      <P>Sharing his experience in resting his mind at ease, Hsing Yun
said there are numerous ways of doing that, but such fundamental
principles as love, tolerance, cherishing what one has and making
friends with all will not change no matter what approach one takes to
find a home for one's mind. He noted that a sense of equality is
important because only by treating all living beings and all systems
of belief equally will peace and harmony prevail in the world.</P>
      <P>For that same reason, he said he would advise the people of
Taiwan not to look down upon their poorer neighbors in China, who may
sometime in the future grow rich enough to bring the Taiwanese into
its fold.</P>
      <P>The gathering was sponsored by the Republic of China's Embassy in
the Vatican, with Ambassador Tu Chu-sheng and Taiwan's top
representative in Italy, Cheng Hsin, in attendance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pope Benedict XVI met with visiting Master
Hsing Yun, founder of the Buddha's Light International Association in
Taiwan, Wednesday in a general audience at St. Peter's Basilica in
Vatican. </P>
      <P>During the meeting, Benedict XVI expressed his best regards for
the Taiwan people and said he will pray for them. The pope also
expressed the hope of meeting the Taiwan people if the chance arises.</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun arrived in Rome Tuesday. In the company of Ambassador
Tou Chou-sheng of the Republic of China, the Buddhist master extended
his respects to the pope on behalf of Taiwan Buddhists and invited
the leader of the Roman Catholic world to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Calling himself a pilgrim during his Rome trip, Hsing Yun said he
hopes the journey will act to help boost mutual understanding and
cooperation between Buddhists and Catholics.</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun founded the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist Monastery in 1967 in
southern Taiwan, which has since then evolved to become the largest
Buddhist monastery in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Now, Fo Guang Shan has more than 200 branch temples throughout
the world with the aim of promoting humanistic Buddhism.</P>
      <P>After his meeting with Benedict XVI, Hsing Yun called on Paul
Cardinal Poupard, president of the Pontifical Council for Culture of
the Holy See, for talks on issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun, heading a group of his followers, is currently on a
tour to tour Fo Guang Shan branches in Europe. He is scheduled to
leave for Geneva Wednesday evening to attend an inauguration ceremony
for a new Fo Guang Shan branch temple in the Swiss city.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian suggested Thursday
that Taiwan actively fight for opportunities to take part in
international competitions, which he called the best occasions to
publicize the country on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Chen wrote in the latest edition of his online newsletter that he
was deeply moved by the sight of soccer players from various
countries and their cheering fans wielding national flags at World
Cup matches.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago as
well as the West African nation of Togo, which originally were not
well known in the world, have suddenly become the focus of billions
of people because of their presence in this year's World Cup.</P>
      <P>While it is the most touching and proudest moment to see the
national flag of one's own country flying on the fields of
international competitions, Taiwan is the only country in the world
that has been forbidden to sing its national anthem and raise its
national flag at the Olympic games, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that although this is the international reality that
Taiwan has been forced to accept since the 1980s, Taiwan must not
take this suppression as a matter of course and must not give up in
fighting for the country's rights.</P>
      <P>It is unreasonable and extremely strange that the people of
Taiwan are not allowed to bring the national flag to cheer for their
country even at international competitions hosted by Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>The president urged all sectors in Taiwan to actively seek
opportunities to participate in international competitions and
cherish these opportunities so that Taiwan will get the best

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE FISHING BOAT ESCORTED HOME AFTER MUTINY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat whose skipper was
allegedly killed by two Chinese crewmembers on the high seas near
Japan's island of Iwo Jima in the Pacific Ocean returned to Taiwan
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The fishing boat "Hsinglung" returned to Suao port in Yilan
County in northeastern Taiwan under the escort of a coast guard
patrol vessel. The two suspects -- mainland fishermen Yang Jietsong,
22, and Huang Tapao, 23 -- who are suspected of having murdered
skipper Chen Mu-tsai, 50, were turned over to the Yilan Prosecutor's
Office for questioning.</P>
      <P>The "Hsinglung" left Yilan's Nanfanao Harbor in March for fishing
operations in waters east of Iwo Jima. On board were the skipper as
well as chief engineer Huang Chin-hsin, 49, and eight Chinese
fishermen, including Yang and Huang.</P>
      <P>Coast guard official Wang Yun-huei said that initial
investigations showed that on June 10, the skipper clashed with Yang
and Huang in a bitter argument and that the two later allegedly
stabbed him to death. His body was put on ice in the cabin of the
boat.</P>
      <P>The two had attempted to sabotage the satellite telephone and
communicates equipment after killing the skipper, according to Wang.
They had also wanted to flee to China but then later decided to go
back to Taiwan to face justice at the advice of the other
crewmembers.</P>
      <P>Huang later sent out a distress call for assistance. A coast
guard patrol vessel intercepted the fishing boat June 16 and escorted
it back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The case marks the second time in less than two years that the
fishing boat's two Taiwanese officers were overpowered by Chinese
crew members. In August 2004, Chen and Huang were held hostage by
nine Chinese crewmembers who then took the "Hsinglung" to Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Chen had served as a skipper on the ship for more than a decade.
According to media reports, because he had often run into
trouble with crewmembers hired from Pingtan, Fujian Province, he
decided to hire crew members from Zhangzhou, also in Fujian Province,
this year. However, he also experienced problems with them.</P>

      <P>The number of undeclared cigarettes seized
by customs authorities has increased significantly following the
tobacco tax hike, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to officials at the Ministry of Finance's Taipei
Customs Office, a total of 3,635 cartons of undeclared cigarettes
have been seized since the tobacco tax was raised from NT$50
(US$1.53) per carton containing 200 cigarettes to NT$100 per carton
on Feb. 16.</P>

importers or are accompanied by a permit issued by the Ministry of
Finance, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that any travelers who intentionally do not declare
their taxable items will have the items confiscated and may face
prosecution if they show obvious intent to bring in the products for
profit.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" will attend a rally planned for Saturday in southern
Kaohsiung city despite reported pressure from the central government
to cancel the activity, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokeswoman
Cheng Lee-wen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Both KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong will take part in the demonstration at the
National Science and Technology Museum in the southern port city to
ask for President Chen Shui-bian's resignation over a string of
corruption allegations regarding his family and close aides, Cheng
said at a news conference at KMT headquarters.</P>
      <P>Regardless of pressure from the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government, the activity has gained approval from the museum
authorities through a due process and will be held as scheduled,
Cheng stressed.</P>
      <P>She quoted Ma as saying that if the DPP is the source of the
reported pressure, it would be unforgivable for the government to
attempt to strip people of the freedom of speech guaranteed in the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT spokeswoman, the two men will also
participate in a similar activity slated for Sunday in Taipei to
demand Chen step down -- the latest in a series of protest activities
sponsored by the pan-blue alliance to hold Chen accountable for
corruption allegations, and in conjunction with a presidential recall
vote at the Legislative Yuan next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a KMT ad in local print media that calls on the DPP
to "give Taiwan a chance," Cheng said that the DPP must not turn into
a stumbling block in Taiwan's pursuit of progress and democracy.</P>
      <P>She urged DPP lawmakers to vote in favor of the presidential
recall motion in the legislature June 27 so as to give the Taiwanese
public a chance to have the final say on Chen's fate in a national
referendum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should prove to the rest of the world that it is a
democratic and progressive country, where its people are entitled to
oust a corrupt and incapable president through a set of
constitutional mechanisms, she said, noting that it would mark a
milestone in Taiwan's history.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION ACCUSES GOVERNMENT OF DOCTORING FINANCIAL REPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers and academics accused
the government Thursday of doctoring financial reports and embezzling
public assets, claiming the country is "almost broke" as a result of
rampant corruption and mismanagement.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Yi-ju of the People First Party (PFP) told a
Committee of the Whole meeting at the legislature that the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government over the past six years has used
six tricks to make false financial statements.</P>
      <P>These include exaggerating tax revenues, fabricating income from
selling government-owned shares in state enterprises, wasting public
money, doctoring accounting items, making complicated reinvestments
to evade parliamentary auditing and hiding key information and then
endorsing such behavior, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>She quoted international ratings as claiming that Taiwan's
financial rankings dropped to 79th in the world, with the government
debt running at NT$11 trillion (US$337.5 billion) or 110 percent of
the gross national product (GDP) , rather than what the government
claims to be 39 percent.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was not telling the truth when he said
Taiwan can afford to borrow "twice as much" as it has done, the
finance professor-turned lawmaker said.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held to review an opposition-initiated
legislative motion to recall the president. It was boycotted by DPP
lawmakers and most government officials.</P>
      <P>Lei Chien of the Kuomintang (KMT) said NT$4.61 trillion (US$141.3
billion) in public assets have been improperly taken away through
merging government-owned banks with private holding companies, BOT
projects, privatization of state-owned businesses and "sheer waste"
by government departments.</P>
      <P>"The DPP government should be held 100 percent accountable for
the horrible embezzlement," she claimed.</P>
      <P>Lee Yun-chieh, a scholar, claimed the Presidential Office has
become a "center of corruption" by means of manipulating senior
management personnel at major holding companies and interfering in
key construction projects.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, another scholar, quoted international studies as
claiming that if corruption in Taiwan were at the same level as in
Singapore, Taiwan's per capita GDP would increase by US$170.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP lawmaker, covered his mouth with a mask
during the session, erecting placards that read "Justice can only be
realized in the streets" and "Refusing to answer legislative charges
amounts to confessing crime," a reference to the president's decision
to bypass the legislature to make his rebuttal to opposition charges.</P>
      <P>The president delivered a two-hour televised speech Tuesday
night, denying all ten charges levied against him after declining to
answer to them in the legislature, deciding instead to make a "report
to the people."</P>
      <P>Thursday's legislative Committee of the Whole meeting focused on
the theme "Taiwan is financially broke, " and was second in a series
of four before the legislature votes on the recall motion June 27.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG MAYOR EXPLAINS WHY HE FILED SUIT AGAINST 12 DOCTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Thursday
that he filed suit against 12 doctors who released what they
claimed were his medical records prior to last year's Taichung
mayoral election because he wanted to curb the "malicious practice."</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks when asked about a lawsuit he filed in late
May against the doctors -- including Legislator Peter Lin, who is
also a practicing physician.</P>
      <P>Hu said that some of the doctors had tried to contact him through
others, and that they wanted to meet with him to express their
apologies, but because they sought a private rather than a
public meeting -- which he said was against his principle of a
public apology -- he had not accepted the offer.</P>
      <P>"After a long period of deliberation, I think doctors should not
be allowed to use medical records to sway election results again," Hu
said.</P>
      <P>The suit was filed on grounds of infringing upon personal privacy
and a violation of the election and recall law, he said, adding that
even if doctors "happened" to pick up medical records somewhere, they
shouldn't publish them.</P>
      <P>Hu said that accepting the apology is a personal matter, but he
thinks that it is "highly inappropriate for professionals to use
professional knowledge to sway an election's outcome."</P>
      <P>"This is why I've chosen to do something to redress the practice,
instead of acting as a hypocrite," he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin was a member of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP). But he was stripped of his membership
early this year after the hospital he headed was found to have
swindled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the national health
insurance project.</P>
      <P>The doctors unveiled the medical records of Hu, who once had a
minor stroke, at a joint news conference a few days prior to the
mayoral election December 3, 2005, in an attempt to thwart the
re-election bid of the popular mayor from the opposition Kuomintang
by questioning whether he was healthy enough to serve another
four-year term.</P>
      <P>The doctors claimed the medical records were leaked out of
Taichung Veterans Hospital, although none of them work there and it
remains unknown how they gained access to Hu's records.</P>
      <P>Mayor Hu said that doctors at Taichung Veterans General Hospital
are at the top of their field, and that he had no heart to file suit
against them.</P>
      <P>He also didn't know why the medical records were leaked, saying
the question would be left for prosecutors to find out.</P>
      <P>Lin, who originally insisted he had done nothing wrong, later
openly apologized to Hu in an about-face, saying he had been under
tremendous pressure to do so. Hu accepted the apology.</P>

determination to boost national security.</P>
      <P>Flanked by Defense Minister Lee Jye, Chief of General Staff Lee
Tien-yu and Army Commander-General Hu Chen-pu, Chen took "Air Force
One" to Kinmen around 9 a.m. He was then whisked to Kinmen's Shuitou
Port, where he boarded an amphibious speedboat to Tatan -- one of 15
islets that form the Kinmen archipelago.</P>
      <P>Chen inspected troops posted on Tatan Islet, located southwest of
Lieyu Islet (or Little Kinmen) , about 4,400 meters off the White
Stone Battery of China's port city of Xiamen. He last visited Tatan
on May 9, 2002 during his first term, and made the famous "Tatan

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FIRST RICE-TRADING CENTER INAUGURATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first rice-trading center was
inaugurated and began its first day of operations Thursday at the
Agriculture and Food Agency's (AFA) southern regional office in
Tainan City.</P>
      <P>Trading at the new facility will emphasize the quality and safety
of rice, instead of the weight -- the traditional way of rice-trading
on the island, AFA Director-General Huang Yu-tsai said in his address
at the inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>Weight has been key, or sometimes the only reference for traders
to buy crops from growers, while the government guarantees the price
of NT$21 per kilogram of rice as part of efforts to maintain a stable
rice market, Huang explained.</P>
      <P>However, at the new rice-trading center, more information
including type of rice strain, name of grower and safety guarantees
will be available for traders' reference.</P>
      <P>Huang said he expects quality-oriented rice trading to replace
that of weight-oriented trade.</P>
      <P>A rice farmer participating in Thursday's opening expressed
support for the rice center's establishment, a venue where he said he
had gained a profit twice that of the production area.</P>
      <P>The center is the first of four such planned facilities by the
Council of Agriculture, with others to be constructed in Taiwan's
northern, central and eastern regions, respectively.</P>
      <P>Trading at the southern regional rice center will be conducted
once every two weeks, with each grower obliged to auction at least 30
tons of rice, while the bidder has to purchase at least five tons of
rice per bid, according to the Tainan center.</P>
      <P>On the center's first day of operations, a total of 13 trading
transactions were completed, with "dream beauty" rice grown in Houpi
Township, Tainan County, selling at the day's highest price --
NT$160,000 per ton -- or three times that of other brands of
high-quality rice on the market.</P>
      <P>According to the AFA, "dream beauty" is a crop of rice bred under
a contract of Japanese traders. The rice will be exported to Japan in
July and marketed there in small packages.</P>
      <P>It is rare to see rice exported to Japan in small packages from
other rice-producing countries, AFA officials noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTROMAGNETISM IN SHUEHSHAN TUNNEL AT SAFE LEVEL: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) said Thursday that there is nothing to worry about in terms of
the level of electromagnetism in the newly opened Shuehshan Tunnel as
it is far lower than the recommended maximum level.</P>
      <P>EPA officials made the comments to dispel public concern after
drivers found they have no difficulty in using cell phones and radios
while inside the tunnel.</P>
      <P>Addressing speculation that the electromagnetism in the tunnel
could be harmful to the humans, the EPA invited officials from the
independent National Communications Commission and the Cabinet-level
Department of Health to carry out tests in late May.</P>
      <P>The results show that the level of electromagnetism released by the
electric lines under the tunnel and five cell phone base stations
located at the southern and northern ends of the tunnel are
far lower than the recommended maximum level for non-ionization
radiation.</P>
      <P>The 12.9-km Hsuehshan Tunnel, the longest tunnel in Southeast
Asia and the fifth-longest in the world, was officially inaugurated
July 16.</P>
      <P>The tunnel, considered locally as a "construction miracle, " is
the centerpiece of the 55.3-km "Chiang Wei-shui Freeway" linking
Nankang in the northern city of Taipei to Suao in the northeastern
county of Yilan.</P>
      <P>The opening of the freeway to traffic -- after 15 years of
painstaking construction at a cost of more than NT$100 billion
(US$3.11 billion) -- has significantly reduced travel time between
Taipei and Yilan, cutting the travel time between Nankang and Suao to
45 minutes from nearly three hours in the past.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MARKET PARTITIONING' KEY TO SURVIVING CHINA'S COMPETITION: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's machinery industrial sector must
seek "market partitioning" to make a clear distinction between
Taiwan-made and China-made products in order to survive cut-throat
Chinese competition, Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Seeking to churn out high-quality products is actually the other
side of a double-edged strategy to allow Taiwan's machinery industry
to survive fierce competition from China, Hwang said during his
speech delivered at a forum held in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Faced with China's competition, Taiwan's machinery industry can
no longer retain its niche simply by lowering overhead costs and
compromising product quality, Hwang said, adding the industry will
thrive only by producing innovative, high-quality products while
partitioning markets for Taiwan's products from made-in-China
counterparts.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that Taiwan's machinery industry follow suit with
the country's bicyle industry, which has followed an "A-Team"
strategy of using supply-chain competition to improve quality and
developing more innovative products to sharpen the industry's
competitiveness in the global market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION URGES GOVERNMENT TO SECURE CONTROL OVER MEGA HOLDINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang and Minister of
Finance Joseph Lyu should resign if the government loses its majority
to private shareholders in the board election of Mega Financial
Holding Co., legislators of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mega Financial will hold its next board election Friday and there
is concern that the government, as the single largest shareholder
with 22 percent of the shares in the company, might no longer have a
majority eight seats representing government shares on the 15-member
board.</P>
      <P>Legislator Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus,
said at a news conference that if the government fails to secure its
board majority, thus losing operational control over Mega Financial's
NT$2.13 trillion (US$65.23 billion) in capital, the premier and the
finance minister should step down to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Echoing Pan's call, KMT Legislator Alex Fai claimed that if the
number of board members representing government shares should fall
from eight seats to seven in Friday's election, it would mean that
the premier and the finance minister are no longer qualified to
remain in their posts.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao claimed that the election is of great
concern to all the people in Taiwan because if the government loses
its control over Mega Financial, it would represent an average loss
of NT$100,000 to each person.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, James Soong, chairman of the opposition People First
Party (PFP), said if the premier and the finance minister "give up
the government's control" over Mega Financial, it will be tantamount
to their support for what he described as the "corrupt leadership" of
President Chen Shui-bian, who has been accused by the opposition
parties for "fleecing the national treasury" under the guise of
privatizing state-owned banks.</P>
      <P>Soong vowed that the PFP will do everything possible to topple
the Cabinet if the government suffers a defeat in Mega Financial's
board election.</P>
      <P>Mega Financial, Taiwan's second-largest financial service
company, was formed by state-owned Chiao Tung Bank and International
Securities Co. through exchange of shares in 2002 under the
government's financial reform program.</P>
      <P>Chiao Tung Bank Chairman Cheng Shen-chih became chairman of Mega
Financial, supposedly because of his good relationship with Chen,
although he owned fewer than 2 million shares at the time. The
privatization process triggered opposition suspicion that it was a
scheme by the president and the DPP to "fleece the national
treasury."</P>
      <P>According to news reports, Cheng has obtained the support of
Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., which owns 12 percent of the shares
in Mega Financial, and that he appears certain to continue serving as
chairman, even if control of the board falls into the hands of
private shareholders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC SOUNDS ALARM OVER PROGRESS IN U.S.-CHINA MILITARY EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent U.S. invitation for China to
observe its military drill in Guam may have an adverse impact on
Taiwan-U.S. military exchanges in the long-term, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level mainland policy planner was referring to an
invitation extended to China by U.S. Pacific Commander Adm. William
Fallon to send officers to observe the June 17-19 U.S. military
exercise, codenamed "Operation Brave Shield." To the surprise of some
pundits, Chinese Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan accepted the
invitation.</P>
      <P>In its June report on the latest developments in China, the MAC
said the engagement has not only ushered in a new round of U.S.-China
strategic race in the Asia-Pacific but has also created room for
China to impact U.S.-Taiwan military exchanges.</P>
      <P>The event was also seen by major international news media as the
most positive sign of improvement in U.S.-China military relations
since the spy planes standoff over the South China Sea in 2001, the
MAC report said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the U.S. invitation had at least three
strategic purposes -- expanding bilateral military exchanges, hoping
to secure a subsequent invitation from China to observe Chinese
military exercises and gauging each other's military strength through
the exchanges.</P>
      <P>Most China watchers analyzed the U.S. invitation from the
perspective of strategic competition between Beijing and Washington.
Superficially, they said, the United States looked forward to
avoiding conflict with China by enhancing mutual trust through
military exchanges.</P>
      <P>In reality, they said, the United States intended to get a direct
look at China's military prowess and strategic goals, which they
said may contribute to the U.S. evaluation of its East Asia military
restructuring plan and its global strategic goals.</P>
      <P>While the U.S. motives were understandable, the MAC report said,
China's acceptance of the U.S. invitation came as a surprise. Beijing
was fully aware the United States is unlikely to aid China in its
military modernization drive. What the U.S. is concerned about is the
"management" rather than "cooperation" of their security relations,
the report said.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC's analysis, the most important reason behind
China's consent to the U.S. invitation lies in its hope that the
United States will eventually cease military engagements with Taiwan,
including sales of advanced weapons.</P>
      <P>In the past, the report said, the United States has adopted a
"parallel" strategy in dealing with military exchanges with Taiwan
and China. Increased U.S.-China military exchanges might allow China
to tilt the balance, enabling China to have a hand in "manipulating"
Taiwan-U.S. military relations, the report said.</P>
      <P>By all accounts, the report said, the U.S.-China "date" at the
Guam exercise marked an important milestone in their bilateral
military relations, which is worthy of Taiwan's attention and that of
other neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang Chih-heng, a Tamkang University associate
professor, said the presence of Chinese military officers aboard a
U.S. warship to observe a military drill indeed marked a significant
breakthrough in U.S.-China ties.</P>
      <P>Noting the main purpose of the U.S. invitation was to forge
mutual trust, Yang said he believes that such a move has an even
deeper strategic implication by inspiring their respective political
leaders to improve bilateral military relations.</P>
      <P>With the United States deploying its strategic missiles,
submarines and bombers in Guam to reinforce its traditional security
cooperation with Japan, with China as their "hypothetical enemy, "
Yang said China has gained a rare opportunity to observe the latest
U.S. military deployment in Guam by accepting the invitation.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yang said, China can also take advantage of the event
as a form of goodwill gesture to East Asian countries in an effort to
undermine the legitimacy of including the Taiwan Strait situation
into the strategic goals of U.S.-Japan defense cooperation.</P>

Rallied by Bush, Skittish G.O.P. Now Embraces
War as Issue 

Republicans took to the Senate floor
Wednesday to offer an unambiguous embrace of the
Iraq war and to portray Democrats as advocates
of an overly hasty withdrawal that would have
grave consequences for the security of the
United States. That emerging Republican approach
reflects the success of a White House effort to 
bring a skittish party behind President Bush on
the war after months of political ambivalence in
some vocal quarters. As President Bush offered
another defense of his Iraq policy during a
visit to Vienna on Wednesday, Republicans
acknowledged that it was a strategy of
necessity, an effort to turn what some party
leaders had feared could become the party's
greatest liability into an advantage in the
midterm elections.

Wall Street Journal: Burning Oil, Behind
Rise of Iran's President: A Populist Economic
Agenda

Iran's new president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
has grabbed the world's attention with his
bombast over Tehran's nuclear program and saber
rattling against Israel. At home, however, the
president's popularity is soaring thanks to
another reason: his enthusiastic embrace of
economic populism. In recent weeks, he has
proposed a US$4 billion national
school-renovation program and has raised not
only salaries for workers in Iran's vast,
government-controlled industrial sector but also
the minimum wage for everyone else. He doubled
government grants for newlyweds and forced banks
to lower interest rates by several percentage
points. One key to that plan was diversifying an
economy heavily dependent on oil revenues.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DPP FACTION'S '2008 ACTION PLAN' AIMS TO CONTINUE POWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Welfare State faction of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the party Thursday to adopt,
when it meets in July, a "2008 action plan" aimed at continuing the
party's hold on power as party morale has been undermined by a recent
string of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>The plan claims that rallying pro-independence votes and
developing the economy will be key to "re-consolidating the party's
power base."</P>
      <P>The faction, led by former premier Frank Hsieh, called on party
members to "believe in the innocence" of President Chen Shui-bian,
whom the opposition charged is at the "corrupt center" of an
incompetent government, and to support a fair and independent
investigation by judicial authorities into opposition and media
allegations about Chen and the first family.</P>
      <P>The president is facing a recall motion in the legislature, which
is scheduled for a vote on June 27.</P>
      <P>In addition to lambasting opposition parties for "twisting
judicial operations," the faction also accused pro-China media of
collaborating with the opposition to create social unrest, leading
the country toward a political crisis.</P>
      <P>"All DPP members should call on supporters to boycott these scum
media and phase them out of the market so a media environment can be
created that will be favorable to Taiwan's rule of law and democratic
development," said the action plan.</P>
      <P>Before the 2008 presidential election, the DPP will be fighting
in a legislative election next year, so it's time for the party to
create strategies to keep its lead in Taiwan's public opinion, it
added.</P>
      <P>It said "sovereignty" and "development" should be the main themes
of the DPP's 2007 and 2008 campaigns, an appeal that it claimed will
"touch the hearts of the electorate" and help the party retain its
rein on power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN JOBLESS RATE EXPECTED TO FALL BELOW 4 PERCENT FOR 2006</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate is likely to be
controlled under 4 percent for this year, with the highest
single-month figure, which normally occurs in August, expected to top
4.11 percent, an official of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan posted a jobless rate of 3.84 percent in May, marking the
lowest of all May figures for the last six years, said Huang
Chien-chung, who added that the figure was 0.06 percentage points
higher than that posted in April and represented a decline of 0.26
percentage points from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The average unemployment rate of the first five months of this
year also stood at 3.84 percent, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the jobless rate will live up to the
government's expectations that it will not exceed 4 percent for 2006,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate usually climbs month-on-month from May with
the approach of graduation season, reaching its highest point in
August before beginning to decline month-on-month in the latter
months of the year, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Based on these estimates, the unemployment rate in the months
after August is not expected to surpass 4.11 percent per month,
making it possible that the whole-year unemployment rate for 2006
will not be higher than 4.11 percent, Huang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou expressed
dissatisfaction Thursday with a recent list of courteous cities
published by the Reader's Digest magazine, in which Taipei City was
ranked 28th out of the 35 cities evaluated.</P>
      <P>As Taipei is generally considered a "friendly city, " Ma said he
believes that people sometimes have different opinions on "friendly"
or "courteous" due to the culture gap.</P>
      <P>Ma said a writer in Shanghai told him he thought Taipei is a very
friendly city because he was once given directions by a passer-by,
while Lo Chih-cheng, director of the Taipei city government's
Information Department, talked about the culture difference, claiming
that oriental people sometimes pretend that they do not see other
people in trouble on the street "mainly to prevent the awkwardness of
the victims."</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that some people do help those in trouble.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, friendliness and courteousness are sometimes
classified as different things.</P>
      <P>For example, Lo said, offering a seat to an elderly person is
polite, but some old people who don't consider themselves old might
feel offended when offered a seat.</P>
      <P>Lo said he will ask his friends and international civic groups to

      <P>Underprivileged children from around the
country will be entitled to a monthly subsidy of NT$3,000 each
beginning this July to help avoid deaths as a result of child abuse,
the head of the Child Welfare Bureau said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-hsia, director-general of the Child Welfare Bureau under
the Ministry of the Interior, said it is hoped that with the
emergency relief subsidy of NT$3,000 each month, the prospective
beneficiaries will have access to better care, consequently helping
reduce the possibility of deaths caused by child abuse or domestic
violence.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has
agreed to foot the NT$140 million bill for the program, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said, the Executive Yuan has also decided to
allocate some NT$31.5 million to finance local governments in efforts
to hire more social workers to facilitate the child subsidy program.</P>
      <P>Huang said that before the subsidy program is implemented, a
system must be built first -- with the participation of grassroots
offices, schools and social workers -- to find and determine the
prospective beneficiaries for the subsidy.</P>
      <P>Huang said the implementation of the program has become
increasingly urgent, with the number of children dying as a result of
child abuse or being murdered by their suicidal parents increasing
year-on-year.</P>
      <P>A total of 24 children died of child abuse or were killed by
their suicidal parents in the first six months of this year, slightly
higher than the figure posted in the same period of 2005, Huang said,

    <HEADLINE>PFP HEAD TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT ON EVE OF LEGISLATURE'S RECALL VOTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) said he and PFP legislators will sit up through the night
before the Legislative Yuan building on the eve of the legislature's
June 27 vote on a motion seeking to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>James Soong told reporters that he and the PFP lawmakers, along
with PFP supporters, will use the overnight vigil to call on
legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) not to
be "hijacked" by the president and become culprits because of their
support for him.</P>
      <P>The recall motion was introduced by KMT legislators with the
support of their PFP allies after the president refused to step down
amid a series of corruption scandals involving his senior aides and
family members.</P>
      <P>Soong, PFP lawmakers and their supporters have been staging a
four-day sit-in during the daytime at the entrance of the legislature
that will last until June 24 to coincide with a meeting of the
legislature's Committee of the Whole to hear the pros and cons of the
proposed recall of the president.</P>
      <P>According to PFP legislative caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang, the
sit-in is intended to be a moral appeal to the president, the DPP and
its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), "to recover Taiwan's
democratic conscience."</P>
      <P>The recall motion will need a two-thirds majority vote in the
221-seat legislature before the issue can be put to a national
referendum. With the KMT and the PFP holding only a slight majority
in the legislature, they will need the support of at least 36
legislators from the DPP and the TSU for the passage of the motion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST TAIWAN TRADE POLICY REVIEW AT WTO DRAWS TO 'PERFECT END'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first Taiwan trade policy review (TPR)
at the World Trade Organization (WTO) drew to a "perfect end"
Thursday amid thunderous applause from representatives of all member
states.</P>
      <P>Clemens Boonekamp, director of the WTO's TPR department, said
marking the conclusion of a member economy's trade policy review with
such resounding acclaim was unprecedented and extraordinary.</P>
      <P>The acclaim symbolized a mutually beneficial scenario for the WTO
and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Boonekamp said.</P>
      <P>The WTO is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taiwan and China. The first-ever Taiwan trade policy review
since its WTO accession in 2002 got under way a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Given the often rocky cross-strait relations, the WTO Secretariat
had exercised extreme prudence in preparing the two-day session and
many other WTO members had also shown keen interest in the
interaction between the Taiwanese and Chinese representatives. Over
the two days of the review, the two "rivals" had more than 30 minutes
of direct dialogue in which the two sides showed self-restraint,
allowing the session to proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>Boonekamp credited Republic of China Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Chen Ruey-long and Li Enheng, China's deputy permanent
representative at the WTO, for the successful completion of the
review.</P>
      <P>The success proves the maturity of the WTO's multilateral
mechanism, Boonekamp said, adding that the WTO framework can
satisfactorily handle trade and economic affairs between political
rivals. Analysts said Boonekamp also played a crucial role in
ensuring the smooth proceeding of the review, having twice visited
Taiwan in preparation. He has never hesitated to acknowledge that
political disputes are the thorniest part of the Taiwan trade policy
review.</P>
      <P>Knowing the delicacy of cross-strait ties, most WTO members
welcome positive and healthy interaction between Taiwan and China
under the WTO mechanism. Japan's representative at the session
praised the session as a great success.</P>
      <P>WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy also attended the session to
show his concern.</P>
      <P>WTO officials said Li exercised great self-restraint during the
session. He asked the Salvadoran ambassador to respect WTO
regulations only after the latter repeatedly mentioned Taiwan's
official national title "Republic of China" during the session. El
Salvador is the ROC's diplomatic ally and Taiwan's official
designation in the WTO is the "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."</P>
      <P>Asked whether the trade policy review has any positive
significance in cross-strait interaction, Li said none of the WTO
trade policy review has ever been found to have a negative impact.</P>
      <P>As to whether the trade policy review had set a model for future
cross-strait interaction in the WTO, no WTO officials would make a
forecast. They just said they have noticed that China has no
intention to negotiate with Taiwan at the moment over Taiwan's import
ban more than 2,200 kinds of Chinese products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA SETS FIVE STRATEGIES FOR LOCAL PRODUCTION OF POLY-CRYSTAL SILICON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(by Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has
mapped out five main strategies to boost the development of the local
photovoltaic industry, an MOEA official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The strategies were outlined during a Tuesday meeting of
government officials, industry executives and academics, presided
over by Economic Affairs Minister Hwang Ing-San.</P>
      <P>The MOEA official said Taiwan's solar energy industry has
expanded rapidly in recent years -- from a production value of NT$1.2
billion (US$36 million) in 2003 to NT$3.35 billion in 2004 and NT$7
billion in 2005, registering an estimated value of NT$10 billion for
this year.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that growth has been impeded by a shortage of
raw materials -- 98 percent of Taiwan's poly-crystal silicon supply
relies on foreign countries. He added that the key to the industry's
future development is to raise the percentage of that supply that is
produced domestically.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, the five strategies are: introducing
Siemens' conventional production technology, introducing the refining
production technology of Siemens, seeking a technology transfer from
the Russian Academy of Science, inviting retired German researchers
and developing local metallurgy techniques.</P>
      <P>The official estimated that local production capacity of
poly-crystal silicon should be sufficient for a solar cell production
of 100 megawatts in 2010, while the production capacity will expand
from this year's 355 megawatts to 745 megawatts in 2008.</P>

motive is one who breaks up one of the greatest ties in the
foundation of society. A good and wise man, on the other hand, who
enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to be
right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is
well aware of that."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>COA URGES HOG, FOWL FARMS TO SET UP NETS TO PROTECT AGAINST AVIAN FLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) urged
operators of hog and fowl farms Friday to set up nets before the end
of the year with government subsidies to prevent the outbreak of
avian flu.</P>
      <P>Officials from COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine said that starting from Jan.1, 2007, any hog and fowl
farms that have not set up nets will be fined between NT$10,000 and
NT$50,000 (US$306-US$1,530).</P>
      <P>If the hogs or fowl on those farms have to be culled due to avian
flu infection, the government will not compensate the farmers for
their losses, the officials added.</P>
      <P>They noted that although Taiwan is not an avian flu-affected
country, it is on the migratory route of many birds. This, coupled
with its geographic proximity to China, where the problem of bird flu
is serious, means that Taiwan can't let down its guard.</P>
      <P>With the recent reports of avian flu in many countries, Taiwan
still has to be on alert against its possible onslaught. All hog and
fowl farms should set up the nets as soon as possible, the officials
urged.</P>
      <P>The bureau provided subsidies to 1,748 hog farms and 1,275 fowl
farms to set up nets on a trial basis last year.</P>

amount of Sogo Department Store gift vouchers given by a businessman.</P>
      <P>Huang was swamped by reporters and cameras upon arrival at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport as his whereabouts had been unknown

month and had departed Taiwan for the United States for health
reasons in early June.</P>

Taipei earlier as they saw it as necessary after gathering further
evidence related to the case.</P>

framework since late 2002.</P>
      <P>Chinese officials to the WTO confirmed that the talks were held
Wednesday, during which both sides expressed their respective
positions on the issue.</P>
      <P>During the negotiations, Chinese representatives made clear to
Taiwan that China is opposed to Taiwan's plan to impose safeguard
measures against towel imports from China because they are
"discriminatory" but that it can accept the anti-dumping measures
adopted by Taiwan, sources said.</P>
      <P>On April 25, Taiwan's WTO delegation officially requested
negotiations with the Chinese delegation on the issue and notified
the Chinese delegation of Taiwan's plan to impose safeguard import
duties based upon the quantity on China-made towels.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, the import duties will be NT$42 per
kilogram in the first year, NT$32 per kilogram in the second year and
NT$20 per kilogram in the third year.</P>
      <P>If the measures are adopted, Taiwan will become the seventh WTO
member to take safeguard measures against another member state after
the United States, Peru, India, Canada, Columbia and Turkey.</P>
      <P>From June 1, Taiwan has imposed a provisional anti-dumping tax on
towel imports from China, with the tax rates registering up to 237.7
percent.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan sent a Ministry of Finance official to China last
week to investigate whether two Chinese towel makers have sold their
products to Taiwan at prices far lower than market value, marking
Taiwan's first anti-dumping visit to China under the WTO framework.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO PUSH FOR DOMESTIC CONSULTATIONS, CROSS-STRAIT PEACE TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
he will push for domestic political consultations as well as for
peace talks with the other side of the Taiwan Strait after the
legislative vote on the recall motion against him next week.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving Mohammed A.R.
Galadari, head of the Khaleej Times, a major newspaper in the United
Arab Emirates.</P>
      <P>President Chen, facing a recall motion initiated by the
opposition in the wake of a series of corruption allegations against
Chen's son-in-law and close associates, said he has been thinking
about the issue of "where Taiwan should go" after next Tuesday's vote
on the recall motion.</P>
      <P>The recall motion is seen as unlikely to gain the required vote
of two-thirds of all the legislators as the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First Party only maintains
a slim majority in the 221-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>The president said that Taiwan must first ensure domestic
stability before a cross-strait peace is possible.</P>
      <P>He also said that the world has invested US$560 billion in China
and that according to a U.S. estimate, half of that total has
come from Taiwan. Even more conservative estimates put the amount of
Taiwan investment in China at 30 percent of the total overseas
investment there.</P>
      <P>Chen reaffirmed that Taiwan must maintain its economic
independence, saying that China should not be "the only, the last and
the whole market" of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMICS PUSH FOR ETHICS EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of academics condemned the failure
of the 10-year-old educational reform as a "wavering monster" that
has left Taiwan youths unhappier than before.</P>
      <P>Members of the Education Rebuilding Link and the Taiwan
Provincial Education Association jointly called a news conference in
Taipei Friday to voice their views on what they call the failure of
the ongoing educational reform, which they said has not helped the
country's youths lead a happier life as originally expected. Instead,
they said, the educational reform has only brought a heavier burden
to the young.</P>
      <P>The academics complained that over the past several years,
changes to entrance exam systems have only benefited the rich while
vocational and apprentice education have been disregarded. They added
that the gaps between the rich and poor and between cities and rural
areas have grown even wider and that ethics education has been
neglected.</P>
      <P>Professor Lin Huo-wang from National Taiwan University said the
utilitarianism values that have been prevalent in Taiwan society have
not subsided a bit because of the educational reform. On the
contrary, he said, today's youths strive to study only for the
purpose of seeking better jobs when they finish their education.</P>
      <P>Without ethics education, he said, the youths have only become
"test machines with animal impulses."</P>
      <P>Lin argued that education and training are different. He noted
that education allows youths to make preparations for leading a happy
life, enables them to perceive the meaning of a happy life, and
teaches them that wealth does not necessarily lead to happiness.</P>
      <P>On how ethics education should be promoted, Lin said that first,
the Taiwan people should know what kind of ethics should be built
into Taiwan society. Taiwan is a free society, and in a free society,
people should be educated to tolerate different opinions, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou will visit the Legislative Yuan next Tuesday to monitor
a vote on recalling President Chen Shui-bian, KMT spokeswoman Cheng
Lee-wen said Friday at the party headquarters.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, more than 5,000 supporters will show up
outside the Legislative Yuan that day to display their support for
the opposition's demand for Chen's ouster "to rebuild a clean
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will also hold a
news conference to explain the party's stance after the presidential
recall vote is held next Tuesday, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to solicit greater public backing to that end, the KMT
will organize two large rallies Saturday and Sunday in Kaohsiung and
Taipei, respectively, Cheng said, adding that both Ma and opposition
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong will also attend the
two activities to get together with their "pan-blue alliance"
supporters.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the June 27 presidential recall vote, Ma and KMT
lawmakers will light "sky lanterns" on the square in front of the
Legislative Yuan to pray for Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>Despite the opposition "pan-blue alliance's" efforts to boot out
Chen and hold him accountable for a spate of corruption allegations
involving his family and close aides, the presidential recall motion
stands a little chance of passing the Legislative Yuan as the vote
requires a two-thirds majority approval and the "pan-blue alliance"
holds only a slim legislative majority.</P>
      <P>Soong has repeatedly said that PFP lawmakers will seek to topple
the Cabinet if the presidential recall vote fails at the Legislative
Yuan in order to further pressure Chen to step down.</P>
      <P>In response to the "pan-blue" attempts to oust Chen, the
president clarified his position regarding the many corruption
scandals in a televised speech Tuesday in which he denied any
wrongdoing by himself or by his wife.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) has reiterated its limitations on the use of polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in anything other than flame retardants, due
to the hazardous effects of PBDEs on humans, an EPA spokesman said
Friday.</P>
      <P>PDBEs are widely use in making fire-resistant plastics and
fabrics. When exposed to flames or high heat, PDBEs release bromines
that absorb oxygen in the air to slow or stop the fire. During the
process, however, endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as brominated
dioxin and benzofuran are produced, which pose a health threat to
humans.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the EPA registered Octa-brominated
diphenyl ether and Penta-BDE as class I hazardous chemicals last
December, while Deca-BDE was categorized as a class IV hazardous
chemical in 1999. He added that the EPA still allows the use of PBDEs
in flame retardants, but said local makers should start using
non-brominated substitutes as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, brominated flame retardants comprise 36
percent of global flame retardant products and 450 tons of PBDEs are
used annually in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office produced Friday
receipts of gift vouchers it purchased between 2003 and 2006 in an
attempt to dispel doubts about the source of the vouchers.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, displayed the receipts after an opposition legislator
questioned their source the previous day.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Sun Ta-chien said President Chen Shui-bian
and first lady Wu Shu-jen started to offer Sogo gift vouchers as draw
prizes at the year-end gatherings of the Presidential Office in 2003
-- the year the ownership of the department store changed -- and
demanded clarification from the Presidential Office on the source of
the vouchers. Wu is embroiled in the "Sogo voucher" controversy.</P>
      <P>Cho claimed that Sun's accusation was groundless and not worthy
of response, but "because the public wants answers, " he located the
invoices of the Presidential Office' s purchase of gift vouchers from
various department stores between 2003 and 2006.</P>
      <P>Cho said this is the first time the Presidential Office has
publicly displayed receipts, although it is only required to produce
them when the Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, asks
for an audit.</P>
      <P>He said that in the past, rumors were always rampant in the last

recall motion will be put to a vote in the Legislative Yuan next
Tuesday, "the same thing has happened."</P>
      <P>He said he expected "more sensational revelations will come out

      <P>Noting that Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez Reyna
will visit Taiwan at the end of this month, he said the Presidential
Office staff were forced to put their preparations on hold to look
for the invoices, which he claimed was a "terrible waste of time and
personnel."</P>
      <P>President Chen Sui-bian, in a televised report June 20, said that
the first lady had not "directly" received gift vouchers from the
department store and that the first family had not interfered in an

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) released
Friday a checklist to help the public evaluate on their own the
possibility of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Ministry statistics show that 68 percent of domestic violence
cases reported in Taiwan occur in relationships between married
couples, cohabiting couples or girlfriends and boyfriends.</P>
      <P>The checklist uses a scale of 1 to 12 for the evaluation, with
0-1 indicating a green light, 2-5 indicating a yellow light and 6-12
indicating a red light.</P>
      <P>The questions on the checklist include: "Are you required to
inform your partners of all your expenses, your activities with
friends and your whereabouts? " "Are you tired of communication
failure with your partner? " and "Have you had enough of certain
behavior from your partner?"</P>
      <P>According to Lin Tzu-ling, executive secretary of the MOI's
Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention Committee, if "yes"
is the answer for all three questions, it could point to trouble.</P>
      <P>If the result of the evaluation is a green light, it will mean
that the respondent's relationship with his or her partner is not in
trouble, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>She claimed that a yellow light means there is tension or
conflict in the relationship and that problems are likely to worsen
if they are not dealt with properly.</P>
      <P>A red light means the relationship is tense, with violence and
conflict likely to have existed for a period of time, she went on,
urging respondents with this problem to seek professional support or
ring the 113 hotline for assistance.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said that although the Domestic
Violence Prevention Act has been enacted for eight years, it remains
a common mentality among people in Taiwan that "domestic violence is
a family affair. "</P>
      <P>If the public can detect the crisis of domestic violence in their
relationships early and seek professional assistance, they will be
able to prevent the occurrence of serious conflict, Lee said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-BLUE' SAID INSTIGATING STUDENT MOVEMENT TO PUSH RECALL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has been
instigating a student movement to facilitate the party's scheme to
recall President Chen Shui-bian, a legislative party whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh Yi-chin, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT and the People First Party has pulled out all the stops to
incite a student movement "without the students' knowledge."</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" is pushing to recall Chen, believing his
leadership ability is in doubt in the wake of a spate of corruption
allegations implicating members of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>Yeh accused the "pan-blue" camp of instigating students from
National Taiwan University (NUT) to first stage an 80-hour sit-in,
beginning Saturday, even though the NUT final term exams are on.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kao Chih-pen said an NUT professor, who is one of
the researchers of a KMT think-tank, has mobilized NUT students to
take part in the planned sit-in, while Lin Yi-shish, head of the KMT
Youth League, is championing an island wide petition to push for
Chen's recall.</P>
      <P>Kao described the KMT Youth League as "a wolf in sheep's
clothing, " claiming that the KMT group is maneuvering a political
struggle in the guise of a student movement.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Pi-ling claimed that a student movement,
which according to her "serves as a social trailblazer, " should be
"pure, spontaneous and able to create core values of society."</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, she claimed, NTU student Wang Chen-ya, who the
"pan blue alliance says is organizing the sit-in has denied his
involvement "on the Internet."</P>
      <P>"Shameful" is not a word strong enough to condemn the "pan-blue"
people, who have "impersonated" Wang for their scheme, Kuan claimed.</P>
      <P>Kuan said NTU President Lee Si-chen should, on behalf of the
institute and its students, speak out to condemn the shameful
politicians for scheming the sit-in in Wang's name.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, NTU Secretary-General Fu Li-cheng said that NTU
students have long played a key role in student movements in Taiwan's
contemporary history.</P>
      <P>Fu claimed that Saturday's sit-in -- titled "Calling for
political conscience, president leaving office temporarily" -- is a
"spontaneous activity, " adding that the NTU authorities choose to
remain "neutral" on the matter, pointing out that the Constitution
also empowers students with freedom of speech and the right to
assembly and association.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, KMT Youth League Director Lin Yi-shih, an incumbent
KMT legislator, claimed that no movements conducted by university
students can be "maneuvered" by any individual or political party.
"The movement will not be recognized unless it is staged by the
students spontaneously," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Lin told the ruling DPP legislative caucus not to "intimidate"
the students and not to label the "pan-blue alliance" for no reason.</P>

      <P>It will cost the average person 9.5 year's
income to buy a house in Taipei, according the results of a survey
released Friday by the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The survey, undertaken by a private firm for the council, found

      <P>The confidence index for house prices rose by 7.97 points to
107.12 in the first quarter of this year, indicating a prevailing
optimism among potential buyers about rising house prices.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that mortgage payments account for 41

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of the legislative caucus of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday that
politicians who make unfounded accusations against other political
figures should step down.</P>
      <P>They were referring to accusations made by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Chiu Yi that President Chen Shui-bian's wife Wu
Shu-jen received gift vouchers from Pacific Sogo Department Store
worth millions of dollars as a gift for her settlement in an
ownership battle over the store.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Sun Ta-chien claimed further that the president
and the first lady used the Sogo gift vouchers as lucky draw gifts
for employees of the Presidential Office at festivals. Chiu also
demanded an explanation from the Presidential Office of the source of
the Sogo vouchers.</P>
      <P>In response, Chou Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, showed receipts for the vouchers Friday as
evidence to rebut Sun's accusations.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-chun, a DPP legislative caucus whip, noted that the

      <P>Another political storm seems to be brewing
over the Presidential Office and first family after an Australian
resident of Taiwanese origin said Thursday that her cousin had taken
all her receipts from a Taipei hotel from 2000 to 2005 and given them
to first lady Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Ligi Lee, a resident of Australia, is the owner of Taipei-based
Taiwan Ang Co., which markets a series of products featuring the
peachy pink color -- a symbol of festivity to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She told TV reporters that her cousin Lee Bi-chun, chairwoman of
Shinlin Sinseng Pharmaceutical Co., had taken all her purchase
receipts from Grand Hyatt Taipei Hotel over the past five years, with
an aggregate total of some NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>She said that when asked about the purpose of asking for the
receipts, her cousin replied that they would be given to the first
lady.</P>
      <P>Legislators of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) now want to
find out whether the Presidential Office used any of those receipts
to embezzle public funds meant for state affairs.</P>
      <P>The KMT's legislative caucus has formally requested the Ministry
of Audit under the Control Yuan to supply the Presidential Office's
expenditure records from the past five years.</P>
      <P>In its letter to the Ministry of Audit, the KMT caucus says
opposition legislators are exercising their right to review files and
documents according to law in order to clarify whether the
Presidential Office engaged in forgery or embezzlement of public
funds.</P>
      <P>President Chen has been under mounting pressure to step down over
a series of corruption scandals involving his senior aides and
members of his family. His son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, is implicated
in at least six alleged corruption cases.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will vote on a motion June 27 seeking to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has not delayed the
procedure of adjusting its long-stalled arms procurement package
based on the Legislative Yuan's opinions, Cabinet spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said Friday in response to an accusation by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou expressed doubt over the Executive Yuan's June
14 approval of a defense ministry-proposed draft provisional act
governing crucial national defense investment, claiming that the
consent came too late for the legislature to place the draft bill on
the agenda for its June 13-30 extra session.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan decided the agenda June 12 and the arms
procurement bill was not listed.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" headed by the KMT, which
strongly opposed the government's original NT$610.8 billion arms
procurement package, has been accused of "not caring" about national
security after failing to have the legislature place the new draft
bill on the agenda for its ongoing extra session.</P>
      <P>The draft bill will allow for appropriation of a budget of NT$6.3
billion for four projects aimed at enhancing military power.</P>
      <P>The budget was proposed to finance the following projects:
constructing a runway for cargo aircraft on the remote,
Taiwan-controlled Taiping Island in an effort to safeguard the lives
and property of Taiwanese operating in the South China Sea; engaging
in a review of a project to buy diesel-electric submarines; replacing
outdated anti-submarine equipment; and upgrading the capability of
the Patriot missile systems.</P>
      <P>Ma asked Su to offer the public an explanation for the "delay" in
submitting the new draft bill for legislative review.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the arms procurement bill has been put off at the
legislature for a long time, blaming the "pan blue alliance" for
continually blocking the bill from being placed on the legislature
agenda.</P>
      <P>Calling for a "rational dialogue" between the ruling and

month last year, according to statistics released by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) Friday.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said the growth was due to an increasing global
demand for consumer electronic products, panels, communication,
petrochemicals and steel products.</P>
      <P>Among the different industries, the production index of the

index (IPI) stood at 142.44 in May, a year-on-year growth of 8.6
percent, and the IPI for the first five months registered 134.76, a
growth of 7.88 percent over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's short-term exports will continue growing due
to the strong global demand for information and electronic products,
the officials said this will boost the manufacturing production index

Under a secret Bush administration program

involving thousands of Americans and others in
the United States, according to government and

Wall Street Journal: Hidden Burden,

There's a twist to some big companies'
pension situation -- while reducing, freezing or
eliminating pensions for workers, the executives
are building up ever-bigger pensions, causing
the companies' financial obligations for them to
balloon. Companies disclose little about any of 
this. But a Wall Street Journal analysis of

      <P>The 105 professors, whose names appeared at the end of the joint

    <TEXT>
      <P>The partially state-owned Mega Financial
Holding Co. remained under government control Friday after an
apparent maneuver by the Cabinet turned unfavorable results in a
board of directors election to its advantage.</P>
      <P>Holding 22.78 percent of Mega Financial's shares, the government
managed to capture only seven seats and lost its majority on the
15-member board, including seven representing private shareholders
and one independent member.</P>
      <P>However, at a meeting held after the election, the new board
re-elected Cheng Shen-chih as chairman, which was followed by
resignations of the independent board member and another member
representing private shareholders, leaving the government's seven
seats in control of the 13-member board.</P>
      <P>A by-election to fill the two vacancies is impossible without
approval by two-thirds of board members.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the new development, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said
the Cabinet is "not entirely satisfied" with the results, although it
had achieved its goal.</P>
      <P>She added that the Cabinet will closely supervise future

Tseng-chang and Minister of Finance Joseph Lyu, who had faced
pressure from opposition legislators to step down if the government
should lose its operational control over Mega Financial's NT$2.13
trillion (US$65.23 billion) in capital.</P>
      <P>Mega Financial, Taiwan's second largest financial service
company, was formed by state-owned Chiao Tung Bank and International

    <HEADLINE>MAC CALLS FOR MORE CROSS-STRAIT RELIGIOUS EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should expand religious exchanges
with China as part of efforts to maintain peace across the Taiwan
Strait, a group of advisers to the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the council's monthly consultation meeting, the MAC
advisers said the government should adopt an "open-door" policy
toward cross-strait religious exchanges because such engagements
would foster friendship among people on both sides and contribute
toward maintaining cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>With robust religious freedom and diverse religions, the advisers
said, Taiwan has many advantages in promoting the bilateral religious
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The advisers said the exchanges should not be confined to
organizing pilgrimage tours of historic Buddhist and Taoist temples
in China.</P>
      <P>In future, the advisers said, the two sides should strengthen
exchanges and cooperation in theological studies and promote core
values and scriptures of many religions. By doing so, they said, the
two sides will not only learn from each other's strengths, but China
will be less likely to use traditional religious activities -- such
as Buddhist and Taoist programs -- to boost its "unification" drive.</P>
      <P>As a countermeasure, the advisers suggested that Taiwan's
flourishing Christian and Catholic groups play a more active role in
promoting the exchanges, including inviting more Chinese Christians
and Catholics to visit Taiwan to boost mutual understanding and
trust.</P>
      <P>On promoting China's religious freedom, the advisers said Taiwan
can play diverse roles. For instance, they said, local universities
can invite Chinese professors in various religious fields to visit
Taiwan, or co-sponsor seminars on religious themes with foreign
groups and invite Chinese scholars to attend.</P>
      <P>Such exchanges are expected to help enhance Taiwan's influence on
China's religious organizations, they said. Given China's strict
control of religious activities, the advisers said cross-strait
religious exchanges should focus more on humanitarianism themes and
avoid controversial issues.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "In the conduct of government there
are five good principles to be kept in mind and respected. First, to
benefit the people without wasting the resources of the country;
secondly, to encourage labor without giving cause for complaint;
thirdly, to desire for the enjoyments of life without being covetous;
fourthly, to be dignified without being supercilious; fifthly, to
inspire awe without being severe."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CALLS FOR MORE CROSS-STRAIT RELIGIOUS EXCHANGES(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should expand religious exchanges
with China as part of efforts to maintain peace across the Taiwan
Strait, a group of advisers to the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the council's monthly consultation meeting, the MAC
advisers said the government should adopt an "open-door" policy
toward cross-strait religious exchanges because such engagements
would foster friendship among people on both sides and contribute
toward maintaining cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>With robust religious freedom and diverse religions, the advisers
said, Taiwan has many advantages in promoting the bilateral religious
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The advisers said the exchanges should not be confined to
organizing pilgrimage tours of historic Buddhist and Taoist temples
in China.</P>
      <P>In future, the advisers said, the two sides should strengthen
exchanges and cooperation in theological studies and promote core
values and scriptures of many religions. By doing so, they said, the
two sides will not only learn from each other's strengths, but China
will be less likely to use traditional religious activities -- such
as Buddhist and Taoist programs -- to boost its "unification" drive.</P>
      <P>As a countermeasure, the advisers suggested that Taiwan's
flourishing Christian and Catholic groups play a more active role in
promoting the exchanges, including inviting more Chinese Christians
and Catholics to visit Taiwan to boost mutual understanding and
trust.</P>
      <P>On promoting China's religious freedom, the advisers said Taiwan
can play diverse roles. For instance, they said, local universities
can invite Chinese professors in various religious fields to visit
Taiwan, or co-sponsor seminars on religious themes with foreign
groups and invite Chinese scholars to attend.</P>
      <P>Such exchanges are expected to help enhance Taiwan's influence on
China's religious organizations, they said. Given China's strict
control of religious activities, the advisers said cross-strait
religious exchanges should focus more on humanitarianism themes and
avoid controversial issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT RETAINS CONTROL OVER MEGA HOLDINGS(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The partially state-owned Mega Financial
Holding Co. remained under government control Friday after an
apparent maneuver by the Cabinet turned unfavorable results in a
board of directors election to its advantage.</P>
      <P>Holding 22.78 percent of Mega Financial's shares, the government
managed to capture only seven seats and lost its majority on the
15-member board, including seven representing private shareholders
and one independent member.</P>
      <P>However, at a meeting held after the election, the new board
re-elected Cheng Shen-chih as chairman, which was followed by
resignations of the independent board member and another member
representing private shareholders, leaving the government's seven
seats in control of the 13-member board.</P>
      <P>A by-election to fill the two vacancies is impossible without
approval by two-thirds of board members.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the new development, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said
the Cabinet is "not entirely satisfied" with the results, although it
had achieved its goal.</P>
      <P>She added that the Cabinet will closely supervise future
developments involving Mega Financial Holding Co. and safeguard the
public's interest in the financial institution.</P>
      <P>Tsai stressed that the government will be in full control of Mega
Financial for at least the next three years.</P>
      <P>The dramatic turn of events dissolved a crisis for Premier Su
Tseng-chang and Minister of Finance Joseph Lyu, who had faced
pressure from opposition legislators to step down if the government
should lose its operational control over Mega Financial's NT$2.13
trillion (US$65.23 billion) in capital.</P>
      <P>Mega Financial, Taiwan's second largest financial service
company, was formed by state-owned Chiao Tung Bank and International
Securities Co. through an exchange of shares in 2002 under the
government's financial reform program.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who serves concurrently as chairman of Chiao Tung Bank,
announced after the board meeting that when Chiao Tung Bank is merged
with the Internal Commercial Bank of China Aug. 21, he will no longer
be the chairman of the expanded entity.</P>
      <P>Cheng also assured that he will not allow Chinatrust Financial
Holding Co. to buy Mega Financial in the next three years.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust has increased its shares in Mega Financial from 12
percent to 15 percent in recent months and is reportedly aiming to
eventually take it over.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June  23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 professors from Taiwan's
universities placed an advertisement in two major newspapers Friday,
urging President Chen Shui-bian to step down because they claimed he
no longer has the people's trust and is incapable of carrying out his
constitutional duties.</P>
      <P>The 105 professors, whose names appeared at the end of the joint
statement, urged the president to "be responsible to the people" and
step down gracefully in order to "set a good political example."</P>
      <P>They said in the statement that as intellectuals, they firmly
believe the moral integrity of a chief of state must be beyond
question.</P>
      <P>However, they continued, President Chen is not only unable to
offer a reasonable explanation for why some senior aides and family
members have been involved in a series of corruption scandals, but
also lacks the ability to reflect upon himself and his
administration.</P>
      <P>The professors added that Chen's "unfit" conduct has "violated
the basic moral conscience" of Taiwan's people and has "confused
Taiwan society's system of simple values."</P>
      <P>Therefore, they concluded, Chen should resign his post as chief
of state as soon as possible and set a good example for the benefit
of solidifying Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>In reaction to the joint statement, legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) dismissed it as an appeal by
professors who are supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" of the
opposition Kuomintang and People First Party.</P>
      <P>As a rebuttal, several of the professors told reporters the 105
endorsements in the joint statement comprise professors of all
political persuasions, including DPP supporters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirteen pro-Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Taiwanese groups in the United States called on the opposition
Friday to stop their political struggle against the ruling party "to
sustain Taiwan's development."</P>
      <P>In a joint statement, the groups, led by the U.S. east coast
branches of the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union,
expressed concern over the political turmoil marked by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) -led campaign to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The groups said they are deeply saddened by the scandals
allegedly involving Chen's son-in-law and understand the doubts and
criticism that Taiwan society has against the government following
this and a spate of other corruption scandals involving other members
of Chen's family and his close aides.</P>
      <P>They said that while they support the investigation by the
judicial authorities into the scandals, the "arbitrary revelations"
by the Taiwan media of "unverified" information concerning the cases
and the opposition's taking advantage of the situation to create
political struggle are worrying.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the revelations have violated the principle of
secret investigation and have seriously undermined the public's trust
in the judiciary, they urged those who have engaged in such
activities to stop interfering in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>They said the media should play the role of the fourth estate
impartially to uphold justice, instead of creating social unrest and
disturbance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they called on the ruling party to show the public its
courage and sincerity in self-examination and urged the opposition to
stop their struggle against the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, officials at the KMT's New York Youth League claimed
that integrity is a basic requirement for politicians and that the
people should judge politicians with the highest of moral standards.</P>
      <P>They urged Chen to resign to "save social costs" and called on
civil servants in Taiwan to remain neutral and responsible in
performing their duties.</P>
      <P>A petition launched by the youth league calling for Chen's ouster
has won the support of 742 Taiwanese expatriates in the United
States, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun is planning to visit the leaders of the two main
opposition parties after a June 27 legislative vote on a motion to
recall President Chen Shui-bian, a DPP official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang, the DPP will try to
stabilize the situation after the political turmoil and hopes that
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong will take part in inter-party
dialogue to be promoted by Chen.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Chen said he will push for political consultations
with the opposition and peace talks with China after the June 27
vote, which was initiated by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the KMT and PFP in the wake of a spate of corruption allegations
involving the first family and Chen's close aides.</P>
      <P>If more than two-thirds of the legislators vote in favor of it,
the motion will then be put to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>However, with the "pan-blue alliance" controlling only a slim
majority in the legislature, the odds of the motion passing the
legislature are believed to be slim.</P>
      <P>Local media reports have said the "pan-blue alliance" might
initiate a second campaign to recall Chen if it fails to push through
the motion next week.</P>
      <P>Responding to the reports, Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the KMT
legislative caucus, refused to confirm if there is a plan for a
second recall campaign and stressed that the KMT's priority at
present is to make sure the motion passes the legislature next week
so that the people can decide on whether the president should be
unseated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Up to 80.5 percent of the respondents to a
recent poll said law and order have not improved at all over the past
three months, according to the results of a poll released by the
non-profit Institute for National Policy Research (INPR) Saturday.</P>
      <P>The INRR published the poll results on public feelings on law and
order for the third time since Premier Su Tseng-chang vowed in March
to step down if the public do not perceive a marked improvement in
law and order within six months.</P>
      <P>Overall, however, public satisfaction with law and order has
risen dramatically, climbing to 29.9 percent compared to 15.89
percent in the first survey.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the public faith in the Executive Yuan's
declaration to improve law and order has declined. In the first
survey, those who said social order has improved totaled 27.16
percent. The figure dropped to 16.9 percent in the latest survey,
even lower than 22.53 percent in the second survey.</P>
      <P>INPR officials said the conflicting figures seem to reflect the
fact that the public do not harbor high expectations for the
current social order and are worried about the government's
determination to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>The officials said that on law and order issues that have
surfaced over the past month, attempted fraud is considered the most
serious problem in all three surveys, with more than 80 percent of
the respondents having been targeted by scammers.</P>
      <P>The respondents are also more concerned about problems with
substandard food products than about collection of debts through
violent methods.</P>
      <P>The INPR commissioned Master Survey &amp; Research Co. to conduct the
survey by telephone June 16-17. A total of 1,078 effective samples
were collected with a margin of error of around 3 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed to hold
political consultations at home and engage in peaceful talks with the
other side of Taiwan Strait, while "confessing" to a Buddhist master
Saturday for his lack of wisdom in governing the country.</P>
      <P>According to Chou Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, Chen visited Buddhist Master Sheng Yen, founder
of Dharma Drum Mountain, earlier in the day to confess that due to
his lack of wisdom and mercy, society has been full of confrontations
during his mandate of the last six years.</P>
      <P>Expressing hope that Master Sheng Yen can use his religious
wisdom to help lead the country toward happiness, Chen vowed to
engage in domestic political consultations and cross-strait talks for
the welfare of the country and cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although he cannot meet with Master Sheng Yen
every day, he has the master's calligraphy hanging in his office. The
calligraphy reads: "Mercy will have no enemy, wisdom will cause no
trouble."</P>
      <P>Chen is embroiled in several corruption allegations implicating
his son-in-law and close aides and is facing an opposition-proposed
motion for a referendum to recall him over the corruption allegations
and his incompetence.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan official urged the United

(FTA) with Taiwan, which she described as the most valuable gateway
for U.S. small- and medium-sized businesses to make inroads into the
Asian market.</P>
      <P>Addressing the annual conference of the Taiwan Chambers of
Commerce of North America, ROC Minister without Portfolio Ho Mei-yueh
said the establishment of a Taiwan-U.S. FTA would be advantageous to
the United States because it would create a lot of business
opportunities for U.S. businesses.</P>
      <P>While it would not be a problem for large U.S. businesses to
enter the Chinese market, small- and medium-sized businesses need a
reliable partner like Taiwan to enter the Asian market, Ho claimed.</P>
      <P>Ho said Taiwan is the United States' best trading partner and its
best friend in Asia, with Taiwan being a major destination of U.S.
exports including corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, chemicals, plastics,

    <HEADLINE>DRAFT LAW ON INDOOR AIR QUALITY CONTROL UNVEILED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
unveiled Saturday a draft law aiming at controlling the indoor air
quality of public establishments and office buildings.</P>
      <P>The draft law stipulates that the concentrations of pollutants
such as carbon dioxide, suspended particulates, volatile organics and
bacteria in indoor environments must not exceed the EPA-recommended
levels for indoor air.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh Fang-lu, a section chief from the EPA's
Department of Air Quality Protection and Noise Control, as people
spend 80 percent to 90 percent of their time indoors every day, the
quality of indoor air directly affects the quality and efficiency of
their work, as well as their health.</P>
      <P>Research indicates that people can display symptoms such as
drowsiness, itchy eyes and dry throat after staying for long periods
in an indoor environment where the air quality is bad, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that after the law is enacted, it will apply to public
establishments first before expanding to other facilities.</P>
      <P>Violators will be subject to fines of up to NT$25,000 (US$765)
and will be required to make improvements. Until the situation is
improved, prominent signs should be set up at the entrance of the
buildings to warn the public of the air quality inside, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>She said the draft law will be submitted to the Cabinet for
review soon and is likely to be included in the Legislative Yuan's
agenda for the next session set to start in September.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental protection group expressed
anger Saturday after police said they would crack down on a nude
event planned for next Monday to highlight opposition to the Fourth
Nuclear Power Plant in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The group was responding to an earlier warning by the police, who
said that according to regulations on assembly, the group should have
applied to Juifang police station one week prior to the activity.
Since the group has not done so, police will act accordingly, Juifang
police officials added.</P>
      <P>Ho Tsung-Hsun, secretary general of the Taiwan Environmental
Protecting Union (TEPU), said the group has solicited the public to
pose nude and display the words "No Nuke" on Fulung Beach near the
plant site next Monday.</P>
      <P>The event is aimed at conveying the ideals of opposing the
nuclear power plant and saving Fulung beach, which is eroding due to
a nearby wharf that has been constructed to take delivery of heavy
equipment destined for the nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The event is described as an artistic performance aimed at
environmental protection, he said, adding that the group has acted
according to law, which stipulates that all outdoor assemblies and
protest marches require permission from the related authorities,
while academic, literary, travel, sports competitions or similar
activities are exceptions.</P>
      <P>He stressed that a hotel has been commissioned to manage Fulung
beach, that the beach is privately owned and that the TEPU has
already paid for its use.</P>
      <P>In addition, the event is in line with the government's policy of
a "nuke-free homeland, " he said, questioning why the police have
arbitrarily decided that it is a protest activity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONFERENCE ON TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS TO BE HELD JULY 4</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A conference on Taiwan's economic prospects
in the coming 10 years will be held July 4, an official of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , the organizer
of the conference, said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Vincent Siew, chairman of the Chung Hua Institution for Economic
Research (CIER) , will present proposals to the government on behalf
of Taiwan's major economic think tanks -- CIER, the Taiwan Institute
of Economic Research, the Taiwan Thinktank, the Taiwan Research
Institute and Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>The meeting will be considered a prelude to the much-anticipated
Cabinet-organized conference on Taiwan's sustainable economic growth
scheduled for late July.</P>
      <P>Commissioned by Premier Su Tseng-chang, Siew is expected present
a research report conducted jointly by the five think tanks at the
July 4 conference.</P>
      <P>Part of the content of the report was revealed in advance Friday,
the 25th anniversary of CIER, in which Siew suggested that the
government develop Taiwan into a "global center of value-added
services."</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's unique economic characteristics, in which small-
and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) are full of dynamism, Siew
suggested that government incentives should not focus on giant
companies, but rather on the SMEs, which Siew said can increase the
country's development space and avoid Taiwan companies being
marginalized.</P>
      <P>Noting that the success of future markets will hinge on who can
provide the best value-added services to clients, Siew said Taiwan
companies need not waste too much time enlarging the scale of their
enterprises but should focus on the speed of their services, the
number of patents they obtain and their participation rate in the
market.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan does not boast the huge capital needed to support the
giant companies that are a feature of Japan, South Korea and China,
Siew said, Taiwan should emulate countries such as Finland, the
Netherlands and Ireland by focusing on its own economic
characteristics amid the pressure from the neighboring big countries.</P>
      <P>At a CIER celebration cocktail party Friday, Siew also envisioned
an economic outline for Taiwan in 2015 with the hope that Taiwan
might enter the list of advanced countries at that time, when the per
capita gross domestic product is expected to have reached US$30,000.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that if the government follows its proposed
policies of cultivating talent, making more connections with the rest
of the world and setting up brand names, Taiwan might see its average
economic growth rate in the coming 10 years topping 5 percent, and
the average unemployment rate being reduced to under 4 percent with
the creation of some 1.26 million jobs in the next 10 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP TO PUSH FOR 'AMITY MEETING' AMONG RIVAL GROUPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that she will organize an informal gathering of opinion leaders of
different political stripes for "amity talks" after the June 27 vote
in the legislature on a referendum to recall President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while attending a religious ritual in Taipei
County's Wanli coastal township to pray for social stability and
national wellbeing amid the current political turmoil stirred up by
the corruption allegations involving members of Chen's family and his
close aides and an opposition-initiated campaign to unseat him over the
allegations.</P>
      <P>Saying she dislikes seeing society divided by political disputes,
Lu said she has long planned to invite politicians from the nation's
two rival political camps to meet for reconciliation talks.</P>
      <P>Before the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) launched the recall motion last
week, Lu had proposed a meeting of officials from the ruling and
opposition camps for exchanges of views on major policy and political
issues, to be co-chaired by herself and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, a KMT veteran.</P>
      <P>The plan was aborted because the timing was not right, Lu said,
adding that she was not daunted by the setback and will continue her
efforts to help mend differences between the "pan-blue alliance" and
the DPP-led "pan-green camp" for the sake of seeking a breakthrough
to the protracted domestic political stalemate.</P>
      <P>As an initial step, Lu said she will invite leaders of private
social groups, regardless of their party affiliation or preference,
to an informal "brainstorming session" on major national issues
and
feasible measures to halt partisan infighting.</P>
      <P>Lu said the planned meeting will take place after next Tuesday's
legislative vote on the presidential recall motion, which is widely
seen as unlikely to succeed. The opposition "pan-blue alliance" holds
a slim majority in the Legislative Yuan but needs to muster
two-thirds of the votes in the 221-seat legislature to clear the way
for voters to decide Chen's fate in a national referendum.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, a key figure in the
campaign to oust Chen, once promised her to help push for realization
of her "amity" meeting.</P>
      <P>In related developments, Lu said Friday evening that those in
power should never be arrogant nor break the law, as their power
comes from public mandate.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a training program for nurturing a new generation of
leaders for the 21st Century, Lu said both she and Chen will pull out
all the stops to fulfill their official duties for the remainder of
their term in office. "Both of us have come to power with integrity
and will leave office in style," she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 21st Century is an era of globalization and
digitization, Lu encouraged those attending the class to make good
use of knowledge and to cultivate international perspective and
vision.</P>
      <P>She also told her audience that the 21st Century is an era of
gender equality. "We should come to understand that no single thing
can be monopolized by a single gender and that cooperation and
division of labor between the two genders is required," she added.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing
expressed Saturday in Geneva his optimism in persuading German makers
of medical equipment to invest in his southern Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Yang, heading a county government delegation, is on a European
visit aimed at persuading some of the world's leading producers of
devices and equipment for medical treatment to set up manufacturing
operations at the Kaohsiung Science Park.</P>
      <P>The delegation arrived in Geneva a day earlier after concluding a
visit to Germany. In an interview with CNA in Geneva, Yang explained
the prospects for the development of Kaohsiung's medical equipment
manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>Yang said the industry needs a workforce with expertise in making
high-grade metal and steel products and that Taiwan is a better place
than China to house factories making medical equipment and tools.</P>
      <P>Yang also said German businesses appear more confident in
Taiwan's ability to protect intellectual property rights than that of
China.</P>
      <P>The delegation also attended a religious ceremony Friday in
Geneva to mark the inauguration of an international Buddhist
convention center established by the Kaohsiung-headquartered Fo Kuang
Shan Buddhist organization.</P>
      <P>Master Hsing Yung, founder of the Fo Kuang Shan monastery,
presided over the ceremony, which included a Buddhist ritual to pray
for world peace and happiness of all people around the globe.</P>
      <P>The new Buddhist center was built on land donated by the Geneva
state government. Over 500 people, including Geneva state officials,
diplomats from Taiwan and China and religious leaders in the region

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou urged the people of southern Taiwan Saturday to throw their
support behind the campaign to oust President Chen Shui-bian,
claiming that "only his recall will bring Taiwan hope."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in a major rally in Kaohsiung --
traditionally a stronghold of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) -- with the aim of drumming up support for the
opposition-initiated recall motion, which will be put to a vote
in the Legislative Yuan next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Chen's administration has lost the trust of the
people due to its incompetence and a spate of corruption allegations
involving members of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>The president has reneged on his inauguration vow, and the people
have to take back through the recall the mandate they gave him, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the recall motion has nothing to do with partisan

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER LAUNCHES 'PRO-STABILITY' CAMPAIGN AMID TURMOIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling party lawmaker launched a
petition campaign in the southern port city of Kaohsiung Saturday
calling for "rationality" amid the current political turmoil
triggered by an opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuan Bi-ling of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said the "Believe in Judiciary and Maintain Social
Staibility" campaign is mainly aimed at galvanizing rationality and
self-restraint at this crucial moment of political upheaval.</P>
      <P>Supporters of rival political camps should exercise restraint and
refrain from radical moves to exacerbate the feuding and
confrontation, which will only add up to social unrest at the expense
of overall national wellbeing, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>More than 30 grassroots social groups, including Lions clubs,
have thrown support behind the petition campaign, Kuan said, adding
that the passionate response indicates that grassroots groups are
concerned about the escalating confrontation between the country's
two rivaling political camps -- the DPP-led "pan-green" camp and the
Kuomintang (KMT)-led "pan-blue" alliance.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, Kuan lamented that a suspected illegal
case that can be clarified and resolved through judicial procedures
has been overblown into a political storm, with the opposition
striving to unseat the president and threatening to topple the
Cabinet provided that the recall motion in the legislature fails.</P>
      <P>Kuan was referring to a stock insider trading case allegedly
involving Chen's son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, who has been detained
since May 24 for questioning about his role in the Taiwan Development
Corp. (TDC) stock trading scandal.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, President Chen has shown invariable respect
for the judiciary, Kuan said, citing as proofs his attendance as a
witness at a court hearing on an election bribery charge and the
proceedings of the two lawsuits concerning the 2004 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>For the TDC insider trading case, Kuan said, Chen has pledged on
many occasions that his son-in-law wouldn't receive preferential
treatment as "everyone is equal before the law."</P>
      <P>Kuan said opposition politicians and news media should refrain
from overblowing the case in terms of unfounded speculation to
interfere with judicial investigations, which would only lead to more
clashes and chaos in local society.</P>
      <P>"Let the judicial case run its course and none of us should
'incriminate' anyone before judicial authorities conclude
investigations and mete final verdicts," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Kuan's office set up booths at Sanming Park in downtown Kaohsiung
for city dwellers to sign their names in support of the "Believe in
Judiciary" petition campaign.</P>
      <P>She took the opportunity to slam the National Communications
Commission (NCC) for what she called "discrepancies" in its treatment
of of a Taipei-based cable TV station and radio stations in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Kuan, the NCC, while turning a blind eye to the TVBS
talk show fans' oft-threatening rhetoric against Chen, launched a
raid at an underground radio station in southern Taiwan earlier this
week simply because one of its listeners gave a call-in phone call
suggesting "assassinating" KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>"The NCC's biased treatment of the southern Taiwan radio station
is unacceptable," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she urged supporters of both camps to refrain from
emotionally-charged rhetoric and irrational actions before and after
the June 27 legislative vote on whether to hold referendum to sack
Chen over corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" alliance staged a final weekend demonstration in
Kaohsiung Saturday against Chen and his administration to drump up
support for the recall motion. Many doubt the opposition "pan-blue"
alliance, which has a slim majority in the legislautre, will be able
to muster the two-thirds majority needed to pass the motion next

    <TEXT>New York Times:
Court Says S.E.C. Lacks Authority on Hedge 
Funds 

A federal appeals court ruled yesterday that
the Securities and Exchange Commission lacks the
authority to regulate hedge funds, dealing a
possibly fatal blow to the commission's efforts
to oversee a rapidly growing industry that now
has US$1.1 trillion in assets. As hedge funds
have grown, and as some have collapsed amid
fraud or because they took excessive risks,
pressures to regulate them have grown. But fund
managers have protested that the vast majority
have acted responsibly and should not be
subjected to "regulatory overlays and burdens"

Wall Street Journal: Stop Order, SEC Dealt
Setback As Court Rejects Hedge-Fund Rule

The U.S. government's long-running battle to
regulate hedge funds was thrown into doubt as a
federal appeals court tossed out a controversial
rule requiring hedge-fund advisers to register
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The court decision abruptly halts, for now, the 
SEC's attempt to regulate the murky world of 
hedge funds, the private and sometimes volatile 
investment pools that have surged in popularity 
in recent years and now oversee more than US$1 
trillion in assets.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER LAUNCHES 'PRO-STABILITY' CAMPAIGN AMID TURMOIL(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling party lawmaker launched a
petition campaign in the southern port city of Kaohsiung Saturday
calling for "rationality" amid the current political turmoil
triggered by an opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuan Bi-ling of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said the "Believe in Judiciary and Maintain Social
Staibility" campaign is mainly aimed at galvanizing rationality and
self-restraint at this crucial moment of political upheaval.</P>
      <P>Supporters of rival political camps should exercise restraint and
refrain from radical moves to exacerbate the feuding and
confrontation, which will only add up to social unrest at the expense
of overall national wellbeing, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>More than 30 grassroots social groups, including Lions clubs,
have thrown support behind the petition campaign, Kuan said, adding
that the passionate response indicates that grassroots groups are
concerned about the escalating confrontation between the country's
two rivaling political camps -- the DPP-led "pan-green" camp and the
Kuomintang (KMT)-led "pan-blue" alliance.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, Kuan lamented that a suspected illegal
case that can be clarified and resolved through judicial procedures
has been overblown into a political storm, with the opposition
striving to unseat the president and threatening to topple the
Cabinet provided that the recall motion in the legislature fails.</P>
      <P>Kuan was referring to a stock insider trading case allegedly
involving Chen's son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, who has been detained
since May 24 for questioning about his role in the Taiwan Development
Corp. (TDC) stock trading scandal.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, President Chen has shown invariable respect
for the judiciary, Kuan said, citing as proofs his attendance as a
witness at a court hearing on an election bribery charge and the
proceedings of the two lawsuits concerning the 2004 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>For the TDC insider trading case, Kuan said, Chen has pledged on
many occasions that his son-in-law wouldn't receive preferential
treatment as "everyone is equal before the law."</P>
      <P>Kuan said opposition politicians and news media should refrain
from overblowing the case in terms of unfounded speculation to
interfere with judicial investigations, which would only lead to more
clashes and chaos in local society.</P>
      <P>"Let the judicial case run its course and none of us should
'incriminate' anyone before judicial authorities conclude
investigations and mete final verdicts," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Kuan's office set up booths at Sanming Park in downtown Kaohsiung
for city dwellers to sign their names in support of the "Believe in
Judiciary" petition campaign.</P>
      <P>She took the opportunity to slam the National Communications
Commission (NCC) for what she called "discrepancies" in its treatment
of of a Taipei-based cable TV station and radio stations in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Kuan, the NCC, while turning a blind eye to the TVBS
talk show fans' oft-threatening rhetoric against Chen, launched a
raid at an underground radio station in southern Taiwan earlier this
week simply because one of its listeners gave a call-in phone call
suggesting "assassinating" KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>"The NCC's biased treatment of the southern Taiwan radio station
is unacceptable," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she urged supporters of both camps to refrain from
emotionally-charged rhetoric and irrational actions before and after
the June 27 legislative vote on whether to hold referendum to sack
Chen over corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" alliance staged a final weekend demonstration in
Kaohsiung Saturday against Chen and his administration to drump up
support for the recall motion. Many doubt the opposition "pan-blue"
alliance, which has a slim majority in the legislautre, will be able
to muster the two-thirds majority needed to pass the motion next
Tuesday to authorize a recall referendum.</P>
      <P>Chen himself visited two temples in Taipei Saturday to pray for
peace, harmony and national wellbeing, officials said, adding that
the president will visit his hometown in southern Tainan county to
see his mother and grassroots supporters.</P>
      <P>Chen on Tuesday offered a point-by-point rebuttal of the
opposition's recall case during a two-hour televised address. His DPP
has been boycotting legislative hearings on the topic. DPP bigwigs
have said the bid to oust Chen is unjustified because he is not
personally implicated in any wrongdoing.</P>

      <P>Seventy-five outstanding culture volunteers

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou urged the people of southern Taiwan Saturday to throw their
support behind the campaign to oust President Chen Shui-bian,
claiming that "only his recall will bring Taiwan hope."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in a major rally in Kaohsiung --
traditionally a stronghold of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) -- with the aim of drumming up support for the
opposition-initiated recall motion, which will be put to a vote
in the Legislative Yuan next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Chen's administration has lost the trust of the
people due to its incompetence and a spate of corruption allegations
involving members of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>The president has reneged on his inauguration vow, and the people
have to take back through the recall the mandate they gave him, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the recall motion has nothing to do with partisan
or ethnic struggle, but is for the future of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>He also called for the DPP to draw a clear line with the
president instead of rallying behind him.</P>
      <P>If the president clings to power and refuses to step down, more
and more scandals will be exposed, Ma speculated.</P>
      <P>Braving sweltering heat of 37 degrees, nearly 10,000 supporters
attended the rally, which had "safeguarding Taiwan with integrity" as
its theme, in the square in front of the National Science and
Technology Museum. </P>
      <P>KMT Legislators Wu Yu-sheng and Kuo Shu-chun presided over the
rally, with Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, KMT Kaohsiung mayoral
hopefuls Huang Chun-ying and Huang Chao-shun, as well as legislators
Wu Den-yih, Chiu Yi and People First Party Secretary-General Chin
Chin-sheng all speaking out against Chen and his government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PLAYS 'RECONCILIATION CARD' AMID RECALL JITTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is now opting for a "reconciliation card" in an attempt to cool
the current political turmoil triggered by an opposition-initiated
motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" alliance of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) has pushed for a recall motion to unseat
Chen in the wake of a string of corruption scandals in which Chen's
senior aides and close family members are being investigated for
suspected involvement.</P>
      <P>Chen vowed Saturday to hold political consultations at home and
to engage in peaceful talks with the other side of Taiwan Strait,
providing a shot in the arm to the ruling DPP, which has been cloaked
in a shroud of depression since the pan-blue opposition launched the
recall motion two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday that she will organize an
informal gathering of opinion leaders across the political spectrum
for "amity talks" after the June 27 vote on a legislative referendum
to recall the president.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun will also soon pay visits to the
opposition KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong to
help eliminate misunderstandings between the DPP-led "pan-green" camp
and its rival pan-blue alliance.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which in the meantime has grappled with a sense of
crisis over the recall motion, has sorted out a "diverging and
converging" strategy aimed at creating a reconciliation atmosphere
and "throwing the issue back to the opposition."</P>
      <P>In fact, the DPP has become more complacent as the recall motion
proceedings drag on, believing the longer the issue plays out the
more likely the situation will turn in favor of the president and
ruling party.</P>
      <P>Many doubt the opposition pan-blue alliance, which has a slim
majority in the legislature, will be able to muster the approval of
two-thirds of the 221-seat legislature next Tuesday in order to clear
the way for voters to decide on Chen's fate in a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Most DPP legislators believe the recall motion would have no
chance to succeed and some DPP officials even speculate that Tuesday
-- when the recall motion may be aborted -- is the day President
Chen may be freed from the current domestic political turmoil.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition pan-blue alliance is viewed as full of
controversies from within the alliance, with PFP Chairman James Soong
insisting if the recall motion fails, moves to topple the Cabinet
should proceed, while the KMT leader said no further moves to oust
Premier Su Tseng-chang and the Cabinet are considered even if the
recall motion fails to pass in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen's son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, has been detained since May
24 for questioning about his role in an insider trading scandal
involving Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) stocks.</P>
      <P>DPP bigwigs have said the bid to oust Chen is unjustified because
he is not personally implicated in any wrongdoing.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main Kuomintang (KMT) will focus
efforts on pushing a recall vote against President Chen Shui-bian
through the legislature but will not consider toppling the Cabinet as
a means of ousting Chen, KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Pan made the remarks while fielding questions from reporters at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the KMT would do its best to pass the presidential
recall vote in the Legislative Yuan Tuesday, Pan said it would be
untimely to call for a no-confidence vote in the legislature to
topple the Cabinet before redistricting of electoral constituencies
has been completed for the next legislative election.</P>
      <P>As the current legislative session ends June 30, it is beneficial
for KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong to make use of the ensuing two-month summer recess to
decide whether to launch a no-confidence vote when the next session
begins in September, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng suggested.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that he was sure new evidence regarding corruption
allegedly committed by Chen's family would surface in coming months,
adding the KMT would gauge public response before deciding whether to
call the no-confidence vote, and only after the June 27 presidential
recall vote has been held.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong vowed to continue pushing for a no-confidence
vote in the Legislative Yuan and to pressure Chen to step down even
if the presidential recall vote fails in the legislature Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Soong, who has been staging a sit-in in front of the Legislative
Yuan since late last week to solicit wider support for the
presidential recall vote, said that "the PFP will undoubtedly propose
a no-confidence vote in the Legislative Yuan, " as "The Taiwanese are
looking forward to having politicians with a strong will to wipe out
corruption."</P>
      <P>"Pan-green" lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(PFP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union must not veto the presidential
recall motion Tuesday so as to provide the public with a chance to
decide Chen's fate in a national referendum, Soong said.</P>
      <P>"If 'pan-green' lawmakers really respect what they called 'the
public mandate,' they are supposed to vote in favor of the
presidential recall motion and leave people with the chance to
determine Chen's fate," Soong urged.</P>
      <P>If the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and PFP are
still unable to oust Chen from the presidency through their combined
efforts, it means that Taiwan's democratic mechanisms to check and
balance the government have become paralyzed, PFP Policy Center
Director Chang Hsien-yao stressed, expressing concern about Taiwan's
democratic future.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that the KMT has held back from its
decision to call for a no-confidence vote in the legislature as a
follow-up to the presidential recall motion to unseat Chen, Chang
said that it may indicate that differing opinions within the KMT need
to be consolidated, adding that "it is wrong to say the KMT has
softened its position."</P>
      <P>According to Chang, it is the common desire of all of Taiwan's
people to denounce corruption, regardless of political affiliation.</P>
      <P>Faced with the "pan-blue alliance's" move to oust Chen, DPP
legislative caucus whip Yeh Yi-jin urged the KMT and PFP to refrain
from political wrangling and to address the quality of life issues
and public welfare.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, it would backfire among the public," she warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMICS TO LAUNCH SIT-INS CALLING FOR PRESIDENT'S RESIGNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another group of some 100 academics called
on President Chen Shui-bian Sunday to resign in order to "set a good
example in Taiwan's democratization."</P>
      <P>This marks the second time in three days that professors and
academics in Taiwan have run ads in major dailies demanding that Chen
step down, about one month after the detention of his son-in-law,
Chao Chien-ming, following allegations of insider trading by an
opposition legislator.</P>
      <P>In a front-page statement published in Sunday's newspapers, 106
intellectuals said the moral integrity of a head of state must be
beyond question.</P>
      <P>However, they said, Chen is not only unable to offer a reasonable
explanation for why some senior aides and family members have been
involved in a series of corruption scandals, but also lacks the
ability for self-reflection by using provocative rhetoric to distort
the solemn procedure of democratic politics into a political struggle
between the Democratic Progressive Party-led ruling "pan-green" camp
and the rival "pan-blue" alliance of the opposition Kuomintang and
the People First Party.</P>
      <P>The intellectuals continued to say that DPP officials and
lawmakers -- who have supported the president's decision not to
respond to the allegations in the legislature and have defended the
first family in cases of alleged wrongdoing -- should also bear all
consequences for their "total disregard for truth and fact."</P>
      <P>Huang Kuang-kuo, a psychology professor at National Taiwan
University and convener of the Democratic Action Alliance (DAA) which
sponsored the newspaper ads, said the DAA is sponsoring a candlelight
vigil at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Sunday night as a reflection
of Taiwan public determination to seek truth and justice, and is
expected to transcend confrontations between the pan-green camp and
pan-blue alliance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said, this group of intellectuals will join the
public in DAA-sponsored sit-ins at the same venue Monday and Tuesday
in order to call for Chen's resignation because the president no
longer has the public's trust and is incapable of carrying out his
constitutional duties as a leader, Huang argued.</P>
      <P>The group of 105 professors published front-page ads in two major
newspapers Friday petitioning Chen to "be responsible to the people"
and to step down gracefully in order to "set a good political
example."</P>
      <P>They said in the statement that as intellectuals, they firmly
believe the moral integrity of a chief of state must be
unquestionable.</P>
      <P>The professors added that Chen's "unfit" conduct has "violated
the basic moral conscience" of Taiwan's population and has "confused
Taiwan society's system of simple values."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT STANDS BY DENIAL OF BUSINESS TYCOON'S DONATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian stood by his
denial that his wife had never met with a controversial business
tycoon at his Taipei home or received political donations from him, a
presidential aide said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In response to remarks made by the founder of the now-defunct
Tuntex Group Chen You-hao at 12: 00 a.m. Taipei time Sunday in Los
Angeles that he had personally presented NT$3 million (US$91,600) to
Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen in 1994 and 1998, a spokesman for the
Presidential Office said the president "has made it very clear" on
June 20 that "no is no" and any attempts to contradict the
president's statement are "politically motivated."</P>
      <P>Chen You-hao, a fugitive wanted in Taiwan for illegally
transferring his company's assets overseas, accused the president of
lying when he denied in a nationally televised speech June 20 that Wu
had never met with Chen You-hao, much less received his political
donations.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office spokesman said they do not wish anyone
with political motivations to unveil "behind-the-scenes" information
at a time when lawmakers are about to vote on a motion in the
Legislative Yuan to recall the president.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also urged Chen You-hao to return to Taiwan,
provide an explanation for the issue and to assist investigators in
other ongoing cases.</P>
      <P>During Chen You-hao's news conference, he said he gave money to
President Chen on two occasions in the 1990s, claiming each time he
gave President Chen Shui-bian -- then a candidate in the race for
Taipei mayor -- NT$3 million in cash.</P>
      <P>The first time was in 1994, he said, when he visited Chen
Shui-bian's residence on Minsheng East Road with Shen Fu-hsiung, a
former lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>He claimed the second visit took place in 1998 when Chen
Shui-bian was running for re-election as mayor of Taipei. Chen
You-hao said he went to Chen Shui-bian's residence accompanied by
Shen, and that they were received by Wu again.</P>
      <P>Shortly after they left, Chen Shui-bian called to thank him. The
call was made to a phone in his car and his conversation with Chen
Shui-bian was clearly heard by his driver.</P>
      <P>Shen recently confirmed he had accompanied Chen You-hao to visit
Chen Shui-bian at his Taipei house in 1994 and handed over NT$3
million to Wu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION EFFORTS IN RECALL BID 'INADEQUATE': ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition has shown itself incapable
of succeeding in its bid to recall President Chen Shui-bian over the
past two weeks, an academic said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Legislative caucus members of the "pan-blue" alliance of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party have fallen
short in maneuvering and executive abilities in the legislature when
they pushed for a presidential recall, said Chou Yang-shan, director
of Chinese Culture University's Chungshan Academic Research
Institute.</P>
      <P>The pan-blue legislators also have serious coordination problems
concerning morale, party discipline and the "combative capability" of
the opposition, Chou claimed.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chou said, Taiwan's opposition is not the only
group in the world that is insufficient or incapable of recalling the
head of state. In fact, he said, most countries, regardless of
whether they are newly democratic countries or veteran democracies,
have constitutional problems in recalling the executive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a seasoned democracy and electoral system, but
lacks a well-designed process to recall or impeach the president or
topple the Cabinet, Chou argued.</P>
      <P>Chou claimed that in Taiwan, the threshold is too high for a
presidential recall -- proponents must gain the support of two-thirds
of the legislature before voters decide on the issue in a
national referendum.</P>
      <P>The fact that one-third of legislators can veto a decision made
by the other two-thirds reflects a "minority ruling" phenomenon, he
said, adding that "this shows the inadequacy of Taiwan's
constitutional mechanism."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher at Academia
Sinica, said the ongoing recall drive is teaching Taiwan's opposition
that the too-high threshold for a recall referendum means risking the
spirit of democracy.</P>
      <P>The KMT has said it has already collected enough signatures for a
recall petition, Hsu said, adding that the public's endorsement
actually has no say in a recall motion since the measure is passed or
rejected only by legislators, not by the people.</P>
      <P>The pan-blues should seek more support for the recall drive from
the "pan-green" camp consisiting of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, Hsu added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION, PAN-GREENS PREPARE STRATEGIES TO FOLLOW A FAILED RECALL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both the ruling and opposition camps are
preparing for a new phase in Taiwan's politics after a vote is held
on a presidential recall motion in the legislature June 27, academics
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Scholars and political analysts made the comments at a seminar
sponsored by Taiwan Thinktank on "Crisis and turning point: Taiwan's
political strife and reform predicament," and comes at a time when
lawmakers are set to vote on an opposition "pan-blue alliance"-led
motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher at Academia Sinica who
chaired the seminar, said that visionary political figures from both
camps have begun preparing for the "post-627 era" because the results
of the presidential recall vote -- the first in Taiwan's history --
are predictable.</P>
      <P>Hsu based his claims on a media report that main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou will return to his
"middle-of-the-road" stance following the June 27 vote -- a
development that coincided with remarks made recently by Chen in an
interview with foreign media that he will pursue political dialogue
at home while engaging in cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations after the
vote takes place.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged politicians to reflect deeply on whether Taiwan's
constitutional system should be reformed in light of a vicious cycle
of political wrangling since Chen came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chien-yuan, a professor at Chung Hua University, said it
would be a good strategy if the KMT returned to its moderate stance
by not seeking to topple the Cabinet after the presidential recall
vote, and he contended that the main opposition party should respond
to Chen's call for negotiation.</P>
      <P>The ruling and opposition parties should also cooperate to iron
out an adequate constitutional system that would help foster Taiwan's
democratic development, he said.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University Professor Lee Si-tang opined that
the KMT hopes to take a centrist policy after being driven by its
pan-blue partner -- the People First Party (PFP) -- to join recall
efforts.</P>
      <P>Chou Yang-shan, a professor at Chinese Culture University, said
the opposition's recall bid underscored the fact that "Taiwan's
electoral democracy" lacks a balancing mechanism.</P>
      <P>Although the Constitution stipulates the people are entitled
to recall or impeach the president or topple the Cabinet, Chou said
these practices are hard to carry out in actuality due to a lack
of supporting measures.</P>
      <P>Taipei University professor Chen Yao-hsiang attributed Taiwan's
political crisis to an unclear system of central government.</P>
      <P>He called for a new Constitution or an overhaul of the existing
one to better implement checks and balances for a normal democratic
nation.</P>
      <P>According to a media report, the KMT has decided to adjust its
stance by not seeking to topple the Cabinet following next Tuesday's
recall vote, which is expected to fail in the Legislative Yuan for
lack of a two-thirds majority. Ma was also reportedly planning to
meet with Chen.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen responded that the KMT has been
moderate and there is no need for the party to adjust its strategy.
She denied the report by saying the KMT has never ruled out the
possibility of toppling the Cabinet and that Ma has no plans to meet
with Chen in the near future.</P>
      <P>The KMT is focusing efforts on recalling Chen and has been
calling for him to step down.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian thanked supporters
in his hometown in southern Taiwan for their moral support at a time
when he was facing the hardest period in his life.</P>
      <P>On a visit to a temple in Guantien Township, Tainan County, the
president -- who is facing a recall motion in the legislature over
scandals allegedly involving family members and close aides --- said
he is willing to sacrifice everything for the country but will never
yield in the face of hardship.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is going to visit different temples around the
island and to pray not for himself but for the country and people,
and to wish them good luck.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan is not a normal country, and that it is
encountering the same difficulties as any other country transforming
from an authoritarian regime into a democratic country. Difficulties
include abnormal media, parliament and intelligence agencies.</P>
      <P>However, the president said he will never concede to
difficulties, but will instead lead the country and its people
bravely toward a better future.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yueh-tseh
called on opposition and ruling parties Sunday to take a step
backwards from a fierce dispute over whether President Chen Shui-bian
should be recalled in the wake of scandals allegedly involving his
family and administration.</P>
      <P>He said in a written statement that opposition legislators who
initiated the recall motion should fully understand why the
Constitution outlines stringent requirements for a presidential
recall -- to ensure domestic stability and to make it difficult for a
recall bid to pass without a clear legislative majority.</P>
      <P>The recall motion is expected to fail because opposition parties
leading the recall are highly unlikely to obtain the two-thirds
majority as required by the Constitution when the motion is put to a
vote in the Legislative Yuan on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the Nobel laureate said, as the target of the
motion the president should understand the best way to ward off
future accusations is to "mend his ways and conduct himself
accordingly."</P>
      <P>Lee -- whose support is viewed as having contributed to Chen's
presidential election victories -- was claimed by Chen's political
rivals to be "morally responsible for Chen's failure" to rein in his
aides and family members.</P>
      <P>As a response to their claims, Lee said he felt deeply sorry that
the DPP, instead of adhering to its political objectives and pursuing
them, has been dogged by scandals and performed far below public
expectations ever since it took power in 2000. </P>
      <P>He urged the DPP to reflect carefully on its internal governance
and to make up for its faults by mending its ways.</P>
      <P>He called for reconciliation among different parties, noting
that partisan bickering would only hinder the country's development
and jeopardize the welfare of 23 million people while other
countries are making rapid advancements.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Monday, June 26, or the first
day of the sixth month of the Year of the Dog according to the
lunar calendar. The following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

363: Roman emperor Julian the Apostate, the first non-Christian
emperor since Constantine, dies of spear wounds inflicted during a
battle with the Persians. He was 32.

    <HEADLINE>CHRISTIAN FUND SEEKING 300 NEW FOSTER FAMILIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Fund for Children and Families
is seeking 300 new foster families to provide foster care for
orphaned, abused or neglected children, a spokesman for the Christian
charity said Monday.</P>
      <P>The foundation is cooperating with Family Mart in soliciting
decent families to join its foster care program, the spokesman said,
adding that those who are willing to offer family foster care for
children in need are welcome to register at any of the 1,900 Family
Mart convenience stores around Taiwan by Sept. 25.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a recent Taiwan Fund survey, the spokesman
said an average of 3.1 children or adolescents have to leave their
birth families per day around Taiwan, but only 0.7 new foster
families are available each day.</P>
      <P>The substantial gap between the demand and supply of foster
families can be attributed to a combination of factors, the spokesman
said. On the one hand, the number of abused children has been on a
steady rise, while on the other hand, local people have become less
interested in becoming foster parents for various reasons, including
foster children's disappointing behavior, birth parents' reluctance
to cooperate or foster families encountering unexpected misfortunes
that force them to stop providing foster care, he said.</P>
      <P>In 2005 alone, the Taiwan Fund had to find foster parents for
1,143 new children in need, 52.6 percent of whom were abused or
maltreated by their birth parents. For abused children, the spokesman
said, foster parents not only play the role of "substitute parents"
but also have to serve as professional counselors.</P>
      <P>Through cooperation with Family Mart, the foundation managed to
recruit in 2005 far more new foster families than in the previous
year. Nevertheless, the number of new families recruited still fell
short of the number needed. Each foster family under the Taiwan Fund
program now has to care for an average of two children.</P>
      <P>"We hope the new foster family recruit program can help bring the
ratio down to below 1-1.5," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Those who intend to join the foster care program are welcome to
contact the Taiwan Fund by phone at (04)-2206-1234 or visit the
fund's Web site at www.ccf.org.tw.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government may consider allowing
Chinese employees of Taiwan companies operating in China's Fujian
Province to seek extended education in Taiwan's outlying island of
Kinmen, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>By doing so, the government can help strengthen business
operations of the Fujian-based Taiwan companies, MAC Vice Chairman
Liu Te-shun said.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in response to a recent announcement made by
Fujian's Xiamen City that the Chinese province will soon activate
nine incentive measures to boost educational exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to the measures, Liu said, the government should
further encourage China-based Taiwan businesspeople to send their
children to the Taiwan-held islands of Kinmen and Matsu for
education.</P>
      <P>Liu related that China has been systematically increasing work on
Taiwan's youths in recent years in an attempt to have the new
generation Taiwanese turn to the fold of the Chinese communists in
the long run.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan's part, Liu suggested that Taiwan open its doors wider
to mainland Chinese students so as to allow young Chinese men and
women to have a better chance to learn about Taiwan's freedom and
democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT WILL CONSIDER NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE `CAUTIOUSLY': SPOKESWOMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
exercise extra caution if it launches a no-confidence vote to topple
the Cabinet at the Legislative Yuan as a means of pressuring
President Chen Shui-bian to step down, KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at KMT headquarters, Cheng said the
party has not ruled out the possibility of calling a no-confidence
vote to serve that end, but will do so in an "extremely cautious"
way.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT will not stop its bid to demand Chen's
resignation, such as through a recall motion at the Legislative Yuan,
because "more than half" of the Taiwan people feel that he is no
longer capable of serving as head of state because of a string of
corruption allegations involving members of his family and close
aides, Cheng claimed.</P>
      <P>The Constitution provides the people with the right to recall or
impeach the president or topple the Cabinet and it is lawful for the
people to exercise such rights, in addition to staging sit-ins or
street protests, she said.</P>
      <P>The KMT has always been a moderate political party and there is
no need for it to adjust its line, she claimed.</P>
      <P>Cheng's remarks came in the wake of a media report that the KMT
will drop a plan to join the People First Party's (PFP) efforts to
topple the Cabinet as a follow-up move to oust Chen if the
presidential recall vote -- the first of its kind in Taiwan's history
-- fails at the Legislative Yuan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The presidential recall vote stands no chance of passing the
Legislative Yuan without the backing of the "pan-green" lawmakers of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, as the vote requires a two-thirds majority
approval.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it is feared that confrontation over the presidential
recall motion showdown might be brought to a boil as the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the PFP and the "pan-green camp" will
mobilize supporters at the Legislative Yuan to display their stances.</P>
      <P>About 2,000 "pan-blue" supporters will show up on one side of the
Legislative Yuan, while some 10,000 "pan-greens" will appear on the
other side, according to local media reports.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers Lin Kuo-ching and Hsieh Hsin-ni told a news
conference earlier the same day that according to information they
had received, some gangsters dressed in black or in the colors of the
national flag are likely to infiltrate the crowd of "pan-blue"
supporters Tuesday with the intention of creating chaos between the
two camps.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the presidential recall vote is doomed to fail at
the Legislative Yuan and called on "pan-blue" supporters not to be
fooled by their leaders or cause bloodshed in the streets.</P>
      <P>DPP social development department head Lin You-chang confirmed
that around 10,000 "pan-green" supporters were expected to show up
near the Legislative Yuan Tuesday to show their support for Chen.</P>
      <P>Lin promised that the DPP will do its best to prevent conflict by
sending task force members to maintain traffic order at street
intersections, and urged the Taipei city police authorities to
maintain high alert to head off any contacts between supporters of
the two sides.</P>

sector remains weak two years after a national conference on the
development of the service sector in which participants called for an
annual service sector growth of 6.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Saying that a weak service sector will drag down the economy,
they blamed the lack of development on various government agencies
and the fact that the CEPD is incapable of reining in them and
coordinating between them.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the ratio of Taiwan's service sector
accounts for 73 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP),
although the number of those employed in the sector accounts for only
58.27 percent of the total employment.
</P>
      <P>Compared with the figures in industrialized countries, such as
the 2004 service sector employment in Hong Kong accounting for 81.4
percent of the total employment, with 75.6 percent in the United
States, 74.6 percent in Britain and 67.1 percent in Japan, the
creation of service sector jobs in Taiwan is low.</P>
      <P>In addition, although Taiwan's service sector accounts for over
70 percent of the nation's GDP, its contribution to economic growth
is comparatively low.</P>
      <P>In terms of the contributions of various sectors to economic
growth, the contributions of the service sector (0.88 percent) lagged
behind those of the manufacturing sector (1.64 percent) and the
industrial sector (1.5 percent) in 2005.</P>
      <P>In terms of the real growth of various sectors, the service
sector also lagged at 3.8 percent behind the 5.76 percent of the
manufacturing sector and the 5.24 percent of the industrial sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIA SINICA CHIEF CALLS FOR PARTY RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of engaging in partisan struggles,
political parties should work together for the benefit of the
country, Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee reiterated the remarks he made in a four-point written
statement the previous day, adding that his statement was made in
response to the many e-mails he has received asking about his views
on the political situation.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that the purpose of his statement was to urge
political parties to end their vicious disputes and pay more
attention to the country's development.</P>
      <P>He said the most important part of his statement is his call for
parties to start negotiations and that the ruling and opposition
parties should strive for the country's development.</P>
      <P>Lee's statement also urged the opposition and ruling parties to
step back from the fierce dispute over whether President Chen
Shui-bian should be recalled in the wake of scandals allegedly
involving members of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>His statement said that opposition lawmakers who initiated the
recall motion should fully understand why the Constitution outlines
stringent requirements to recall the president, which is to ensure
domestic stability and to make it difficult for a recall bid to pass
without a clear legislative majority.</P>
      <P>The recall motion will be put to a vote Tuesday at the
Legislative Yuan, where it is expected to fail because the opposition
parties leading it are unlikely to obtain the two-thirds majority
required by the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's new deputy representative to the

      <P>Deng, a shrewd economic affairs official who has performed well

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER TO PROPOSE SECOND EXTRAORDINARY LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that he would propose a second
extraordinary session of the legislature after a showdown between the
ruling and the opposition parties on an opposition-initiated recall
motion against President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said the second extraordinary
session should focus on the discussion of a major arms procurement
bill and on bills related to public welfare such as special budgets
for flood-control as well as a draft bill on the establishment of a
group to supervise a labor retirement fund, which he said is crucial
to the rights of 6 million wage earners. </P>
      <P>Ker made the remarks after a regular meeting with Premier Su
Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun at the premier's office. Su
approved of his suggestion, according to Ker.</P>
      <P>Ker said they also discussed the party's strategy on the recall
motion vote and how to deal with the aftermath of the vote, expected
before noon Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) only maintains a slim majority in
the 221-seat legislature, Ker said the recall motion is "bound to
fail, " as a recall motion requires the endorsement of two-thirds of
the legislators before it can be put to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Ker said the DPP, defined the recall motion as "political
strife, " will not take part in the vote, but said the DPP lawmakers
will unfurl a banner prior to the vote to express their opposition to
the recall and the political struggle, and to put forward the party's
pro-public welfare stance.</P>
      <P>On an opposition announcement that it will encourage DPP
lawmakers to side with them, Ker claimed that "they are lying and
that it is also impossible, " warning them that some KMT and PFP
legislators might "act in line with the public will and stay away
from the vote."</P>
      <P>Amid tension between the ruling and the opposition parties after
days of campaigning by the rival parties, Ker, Su and Yu also decided
that after the vote, police will step up checks at major traffic
points, including mass rapid transit stations and railway stations,
to avoid possible clashes between "pan blue alliance" supporters and
their "pan green camp" rivals, Ker added.</P>
      <P>The legislators agreed to an extraordinary session June 13-30
after the legislature went into recess in late May. The DPP has
listed several priority bills for discussion in the special session,
but the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) put the recall motion at the top of the agenda.</P>
      <P>With reports saying that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is most
likely to represent the party in the 2008 presidential election,
intends to return to a middle-of-the-road path after the vote, Ker
said he hopes Ma will support the idea of the second extraordinary
session.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will
review the overall needs of industry and the actual labor shortage
situation before deciding whether to allow the hiring of more foreign
laborers, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a recent call by Minister of
Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san to allow for more foreign workers to
be brought in to meet the demands of certain "hardship" industries.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at a ceremony to mark the formation of a
150-member workplace hygiene and safety inspection corps last Friday,
Hwang said he hopes the CLA can set up additional foreign laborer
import quotas because certain "special manufacturing industries" have
60,000 jobs left unfilled.</P>
      <P>The CLA's 20,000 foreign laborer quota for this year is not
enough to meet the demand of these labor-intensive industries,
particularly those with dirty and dangerous work conditions.</P>
      <P>However, CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said that more than 7,000
vacancies remain for this year. "The CLA will discuss with the
Industrial Development Bureau how to allocate the remaining quota for
special manufacturing businesses," he added.</P>
      <P>As to whether to allow more foreign laborer quotas, Lee said the
CLA has to evaluate overall industry demand and the actual labor

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former gangster who was arrested the
previous day in a high-profile police operation was released on bail
by prosecutors early Monday to the outrage of the police authorities.</P>
      <P>Yang Shung-wu, who is accused of extorting money from local
businessmen, was questioned by prosecutors overnight and released on
NT$300,000 bail, on the grounds that there is little ironclad
evidence to substantiate the police charges against him.</P>
      <P>Also released were eight alleged members of Yang's crime ring who
were arrested along with him.</P>
      <P>It was a hard blow to police because they had monitored Yang for
more than three days without sleep and had mounted a large-scale
operation to arrest him and crack down on his crime ring.</P>
      <P>Chung Chung-hsiao, assistant director of Kaohsiung District
Prosecutor's Office, said the police failed to substantiate their
charges against Yang with evidence and added that if new evidence is 
been presented by the police, Yang may be detained later.</P>
      <P>Yang who lives in Kushan, Kaohsiung City, ignored media requests
for interviews.</P>
      <P>Police claim that Yang extorted NT$20 million from a businessman
selling grit and sand in July 2005 and ordered one of his underlings
to smash the windows and furniture of a night club after its owner
rejected his demands for NT$5 million early this year.</P>
      <P>They claim that Yang, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in
1990 for killing two other gangsters in a turf war but was released
on probation in 2003 after serving 13 years, bullies businessmen and
extorts cash in return for his "protection."</P>
      <P>Yang was once listed as one of the nation's top-10 wanted
fugitives and went into hiding in Japan and China until 1990, when he
visited Thailand and was arrested by Thai police at the request of
their Taipei counterparts.</P>
      <P>Yang has avoided publicity ever since his 2003 release.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 20 percent of college graduates have
yet to land jobs five years after leaving college or university,
according to the results of a survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by www.1111.com.tw, an on-line manpower
firm, between March 8 and May 10 with the aim of learning about the
employment situation among college graduates five years after leaving
school. A total of 1,297 effective samples were collected with a
margin of error of 2.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 69.93 percent of college graduates
are hired as full-time workers within five years of their graduation,
19.12 percent have yet to land jobs, while 9.79 percent are in
non-typical jobs such as short-term jobs, temp work or case-by-case
projects.</P>
      <P>That means that around 30 percent have yet to enter the
traditional work force after receiving their diplomas, the survey
shows.</P>
      <P>Asked if they have ever been jobless, 44.64 percent of those
polled said "yes, " compared with 55.36 percent who did not. On
average, college graduates experience a five-month waiting period
before landing jobs.</P>

their parents, compared with 12.78 percent who said they do not.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh forecast Monday
that the opposition "pan-blue alliance" might split following
a Tuesday vote on a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Hsieh
claimed that the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Part (PFP) is set to split should some lawmakers be
disciplined for having failed to cast a "yes" vote to oust Chen.</P>
      <P>If this happens, it is very possible that some lawmakers will
quit the two parties, Hsieh forecast, pointing out that in that case,
it will be also impossible to launch a no-confidence vote to topple
the Cabinet as a means of maintaining pressure on Chen to force him
to step down.</P>
      <P>Hsieh blamed the "pan-blue alliance" for calling the presidential
recall vote, because doing so is against the present world trend that
suggests co-existence backed up by dialogue, negotiations and
conciliation to replace confrontation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will lose its advantages on the world stage because of the
fierce infighting at a time when the rest of the world is engaged in
cooperation, he contended.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the "pan-blue alliance" has failed to
notice this point and does not sense that the presidential recall
vote will further fan ethnic confrontation in Taiwan, he said,
warning that this will be a huge crisis for the country.</P>
      <P>The former premier made the remarks on the eve of a presidential
recall vote at the Legislative Yuan -- the first of its kind in

prior to the legislature voting on the recall motion. He will answer

      <P>The recall motion was introduced by legislators of the main
opposition Kuomintang with the support of their PFP allies after the

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER TO SEEK GRAND JUSTICES' CLARIFICATION ON RECALL CLAUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislator is drafting a motion asking the panel of grand justices to
explain whether the second clause in the Constitution has deprived
people of the right to recall the president and vice president.</P>
      <P>John Wu told reporters that with the support of the KMT's
legislative caucus, he will introduce such a motion after the
legislature votes Tuesday on the proposed recall of President Chen
Shui-bian on grounds he can no longer lead the country effectively
after some senior aides and family members were investigated in a
series of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>The recall motion appears unlikely to pass the legislature
because, according to the Constitution's second clause, a two-thirds
majority vote is required before the issue can be put to a national
referendum.</P>
      <P>Wu said he intends to ask the grand justices to explain whether
the second clause has "violated the spirit of the Constitution,"
because voters who can select the president and vice president
through direct elections cannot institute a motion to recall them and
have to wait for the legislature to adopt such a motion before they
can vote on the issue in a national referendum.</P>
      <P>He said the threshold to pass a recall motion in the legislature
is currently too high, making it impossible for Taiwan's voters to
exercise their constitutional right.</P>
      <P>Wu added that if the grand justices' interpretation says the
"indirect democracy" prescribed by the second clause of the
Constitution is unconstitutional, the KMT will propose a motion to
amend the Public Officials Election and Recall Law, granting voters
the right to directly introduce a motion to recall the president and
vice president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPEAKER CALLS FOR RESPECTING OUTCOME OF RECALL VOTE(repeat)</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
urged supporters of the country's two rival political camps Monday to
respect the outcome of the upcoming legislative vote on a motion to
recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"No matter what the result turns out to be, supporters of the
'pan-green' and 'pan-blue' camps should respect the parliamentary
resolution, " Wang appealed on the eve of a closely watched vote on
the opposition-led recall motion.</P>
      <P>Noting the legislature's Committee of the Whole finalized
screening of the recall motion earlier in the day, Wang said he is
hopeful all lawmakers will cast their ballot in a responsible way and
based on prudent judgment.</P>
      <P>"During the voting procedures, proponents and opponents of the
motion should remain calm, rational and peaceful," Wang added.</P>
      <P>As both the opposition "pan-blue" alliance of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (PFP) -- which initiated the recall
motion -- and the "pan-green" camp led by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party will mobilize their loyalists to rally on the issue
outside the legislature Tuesday, Wang said all demonstrators should
respect and accept the vote's outcome and refrain from any drastic
actions.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is now a liberal democracy that values the rule of law
and denounces violence," Wang said, adding he keenly hopes locals and
politicians of all political stripes will work together after the
recall vote to create a stable, harmonious environment that is
favorable to economic development.</P>
      <P>The recall campaign was triggered by allegations of corruption in
President Chen's family. His son-in-law, Chao Chien-min, was arrested
May 24 and is being held under detention while being investigated on
suspicions of insider trading.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan began an unprecedented
vote Tuesday on an opposition-initiated recall motion against
President Chen Shui-bian for incompetence and corruption allegations
against his family and close associates.</P>
      <P>The vote was being held amid tight security as 5,000 police
officers were deployed to prevent possible clashes between supporters
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -led "pan-green
camp" and the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party who had converged outside the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Around 60 KMT lawmakers shouted slogans such as "clean politics
to save Taiwan, " "against corruption" and "President Chen Shui-bian
must step down," prior to the vote in the legislature.</P>
      <P>They also unveiled white banners emblazoned with the words
"supporting President Chen Shui-bian is supporting corruption" and
"supporting the president is a real disgrace."</P>
      <P>The vote began at 9: 10 a.m. and was expected to last 90 minutes.
Legislators received ballots printed with a serial number, their
names and two options -- "yes" or "no" to the recall motion.</P>
      <P>In inter-party consultations, it was agreed that one legislator
from each party would be sent to monitor the vote. The
representatives selected were Kuo Su-chun from the KMT, Ko Shu-ming
from the PFP, Kuo Lin-yung from the TSU. The DPP and the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union decided not to send representatives.</P>
      <P>Legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a former KMT vice chairman,

creating national turmoil."</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus decided not to enter the legislative

      <P>Ma lashed out at President Chen for refusing to give a written

26 and instead resorting to a televised address in order to, in the
president's words, "report to the people, " while denying the public
the right to express their views through a national referendum on the
recall motion.</P>
      <P>The recall motion is unlikely to pass as the "pan-blue alliance"
only holds a slim majority in the 221-seat legislature, far short of
the two-thirds required for the motion to pass and be put to a

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both the Hsinchu county government and city
government have decided to set up drug prevention and control centers
to facilitate their campaign against drug abuse and trafficking.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin and Hsinchu City Mayor
Lin Cheng-tzer unveiled their plans during a meeting with Minister of
Justice Shih Mao-lin Monday.</P>
      <P>Both Cheng and Lin invited Shih to preside over the inauguration
ceremonies for their respective drug prevention and control centers
next month.</P>
      <P>Shih praised the two local government chiefs for their innovative
efforts in the battle against drugs, adding that he believes that the
establishment of the centers will upgrade efficiency in helping drug
addicts quit their vice and in facilitating one-on-one counseling
service.</P>
      <P>The war against drugs has become more urgent as many new types of
drugs have appeared on the streets, drug users and drug traffickers
are starting at a younger age, and the ratio of repeat and serial
offenders is on the rise in Taiwan, Shih said. He added that the
sharing of needles among drug users has accelerated the spread of
HIV/AIDS.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Shih noted, many robberies and violent crimes are
related to drugs, adding that drugs thus pose a grave threat to
public order. Against this backdrop, he said, the Executive Yuan has
made anti-drug operations a major part of its ongoing campaign to
improve law and order in the country.</P>
      <P>Shih encouraged the Hsinchu city and county governments to
promote community "living camps" to help young student drug abusers
and school dropouts to get back on track.</P>
      <P>Other city and county governments are also expected to follow
suit to boost the national campaign against drug abuse and
trafficking, Shih added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun expressed the hope Tuesday that he can meet with
opposition leaders to discuss major bills related to the people's
welfare now that the political turmoil triggered by an
opposition-initiated recall motion against President Chen
Shui-bian has come to an end. </P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks after an unprecedented vote on whether to put
a recall motion to a national referendum failed to pass the
legislature with only 119 lawmakers voting in favor of the motion,
far short of the required two-thirds of all legislators in the
221-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>With the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) only maintaining a slim majority in the
legislature, the result of the recall vote was "predictable, " Yu
said, although he added that he felt "no joy at heart, as there is no
winner in this vote."</P>
      <P>Saying that political turmoil has a huge social cost, he said
that "the end of the recall motion in the legislature should also be
the end of inter-party strife and the start of getting things done."</P>
      <P>Yu said he hopes he can meet with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and
PPF Chairman James Soong to exchange views so as to "do something
useful for the people."</P>
      <P>He lamented that since the extraordinary session of the
legislature convened June 13, it has achieved nothing.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT and the PFP really have the interests of the people
at heart, they should start inter-party consultations to promote
bills related to the public's welfare and the bills' budgets."</P>
      <P>The opposition should at least pass the special budget for a
flood-fighting bill before the extraordinary session ends June 30, Yu
added.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that
none of the priority bills the party listed have passed since the
extraordinary session began.</P>
      <P>Ker said that Ma should take the biggest responsibility. Since Ma
assumed the party chairmanship last year, the rivalry between the
ruling and the opposition parties has been the most serious, he
added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the long-stalled arms procurement bill in the
opposition-controlled legislature, Ker also called for the speedy
passage of the budget for flood-fighting and the restoration of
budgets for some government agencies that have been frozen due to the
opposition of the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>Ker reaffirmed that the nation should return to the normal after

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun hailed "people power" as the major force behind
a thwarted attempt by the opposition to pass a legislative motion for
the recall of President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the comments while publicly announcing the failed passage
of a presidential recall motion initiated by the "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>A total of 119 lawmakers -- including 89 KMT lawmakers and 23 PFP
lawmakers as well as one independent lawmaker and six from the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) -- cast a "yes" vote to recall
Chen at the 211-member Legislative Yuan. But it still fell short of a
two-thirds majority of lawmakers, or 148, for the presidential recall
motion to be put to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the drop in public approval ratings for KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and his party indicate the average voter is fed
up with political infighting. Yu promised the DPP would cooperate
with its "pan-green" partner, the TSU, to work in the public interest
and on improving Taiwan's economy and democracy.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the outcome of the presidential recall vote,
which was aimed at ousting Chen over a string of corruption
allegations involving his family members and close aides, was
foreseen, Yu said that the DPP was not content with the results
because "no one is the winner -- the ruling party, the opposition,
the people nor the country."</P>
      <P>Now that the presidential recall vote has failed in the
legislature, it is time to end politicking and social upheaval and to
begin doing something in the public interest, Yu said, voicing hope
of meeting with Ma and PFP Chairman James Soong to discuss such
quality of life issues.</P>
      <P>"If the people of Taiwan are really important to the KMT and PFP,
they should agree to resume inter-party negotiations to pass more
budgets and bills related to people's welfare during the Legislative
Yuan's current extra session -- such as a budget bill pertaining to a
flood control project," Yu proposed.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman also called for swift passage of a major
military procurement bill and three sunshine laws if the pan-blue
alliance really wants to build a clean Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Don't let the extra legislative session come up empty-handed
before it ends June 30, " he urged, calling on the pan-blue camp to

    <HEADLINE>KMT CAREFULLY MULLING NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION AGAINST GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Tuesday his party has not ruled out the possibility of
proposing a no-confidence motion against the government of President
Chen Shui-bian, but said the strategy must be "carefully studied."</P>
      <P>The issue needs careful evaluation because it might bring about
an "idling period" of the government, as rules on the election of a
new legislature -- which would likely follow the toppling of the
premier in the wake of a no-confidence vote -- have not been set, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after the legislature failed to pass an
opposition-led motion to recall the president. He urged the president
to "know the right thing to do" and not to "become a liability to the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party," or DPP.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, more than 1.7 million Taiwanese adults have
signed a petition calling on Chen to step down to take moral and
political responsibility over his senior aides and son-in-law's
suspected involvement in various corruption scandals currently under
investigation by judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>He said his party's 89 legislators will call town hall meetings
in their constituencies to explain to voters the need to "protect
Taiwan with politics based on integrity" and urging them to
"resuscitate Taiwan's core values."</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Ma said the KMT encourages officials involved in
the investigation to do their jobs professionally and
conscientiously.</P>
      <P>"We're not trying to interfere in their judicial work. We're just
encouraging them to do their jobs properly," he added.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he said if President Chen became a burden to
the DPP, he would be "contributing to the continuation of the party's
decline and holding it hostage," Ma said.</P>
      <P>As for the KMT, he said although the recall motion had failed, it
set a democratic example of "a direct exercise of people power."</P>
      <P>"It may not have been a successful exercise. But the KMT has
played its role as an opposition party," he said.</P>
      <P>Its next step? He said he will not exclude the possibility of
proposing a no-confidence vote against the premier, another recall
motion or impeachment proceedings against the president.</P>
      <P>A no-confidence vote, which requires only half of the
legislature's 221 votes, may result in a change of premier or trigger

    <HEADLINE>CHEN URGES SPEEDY PASSAGE OF PENDING LEGISLATION AFTER RECALL VOTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called for a
"return to normal" and for ruling and opposition parties to engage in
rational discussion on major bills related to the public's welfare
after opposition attempts to recall him through a presidential recall
motion failed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The president made the appeal after the opposition-led motion
failed to pass the legislature, with only 119 votes in favor of the
recall, far short of the required two-thirds majority approval in the
221-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>The embattled president said that because the opposition put
the recall motion at the top of the agenda, major bills related to
the public's welfare have yet to be reviewed since the extraordinary
legislative session convened on June 13.</P>
      <P>He urged all political parties to "return to rationality" after
the recall vote and to speedily pass the pending legislation.</P>
      <P>President Chen also said that whether he personally stays or
leaves is unimportant, and that he respects the process and results
of the recall motion as long as it adheres to the Constitution. He
apologized to the public for the hefty social costs of the recall
bid, which the opposition launched in response to a series of
corruption allegations against Chen's family and close associates.</P>
      <P>The president urged all parties to respect the results of the
recall vote and to placate the most fervent supporters so that
Taiwan can return to a "normal and tranquil state" soon.</P>
      <P>As for ongoing judicial investigations into a series of
corruption scandals -- which have implicated Chen's former deputy
secretary-general and son-in-law -- the president urged faith in the
nation's judicial system.</P>
      <P>Let the judicial authorities uphold justice without interference,
he urged.</P>
      <P>He expressed concern that a social divide has deepened due to the
recent political turmoil, which has seriously undermined internal
unity and solidarity.</P>
      <P>Expressing his desire to mend his ways, he also reaffirmed that
he would contribute to Taiwan's solidarity by promoting inter-party
consultation and cross-strait talks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court allowed a Taipei
city councilor of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who
has been implicated in several extortion cases to be released on
NT$800,000 bail Tuesday, but barred him from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Public prosecutors interrogated Lo Tsung-sheng and two of his
aides for 13 hours Monday after searching their residences and
offices in response to complaints they had extorted money from a
number of construction companies between the years 2002 and 2004.</P>
      <P>The prosecution filed a request in court for Lo's detention on
grounds the crime involved is a felony and that he should be
prevented from colluding with witnesses.</P>
      <P>However, the court ruled the witnesses in the cases are all
"hostile witnesses," and that there should be no apprehension about
Lo colluding with them.</P>
      <P>The court allowed Lo to be released on NT$800,000 bail but
prohibited him from leaving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Four construction companies have alleged they were forced to pay
Lo millions of new Taiwan dollars so he would keep mum about their
unlawful dumping of construction debris.</P>
      <P>They claim that Lo and his aides used their access to files at
the Maintenance Office of the city government's Department of Public
Works to obtain information about which construction companies were
found to have illegally dumped construction waste.</P>
      <P>Lo and his aides would then allegedly demand money from the
companies and threaten to blow the whistle on them if they did not
cooperate.</P>
      <P>According to the construction companies, Lo would accept the cash
and pretend that he "borrowed" the money from them by writing a check
to each of them, but the checks would always bounce.</P>
      <P>The owners of the construction companies said they decided to
tell prosecutors everything because they had had enough of Lo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE REMAINS OPTION FOR KMT: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Calling a no-confidence vote to topple the
Cabinet remains one of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) options to
pressure President Chen Shui-bian to step down, but the "pan blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) need to further
negotiate over when and under what conditions to do so, KMT
legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pan made the remarks in response to PFP Chairman James Soong's
urging that the two parties should launch a no-confidence vote at the
Legislative Yuan as a follow-up move to keep the pressure on Chen
after a "pan-blue alliance"-led motion to recall Chen failed to pass
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Although a no-confidence vote requires the endorsement of only
half of the 211 lawmakers, Pan said that "the possible consequences
must be fully gauged in advance."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the KMT and the PFP share the same stance -- that
Chen must step down -- she said, however, that "a no-confidence vote
is not being considered for the time being" by the KMT.</P>
      <P>The KMT has no fear of facing a new legislature election which
might be called by the president in the wake of a no-confidence vote,
but the party must carefully weigh how to respond to Chen's naming of
a new premier if he chooses not to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, Pan
pointed out.</P>
      <P>In addition, she said, accompanying measures have yet to be put
in place for a new legislative election, which could also be a point
of contention.</P>
      <P>Responding to Pan's comments, PFP legislative caucus whip Lee
Hung-jun said his party will continue to seek KMT lawmakers'
cooperation in proposing a no-confidence vote at the Legislative Yuan
so that a new legislative election can be held.</P>
      <P>Believing the "pan-blue alliance" is sure to won a two-thirds
majority in the new election, Lee said "A new legislature backed up
by new public mandante can recall Chen successfully, " adding that
"the PFP stands firm on its position of calling a no-confidence vote
to topple the Cabinet, so as to push Chen to dissolve the Legislative
Yuan and allow the various political parties to be examined by the
public again."</P>
      <P>Judging from Chen's statement issued following the recall vote
result at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said that "Chen apparently fails
to realize that the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
lawmakers' decision to cast invalid votes is an indication that
former President Lee Teng-hui -- the TSU's spiritual leader -- is no
longer willing to back the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)."</P>
      <P>The abstention of all 86 DPP lawmakers from the vote further
underlines the fact that "the 119 votes cast were all in favor of
Chen's recall," Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary for Chen to apologize to the people, and he
should step down voluntarily to stabilize public order, Lee argued.</P>
      <P>Although 89 KMT lawmakers and 23 PFP lawmakers, as well as one
independent lawmaker and six from the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
cast "yes" votes to demand Chen's ouster, the 119 votes still fell
short of the legal threshold of 148 votes, or a two-thirds majority
at the 211-member Legislative Yuan, denying the people the chance to
decide the president's fate in a national referendum.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called for
national reconciliation Tuesday after an opposition-led motion to
recall President Chen Shui-bian failed to muster the two-thirds
majority approval required for the measure to be put to a national
referendum.</P>
      <P>Lu issued a statement calling on ruling and opposition parties to
stop political feuding, "inside and outside" the legislature.</P>
      <P>She also called on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to speed up "house-cleaning efforts" and ethical reform. The party's
image has been tarnished by a spate of corruption scandals in which
President Chen Shui-bian's senior aides and son-in-law are being
investigated for suspected involvement.</P>
      <P>The vice president then called on the public to engage in a
national campaign for "blue sky, green grass, good Taiwan," referring
to the DPP's green logo and main opposition Kuomintang's blue-based
party flag.</P>
      <P>She asked the opposition parties to "understand the ordinary
person's true feelings" and to quickly pass law bills aimed at
improving people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>She said she had intended to comfort the crowd gathering around
the legislature as it voted on the historic recall motion but could
not show up in person as she was not feeling well.</P>
      <P>"My caring for people has not been affected in any way by my
physical condition, " she said after her eye disease flared up again
and she was further stricken by a sudden inflammation of disc nerves
in her back.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung City Government has decided to

hosting the World Games in 2009.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mayor Cheng Wen-lung, who is convener of a city committee

Tuesday that in addition to the changes, the committee is also

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) vowed Tuesday that they will introduce legislation
to slash the allowance for retired presidents and vice presidents by
about 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Legislator Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the KMT's legislative caucus,
said that before the 18-day extra legislative session ends June 30,
the KMT will try to pass an amendment to the current Statute
Governing Preferential Treatment for Retired Presidents and Vice
Presidents.</P>
      <P>According to her, the amendment would reduce the annual allowance
for a retired president -- paid in 12 monthly installments -- by half
to about NT$230,000 (US$7,043) per month.</P>
      <P>The measure is apparently intended as retaliation to the
collective abstention from voting by the 86 legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on a motion to recall President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The recall motion was defeated, although 119 Legislative Yuan
members voted "yes, " including the 89 KMT legislators and 23 People
First Party legislators -- well short of the two-thirds majority
required to pass the motion and refer the issue to a national
referendum.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP want to recall Chen because they claim that
with his senior aides and family members involved in a series of
corruption scandals, he is no longer fit to govern the nation.</P>
      <P>Chen is to retire in 2008 after serving the remaining two years
of his second four-year term. Opposition legislators have complained

      <P>Academia Sinica will begin the second stage
of an operation to construct a "Taiwan Biobank" next year, collecting
biological samples and health information from 15,000 residents in
Miaoli, Chiayi and Hualien counties, an Academia Sinica senior
researcher said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Academia Sinica, the first stage -- scheduled from
August 2005 to July 2006 -- should collect samples from 1,000 people
to evaluate the feasibility of the whole project. However, due to
some delays in the review process, the 1,000 samples have yet to be
gathered.</P>
      <P>The biobank -- constructed and operated by the Biomedical
Science Institute of Academia Sinica -- starts with 15,000 initial 
volunteers, with the hope that a maximum of 200,000 entries will
eventually be gathered.</P>
      <P>The official said the biobank, based on a pool of native genes,
aims to run mass-scale, cross-generation studies to understand the
interconnections between Taiwanese and the local environment,
enhancing the efficacy of disease prevention, diagnosis and
treatment.</P>
      <P>He said that although a dozen countries -- such as Japan, the
United States, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Singapore --
have already established similar biobanks, the study results are
confined to specific groups of people and are not necessarily
applicable to Taiwanese, hence the need for the local operation.</P>
      <P>In response to several ethical issues raised by local
non-governmental organizations, the official claimed that Academia
Sinica values the protection of privacy and human rights before all
else, adding that the biobank will not be initialed if there are any
doubts among the general public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DUST STORMS INCREASE AMOUNT OF AIRBORNE BACTERIA: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 27 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The amount of bacteria and fungal spores in
the atmosphere tend to increase by at least six times whenever a dust
storm hits Taiwan, according to the results of a study released
Tuesday by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Every year during the period between January and May, Taiwan is
susceptible to dust storms originating in the desert
region of northern China, which worsens the air quality and
becomes a major source of allergies.</P>
      <P>In March and April, the EPA sampled and tested dust in the air of
Wanli, Taipei County -- the first place that the dust storms normally
affect -- and found that the amount of bacteria and fungal spores was
five to six times higher compared with when there are no dust storms
and that the amount of spores was 20 times that of bacteria, EPA
officials said.</P>
      <P>According to Yen Jung-hua, an associate research fellow at the
EPA's Environmental Analysis Laboratory, six to 12 additional kinds
of bacteria and fungal spores were discovered during the dust storm
period, they said.</P>
      <P>The EPA said these microorganisms are able to survive because the
coverage by thick dust clouds significantly reduces their exposure to
ultraviolet rays.</P>
      <P>Hung Wen-tzung, a section chief at the Environmental Analysis
Laboratory, said it requires further observation to see if the
increase in the amount of bacteria and fungal spores in the
atmosphere has any direct impact on human health.</P>
      <P>Hung said the EPA is also planning to study the possibility of
viruses being transmitted via dust storms.</P>
      <P>However, unlike fungal spores, viruses die in a short period of
time after leaving their hosts, which leaves little chance of viruses
such as the bird flu virus to invade Taiwan via dust storms, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SMALL PARTY CREATES BIG WAVE IN TAIWAN POLITICSBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> James Soong, leader of the opposition People First Party (PFP) ,
hurled himself into another political battle Tuesday by calling for a
no-confidence motion against the government after the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" failed to muster two-thirds of the legislative
votes needed to call a referendum to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The PFP's 23 lawmakers joined 89 Kuomintang (KMT) colleagues in
the "pan-blue alliance" in the historic vote. Even though the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union and independents stood on their side,
the resulting 119 ballots fell far short of the 148 threshold in the
221-seat Legislative Yuan needed to put the motion to a national
referendum.</P>
      <P>Soong appears to be betting his political future on continuing to
creating waves in Taiwan politics, calculating that a toppled Cabinet
would trigger a re-election of the legislature in which the
opposition could win more than two-thirds of the 113 seats up for
grabs, with which it could launch another motion to recall Chen.</P>
      <P>The KMT has been forced to follow his lead in the just-ended
"first phase" recall campaign because that was what the people wanted
-- a chance for the ruling DPP to separate itself from the president,
whose credibility is very much in doubt after his senior aides and
son-in-law have been investigated on corruption charges, Soong
claims.</P>
      <P>Soong claims that he did not "kidnap" the KMT into voting for the
recall motion. Now that it has failed in the legislature because of
the ruling DPP's boycott, the DPP government should be toppled for
endorsing a scandal-ridden president, he said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was downplaying the
urgency of filing a no-confidence vote against Premier Su
Tseng-chang, although he did not rule out the possibility altogether,
choosing instead to return to his "modest and rational"
middle-of-the-road policy line.</P>
      <P>For this flip-flop, Ma has been criticized for "being not bold
enough and lacking in action ability, " as new polls indicate a drop
of 19 percentage points in his support rating. But he knows the
recall campaign missed support from the DPP legislators because Chen,
seeing not enough evidence to implicate him and his wife, was able to
portray it as an opposition attempt to "seize power" from his
"pro-Taiwan regime."</P>
      <P>Ma called for a "truce" in political feuding, in tune,
ironically, with the president's overture to his political rivals.
After months of political shouting and street rallies, people do need
a good rest now, both sides claim.</P>
      <P>But KMT insiders claim this would be a chance to "wait for the
DPP rebels who want to save the party to demand Chen's head" -- when
the opposition will be given more room for maneuvering against the
president.</P>
      <P>A seemingly unperturbed Chen was already waiting for the
"reconciliation" game to start, throwing out olive branches for
"political consultation" at home and even "peace talks" with China,
Taiwan's arch-rival. Ma has turned down an invitation from DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun for the party leaders to meet.</P>
      <P>Ma could ignore the DPP's "peace" offer, but he will run into
trouble if he ignores the PFP's insistence on launching a
no-confidence motion on a government that "cannot tell the difference
between a questionable leader and its need to govern."</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A wise and good man, whether
dealing with a few people or many, with great matters or with small,
is never presumptuous and never regards anything as beneath his
notice or as unworthy of serious and careful attention -- that is
what is meant by being dignified without being supercilious."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang on Wednesday urged
the Legislative Yuan to pass major budgets worth a total of NT$3.8
trillion (US$116.56 billion) before the current extraordinary session
ends June 30.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to the NT$3.7 trillion budget for state-owned
enterprises, NT$100.7 billion for major infrastructure projects, and
NT$44.9 billion for flood-prevention works, including the dredging of
Shihmen Reservoir and its water collection areas in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the budgets should have been passed in the last
legislative session which ended in late May, pointing out that this
is the reason why the Executive Yuan had requested the holding of an
extraordinary legislative session, which began June 13.</P>
      <P>Noting that the month-long political turmoil triggered by the
opposition-initiated recall motion against President Chen Shui-bian
came to an end Tuesday, with the motion failing to gain the required
support of two-thirds of all lawmakers in a legislative vote, Su said
the nation must "return to the normal."</P>

the government to "get down to the real work at hand."</P>
      <P>Su said he hopes the legislature will pass the budgets as failure

billion, economic growth would be cut by 0.15 percent and the
unemployment rate would rise by 0.1 percent.</P>

opposition-backed campaign to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a luncheon with a group of Taiwanese
businesspeople in the United Kingdom, the vice minister said that the
chaotic situation in Taiwan's politics is an inevitable phenomenon in
the process of democratization and that Taiwan's democratic
development has been smooth compared with that of other countries.</P>
      <P>Although the turmoil has caused fluctuations in the financial
market, the fundamentals of Taiwan's economy remain sound, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that private sector investment, which is a major force
in Taiwan's economic development, was valued at NT$510 billion
(US$15.64 billion) between January and May, accounting for 57 percent
of the target amount set for this year.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's exports and imports have risen 12.2 percent
and 12.9 percent, respectively, while the unemployment rate for the
first four months of this year dropped to 3.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's economic growth rate is expected to reach at
least 4 percent, which he said is better than that of Europe and
Japan.</P>
      <P>To prevent the hollowing out of Taiwan's economy following the
exodus of local industries, the government has continued to introduce
new industries into Taiwan, including the energy conservation and
renewable energy industries, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government welcomes the return of Taiwanese
businesspeople and has made available a NT$200 billion financing
program to serve their needs, with the interest rate registering
below 3.6 percent for medium-term and long-term loans.</P>
      <P>Also, investors will enjoy preferential tax rates, while the
import of production facilities by investors will also enjoy
preferential tariff treatment, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>London, June 27, (CNA)
(By J.J. Hwang &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Britain Business Council (TBBC)
held its eighth annual meeting in Cambridge, England Tuesday, with a
44-member Taiwan business delegation headed by Taiwan Cement Corp.
Chairman Leslie Koo attending the gathering.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and British entrepreneurs reached many agreements aimed
at enhancing cooperation and exchanges during the one-day meeting,
including working to set up a Web site to boost mutual exchanges,
assisting British pharmaceutical companies to promote their new drugs
in Taiwan, and launching a cooperative effort to bid for construction
projects in the Middle East, according to the council.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Koo indicated that biotechnology,
telecommunications technology, and infrastructure projects were three
major topics of discussion during the meeting.</P>
      <P>Koo said many British businesses have shown great interest in
cooperating with their Taiwanese counterparts in investing in China,
the largest market in Asia, because Taiwanese businesses know the
Chinese market well and have a lot of experience investing there.</P>
      <P>British businesses are also interested in investing in projects
to develop the areas surrounding Taiwan's high speed railway stations
in Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi and Tainan, according to John
Yu, chairman and CEO of Taiwan-based CTCI Corp.</P>
      <P>Yu praised British businesses' capability in transportation
construction, citing as an example the successful transformation of
Canary Wharf in London into a modern financial center.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Representative to Britain Edgar Lin, Deputy Minister of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and Michael Reilly, director general
of the British Trade and Cultural Office, also attended the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T TO STEP UP CRACKDOWN ON CRIME: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that
under a revised criminal code that will take effect July 1, the
government will step up its crackdown on repeat offenders of serious
crimes.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while presiding over a weekly
meeting of the Executive Yuan, noting that several new measures will
take effect July 1 and that related government agencies should step
up the publicity campaign.</P>
      <P>He said that from July 1, a "three strikes" law patterned on that
adopted by many U.S. states will take effect. Anyone convicted of
manslaughter, robbery, kidnapping or other felonies on three or more
separate occasions will not be eligible for parole, which he said
should help deter crime and improve law and order.</P>
      <P>He instructed the Ministry of Justice to publicize the message,
lest people commit crimes without knowing of the consequences.</P>
      <P>The maximum prison sentence will also be raised to 30 years from
the current 20 years, the premier said.</P>
      <P>The stated rationale for the "three strikes" law is that the
automatic and lengthy imprisonment of individuals who commit more
than two felonies is justified on the basis that repeat offenders
pose a threat to public safety.</P>
      <P>On electricity rate hikes scheduled for July 1, Su said the new
measure will not affect families, small shops, elementary schools or
junior high schools that use less than 330 kw/h per month.</P>
      <P>Other new measures will also be put into practice out of concern
for energy conservation or cost efficiency, Su said, urging related
government agencies to step up their publicity drives for the various
measures.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trading decisions of Taiwan's stock
investors are related to their political preferences, according to
the results of a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While 60 percent of respondents supporting the "pan-green camp"
said they would reduce the number of shares they own if the
Legislative Yuan adopted a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian,
more than 50 percent of respondents supporting the "pan-blue
alliance" said they would do the opposite if the motion were adopted.</P>
      <P>The bimonthly "Taiwan investor sentiment index" survey was
conducted by Shih Hsin University in cooperation with the magazine
Business Today on 1,074 stock investors from June 20-22. It has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that the investor sentiment index plunged to
-72.2, down 69.9 points from the previous survey, with the individual
index falling 36.5 points to -16.9 and the economic index declining
33.4 points to -55.3.</P>
      <P>The fall in investor sentiment is the second largest since an
October 2005 survey conducted ahead of the "three-in-one" local
elections, when the index plummeted 70.5 points.</P>
      <P>The survey indicates that "pan-blue" investors were even more
pessimistic about the presidential recall motion than when the
"pan-blue" candidates were defeated in the 2004 presidential
election, with their sentiment index being 77 points lower.</P>
      <P>If the recall motion were adopted, "pan-green" investors think
that it would facilitate the passage of the long-stalled arms
procurement package from the United States and a relaxation of the
country's policy toward China, while "pan-blue" investors think that
it would help achieve clean politics, social justice and judicial
impartiality.</P>

yet to decide whether to subpoena first lady Wu Shu-jen in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City will begin from the second
academic semester in 2006 to offer an education subsidy of NT$500
(US$15) per semester to each public elementary school student in the
city who is the third child or upward in a family, a municipal
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The measure was adopted by the city government Tuesday as part of
efforts to encourage citizens to have children as the birth rate has
been dropping in the capital city over the last several years,
Director of Education Wu Ching-ji said, noting that his department
has planned a budget worth NT$12 million for the upcoming
subsidization next year.</P>
      <P>To boost the birth rate, initiatives have also been proposed by
the city's social affairs bureau and labor department, including a
plan to allow the third child or upward in a family to be given
priority to attend public pre-schools, as well as a proposal to
provide such children aged under six with medical subsidies in a form
of reduced registration fees at hospitals and local clinics.</P>
      <P>Health officials indicated that a budget totalling more than NT$9
million has been planned for the proposed medical subsidies in 2007
and that the proposal will be carried out Jan. 1, 2007, if the city
council approves the budget in the upcoming six months.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the city government showed that "tax cut"
is the most attractive initiative to encourage most citizens to bear
more than one child, with 37.7 percent of those surveyed expressing
their willingness to have more than one child if they are entitled to
such preferential tax treatment.</P>
      <P>The education subsidies raises the interest of 5.8 percent of the
polled citizens to bear a third child, while the priority right to
enter public pre-schools and kindergartens raises the interest of
12.1 percent of the surveyed to have more children.</P>

      <P>Chiayi Mayor Huang Ming-hui will solicit
central government support for a plan to turn an old prison in the
southern city into a prison museum when she attends a meeting of city
and county chiefs in southern Taiwan later this week.</P>
      <P>The central government is expected to send officials to attend
the meeting of eight chiefs, to be held in Luokuei, Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Huang, a legislator-turned-mayor who is the only local chief
among the eight from the opposition Kuomintang, noted that the
Ministry of the Interior designated the old prison as a national
historical relic in 2005, making it Chiayi's only national historical
relic. The other seven chiefs are from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>She said the prison, completed in 1922 when Taiwan was still
under Japanese colonial rule, has a distinctive architectural style.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi city government has applied to the Ministry of Justice
for a subsidy of NT$310 million (US$9.48 million) to turn the old
prison into a museum by 2009 to keep historial documents concerning

      <P>In Friday's meeting, Huang said she will also propose that the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications provide NT$200 million

passengers traveling to and from Chiayi can have easy access to buses

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD BLAMED FOR NO PASSAGE OF KEY BILLS AT LEGISLATURE: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) blamed main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Wednesday for failing to push key bills to pass
an extra legislative session that will end June 30.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming claimed that Ma must be held accountable for the
situation and ascribed the political upheaval to Ma's efforts to
recall President Chen Shui-bian -- the only thing that the extra
legislative session has dealt with up to now since it opened June 20.</P>
      <P>According to Ker, the launch of the recall motion to unseat Chen
was the product of an alignment between what he called an "incapable"
Ma and a "tricky" People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a Soong's insistence that the PFP will continue to
collaborate with the KMT to call a no-confidence vote at the
Legislative Yuan to topple the Cabinet as a follow-up to pressure
Chen to step down, Ker said that it was only "empty talk," given that
the PFP only holds 21 seats at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ker claimed that Ma has been caught in a dilemma after being
"driven by Soong" to make public a three-point set of conditions for
initiating a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet, and cited KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan as saying that "there has been enough of
this farce" -- referring to the two parties' thwarted efforts to boot
out Chen in the Tuesday legislative recall vote.</P>
      <P>"Now that polarized confrontation brought up by the recall motion
has come to an end, it is time for all the political party leaders to
hold dialogue and reconcile," he urged.</P>
      <P>Regarding a news report that Ma met Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
Legislator Lai Hsing-yuan in secret last week prior to the failed
presidential recall vote, Ker said that he has confidence in the TSU
and added that there is "no need to overreact to an groundless
report."
</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, the TSU's so-called "spiritual
leader," was reported to have lost faith in the DPP government, which
has always labeled itself as a "clean and indigenous regime"
dedicated to promoting a distinctive identity for Taiwan and the
people's welfare.</P>
      <P>Ker said that he respected the 12 TSU lawmakers' decision to cast
invalid votes in Tuesday's vote because each political party has to
weigh its future development. "But the TSU was firmly against
launching the presidential recall vote," he argued.</P>
      <P>The DPP and the TSU form the "pan-green camp" as rivals to the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>The vote to recall Chen initiated by the "pan-blue alliance" over
a spate of corruption allegations implicating his family members and
close aides failed at the 221-member Legislative Yuan when only 119
votes were cast in favor of Chen's recall, which would have required
a two-thirds majority approval in order to have the recall motion put
to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>All 86 DPP lawmakers boycotted the vote.</P>
      <P>The different moves by the TSU and the DPP is seen by some as a
sign that the "pan-green camp" has split out of competition to vie
for the support of pro-independence activists.</P>

      <P>The No. 29 Wan An air-raid drill for
northern Taiwan is scheduled to be held early July 6, breaking the
norm of holding the drills in the afternoon, a Ministry of National
Defense spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Chi-fang said the 30-minute drill is scheduled to begin at 5
a.m., when air-raid sirens will sound in cities and counties north
of Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>Wu explained that the Defense Ministry decided to hold the drill
in the early morning to parallel the ongoing Han Kuang Exercise, some
of which involves live-ammunition firing.</P>
      <P>The moving forward of the Wan An air-raid drill schedule is also
based on a scenario that the Chinese People's Liberation Army
launches a surprise attack on Taiwan in the early morning rather than
later in the day, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu appealed to the public not to be angry about the possible
inconveniences that the early morning air-raid drill might cause,
pointing out that the enemy will not invade Taiwan suddenly at a time
that would be "convenient" for anybody.</P>
      <P>The spokesman appealed to the public to take complementary
measures on the early morning air-raid drill July 6, saying that
people "should be prepared for danger in times of peace."</P>
      <P>Wu said the Defense Ministry has communicated with local
governments in advance over the rescheduling of the drill. For
example, he said, the celebrated fish market auction in Keelung will
be closed that morning.</P>
      <P>Traffic restrictions will be imposed in all areas of northern
Taiwan during the drill, with pedestrians and drivers told to clear
the streets and cars ordered to stop. Stores and shops will be told
to close their doors, Wu added.</P>

Israeli Troops Enter Gaza; Bridges Are Hit 

Israel sent troops into southern Gaza and
its planes attacked three bridges and a power
station early Wednesday, in an effort to prevent
militants from moving a wounded Israeli soldier
they abducted Sunday, Israeli Army officials
said. Witnesses said Israeli troops had taken
over the old Gaza airport and were heading
toward Rafah on the road that marks the border
between Gaza and Egypt, as Egyptian troops
watched. The Israeli Army said the operation was
limited to an effort to rescue the corporal and 
was not an attempt to reoccupy Gaza.

Wall Street Journal: Core Value, At Apple,
Secrecy Complicates Life But Maintains Buzz

Apple Computer Inc. generates buzz for its
new products by obsessively enforcing a strict
secrecy policy. But the policy can sometimes
leave partners, big customers and even employees
in the dark. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., 
mostly keeps its plans for new products to
itself. It rigidly compartmentalizes itself so
that even its own employees don't find out about
coming products. It has fired and later sued
workers who leaked information about unannounced

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) denied Wednesday a claim by a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislator that the legislature has become
"lethargic."</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, secretary-general of the KMT's legislative caucus,
told DPP lawmaker Ko Chien-ming to stop making false accusations
against the opposition.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP is sincere in reaching a consensus on major budget
bills, then on Friday it should not try to boycott all other major
bills being debated at the legislature and help pass them together, "
she said.</P>
      <P>Pan was responding to Ko's earlier accusation that the
legislature's extra session has achieved nothing except a vote on the
opposition-initiated motion to recall the president. If the session
ends up without passing any bills, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou should
be held responsible, he charged.</P>
      <P>Pan pointed out that all parties have agreed to pass two budget
bills for flood-control projects, a government proposal to spend
NT$500 billion over five years on various national development
projects and a budget for state-owned enterprises by June 30.</P>
      <P>She emphasized that negotiations over the bill on the budget for
state-owned businesses were still going on that day, and questioned
how this could be perceived as "legislative lethargy."</P>
      <P>Pan said Ko had pledged to deal with all of the 14 bills put
forward by the KMT during the extra session of the Legislative Yuan.
The DPP should not boycott talks over these bills -- including an
amendment for setting up direct transportation links across the
Taiwan Strait and another amendment on the statute governing the
treatment and privileges of retired presidents and vice presidents.</P>
      <P>She added that whichever party attempts to boycott the normal
legislative process should be held accountable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT OFFICIALS SUPPORT CAUTIOUS ATTITUDE TOWARD NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two central standing committee members of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Wednesday that they support KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's desire to maintain a cautious attitude toward
proposing a no-confidence motion against Premier Su Tseng-chang and
his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Lee Chi-chu and Wu Yu-sheng, who are also KMT legislators, made
the remarks on the sidelines of a regular weekly meeting of the KMT
Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Ma reaffirmed his cautious attitude toward a no-confidence
motion, in contrast with the keen stance of James Soong, chairman of
the People First Party, an ally of the KMT in the opposition
"pan-blue alliance." Soong vowed to pursue the no-confidence motion
after a recall motion against President Chen Shui-bian failed to pass
a day earlier because only 119 legislators were in favor of the
motion, far short of the required two-thirds in the 221-seat
legislature.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that if the no-confidence motion succeeds after getting
the endorsement of half of the legislators, the president could
either name a new premier to replace Su -- which would anger the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party because Su represents the best
hope of the party in the 2008 presidential election -- or dissolve
the legislature to force a new election within three months.</P>
      <P>In the latter case, she said the administration would be left in
a vacuum, which would not be good for the nation.</P>
      <P>The next legislature will face a new electoral system, which is
said to be unfavorable to minority parties such as the PFP, as the
number of seats will be halved to 113 and a "single constituency, and
two votes" system will be adopted.</P>
      <P>On Ma's approval rating slipped to less than 50 percent after the
recall vote -- down from more than 60 percent in late March -- Lee
said that any reforms will invoke different reactions, which she
said is "nothing to worry about."</P>
      <P>Wu said the recall motion has drawn criticism, has polarized the
rivalry between the ruling and opposition parties, and needs to be
reviewed to avoid similar faults at the next stage.</P>
      <P>Wu also said the best timing to topple the Cabinet hinges not on
the will of Ma or the determination of Soong, but on public opinion
and the results of a probe into the series of corruption allegations
that triggered the recall motion in the first place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STRIKES CONSIDERED TO DEMAND PRESIDENT'S OUSTER: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
will continue holding activities and might consider calling on the
public to stage strikes in markets, workplaces and on campuses to
force President Chen Shui-bian to step down, PFP legislative caucus
whip Lu Hsueh-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Lu said
that the PFP agrees with the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's)
call for a return to a centrist party line after a presidential
recall vote failed to clear the Legislative Yuan a day earlier. He
argued, however, that this does not mean everything should be put on
hold.</P>
      <P>From now on, the PFP will join efforts with social activists to
forge national consensus and promote a movement calling for Chen's
ouster, in addition to moves made through debate in the legislature,
Lu said, reiterating the PFP's stance that Chen should "behave
himself" by voluntarily stepping down from the presidency.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmakers' boycott of the Tuesday presidential recall vote
"proves" that they acknowledge that Chen is corrupt.</P>
      <P>The vote initiated by the KMT and the PFP to remove Chen over a
string of corruption allegations involving his family members and
close aides failed at the Legislative Yuan due to the lack of support
from the "pan-green" lawmakers of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity
Union.</P>
      <P>A total of 119 votes were cast in favor of Chen's recall, but the
number fell short of a two-thirds majority approval to put the vote
to a national referendum to allow the people to decide Chen's fate.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's ally in the "pan-green camp" --
and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) both denied Wednesday that
the two parties had a secret contact before Tuesday's vote in the
legislature on a motion to recall president Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The two parties issued the denials in separate news conferences
in reaction to reports that TSU Legislator Lai Hsing-yuan and Chang
Jung-feng, vice president of Chung Hua Institution for Economic
Research, met with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou secretly for one hour
last week and relayed a message from former President Lee Teng-hui,
the "spiritual leader" of the TSU.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said she did not know why there was
rumor of a secret TSU-KMT meeting and stressed that the KMT had made
no contact with the TSU prior to the recall vote.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Lo Chih-ming said he suspected it was
probably started by DPP members who were unhappy about the 12 TSU
legislators who cast invalid ballots in the recall vote.</P>
      <P>Lo declined to say whether the TSU would work with the KMT to
topple the Cabinet on the condition that Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng be named the next premier.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment, Wang said the reports were mere conjecture and
refused to comment on hypothetical questions.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will instead focus his attention on issues on the
legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>The recall motion, prompted by a series of corruption scandals
implicating the president's senior officials and family members, was
defeated because the vote fell short of the two-thirds majority
required for its passage.</P>
      <P>Although the victory could provide the president with temporary
relief from pressure to step down, political analysts claimed that
the vote result was a "disgrace" for him because none of the 221
Legislative Yuan members voted against the motion, while 119
legislators -- more than half -- voted "yes," with 14 invalid votes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is in tune
with its ally, the People First Party (PFP), in its determination to
unseat President Chen Shui-bian "in order to save the country from
meeting its doomsday because of a corrupt leadership, " a KMT party
whip said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang denied that the KMT is
out of tune with the PFP over the plan to recall Chen and an ensuing
no-confidence motion against his administration after the recall
motion failed the previous day.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP has been pushing
for Chen's recall, believing that the president's credibility is in
tatters as a result of his senior aides and son-in-law being
investigated on corruption charges.</P>
      <P>Pan reiterated that the KMT is maintaining close communications
with the PFP decision makers and will jointly decide "in the shortest
possible period" on when to launch a no-confidence motion in the
"most workable fashion" to topple the Cabinet now that the
"pan-blues" have failed to muster the two-thirds of the legislative
votes needed to call a referendum to recall the president.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association
said Wednesday it was helping farmers export 200 metric tons of
bananas to China as its price was hitting a new low in the local
market.</P>
      <P>Association officials said they had reached an agreement with a
Chinese business group to buy Taiwan bananas at NT$11.1 per kilogram
as exports to Japan dropped to NT$10 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Fruit Marketing Cooperative was purchasing
bananas from growers at that price, but only about one-third of the
output qualified for the Japanese market, with the rest crowding into
the local market at NT$2.5 per kilogram, a price farmers said was
insufficient even to cover their costs.</P>
      <P>The officials said they would like to help sell more surplus
bananas to China, after the 200 metric tons have been loaded for
shipment.</P>
      <P>Last year, typhoons and heavy rains hit Kaohsiung County -- where
banana farming was concentrated -- and its price soared at one point
to N$50/kilogram.</P>
      <P>That attractive price lured many farmers to grow bananas this
year, resulting in the current surplus.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh, who has been
drafted by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to run for
Taipei mayor, said Wednesday he will find a new definitive role for
Taipei if elected.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Hsieh also presented his vision for
Taipei's development, promising to "revitalize old communities while
fostering amity in new communities."</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who stepped down from the premiership in late January,
said he doesn't feel frustrated or "wronged" by the party's decision
on his joining the year-end Taipei mayoral race.</P>
      <P>Defying comments that his Taipei mayoral bid would be an uphill
battle, Hsieh said he has full confidence in the success of his
pursuit.</P>
      <P>"When I first ran for Kaohsiung mayor eight years ago, few
thought I could beat the incumbent Kuomintang mayor. I was undaunted
by all those pessimistic forecasts and I finally made it," Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>During his six years as Kaohsiung mayor until assuming the
premiership in February 2005, Hsieh said he consistently ranked among
the top three best-performing or most popular local government chiefs
in various public opinion polls. Sometimes, Hsieh said, his ratings
even surpassed that of charismatic Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>With experience in presiding over many successful projects in
Kaohsiung, including the arduous cleanup of Love River and the
improvement of drinking water, Hsieh said he is confident he will
bring new hope to Taipei.</P>
      <P>As the country's capital, Hsieh said Taipei is the envy of other
cities and counties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taipei is our political and economic nerve center. It has
all sorts of developmental advantages."</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh lamented that Taipei now faces some "crises,"
including a population exodus and a graying population, as well as a
decline in the city's international competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Claiming Taipei's relatively lackluster development in recent
years could be attributed to Ma's failure to carve out a definitive
role for the city.</P>
      <P>"During my tenure as Kaohsiung mayor, I defined the port city as
Taiwan's maritime capital. With this definitive goal in mind, all
infrastructural construction projects, urban landscaping, harbor
development plans and water sports facilities are designed in clear
tandem with this goal," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Although Ma once announced his plan to build Taipei into a
"healthy city," Hsieh said, although the city's current mayor has
failed to flesh out a clear definition for that plan. Consequently,
Hsieh argued, Taipei lacks its own "distinctive identity and style."</P>
      <P>Worse still, Hsien said, Ma -- who concurrently serves as
chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang -- has turned Taipei into
a "battlefield of political dogfighting" by taking part in unlawful
assemblies and demonstrations.</P>
      <P>In the past, Hsieh said, the mayor of Taipei never personally
took part in any political strife. Regrettably, Hsieh said, Ma has
broken this "time-honored tradition" by playing a key role in the
recent political turmoil whipped up by the KMT-led motion to recall
President Chen Shui-bian over corruption allegations against members
of his family and staff.</P>
      <P>"As the chief of a local government, the mayor should play the
role of arbitrator, mediator or conciliator. With Ma assuming a dual
role, Taipei has become a battlefield for political strife. This is a
setback in Taipei's development," Hsieh said, adding that Taipei
should not be a hub of political wrangling and should instead focus
on cultural and economic development.</P>
      <P>"Let's ward off politics while ushering in more economic and
cultural activities," Hsieh said, adding that his mayoral campaign
platform will focus on offering his visions and strategies for
helping Taipei regain its glamour as an "economic capital with trust,
love, culture and style."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CANDIDATE VOWS TO FIND TAIPEI'S 'DEFINITIVE ROLE'(Repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh, who has been
drafted by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to run for
Taipei mayor, said Wednesday he will find a new definitive role for
Taipei if elected.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Hsieh also presented his vision for
Taipei's development, promising to "revitalize old communities while
fostering amity in new communities."</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who stepped down from the premiership in late January,
said he doesn't feel frustrated or "wronged" by the party's decision
on his joining the year-end Taipei mayoral race.</P>
      <P>Defying comments that his Taipei mayoral bid would be an uphill
battle, Hsieh said he has full confidence in the success of his
pursuit.</P>
      <P>"When I first ran for Kaohsiung mayor eight years ago, few
thought I could beat the incumbent Kuomintang mayor. I was undaunted
by all those pessimistic forecasts and I finally made it, " Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>During his six years as Kaohsiung mayor until assuming the
premiership in February 2005, Hsieh said he consistently ranked among
the top three best-performing or most popular local government chiefs
in various public opinion polls. Sometimes, Hsieh said, his ratings
even surpassed that of charismatic Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>With experience in presiding over many successful projects in
Kaohsiung, including the arduous cleanup of the city's trademark Love
River and the improvement of drinking water, Hsieh said he is
confident he will bring new hope to Taipei.</P>
      <P>As the country's capital, Hsieh said, Taipei is the envy of other
cities and counties in Taiwan. "Taipei is our political and economic
nerve center. It has all sorts of developmental advantages, " he
noted.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh lamented that Taipei now faces some "crises, "
including demographic changes and a decline in the city's
international competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Claiming Taipei's relatively lackluster development in recent
years is rooted in Ma's failure to carve out a definitive role for
the city, Hsieh said Taipei is now a city without its own
"distinctive identity and style."</P>
      <P>"During my tenure as Kaohsiung mayor, I defined the port city as
Taiwan's maritime capital. With this definitive goal in mind, all
infrastructural construction projects, urban landscaping, harbor
development plans and water sports facilities are designed in clear
tandem with this goal," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Although Ma once announced his plan to build Taipei into a
"healthy city, " he has failed to flesh out a clear definition for
that plan, Hsieh said, adding that as a result, Taipei lacks its own
unique identity.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Hsien said, Ma -- who concurrently serves as
chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang -- has turned Taipei into
a "battlefield of political dogfighting" by taking part in "unlawful
assemblies and demonstrations" in person.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 40 illegal foreign workers have
been seized in the southern county of Pingtung in the past few days,
police said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As part of a new round of nationwide crackdown on illegal foreign
workers initiated by the National Police Agency (NPA) , Pingtung
county police launched an all-out search for illegal foreign laborers
in the county last weekend.</P>
      <P>In addition to interviewing owners of factories, small cafeterias
and construction companies, police officers have also combed farms,
orchards, hog ranches and major infrastructure construction sites to
look for absconded foreign workers.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, 40 illegal foreign workers, including those who
have overstayed their visas or absconded from their original jobs,
had been uncovered.</P>
      <P>According to NPA tallies, more than 21,000 absconded foreign
laborers remained at large.</P>
      <P>NPA officials reminded prospective employers that they have to
apply for labor authority approval before hiring foreign workers or
caregivers. Those who are caught to have illegally employed foreign
workers could face a fine of up to NT$750,000 under current
regulations.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) affirmed
Wednesday that Taiwan bananas are firmly in keeping with
international safety standards, denying rumors that a shipment of
Taiwan bananas bound for Japan was returned for having contained
residual pesticides.</P>
      <P>COA officials were responding to a rumor that a batch of bananas
had arrived in Japan and was found to contain high levels of residual
pesticide, and that the whole shipment had been returned to Taiwan in
April.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that in order to meet Japan's new regulations
that took effect May 29, the COA early this year started educating
local farmers about the use of pesticides.</P>
      <P>Moreover, all Japan-bound bananas must pass the COA's lab tests
before being issued export permits, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>COA statistics show that in the first five months of this year,
Taiwan exported 10,324 metric tons of bananas to Japan, down 3.91
percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The banana exports were valued at US$10.9 million, up 48.22

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW MAY BE INDICTED SOON FOR INSIDER TRADING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chao Chien-ming, son-in-law of President
Chen Shui-bian, may soon be indicted on charges of insider trading
and misappropriation of funds as investigators wind up their probes
into a high-profile corruption scandal revolving around the trading
of Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) stocks.</P>
      <P>Investigation results were handed in Thursday morning to
prosecutors at the Taipei District Court, who said Chao and six
others will likely be indicted on charges of violating the securities
exchange law, breach of trust and misappropriation of funds.</P>
      <P>The other six are Chao's father, Chao Yu-chu, who will probably
be charged with insider trading and misappropriation of funds;
Waterland Securities Co. board member Tsai Ching-weng, TDC Chairman
Su Teh-chien and businessman You Shih-yi, who will each likely be
charged with insider trading; and two private companies' top
managers, Chen Ching-yao and Hung Min-sen, both likely to be charged
with breach of trust.</P>
      <P>After more than a month of investigations, investigators have
gained a clear picture of the case and how Chao senior and junior
have been involved in misappropriating funds and their complicated
dealings with the political and business sectors involving huge
amounts of money.</P>
      <P>Judicial sources said Chaos' money dealings with politicians and
businesspeople may lead to charges for other irregularities, such as
influence peddling in connection with the appointments of senior
managers in bank mergers and the awarding of public construction
contracts, suspicions that will be the target of investigators'
"second-phase" probes.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Hsu Yung-chin, who is in charge of investigating the
TDC insider trading case, said he has mapped out a chart indicating
the flows of funds used in the buying and selling of TDC shares based
on the bank accounts of Chao family members and their "business
partners."</P>
      <P>He said the "first-phase" investigations are coming to an end and
that the prosecution may officially lay charges against all the
suspects by the end of this month or early next month at the latest.</P>
      <P>Investigators have found that Chao Chien-ming, Su and Tsai are
the main suspects in the case. As Tsai had confessed almost
everything to the investigative officials, his sentence will likely
be reduced.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, prosecutors will likely request a heavier
sentence for the president's son-in-law who has all along denied any
wrongdoing. The prosecution will also demand that all suspects pay
back all of the illicit gains from their illegal dealings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. HOUSE PASSES AMENDMENT TO LIFT DIPLOMATIC RESTRICTIONS ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  28 (CNA)
(By Lin Chieh-yu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. House of Representatives
passed Wednesday an amendment that would lift various restrictions on
the United States' relations with Taiwan, including a ban forbidding
Taiwan officials from visiting the White House.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the Science, State, Justice, Commerce
Appropriations Bill was jointly proposed by four pro-Taiwan
representatives, namely Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) , Robert Andrews
(D-N.J.), Steve Chahot (R-Ohio) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).</P>
      <P>If the amendment is approved by the Senate, several restrictions
set forth in the U.S. State Department's Guidelines on Relations with
Taiwan will be removed.</P>
      <P>These restrictions include that meetings between U.S. and Taiwan
officials may not occur in the State Department buildings, the White
House or the Old Executive Office Building; that officials from U.S.
foreign affairs agencies and those above the rank of GS-14 may not
attend the annual Republic of China National Day reception hosted by
Taiwan's representative office in Washington; and that executive
branch personnel are not permitted to attend functions held at the
Washington residence of Taiwan's representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>The guidelines also stipulate that officials from the Department
of Defense and State Department above the rank of office director or
the rank of colonel or Navy captain may not travel to Taiwan on
"official business," executive branch officials at or above the level
of assistant secretary of state or three star flag military officers
may not travel to Taiwan for personal travel without advance
clearance from the State Department, and all travel must be on
"tourist" rather than "official" passports.</P>
      <P>In addition, executive branch personnel may not officially
correspond by mail directly with Taiwan officials unless their
correspondence is first sent to the American Institute in Taiwan.
While any such correspondence may not be on letterhead, nor may it
contain the official title of the author, personal correspondence
between executive branch personnel and Taiwan officials are subject
to the same restrictions.</P>
      <P>Further restrictions include that executive branch officials are
not permitted to refer to Taiwan by its official name "Republic of
China, " nor can they refer to Taiwan's government as a "government."
Instead, the term "Taiwan authorities" must be used. The guidelines
also prevent executive branch personnel from referring to the people
who live in Taiwan as "Taiwanese" but require them to refer to these
people as "people on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Tancredo said getting rid of such "humiliating restrictions" will
force the State Department to treat Taiwan as an "equal partner in
freedom and democracy."</P>
      <P>"China shouldn't control our foreign policy, Americans should, "
Tancredo added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Andrews called the guidelines "an unnecessary
roadblock" to clear communication between U.S. and Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>"In approving this amendment, the House voted for respecting
democracy and human rights abroad," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU MAYOR CANDIDATE CHALLENGES DPP NOMINEE OVER CHINA TRADE POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
candidate for Kaohsiung City mayor, challenged his Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) counterpart, Chen Chu, Thursday to make clear
her party's China trade policy which he claimed could affect the
well-being of large numbers of workers in the southern port city.</P>
      <P>Lo said that if Chen withdraws from the DPP's New Tide faction,
which he noted supports a "boldly go west" policy, and explains to
former President Chen Shui-bian her proposed cross-Taiwan Strait
policy, then there will be room for the two parties to talk about
fielding a single candidate in the mayoral election.</P>
      <P>In that case, Lo said he would be willing to quit the race -- a
remark he soon clarified by pointing out that he did not mean
"withdraw from the race" and instead meant he would be willing "to
negotiate" with the DPP over a unified strategy to win the race.</P>
      <P>What is hampering the two parties from engaging in negotiations
is the DPP's New Tide faction, to which Chen belongs, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Lo stressed that he is not targeting Chen Chu as an individual,
but rather "trying to discuss the issue from the policy perspective."</P>
      <P>He claimed that if the city government adopts the "boldly go
west" policy toward China, it will cause serious unemployment in
Kaohsiung which has a large blue-collar population.</P>

      <P>In response to Vice President Annette Lu's

opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday "the time
is not ripe" for organizing such a meeting.</P>

just failed to obtain legislative support, he thinks "everyone now

      <P>Ma, who also doubles as Taipei mayor, made the remarks on the

off Thursday at the Taipei International Convention Center. Both Lu

    <HEADLINE>46% OF PARENTS FEEL 'HIGHER THAN NORMAL' PRESSURE: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (CCF/
Taiwan) released results of a survey Thursday indicating that 46 percent of
parents of elementary school pupils experience "greater than normal"
pressure due to multiple pressures of being a parent, income earner, spouse
and a member of society, with five percent saying they suffer "extreme"
pressure.</P>
      <P>A lack of knowledge about parental responsibilities has for five
consecutive years been the No. 1 reason cited for child abuse, according to
the authors of the survey, which was released as child abuse enters its
"peak season" of July to September.</P>
      <P>Chou Hui-hsiang, director of CCF/Taiwan's department of social work,
said female parents, single parents, grandparents looking after
grandchildren, parents with little education or greater economic burdens and
families with a large number of children tend to face greater pressures.</P>
      <P>CCF/Taiwan suggested that parents learn stress management and relaxation
techniques, find more time to unwind and make good use of social support
networks. At home, household duties should be shared by all members of the
household and parents and children should find "quality time" to share daily
experiences and communicate with each other.</P>
      <P>The organization will distribute 150,000 booklets across Taiwan teaching
parents how to improve parent-child relations. For further information, call

    <HEADLINE>CNA, BUSINESS WIRE INK NEW PACT FOR COMMERCIAL NEWS DISTRIBUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) inked an
agreement with U.S.-based Business Wire Thursday to boost bilateral
cooperation in news distribution and commercial representation.</P>
      <P>CNA's President Liu Chih-tsung and Hector Botero, president of
Business Wire's Latin America and China operations, signed the
agreement on behalf of the two leading news agencies at aceremony
held at CNA's Taipei headquarters, marking a milestone in bilateral
cooperation between the two.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Botero quoted a recent New York Times
report as saying that efforts by Taiwan's government to foster
Internet-related industries and an information infrastructure have
yielded "substantial rewards."</P>
      <P>Botero said Taipei's WiFly network may be the most visible
evidence of Taiwan's technological aspirations, but besides the
technology, the government has been working on a "far-reaching" plan
since the 1990s to use the Internet as an efficient and inexpensive
way for government functionaries to communicate among themselves and
with citizens.</P>
      <P>He quoted the New York Times as reporting that in 2005, 92
percent of Taiwan's businesses and 35 percent of individuals filed
taxes electronically, Taiwan's government distributes about 100,000
documents online every working day, thousands of Taiwanese students
pay school tuition through the Internet and one million citizens now
have identification cards with chips inside.</P>
      <P>The efforts of Taiwan's government have attracted great
attention, the report said, adding that the Brown University Taubman
Center for Public Policy put Taiwan at the top of its list of the
world's most Internet-savvy governments, according to Botero.</P>
      <P>"The Internet is not just to get rid of regulations, but also to
establish a mature democracy," said Yeh Jiunn-rong, the former
chairman of the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission.</P>
      <P>"While we were doing government reform, it was a golden
opportunity to do it right with e-government," Yeh was quoted as
saying in the New York Times report.</P>
      <P>"These excerpts from the New York Times article reflect Business
Wire's interests in participating with the Central News Agency to
provide the Taiwan capital markets, the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the
companies listed on the exchange with the latest state-of-the-art
technology for corporate news distribution," Botero said.</P>
      <P>Business Wire was established over 50 years ago and is the
world's leading service for corporate news distribution. It has over
15,000 corporate subscribers and offices and bureaus in the
United States, Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, he
said.</P>
      <P>Botero said that Business Wire was acquired by legendary investor
Warren Buffet earlier this year. Buffet is considered the second
wealthiest man in the world, he said, adding that Buffet announced
plans this week to donate more than US$40 billion in Berkshire
Hathaway stock to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for
children's education and medical research.</P>
      <P>"We are very proud that someone as influential and respected as
Mr. Buffet recognized our leadership, integrity and values," Botero
continued.</P>
      <P>"We at Business Wire have recognized the qualities of CNA
including its outstanding leadership, its management, its worldwide
reputation, integrity and values," he added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Liu said Business Wire has long been one of CNA's
key partners and this new agreement will surely bring the two even
closer.</P>
      <P>Liu said Business Wire, now a wholly owned subsidiary of
Berkshire Hathaway, is the global market leader in commercial news
distribution. Thousands of member companies and organizations depend
on Business Wire to transmit their full-text news releases,
regulatory filings, photos and other multimedia content to
journalists, financial professionals, investor services, regulatory
authorities and the general public worldwide, he said.</P>
      <P>"Through the coopertion of Business Wire and CNA, we could help
the Taiwan Stock Exchange establish a platform to help transmit
information of local enterprises to international stock exchanges,
monetary markets and Internet portals," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"This ground-breaking collaboration is expected to greatly
increase the popularity of local listed and OTC companies in the
world arena, while ensuring the transparency of related information,"
he said.</P>
      <P>CNA and Business Wire signed their first cooperation agreement on
news distribution and commercial representation in February 2005 with
efforts focusing on Business Wire transmitting global corporate news
to Taiwan's clients via the CNA news vehicle.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
political parties in Taiwan must put aside their differences and
work together toward the promotion of constitutional reforms that
will sustain the country's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony for two study programs offered
by the Executive Yuan for government employees, Chen said the
country's two major directions of development should be toward a
"democratic Taiwan, sustainable development" and "pursuing peace,
seeking dialogue."</P>
      <P>To ensure the nation's sustainable development, the government
needs to beef up national security, deepen the country's
democratization, continue its economic development, uphold social
justice and build a civil society, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that national security is vital to Taiwan's survival,
and that faced with China's military intimidation the country must
establish sufficient self-defense capabilities and unite its people
against that threat.</P>
      <P>On the deepening of Taiwan's democratization, Chen said the
transition of power in 2000 marked a major step toward deepening
the country's democratic development, and he pledged that the
government would continue to work to create an "open political
environment" with transparent decision-making processes.</P>
      <P>On continuing down the path of economic development, Chen said
that while the economy is essential to the country's survival, Taiwan
should attach equal importance to environmental protection and
development in order to enhance its overall competitiveness.</P>
      <P>On upholding social justice, the president said it is the
government's responsibility to create a social environment that is
fair and just, and to achieve that goal the government is promoting
taxation reform, planning a national pension program, improving the
National Health Insurance program, establishing a social security
network and enhancing the welfare of the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>On the establishment of a civil society, Chen said the government
hopes to joint forces with the private sector and non-governmental
organizations to build a society in which people identify, respect,
care, trust and help one another.</P>

      <P> He noted that Taiwan and the United States maintain close economic
and trade relations and said both sides can create more trade opportunities
in information technology, the service industry, financial and transport sectors
with the signing of an FTA.</P>
      <P> With FTAs Taiwan has already signed with Panama, Guatemala and
Nicaragua, Taiwan can connect to the whole American market if it can sign an FTA with the United States, Chen added.</P>
      <P> With the huge American market in mind, the government will help Taiwan 
enterprises diversify their investments in the market, while American companies can enter the Asian market

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Su
Jia-chyuan outlined a "new agricultural movement" Thursday with the
hope that Taiwan's agricultural exports will increase by 20 percent
within three years.</P>
      <P>With the new project, the COA plans to redouble within three
years the area in which farmers dedicate to the cultivation of
organic farm products; attracting 1,000 additional young farmers to
the agricultural industry: increasing revenue for technical transfer</P>
      <P>by threefold; installing global positioning system on high sea
fishing boats; prohibiting fishing boats that damage environment;
and all pigs will be subject to death insurance.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA will implement a system by 2015 in which the
agricultural products will have their thorough records from
cultivation to marketing.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's agricultural industry is facing fierce
competition from liberalization and internationalization since its
entry into World Trade Organization, Su said the country's
agriculture should not only focus on production and technology, but
should also strengthen the renovation and international marketing.</P>
      <P>Under the "new agricultural movement, " the COA will promote
the development of biomass energy in fallow lands, implement
insurance for the agricultural industry, as well as strengthen global
marketing for Taiwan's agricultural products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA BOYCOTT BEHIND PRESIDENT'S DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
his efforts to expand Taiwan's international presence is due to
China's relentless attempts to isolate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in an online weekly newsletter issued by
the Presidential Office in an attempt to detail his diplomtic efforts
since coming to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>Stating that he is sure that Taiwan's 23 million people are aware
of the country's difficult situation in the international community,
Chen said that as head of state, he must not hold back and must
tackle all difficulties to "reach out" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For instance, recent visits to Taiwan by Dominican
Republic President Leonel Antonio Fernandez Reyna and King Mswati III
of Swaziland and a visit next week by Honduran President Manuel
Zelaya are proof of his efforts, Chen said, noting that since 2000,
he has visited some of Taiwan's diplomatic allies each year, with
nearly half of them visited by Taiwan's president for the first time.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, his visit to the Vatican in April last year to
attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II carried great significance
because it was the first-ever visit to Taiwan's only European
diplomatic partner by a Taiwan president. Over the past few years, he
has also received several international human rights awards in the
United States on behalf of the Taiwan people, he said.</P>
      <P>Last year, he also made transit visits in Fiji, the United
Arabian Emirates and Indonesia, which maintain no formal diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, in addition to a stopover in Libya this year,
Chen added, claiming that his "diplomatic offensive" was made to
counter China's suppression of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that China makes "no difference" between the "pan-blue"
and the "pan-green" camps when it seeks to block Taiwan in
international activities, citing as evidence that Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a heavyweight in the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , was unable to take part in last year's summit
meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on his behalf
as a result of pressure from China.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, unity is important among the Taiwan
people to deal with China's strenuous diplomatic suppression, Chen
said, adding that the public should lend their support to the
government's diplomatic officials and encourage them to help Taiwan
play a bigger role on the world stage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENSIONS FOR RETIRED PRESIDENTS TO BE SLASHED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The allowance for retired presidents and
vice presidents will be cut by almost 50 percent, according to
consensus reached Thursday among legislators of the ruling and
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The legislators completed a draft amendment to the Statute
Governing Preferential Treatment for Presidents and Vice Presidents,
but the document was not signed by the legislative caucus whips of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, the main opposition
Kuomintang and two smaller opposition parties -- the People First
Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, a retired president will be entitled
to NT$250,000 (US$7,670) per month for a period as long as the number
of years he or she had served in the post.</P>
      <P>Other preferential treatment will include NT$8 million in office
expenses in the first year, NT$6.5 million in the second year, and
NT$5 million from the third year of retirement.</P>
      <P>A retired president will have eight to 12 security personnel to
protect his safety, plus the service of chauffeurs.</P>
      <P>For a retired vice president, the monthly allowance will be
NT$180,000, with the office expenses set at NT$4 million in the first
year, NT$3.25 million in the second year, and NT$2.5 million in the
third year, plus the protection of four to eight security personnel.</P>
      <P>All retired presidents and vice presidents will enjoy health care
provided by the state and will have the privilege of attending
important national ceremonies.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, such preferential treatment will be
suspended if a retired president or vice president becomes gainfully
employed again as a public office holder.</P>
      <P>A retired president or vice president who has emigrated to
another country, lost Republic of China nationality, or been
convicted of rebellion or treason will automatically lose the
preferential treatment.</P>
      <P>An incumbent president or vice president who has been relieved of
his or her post because of a recall, impeachment or a criminal
sentence will also forfeit the right to such preferential treatment.</P>
      <P>The amendment was prompted by opposition legislators' complaints
that President Chen Shui-bian, who is to retire in 2008 after serving
the remaining two years of his second four-year term, does not
deserve a pension three times that of a retired U.S. president for
the rest of his life, because he has plunged the nation into turmoil
with a series of corruption scandals involving his senior aides and
family members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TOUTS TAIWAN'S PRESS FREEDOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian touted Taiwan's
press freedom Thursday, saying Taiwan now ties with Japan at the top
of the Asian rating in terms of press freedom.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of senior
executives of major international news media who have come to Taipei
to attend the June 30 celebration of the Central News Agency's 10th
anniversary as Taiwan's national news agency.</P>
      <P>Since taking office in 2000, Chen said, he has committed himself
to defending freedom of the press and freedom of speech. "Thanks to
our continued efforts, we have made enormous progress in the press
freedom world rating," he said.</P>
      <P>In the annual rating of press freedom in more than 190 countries
compiled by the U.S.-based Freedom House, Taiwan advanced to 35th
place this year from 44th last year and 49th in 2004, Chen said,
adding that among Asian countries, Taiwan ties with Japan at the top
of the press freedom rating this year.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chen said, China is notorious for its human rights
violations, including suppression of press freedom. Ranking nearly at
the bottom -- 177th for 2006 -- China has been blamed for censorship
against such world famous Internet portals as Microsoft and Yahoo.
China has also kept more journalists in detention than any other
country in the Freedom House 2006 survey, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Recalling that he himself was once jailed for eight months for
what he described as "his dissenting views" during Taiwan's martial
law era, Chen said he takes pleasure and pride in seeing Taiwan's
evolution from an authoritarian country with no press preedom into a
liberal democracy.</P>
      <P>The foreign media executives were accompanied by CNA Chairman Su
Tzen-ping during the meeting with the president.</P>
      <P>Chen praised CNA for its always updated and precise news
reporting and information services.</P>

Israelis Batter Gaza and Seize Hamas Officials 

Israel stepped up its confrontation on
Wednesday with Palestinian militants over the
capture of an Israeli soldier, battering
northern Gazan towns with artillery and sending
warplanes over the house of the Syrian
president, who is influential with the
Palestinian leader believed to have ordered the

soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, 19, are believed to

Wall Street Journal: Energy Stalks, Big
Players Join Race to Put Farm Waste Into
Your Gas Tank

The U.S. Energy Department is staging a
competition backing the private sector to build
the nation's first three commercials plant
capable of producing cellulosic ethanol. The
department, which has US$160 million to spend on
the contest, is requiring each candidate to have
a pilot plant showing a process that can be
successful once it is scaled up. At least 30
companies are in the running for the aid,
industry officials say. One player with big
backers is Iogen Corp., a privately held
Ottawa-based biotech company that has patented
enzymes that can extract the sugars from wheat
and barley straw. It has proposed building a
commercial plant in southeastern Idaho, where it
already has contracts with farmers to deliver
the raw materials.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO EXPAND 'CLEAN SYRINGE PROGRAM' FOR DRUG USERS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will from
July 1 expand its "clean syringe program" for intravenous drug users
to cover the entire country to reduce HIV transmission, officials
said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to tallies from the DOH's Center for Disease Control
(CDC) , 11,486 AIDS/HIV cases have been reported in Taiwan as of the
end of May, with 4,064, or 35 percent, being drug addicts who
contracted the virus via sharing needles with other HIV-carrying
addicts. Needle sharing has replaced homosexual intercourse as the
main form of HIV transmission in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CDC has since last year provided drug addiction counseling
and clean syringes free of charge to drug addicts in Taipei County,
Taipei City, Taoyuan County and Tainan County.</P>
      <P>While 40,546 syringes have been handed out, 9,153 drug addicts
have sought counseling, CDC statistics show.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said the "clean syringe program" has been effective
in reducing HIV transmission.</P>
      <P>For example, Tainan County, where more than 30,000 syringes have
been handed out, has reported only 26 new AIDS/HIV cases so far this
year, compared with 136 new cases reported during the same period
last year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They estimated that the decrease will help the government save
NT$1 billion (US$30.67 million) in health spending on AIDS patients.</P>
      <P>From July 1, the CDC will provide an extra 5 million clean
syringes at 427 designated locations in 23 counties and cities around
Taiwan, the officials said, adding that the CDC is also planning to
set up 100 syringe vending machines around the country by the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CDC will expand its methadone treatment program
starting August to help drug addicts quit their vice and will
purchase enough of the medication for one day's use by 1.13 million
people, they said.</P>
      <P>While the methadone will be provided free of charge to
HIV-carrying drug addicts, others can join the program voluntarily by
paying their own medical bills.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TREATMENT FOR RETIRED NATIONAL LEADERS SHOULD BE FAIR: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged the
Legislative Yuan Friday to craft bills based on the principle of
fairness and not just to accommodate certain people.</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks came in the wake of the legislature's passage
earlier in the day of a draft amendment to the Statute Governing
Preferential Treatment for Presidents and Vice Presidents which
will cancel lifelong payments to retired presidents and vice
presidents and dramatically curtail other preferential treatment.
Former President Lee Teng-hui and former Vice President Lien
Chan, who stepped down in 2000, will not be affected by the change.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she has no specific view on the legislature's move,
because "as a civil servant, I have not thought about the money."
However, she urged the legislature "to be reasonable and fair in
their move, " adding that the treatment for retired presidents
and vice presidents should be reasonable.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, a retired president is entitled to
NT$250,000 (US$7,670) per month for a period as long as the number of
years he or she had served in the post.</P>
      <P>Other preferential treatment include NT$8 million in office
expenses in the first year of retirement, NT$7 million in the second
year, and NT$6 million for the third year and NT$5 million from the
fourth year. Furthermore, a retired president will be provided with

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Friday that
she has rung leaders of the ruling and opposition parties to invite
them to meet with her over a cup of coffee.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she was able to reach all of the political leaders
Thursday with the exception of one and that some of them accepted her
invitation immediately.</P>
      <P>As some of her guests, such as Solidarity Taiwan Union Chairman
Su Chin-chiang, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, are either on a foreign visit
or will soon go on such a trip, the meeting will probably be held
after they return home, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu predicted that the atmosphere will be better then as these
leaders will discover on their overseas visits that "the political
strife is a very trivial matter compared with the size of the world."</P>
      <P>Citing a survey on 34 democratic countries, Lu said the Taiwan
people rank only 29th in terms of their pride in their own country
despite Taiwan's achievements on human rights protection and
democratic and technological development. She reasoned that the
results are related to the political instability and strife going on
in the country.</P>
      <P>The vice president again called on the political leaders to give
up their "zero-sum struggle" and put their heads together to find
ways to make Taiwan better.</P>
      <P>Lu had put forth a similar proposal early this month before the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
initiated a motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian, but the plan
was later canceled.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City has been certified by the San
Francisco-based JiWire Inc., a leading provider of wireless broadband
services, as the "world's largest Wi-Fi network city."</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou accepted the certification from JiWire
Chief Executive Kevin McKenzie Thursday at the Taipei International
Convention Center.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that the efforts to build the capital city into a
digitized modern metropolis began in 1999 with the construction of
wireless broadband infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The project is scheduled to be fully completed by July, when the
wireless network coverage will have reached around 90 percent of the
city, providing service to 2.3 million people, Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics released in March, Taipei has a
population of over 2.6 million people.</P>
      <P>McKenzie said the certification was conducted by their
technicians who visited the city to sum up the number of "hotspots"
-- wireless Internet accesses points -- public space and population
in Taipei, and to double-check that Taipei's public wireless network
coverage is the largest in the world.</P>
      <P>The experts also proved the steadiness of the city's wireless

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 95 percent of Taiwan enterprises
are operating in line with the new pension system implemented last
July 1, according to the results of a recent survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was conducted by 1111 Manpower Bank, an online
job search firm, from June 20-28, found that 95.07 percent of the
enterprises are operating completely in line with the new pension
system, while 4.35 percent of the companies are partially in tune
with the new system.</P>
      <P>Under the new pension system, employers must deposit at least 6
percent of an employee's salary into their pension account each
month, which the employees can carry with them whenever they change
jobs. Under the old system, an employee would get his or her pension
after working for 25 consecutive years for the same enterprise or
when they reached the age of 55 years and had worked for the same
company for 15 consecutive years.</P>
      <P>Also under the old system, employees would receive their pension
in one lump sum, while under the new system, retired workers are
eligible to receive a monthly pension for the rest of their life.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 13 percent of Taiwan employers have
changed their employee salary structure due to the new pension
system, while 86 percent have not done so.</P>
      <P>According to survey, 47.25 percent of the enterprises said they
hope their employees choose the new pension system, while only 3.19
percent said they hope their employees choose to stick with the old
system, while a total of 43.77 percent of the companies said they
will make the judgment on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Wu Ruey-ying, spokesman of 1111 Manpower Bank, said employers
could violate the Labor Standard Law if they try to offset the
increased labor costs resulting from the new pension system by
reducing employees' salaries or signing new labor contracts with
their employees.</P>

      <P>The AIT is a quasi-official organization authorized to handle

      <P>Bush, currently director of the Center for Northeast Asian Policy

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislature approved three budgets
totalling NT$141.94 billion (US$4.39 billion) Friday for flood
control and national development projects.</P>
      <P>A total of NT$30.97 billion will go to controlling floods in
low-lying areas across Taiwan in the government's "first-phase flood
fighting program."</P>
      <P>For that budget, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution
prohibiting the government from collecting the money by selling its
shares in publicly owned banks and the tobacco and wine monopoly.</P>
      <P>As a result, all the funds will come from the issue of government
bonds, with the principle and interest burdens to be shared by the
taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Another NT$13.97 billion was approved for dredging and improving
the Shihmen Dam in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, a project that is
expected to stabilize water supply and control flooding for area
residents.</P>
      <P>For this special budget, the government was permitted to borrow
NT$10.36 billion. The other NT$3.61 comes from the previous fiscal
year's budget surplus.</P>
      <P>A third budget of NT$97 billion was also approved for the
government's "expanded national development program" as part of its
third-year spending. The program calls for NT$500 billion over five
years.</P>
      <P>The legislature suddenly became efficient in screening the major
budget proposals because both the ruling and opposition parties were
under pressure from the public to "do something right" rather than
engaging in their never-ending political feuding.</P>
      <P>The extra session was called after both sides agreed to deal with
an opposition-led motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian, a motion
that failed to garner a two-thirds legislative majority vote to clear
the legislative floor.</P>

      <P>A latest inspection conducted by the COA shows that rice produced
from 12 paddy fields with a total area of 3.67 hectares in the county
was contaminated with cadmium.</P>
      <P>COA officials said the council will assist the affected farmers

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER SEES NEWLY PASSED TREATMENT BILL 'NOT REFORMATORY ENOUGH'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
legislator said Friday that a newly passed amendment to the Statute
Governing Preferential Treatment for Presidents and Vice Presidents
is not "reformatory" enough to be fair to the people.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cho-shui said the amendment is not reform-minded
enough and is far from "reasonable, " making it necessary for all the
legislators to apologize to the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The legislature passed the amendment on the last day of an
extraordinary legislative session June 13-30 to handle 14 bills,
including an opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian. That motion failed.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the amended law cancels lifelong payments
to retired presidents and vice presidents and dramatically curtails
other preferential treatment, the treatment accorded to Taiwan's
retired leaders is still too extravagant compared to that accorded to
their counterparts in the United States, which has much higher per
capita income than Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is particularly unacceptable that the amendment still
maintains preferential treatment in addition to monthly allowances
for Taiwan's retired vice presidents. Retired U.S. vice presidents
are given no preferential treatment besides a monthly allowance, he
noted.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, a retired president is entitled to
NT$250,000 (US$7,670) per month for a period as long as the number of
years he or she served in the post. Other preferential treatment
includes NT$8 million in office expenses in the first year of
retirement, NT$7 million in the second year, NT$6 million for the
third year and NT$5 million from the fourth year. Furthermore, a
retired president will be provided with eight to 12 security
personnel to protect his or her safety.</P>
      <P>For a retired vice president, the monthly allowance is
NT$180,000, with office expenses set at NT$4 million for the first
year, NT$3.5 million for the second year, and NT$3 million for the
third year and NT$2.5 million from the fourth year, plus the
protection of four to eight security personnel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Kuomintang legislative caucus whip Pan
Wei-kang said the amendment is helping institutionalize relevant
government policy on treatment for retired national leaders.</P>
      <P>Pan claimed that the amendment was not designed "to accommodate
certain people" as implied by Vice President Annette Lu earlier in
the day. Lu was referring to allegations that the move is designed as
"punishment" for what the opposition sees as the ineptitude of Chen
and his administration.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a legislative caucus party whip of the opposition
People First Party, also expressed welcome to the passage of the
amendment, saying that the law will help save money for the country
to the tune of NT$68 million a year.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President Lien Chan are
not subject to that amendment as the law will not be applied
retroactively.</P>

young people to topple the concept of Mr. Almost Good Enough.</P>
      <P>During a speech to graduating students at Shantou University in
China's Guangdong Province Thursday, according to the Friday edition
of The Sun newspaper of Hong Kong, Li advised students not to be like
Mr. Almost Good Enough, who "has eyes but does not see clearly; who
has ears but does not hear clearly; who has a brain but does not
think logically as he lacks insight."</P>
      <P>Li deplored that Mr. Almost Good Enough remains alive and
kicking, particularly in Chinese societies, where generations of
people have come and gone since Hu Shih created him.</P>
      <P>"Whenever I reread this great article by Hu Shih, I am shocked
not only by Mr. Cha Bu Duo's pitiable ignorance but even more by how
people around him have accepted his way of life -- people who feel
complacent at being like him. I really want to cry over such a
twisted way of wasting one's life that could have been spent much
more wisely," Li said.</P>
      <P>"If you want to shake off the shackles of destiny, " he suggested
to the students, "be brave in thinking, respect science, honor
principles, be able to feel and sense, dare to pursue, dare to care
and act aggressively."</P>
      <P>He encouraged the students to stand the tests of life but remain
"people of integrity in the face of adversity, keeping love and
kindness in your hearts."</P>
      <P>Li, the wealthiest Chinese person in the world, recalled his
early years when he was fleeing from war in China, not knowing what
the future had in store for him.</P>
      <P>"But even at that time, I was determined not to become another
Mr. Cha Bu Duo, another Mr. Almost Good Enough. How about you? " he
said in conclusion.</P>
      <P>Hu Shih, a scholar who introduced the vernacular literary style
to China in the early 20th Century, had considerable influence on
modern China's cultural development. He also served as the Republic
of China's ambassador to the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU WANTS TO CANCEL BUDGET FOR LATE PRESIDENTS' MAUSOLEUMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
legislators proposed Friday that the government cancel an annual
budget for the maintenance of the mausoleums of late presidents
Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers noted that the NT$70 million earmarked annually for
the maintenance of the mausoleums is "obviously excessive" compared
with the NT$15.2 million budgeted for the security of former
presidents and vice presidents, which they claim gives the public the
impression that "dead people enjoy better treatment than those who
are still alive."</P>
      <P>They put forth the proposal after the Legislative Yuan passed an
amendment earlier in the day to cancel lifelong payments for former
presidents and vice presidents and curtail the benefits accorded to
retired leaders.</P>
      <P>However, former President Lee Teng-hui and former Vice President
Lien Chan, who stepped down in 2000, will not be affected by the
change as it is not retroactive.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, head of the TSU's policy committee, said the
amendment is inconsistent with the principle of "fairness and
justice" because former presidents and vice presidents will only have
eight to 12 security guards after the amendment, while a total of 129
workers, military policemen and honor guards are assigned for the
maintenance of the two late presidents' mausoleums.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ho said, while Lien is now receiving NT$470,000 per
month, presidents and vice presidents who step down in the future
will only get NT$250,000 per month.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus convener David Huang said there is no
legal basis for the Ministry of National Defense to earmark an annual
budget to maintain the mausoleums and assign soldiers to protect them
and suggested that the remains of the two late presidents should be
buried to save money.</P>

    <HEADLINE>60% OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS OPPOSED TO TOPPLING CABINET: DPP POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of the supporters of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" are opposed to a no-confidence motion
to topple the Cabinet headed by Premier Su Tseng-chang, according to
the results of a survey released Friday by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The DPP released the result of its survey on the party's
inaugural online newsletter in which it also gave a special report on
the party's nominees for the year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral
elections.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted June 21, one day after President Chen
Shui-bian gave a televised address to respond to allegations of
incompetence and corruption cited by the opposition for initiating
the recall motion, which failed to pass the legislature Tuesday
because it failed to get a two-thirds endorsement from the 221-seat
legislature. But the opposition People First Party has vowed to
continue to propose a no-confidence motion to build up the pressure
on Chen and the DPP.</P>
      <P>Asked about a no-confidence motion, 65.7 percent of those polled
said Su is not involved in any alleged scandals and there is no need
to topple his Cabinet, compared with 20.8 percent who said the
Cabinet should be toppled.</P>
      <P>Among those polled, 57.8 percent of those who claimed to be
"pan-blue alliance" voters said there is no need to topple the
Cabinet. If the Legislative Yuan proposes a non-confidence motion, 48
percent said Chen should dissolve the legislature and allow new
legislative elections. Only 28.4 percent said Chen should replace Su.</P>
      <P>The online newsletter will be published every Friday, and it will
also appear irregularly to target specific issues, in the hope of
increasing exchanges with grassroots members and providing them with
the latest information from the party.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, said it is significant to launch the online newsletter
on the 20th anniversary of the party's founding.</P>
      <P>The newsletter will be mainly sent to party members in the
initial stage, with a subscription system implemented in later
stages.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Friday that he has rejected invitations
from Vice President Annette Lu and ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun to have coffee with them and other
political party leaders.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks while expressing his views on the current
political situation at home during a lunch gathering with PFP
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, Lu and Yu phoned his secretary and PFP
Secretary-General Chin Ching-sheng, respectively, to relay the
message. But Soong said that he turned down their invitations because
"now is not the right time for such political meetings or talks."</P>
      <P>The PFP chairman said he also asked Chin to tell Yu that he will
not meet with ranking DPP officials unless Yu apologizes to the
public on behalf of the DPP and draw a clear line with President Chen
Shui-bian over a string of corruption allegations involving members
of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>Soong said he will not let the people down by making them
"misunderstand" that all politicians are keen on games of "power
exchanges."</P>
      <P>However, he then went on to comment on the PFP's plan to continue
initiating a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet at the
Legislative Yuan following a failed passage of a presidential recall
motion Tuesday, saying that he was really disappointed with the
matter and ascribed what he called a slow handling at the legislature
to the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) changing attitude and what
he claimed is "the DPP's cover up."</P>
      <P>Soong said that he cannot understand why the KMT is hesitant
about calling a no-confidence vote now that it only requires approval
of 112 lawmakers, or half of the 221-member Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>It was the second time that Lu made the offer to opposition
political leaders to negotiate to stabilize Taiwan's politics. She
first raised the idea last month but had to drop the plan due to cool
response from Soong and KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>

      <P>There is no evidence to show that
genetically modified food is bad for people, an Academia Sinica
researcher said Friday.</P>
      <P>He Ruey-hua, director of Academia Sinica's Institute of Plant and

      <P>He said the Taiwanese consume large amounts of genetically

      <P>According to He, Taiwan does not produce soybeans and mainly
imports from the United States, where as much as 94 percent of
soybeans are genetically modified.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan people began to eat genetically modified
soybeans in 1996, he said there have been no recorded cases of health
problems related to this kind of food.</P>
      <P>There is groundswell of demand for genetically-modified food to

    <HEADLINE>NEARLY 47% OF ENTERPRISES HAVE CHANGED SALARY STRUCTURE: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Elisabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a survey released Friday
show that nearly 47 percent of Taiwan enterprises have changed their
salary structure in order to cope with the new pension system
implemented last July.</P>
      <P>A Taipei-headquartered online job search company, 1111 Manpower
Bank, conducted the survey June 13-28 among local wage earners to
find out whether they are beneficiaries or victims of the new system
that took effect a year ago.</P>
      <P>The results show that 66.45 percent of the enterprises that the
respondent employees worked for are operating completely in line with
the new pension system, while 18.27 percent have partially adopted
the system and 10.63 percent have made no changes.</P>
      <P>As to changes made in terms of salary structure, 41.84 percent of
the respondents said their paychecks were cut, while 29.08 percent
said their insurance coverage has been changed and 25.53 percent said
their companies have submitted false salary figures to labor affairs
authorities in order to cut their spending.</P>
      <P>Under the new pension system, employers must deposit 6 percent of
an employee's salary into their pension account each month, which the
employees take with them whenever they change jobs.</P>
      <P>According to Bureau of Labor Insurance statistics, 74.06 percent
of employees around the country adopted the new pension system, while
25.94 percent chose to stay in the old one, under which an employee
gets his or her pension after working for 25 consecutive years for
the same enterprise or when they reach the age of 55 years and have
worked for the same company for 15 consecutive years.</P>
      <P>Under the old system, employees receive their pension in one lump
sum, while under the new one, retired workers are eligible to receive
a monthly pension for the rest of their life.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new system offers more secure pension
guarantees, 43.52 percent of the respondents said they did not know,
while 38.87 percent said they believe it offers a better guarantee
and 17.61 percent said it does not.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that most employees are still bewildered by the
new system, 1111 Manpower Bank spokesman Wu Ruei-ying said.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that no major flaws in the new pension system have been
seen since it was put into effect a year ago. However, employees
should still be aware of the system, particularly when they are
transferred to a different post, as employers might try to offset
their increased labor costs resulting from the new pension system by
signing new labor contracts with employees, he warned.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,204 effective samples were collected for the online
survey, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that the
proceeding of naming a new finance minister was not "thoughtful"
enough and that he will improve.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after some legislators expressed
discontent about being kept in the dark about the abrupt replacement
of Finance Minister Joseph Lyu with National Taiwan University
Professor Ho Chih-chin, which was announced a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Su said that Lyu, who assumed the post Jan. 25 and is the
shortest-serving finance minister, had expressed his desire to leave
his post several times. Lyu, who was criticized in several
controversial financial cases, including the government's battle to
keep control of Mega Financial Holding Co., has accepted an
invitation to serve as a minister without portfolio.</P>
      <P>Ho only returned to Taiwan three years ago after serving as a
senior official at the U.S. Treasury Department and at the Justice
Department for 15 years. A Ph.D holder in economics from Michigan
University, Ho is known for his expertise in the fields of tax law
and financial policy.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Chung-mo said that he has been on the
legislature's Financial Committee for the past six years and yet even
he did not know that Lyu was to be replaced. He also said he had no
knowledge of the new finance minister.</P>
      <P>Lin criticized the premier for displaying the "arrogance of
power," saying that he should at least have given some notice.</P>
      <P>If the Executive Yuan will not respect the DPP caucus, then the
Executive Yuan and the DPP legislators should "go their separate
ways" and the Ministry of Finance should solve its own problems
without bothering to ask for assistance from the legislative
committee.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, in a major announcement May 31, said
that the will give a free hand to the premier on personnel
appointments in the Cabinet.</P>

referred to investigators after calling for the assassination of the

Defense said Friday.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Wu Chih-fang said the soldier, identified as Chiu

would make a threat against the president, although it is sure that
Chiu has not formed a "gangster organization" in the army and that
his statement on the Web site did not reflect on other members of the
armed forces.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation by the army has determined that
Chiu's remarks were simply rhetoric, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>According to local news reports, the army took Chiu's threat
seriously because as a member of the honor guard, which often attends

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged the Central
News Agency Friday to contribute more to Taiwan's globalization in
the coming decades.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed her hope in a speech delivered at a ceremony to mark
CNA's 10th anniversary as Taiwan's national news agency and its 82nd
founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging CNA's consistent leading role in Taiwan's news
services, Lu said CNA should take the lead in upgrading the quality
of news reports. Noting that Taiwan's news media has an obsession
with sensationalism, Lu said she hopes local media outlets can
respect "people's rights to know, not to know and not to be known, "
referring to respect for other people's privacy.</P>
      <P>She also suggested that the domestic news media give more
coverage to international news events to enhance local people's
global perspective and vision.</P>
      <P>Noting that CNA has contributed a great deal to disseminating
information about Taiwan's development, Lu said CNA should play an
even more active role in promoting Taiwan's globalization.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lu, many other guests attended the celebration
ceremony at a Taipei hotel, including Examination Yuan President Yao
Chia-wen, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, party brass, government

Kyodo, JiJi Press, Thailand News Agency, Bloomberg News and the
United News of India News Agency, also traveled to Taipei for the
celebration ceremony.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, CNA Chairman Su Tzen-ping said CNA has
pulled out all the stops over the years to be a credible news
provider, offering updated, precise, objective and non-biased news
services.</P>
      <P>With a comprehensive round-the-island news-gathering network, Su
said CNA has decided to open a new "Taiwan roundup" Web site to help

      <P>Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen pushed the button to inaugurate the new

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Beverage Alcohol Forum launched
a campaign Friday in an attempt to prevent people in Taiwan from
driving while intoxicated.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-kai, chairman of the charitable organization, told a
news conference that the campaign, similar to the "Bob campaign" in
Europe, aims to raise awareness of the dangers of drunk driving by
asking each group of friends or colleagues to designate a driver, a
"Bob," who does not drink and has the responsibility of driving home
the others at the end of the event.</P>
      <P>Chang added that his organization launched the campaign because
drinking-related road accidents in Taiwan have been on the rise.</P>
      <P>The campaign is supported by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, the Department of Transportation under the Taipei
city government and tourism circles.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-yin, Taipei's top official in charge of transportation
affairs, cited figures showing that traffic police handled 19,000
drunk driving cases in the city last year.</P>
      <P>Lin added that according to poll results, more than 80 percent of
Taipei's residents support strict enforcement of the law against
drunk driving.</P>
      <P>The Bob campaign originated in Belgium in 1995 when government
departments, police and the Belgian beer brewing industry worked out
the concept of "designated drivers" to curb drunk driving.</P>
      <P>The government of Belgium claims the campaign has triggered a
change in mentality, with 80 percent of its population considering
drinking and driving to be unacceptable.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) remains likely to call
for a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet as a means of
pressuring President Chen Shui-bian to step down if the party's
legislative caucus approves of the measure, KMT Secretary-General
Chan Chun-po quoted Chairman Ma Ying-jeou as saying Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, Ma made the remarks during a meeting with the
KMT's legislative caucus earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Chan revealed that Ma also hailed the performance of the 89 KMT
lawmakers who all cast a "yes" vote to recall Chen June 27 at the
Legislative Yuan, leaving a good historical example of the Republic
of China's constitutional practices.</P>
      <P>The KMT will also continue a nationwide campaign to solicit
public endorsement for Chen's ouster, hoping to collect at least 3
million signatures in the short-term, Chan said.</P>
      <P>Later the same day, legislative caucus whips of the KMT and the
People First Party (PFP) announced that they have forged a consensus
on launching a no-confidence vote at the legislature to topple the
Cabinet and to pressure President Chen to step down.</P>
      <P>The two parties found common ground on the issue after PFP
legislative caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang visited his Kuomintang (KMT)
counterpart Pan Wei-kang earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Pan said that the KMT and PFP stand firm on their stances that
Chen must step down to take responsibility for a spate of corruption
allegations involving members of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>The two parties share the same desire for Chen's ouster, evident
by the fact that all KMT and PFP lawmakers cast a "yes" vote to
recall Chen in a legislative motion Tuesday, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Pan stressed that "calling a no-confidence vote has always been
one of our options," but pointed out that when such a proposal should
be made at the Legislative Yuan has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>She said the KMT has set up a task force to continue demanding
Chen's ouster and has asked each lawmaker to hold at least 10
seminars in July to explain the party's cause to voters in their
constituencies.</P>
      <P>The KMT decided at a June 3 plenary meeting that its legislative
caucus and Policy Coordination Committee will be in charge of
assessing the no-confidence vote issue and that "toppling the Cabinet
has always been one possible option for the KMT, " she said, adding
that the timing of a no-confidence vote in the legislature remains
undecided.</P>
      <P>Lu said that it is understandable if it takes more time for the
KMT to consolidate opinions over the issue, given that it is the
largest party in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Lee Hung-jun said that the PFP hopes to continue
cooperating with the KMT in calling the no-confidence vote "in order
to allow the public to examine the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party again."</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Chao Liang-yen said she believes that as long as a
new legislature can be elected, a new public mandate will undoubtedly
demand Chen's ouster.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Chan Chun-po quoted party Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou as saying earlier the same day that the KMT is not opposed
to proposing a no-confidence vote at the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP FORMS AN ALLIANCE TO WORK TOWARD TAIWAN'S PUBLIC WELFARE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu announced Friday
that she has forged an alliance comprised of several civil groups
that are working on promoting public's welfare in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the Presidential Office, Lu said
although the crisis of recalling President Chen Shui-bian has
temporarily abated, the society remains rancorously divided over
political stances and ethnicity, which she said has seriously damaged
Taiwan's image and spurred her to promote the alliance.</P>
      <P>An opposition-proposed motion to recall Chen over a string of
corruption allegations implicating members of the first family and
Chen's close aides failed to gain the two-thirds approval required by
the Constitution in the 221-seat legislature June 27.</P>
      <P>To stress her determination to promote harmonious relations in
the country, Lu had invited the country's main political leaders to a
summit in early June to discuss ways of stabilizing the volatile
domestic political situation; however, the summit failed to go
forward due to cool response from political figures.</P>
      <P>Lu said Friday she still hopes to hold the summit and that her
alliance calls for rational consultation and competition amongst
different political parties and integrity of the administration.</P>
      <P>The alliance will also push the legislature to approve
nominations for the posts of president, vice president and members of
the Control Yuan, as well as the "Sunshine Law" to prevent
corruption.</P>
      <P>The alliance also urges the Legislative Yuan to speedily pass
major bills related to the country's defense and people's welfare,
and called for an independent judicial system to ensure justice, and
an effective media that can help "purify" society.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the alliance will hold different panels from
July to December to discuss topics such as anti-corruption efforts,
social order, moral reconstruction, education, industrial
development, the economic environment for investors and Taiwan's
globalization.</P>

      <P>Domestic electricity rates will increase
starting Saturday, with an average 5.8 percent hike depending on the

    <HEADLINE>FORMER KMT FINANCIER GETS 8-YEAR JAIL TERM IN ZANADU DEVELOPMENT CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Kuomintang (KMT) Business Management
Committee Chairman Liu Tai-ying was found guilty Friday of
misappropriation of funds and several other charges and sentenced to
a combined eight years in jail in the much reported Zanadu
Development Corp. case.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court meanwhile acquitted Liu of charges that
he took commissions from Zanadu, Taiwan Fertilizer, Taiwan Pineapple
and other companies.</P>
      <P>The scandal erupted in September 2002 when Su Hui-chen, Zanadu's
vice president and principle shareholder, accused Liu of taking more
than NT$1 billion from her in exchange for helping secure a
syndicated bank loan for her company.</P>
      <P>As a host of irregularities and illegal practices have been
suspected, involving quite a number of business and political
heavyweights, former president Lee Teng-hui and vice president Lien
Chan had appeared in court to provide testimony in the case.</P>
      <P>In June 2005, former Taiwan Fertilizer Chairman Hsieh Sheng-fu
was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in jail, Su to eight years
behind bars, and Yu Chen Yueh-ying -- a former Kaohsiung County
magistrate and Democratic Progressive Party politician -- to one year
and six months.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Liu was found guilty of six counts of violating the
tax code, business accounting law and corporate law. He was given
sentences ranging from three months to two years and 10 months for a
combined eight-year sentence.</P>
      <P>Liu's lawyer Chen Sung-tung said Liu might appeal because
prosecutors had "mistakenly believed in" Su's accusations against the
defendant.</P>
      <P>Chen said he made his statement on the basis that of the 12
"facts" prosecutors had charged Liu with, eight were found to be in
Liu's favor.</P>
      <P>In connection with the case, former legislator Lin Ming-yi was
sentenced to eight months in jail for breaking business accounting
law; businessman Hsieh Wen-chin was given a term of one year and six
months for embezzlement; and three China Development Financial
Holding Co. officials -- Chen Kun-yung, Chen Jui-hsun and Yang
Ching-lan -- were given probation on terms ranging from eight months
to one year and two months.</P>
      <P>Shih Che-hsiung, China Development's vice president, was
sentenced to three terms -- four months, one year and four months,
and one year -- for a combined two-year-six-month sentence after
being convicted of several charges of embezzlement and breaking the
tax code and business accounting law.</P>
      <P>Su Chih-jen, brother of former president Lee's secretary Su
Chih-cheng, was charged with breach of trust and the prosecution in
this case requested a three-year-nine-month sentence for him. Su fled
the country in October 2002, becoming a fugitive suspect.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CONDEMNED FOR BLUNDER CAUSING ELECTRICITY PRICE HIKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution
Friday condemning President Chen Shui-bian for halting construction
on the fourth nuclear power plant in 2000, making electricity price
hikes inevitable for Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to make up for huge
losses.</P>
      <P>A total of 110 legislators -- mostly opposition legislators -- in
the 210-seat legislature voted for the resolution, which also
condemns former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and former Minister of
Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi for the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government's decision to cancel the fourth nuclear power plant
project in October 2000 on grounds it wanted to create a nuclear-free
homeland.</P>
      <P>Although the government changed its mind in February 2001 and
allowed construction on the project to resume, state-owned Taipower
suffered such huge losses that the national treasury had to spend
NT$216.5 billion to cover extra budgets, interests and increased
costs for generating electricity.</P>
      <P>Taipower has announced that it will hike electricity rates July 1
for an extra revenue of NT$30 billion to maintain a financial
balance.</P>
      <P>The legislators of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and People First Party claimed the price hike is a
consequence of the DPP government trying to govern the nation by
placing ideology ahead of the well-being of its people.</P>
      <P>They said they passed the resolution in hopes that similar
blunders will not occur again to harm the interests of the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA UNHAPPY WITH JAPAN'S CHASE OF TAIWANESE FISHING BOAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has expressed "grave
concern" over Japan's treatment of a Taiwanese fishing boat allegedly
intruding into Japan's exclusive economic zone, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lu was referring to the Fuhsiang No. 16, a fishing boat from
Taipei county's Chinshan township which was chased by Japanese coast
guard patrols while operating in waters some 292 nautical miles
northeast of Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration immediately sent a patrol to the
disputed area, but Japanese authorities insisted on slapping the
Taiwanese fishing boat with a fine of 4 million yen on the ground
that the Fuhsiang had transcended the "temporary demarcation line"
and intruded into its exclusive economic zone. </P>
      <P>According to reports from Okinawa, coast guard patrols and
fishing boats from the two countries have continued a standoff in the
open seas. The eigh crew members aboard the Fuhsiang vessel are all
safe and healthy, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Lu said Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Chang Hsiao-yueh met
with Tadashi Ikeda, Japan's representative in Taiwan, Friday
afternoon to express the government's "grave concern" over Japan's
handling of the incident.</P>
      <P>Chang was quoted as having told Ikeda that bilateral fishing
disputes should be resolved through consultations and negotiations.
According to the ship's owner, the Fuhsiang consistently operated
within the "temporary demarcation line" Thursday and didn't intruded
into the Japanese economic zone.</P>
      <P>Because of their conflicting claim over the Tiaoyutai Islands in
the East China Sea, Taiwan and Japan have often been embroiled in
fishing disputes. The waters surrounding the Tiaoyutais have been
Taiwan's traditional fishing grounds, but Japan has claimed rights
over the areas since the United States handed over control of the
island group along with Okinawa to Japan in 1972.</P>
      <P>Japan has since often detained or fined Taiwan fishing boats
operated in the disputed waters. The two countries had held 15 rounds
of talks since 1996, but failed to come to terms.</P>
      <P>To better protect Taiwanese fishing boats, the government has
designated the center line in the two countries' overlapping economic
zones as the "temporary demarcation line" and vowed to protect the
safety and fishing rights of Taiwanese fishing boats operating within
that line.</P>
      <P>During Friday's talks, Chang urged Ikeda to push Japan to hold a
new round of fishery talks with Taiwan as soon as possible to settle
the longrunning disputes.</P>
      <P>The 16th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks was originally
scheduled for June, but was canceled due to great differences between
the two sides on certain fundamental issues, mainly their conflicting
sovereignty claim over the Tiaoyutais.</P>

After Ruling, Uncertainty Hovers at Cuba Prison 

As the U.S. Supreme Court prepared to rule
on the Bush administration's plan to try
terror suspects before special military
tribunals here, the commander of Guantanamo's
military detention center was asked what
impact the court's decision might have on its
operations. The Defense Department repeated 
that the court's sweeping ruling against the
tribunals did not undermine the government's
argument that it can hold foreign suspects
indefinitely and without charge, as "enemy
combatants" in its declared war on terror.
Privately, though, some administration 
officials involved in detention policy -- along 
with many critics of that policy -- were 
skeptical that Guantanamo could or would go 
about its business as before.


Wall Street Journal: Trial and Error,
Justices Bar Guantanamo Tribunals

In a withering opinion handed down on the
last day of its term, the U.S. Supreme Court
declared unlawful the Bush administration's
military tribunals, an alternative legal system
established to prosecute enemy prisoners without
granting them traditional rights found in
courts-martial. The tribunals were among the
first and most far-reaching of White House
responses to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cancer remained Taiwan's No. 1 killer in
2005 for the 24th year in a row, accounting for more than 26 percent
of fatalities, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>On average, cancer claimed a life in Taiwan about every 14
minutes and seven seconds, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the DOH's active promotion of early screening, the
cancer mortality has declined in recent years, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the officials added that the incidence of colon &amp;
rectal cancer, female breast cancer and oral cancer has increased
probably because of Westernized diet, higher fat intake, insufficient
exercise, smoking and men's habit of chewing betel nuts.</P>
      <P>The ranking of top 10 causes of death in 2005 remained almost
same as in 2004, with cancer followed in order by stroke, heart
disease, diabetes, accidents, pneumonia, chronic liver disease,
kidney disease, suicide and hypertension-related diseases.</P>
