    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL PRAISES TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT BEFORE ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan would rather the United States keep
its 25-year-old Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) intact than revise it,
because attempts to do so could led to "unexpected results, " an
official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>With 10 days to go before the act's 25th anniversary, Ling-hu
Jung-da, the deputy director for the Department of North American
Affairs, said the act has stabilized relations between Taipei and
Washington and has prevented the United States from tilting the power
balance in Beijing's favor in the last 25 years. He added that itis
not out of date in any way.</P>
      <P>The act, passed in 1979 after Washington switched its diplomatic
ties from Taipei to Beijing, virtually ensures Taiwan the best
possible treatment from the United States next to formal diplomatic
ties, according to Ling-hu.</P>
      <P>Noting that some pro-Taiwan U.S. congressmen tried in vain to
push for a Taiwan Security Enhancement Act in 1999, Ling-hu said that
any attempts to revise the TRA might backlash and lead to results not
intended by the initiators. Therefore, he went on, Taipei prefers
"not to fix it if it is not broken."</P>
      <P>Actually, Ling-hu said, the TRA gives the U.S.
administration considerable leeway in dealing with Taiwan, and can
accommodate most attempts on the part of the Congress to promote
bilateral ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. APPROVES SALES OF LONG-RANGE EARLY WARNING RADAR TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pentagon has notified the U.S. Congress
of the sale to Taiwan of two long-range early warning radar systems
capable of detecting ballistic and cruise missiles, even though the
Legislative Yuan has only approved the budget for one of the items.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tang Huo-sheng of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said Thursday that the Ministry of National Defense actually
wants to buy two of the radar sets. He accused it of using an clever
method to make sure the purchase is passed by the legislature and
said it will in the future try to present the budget for another
radar system to the legislature.</P>
      <P>Tang, who is opposed to the purchase, claims that the purchase of
the long-range early warning radar is no more than Taiwan serving as
a "doorkeeper" for the United States.</P>
      <P>According to Tang, if the United States wants to sell two Ultra
High Frequency long-range early warning radar systems, it should
"have to make it cheaper for Taiwan, otherwise, Taiwan cannot afford
the purchase."</P>
      <P>In view of the missile threat from mainland China, the MND has
been building up its anti-missile capability. In addition to the
purchase of batteries of Patriot III anti-missile systems, it has
also requested the purchase of the long-range early warning radar
systems.</P>
      <P>The military discussed the necessity of buying the 10-story-high
radar system during the process, which some have claimed could be an
easy target in battle, but went ahead with purchase preparations
because of the fact that with its range of 3,000 kilometers, it can
monitor as far as Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang on the mainland, giving
Taiwan's air defenses more time to respond in the event of a missile
attack.</P>
      <P>The MND plans to have one early warning radar installation in
southern Taiwan and another in northern Taiwan, but this plan has
raised questions from legislators, who feel that the combat needs of
Taiwan military only requires a range of 800 km.</P>
      <P>They also questioned the cost of the systems, claiming that it is
a burden that Taiwan cannot afford.</P>
      <P>Faced with the stiff opposition from legislators, the MND had to
make an estimated budget of US$800 million, appropriation of which
will begin this year.</P>
      <P>The full radar package also includes missile warning centers,
facilities to house and maintain the radar equipment and training
programs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Cyril Wecht, an acclaimed U.S. forensic
pathologist who visited Taiwan earlier this week to help investigate
the March 19 assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian, sent
a letter to the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) Thursday in
recognition of its forensic investigative team's professionalism.</P>
      <P>Wecht said in his letter that he was very grateful for the team's
kindness and the hospitality extended to himself and his two
partners.</P>
      <P>"Without your courtesy and support, I might have been unable to
carry out the forensic examination of the March 19 shooting, " Wecht
said in his letter to Cheng Hsiao-kuei, the CIB forensic department
chief.</P>
      <P>Wecht praised the CIB forensic department for its speedy
completion of forensic examinations of the crime scene and its
gathering of evidence in a highly professional manner. He asked Cheng
to convey his admiration and gratitude to her CIB colleagues for
their assistance and cooperation during his visit.</P>
      <P>Wecht also presented an autographed copy of his book "Mortal
Evidence" to Cheng as a gift.</P>
      <P>Wecht and two other U.S. forensic scientists -- Michael G. Haag,
a forensic firearms expert with U.S. Forensic Science Consultants,
Inc. and Timothy Palmbach, a crime scene investigative specialist --
went to the southern city of Tainan Monday to visit the scene of the
shooting. They also visited the Chi Mei Medical Center, where Chen
and Vice President Annette Lu, both of whom were slightly injured in
the shooting, were taken for treatment.</P>
      <P>The trio made the whirlwind visit to Taiwan at the request of Dr.
Henry Lee, a world-renowned Chinese-American forensic scientist who
was invited by State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa to assist in
the forensic investigation into the election-eve shooting.</P>
      <P>Because of his busy schedule, however, Lee cannot come to Taiwan
until April 13.</P>
      <P>After their examination tour, the three U.S. forensic experts
said they would not draw any conclusion until they have conducted
further studies in their U.S. laboratory. Lee will bring their study
results to Taiwan later this month.</P>
      <P>Chen suffered a 2 cm wide, 11 cm long wound when a bullet grazed
his lower abdomen, while another bullet scratched Lu's right knee.</P>
      <P>After viewing photos of the wounds provided by the CIB, and with
the information provided by the Chi Mei hospital staff, Wecht said he
initially determined that it was very likely a fresh gunshot wound.</P>
      <P>Chen and Lu were shot while riding in an open-top jeep on a
street in Tainan during the last day of campaigning for the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen narrowly defeated his sole contender -- Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan -- in the bitterly fought race. Lien contested the result,
claiming that the election-eve shooting unfairly led to a swelling of
sympathy votes for Chen. Lien has filed a lawsuit to nullify the
election.</P>

      <P>Taitung's Fong Nien Airport in eastern
Taiwan is scheduled to expand its runway in June to allow
international charter planes to the facility, the head of the Civil

      <P>Traffic issues have long caused a bottleneck in the development
of Taitung County's tourism industry, but CAA Director-General Chang
Kuo-cheng said that the administration will invest NT$200 million
(US$5.98 million) in expanding the runway there to facilitate
international charter flight operations.</P>
      <P>Taitung airport used to be for military use and its runway and
taxiway are based on military standards, said Chang, adding that the
width of the runway will be expanded by seven meters on both sides,
making it 45 meters wide, but the original runway's length of 2,438
meters will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>In addition, extra land needs to be expropriated for construction
of a second taxiway, making the distance between the runway and
taxiway much wider. This will upgrade the safety index and enable

      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of National

Wall Street Journal: Shell Estimate Ignored Warnings.

Royal Dutch/Shell Group planners warned their bosses as early as
2000 that the oil giant risked disappointing financial markets with
overly optimistic assumptions about exploration-and- production
projects around the world, according to internal Shell documents.

The warnings, contained in a June 2000 internal presentation, are
part of a body of company documents warning at least Shell's top
managers of deep-seated problems emerging at the Anglo- Dutch oil
giant, according to a person familiar with the situation.

The report is the latest in a series of documents to emerge that
indicate senior Shell executives were warned about serious problems

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has been closely
monitoring the situation in the Taiwan Strait and there are no signs
of an immediate military crisis there, according to Adm. Thomas B.
Fargo, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command.</P>
      <P>Testifying at a public hearing in the U.S. Congress Wednesday,
Fargo said that there is no danger of an imminent military conflict
across the strait, but pointed out that miscalculation by either
Taiwan or mainland China could easily lead to a destructive crisis.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Strait has become the most sensitive spot in the
region and the U.S. military has maintained a close watch on the area
since campaigns for Taiwan's March 20 presidential election kicked
off, Fargo noted.</P>
      <P>He added that the U.S. Pacific Command is ready to help Taiwan
defend itself at any time according to orders issued by President
George W. Bush under the policy framework set up by the U.S.
government's "one China" policy, the three joint communiques signed
by Washington and Beijing and the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States will move to deal with a military
attack by mainland China against Taiwan should tensions between the
two sides persist in the face of a continued military buildup by the
mainland, Fargo said that the U.S. Pacific Command forces remain on

      <P>It is out of the question that any police
leader could skew the direction of the investigation into the March

Bureau Director Ho You-yi claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a response to opposition calls for him to withdraw from the
investigation because of his alleged relationship with the president,
the chief of the country's detectives said forensic examination and
identification is a highly developed science in which only evidence
has a voice, and any attempts to steer a criminal investigation
regardless of the evidence are doomed to fail.</P>
      <P>Noting that three U.S. forensic experts have conducted an

Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa, Ho said that his bureau could
not hog the investigation and is not in a position to meddle with its

      <P>He said his office is more than willing to exchange views with
any lawmakers and forensic experts who question the work of the

      <P>Legislators of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP)
are united and are unlikely to change their stance, despite the
alliance's defeat in the March 20 presidential election, Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks as the topic of the year-end legislative
election quietly moves onto the political scene in the wake of the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>At present, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is the
largest political party in the legislature, but the KMT and the PFP
between them still enjoy a slight edge over the DPP and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), in the 225-seat legislature. Both Wang
and Legislative Yuan Vice President P.K. Chiang are also KMT vice
chairmen.</P>
      <P>The DPP, basking in its latest victory after winning 50.12
percent of the votes in the March 20 presidential election, is
already eyeing the year-end legislative elections as crucial to
gaining a stable legislative majority.</P>
      <P>Reports have claimed that the DPP is trying to lure some of the
KMT legislators who have identified with the DPP's promotion of a
"Taiwan identity" into its fold in order to undermine the strength of
the opposition camp.</P>
      <P>Wang said that despite this, the opposition lawmakers have their
hearts firmly set and are unlikely to change their allegiance.</P>
      <P>On the possible course of the "pan-blue alliance" in the wake of
the presidential election, Wang said that the cooperation mechanism
will continue.</P>
      <P>In nominating legislators for the December legislative polls, the
alliance will give priority to incumbents before nominating new
candidates, he said.</P>
      <P>Wang denied reports that the DPP is trying to lure him because it
expects a mass defection to the DPP fold if he were to take the lead.</P>
      <P>Wang, who concurrently serves as a KMT vice chairman and campaign
manager of the "pan-blue alliance, " has been the focus of keen
attention since the election.</P>
      <P>Known to have a close relationship with former President Lee
Teng-hui, Wang said that he was unaffected by the outcome of the
election. Instead, he said he will maintain neutrality and promote a
middle-of-the-road stance, as well as handling legislative affairs in
a fair manner.</P>
      <P>Other reports have speculated that several DPP heavyweights are
interested in the legislative presidency, including DPP
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, Legislator Hung Chi-chang of the
New Trend faction, and Legislative Whip Ker Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>However, Hung would only say that it is still too early to talk
about the battle for the legislative presidency.</P>
      <P>He said that the most important task is for Premier Yu Shyi-kun
to continue to lead the administrative team so that its performance
will win the party a stable majority in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the TSU said that it was disappointed about Wang's
performance in the role of coordinator in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, TSU legislative whip, claimed that Wang has not
played his role as a president but is mostly a KMT vice chairman. He
expressed hope that the DPP and the TSU can garner over half the
seats in the December elections in order to give them the chance to
vie for the legislative presidency.</P>
      <P>In response, KMT secretary-general Lin Feng-cheng said that the
"pan-blue alliance" will put its weight behind Wang and that the
DPP's attempt to drive a wedge into the alliance is just a "fantasy."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-ISRAEL TEMPORARY ADMISSION AGREEMENT GOES INTO EFFECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A temporary duty-free admission agreement
between Taiwan and Israel went into effect Thursday, according to the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Israel is the first country in the Middle East to sign such an
agreement with Taiwan, a move that is expected to help promote mutual
economic and trade ties between the two countries, a TAITRA official
said.</P>
      <P>For political and security reasons, Israel maintains tight
regulations on goods imported for trade fairs, which has been
inconvenient for Taiwanese businessmen doing business there, the
official continued, adding that Taiwan started negotiations with
Israel on the issue in 1996, which proved futile as a result of the
lack of diplomatic ties between the two sides. After lengthy
negotiations, however, an agreement was signed last July that is now
in effect, said the official.</P>
      <P>Under the international temporary admission system -- the ATA
Carnet -- the signatories agree to offer temporary duty-free
admission of goods traded internationally for use as commercial
samples, goods for presentation and professional equipment or
facilities for use at trade fairs, the TAITRA official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has signed similar temporary admission agreements with 25
countries around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PROGRESS MADE IN TAIPEI-SEOUL AIRLINKS TALKS: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiations on resuming direct air links
between Taiwan and South Korea are still ongoing, as no concrete
agreement has yet been reached, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman Richard Shih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks after Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san said at a Legislative Yuan committee
meeting earlier in the day that Taiwan and South Korean officials met
late last year to discuss a resumption of direct air links, which
were cut off in 1992 following South Korea's switch of diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the two sides are discussing the wording of a
new aviation agreement. "I hope the foreign affairs ministries of the
two countries can reach agreement on the wording in the final stage
of talks to pave the way for a resumption of direct flight services
and thus help boost bilateral tourism and commercial exchanges, " Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the MOFA's stance on Lin's statement, Shih said the
MOFA is continuing talks with South Korean authorities in line with
the principles of "national dignity, reciprocity and substantial
interests."</P>
      <P>Shih said both sides fully understand that a resumption of air
links is critical to upgrading bilateral relations and boosting
mutual interests.</P>
      <P>"But negotiations involve many complicated issues and no concrete
results have been reached so far. We are still negotiating the
issue," Shih added.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said the biggest obstacle to resuming the air
links lies in Seoul's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's sovereign
status in the new aviation agreement for fear of offending Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE URGED TO RESUME REVIEW OF MAJOR ECONOMIC BILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Executive Yuan on
Thursday urged the Legislative Yuan to get back to its review work
quickly.</P>
      <P>Liu Shih-fang, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, said that
the review of many major economic bills has been put on hold since
the March 20 presidential election, adding that even in the heat of
the campaign in the run-up to the presidential election, the
legislature was not stalled.</P>
      <P>But she said that after the election, which saw President Chen
Shui-bian win by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes out of a total
of more than 13 million votes cast, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) is
only concerned about the recount of the ballots and an investigation
into the election-eve shooting of President Chen.</P>
      <P>Both President Chen and Vice Annette Lu were lightly injured
during the shooting when they were riding on an open-top jeep while
canvassing in Tainan, southern Taiwan, on the eve of the election.
The opposition KMT-PFP ticket claimed the shooting gave Chen sympathy
votes and ultimately victory.</P>
      <P>All the committees in the legislature have deviated from their
major agendas, and the review of major economic bills and general
interpellations have been put on hold, a situation she said was quite
"inappropriate."</P>
      <P>She cited as an example that because of the aborted meeting of
the Economic Affairs Committee in the legislature, only six out of
the scheduled 28 state-owned companies' budget review has been
completed.</P>
      <P>However, according to the Budget Law, the budget reviews of the
state-owned enterprises should be completed by November of the
previous year. She lamented the fact that the reviews are still in
the committee, and has yet to pass the second and third readings.</P>
      <P>She also pointed out that the education committee last week only
discussed the protest at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, where
supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" have converged for
days to protest against what they perceive as an "unfair" election.</P>
      <P>Liu asked legislators from across the party spectrum to put away
their political disputes and let the judicial system solve the
questions surrounding the election now that the "pan-blue alliance"
has filed a lawsuit with the Taiwan High Court to nullify the
election.</P>
      <P>She urged them to concentrate on the review of major economic
bills, such as the administration's five-year, NT$500 billion
(US$15.1 billion) 10 New Construction Projects and a financial
reconstruction bill, so as not to disappoint the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL WOES SHOULD NOT HINDER CROSS-STRAIT TRADE TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two-way trade and economic exchanges
between Taiwan and mainland China should go on despite the fact that
President Chen Shui-bian succeeded in his re-election bid in the
March 20 presidential election, according to a veteran economist and
a prominent political figure.</P>
      <P>Vincent Siew, vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and a former premier of the previous KMT-led government, made
the remarks at a seminar Wednesday in his capacity as chairman of the
Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation. Scores of experts from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the academic sector
also took part.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic
cooperation is an irreversible trend amid the many challenges brought
by globalization, Siew said that political disputes should not hamper
bilateral exchanges on this front. He called on the two sides to
engage each other in a pragmatic manner to prevent political issues
from undermining mutually beneficial activities.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, head of the DPP's mainland affairs department,
and DPP lawmaker Hung Chi-chang, said that a policy framework
outlined by President Chen to deal with cross-strait exchanges has
covered the trade and economic fields and they contended that it is
better now to focus on concrete issues, such as allowing mainland
Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan and opening free cargo transport.</P>
      <P>Juan Ming, a political dissident from mainland China who now
serves as a guest professor at Tamkang University, said that he is in
favor of Siew's idea of setting up a cross-strait common market. He
said he believes that Taiwan-mainland trade and economic issues can
be dealt with under such a mechanism without touching on the "one
China" dispute.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court opened its first
hearing Friday on the country's first lawsuit seeking to nullify the
March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Instead of asking the court to recount all the ballots from the
presidential election, attorneys for the plaintiffs, Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate, James Soong, requested the
court to reexamine only the ballots for President Chen Shui-bian and
his running mate, Vice President Annette Lu, who beat Lien and Soong
by a wafer-thin margin.</P>
      <P>Citing the president's decision to hold an unprecedented national
referendum simultaneously with the presidential election on March 20,
an unexplained assassination attempt in which Chen and Lu suffered
light injuries on the eve of election day, and the government's
decision to put the armed forces and police on higher alert after the
shooting, the plaintiffs' attorneys claimed the election was not fair
and a recount of the votes is necessary.</P>
      <P>They requested the re-examination of only the votes for the
winning ticket, as well as the 330,000-odd invalid ballots in the
election, which they claimed were far more than in previous
elections.</P>
      <P>Attorneys for Chen and Lu, who have already agreed to the
plaintiffs' request to recount all the votes in the election, were
outraged that the plaintiffs changed their request and limited the
scope of the reexamination to the disfavor of the defendants.</P>
      <P>Instead of reexamining only the votes for the Chen-Lu ticket,
they insisted all the votes be reexamined.</P>
      <P>They also argued with the plaintiffs' attorneys over who should
bear the cost of the recount, which is estimated at about NT$100
million (US$3.03 million) . The plaintiffs' attorneys said the
defendants should bear the responsibility while the defendants'
attorneys said the plaintiffs should.</P>
      <P>Instead of handing down a ruling, Judge Wu Ching-yuan, who led
two other judges in hearing the case, asked attorneys for the
plaintiffs and defendants to work out an out-of-court agreement
within five days on the range and procedure of the reexamination and
how the recount should be financed. The hearing will be resumed after
the court receives their written agreement.</P>
      <P>"Don't blame the court if the recount cannot begin because no one
wants to finance it," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Today's hearing drew a large number of journalists, although
neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants appeared.</P>
      <P>The plaintiffs' request to reexamine the votes for the Chen-Lu
ticket has drawn fire from Chen's ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), with Cheng Wen-tsan, the DPP deputy chief for the Department
of Culture and Communications, saying that the plaintiffs' request
proves the insincerity of their claim that they wanted a recount of
all the votes.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Chiu Yi from Soong's People First Party
argued that the limited scope of reexamination of the votes for the
Chen-Lu ticket and invalid ballots will save recount costs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An elderly retired soldier who
moved to Taiwan from mainland China along with the Kuomintang
government in 1949 recently donated all of his personal savings to
help needy people in a show of his love for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-chung, 86, who is living at the self-payment Pakuashan
Veterans Home in central Taiwan, mailed a check for NT$1.3 million to
Shen Chun-hua, a China Television Co. anchor, asking her to use the
money to help those who most need assistance.</P>
      <P>Wang said in his letter that he was worried about ethnic rifts in
the wake of the bitterly fought March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wang said, mounting ethnic disharmony is detrimental
to Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I'm determined to donate my savings to help needy
people as my way to give something back to the island, " Wang wrote
in his letter to Shen.</P>
      <P>Wang said he has only deducted a small sum of money to finance his
future living expenses and funeral costs. He has to pay for his
accommodation at the Pakuashan Veterans Home.</P>
      <P>Wang retired from the military in 1969. He didn't marry and has
no relatives in Taiwan. "I have habitually led a simple life and do
not need much money," he wrote.</P>
      <P>After an evening paper reported Wang's philanthropic deed, many
reporters scrambled to the veteran's home to interview him. But Wang
declined any publicity.</P>
      <P>Wang's friends at the veteran's home said Wang is a fan of Shen.
"As Shen has often reported on news events regarding disadvantaged
people, Wang decided to donate his savings to poor people through
Shen," said one of Wang's friends.</P>
      <P>In the fiery and bruising presidential campaign, ethnic origin
was used by some politicians as a tool to woo voters. Ethnic rifts
seemed to become more serious after mainland-born opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan narrowly lost the election to incumbent
Taiwan-born President Chen Shui-bian. Lien has filed a lawsuit to
nullify the election on the grounds that an election-eve shooting of
Chen unfairly swayed sympathy votes in Chen's favor.</P>

      <P>Participants in the national examination
will now be able to find out their results immediately after sitting
the examination, thanks to the inauguration Friday of a computerized
examination center.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Examination Vice Minister Huang Ya-pang, who
concurrently serves as the convener of a national examination task
force, said that participants in the examination will from now in
answer questions on computers.</P>
      <P>Referring to concerns about anti-fraud measures employed by the
computerized system, the Ministry of Examination officials said that
they have taken advantage of the experience of other countries in
preventing fraud when taking computerized tests for things like
drivers' licenses and TOEFL certification.</P>
      <P>The options in the tests could vary from one to another so as to
prevent participants from copying from examinees in neighboring seats
and the anti-fraud mechanism will be even stricter than in the
traditional pen-and-paper examination, they said.</P>
      <P>To avoid computer experts from hacking into the computerized
center of the National Examination Building in Mucha, all computers
at the center will be connected only within the center itself and
will not be accessible from outside the center.</P>
      <P>Examination Minister Liu Chu-chi also said that in view of the
arrival of the computer age and the consideration of ease of use for
the general public, the ministry began studying the possibility of
giving computerized tests in the national examination two years ago.</P>
      <P>Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen said that in the past,
participants would have to wait for one or two months before finding
out their test results and that the inauguration of the computerized
center has greatly cut the waiting time.</P>
      <P>The computerized center has been installed on the eighth floor of
the National Examination Building, with 140 personal computers for
the participants to use for the examination, according to Examination
Yuan officials.</P>
      <P>The center will not only save on the resources required to run
the national examination, but will also make test-taking more

      <P>Fueled by the government's drive to promote
Taiwan's promising biotechnology sector, the private sector and the
government inked a cooperative venture Friday to explore the
development of an advanced anti-cancer drug.</P>
      <P>Tsay Shwu-chen, general manager of Well-being Biotechnology
Corporation, said at the signing ceremony that her company has
already succeeded in developing a platinum anti-cancer drug in
cooperation with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
-- a leading research institute funded by the government.</P>
      <P>According to Tsay, the platinum anti-cancer drug -- the first of
its kind in the world -- is a genetic drug with a DNA-cleaving
ability that makes it suitable for treating various types of tumors.</P>
      <P>As the company has successfully developed the lead drug, Tsay
said that it is expected that the new drug will hit the market in
seven or eight years after it has undergone tests and clinical trials
in animals and humans aimed at upgrading its bio-availability --
namely, increased water solubility and reduced toxicity.</P>
      <P>After going through the whole examination process, the drug
containing platinum will have the ability to recognize different DNA
sequences presented by tumors without hurting normal cells, making it
a secure and effective drug for the treatment of prostate cancer,
colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer.</P>
      <P>According to statistics, the global market scale of cancer drugs
is worth about US$10.7 billion each year, with platinum cancer drugs
accounting for US$1.1 billion.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which has kicked off an all-out
effort to promote biotechnology -- a key segment included in its high
profile "two-trillion, two- star" program -- granted financial aid
worth NT$60 million (US$1.81 million ) to the joint venture set up by
Well-being and the ITRI.</P>
      <P>An ITRI official expressed his belief that Taiwan will be able to
reap a rich harvest in the international market with this new and
unique drug, which will help create business alliances with foreign
companies.</P>

The commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks said on
Thursday that it was pressing the White House to explain why the Bush
administration had blocked thousands of pages of classified foreign
policy and counterterrorism documents from former President Bill
Clinton's White House files from being turned over to the panel's

Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said some Clinton
administration documents had been withheld because they were
"duplicative or unrelated, " while others were withheld because they
were "highly sensitive" and the information in them could be relayed
to the commission in other ways. "We are providing the commission
with access to all the information they need to do their job, " Mr.
McClellan said.

Wall Street Journal: The Future of Jobs: New Ones Arise, Wage Gap

Much of the American anxiety about outsourcing to India and China

The good news: The U.S. almost certainly isn't going to run out

    <HEADLINE>THREE SUSPECTS INDICTED ON CHARGES OF SPYING FOR MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three men, including a middle-ranking
technician with the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology (CIST) , were indicted Friday on charges of spying for
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Public Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court said in
the indictment that the trio had helped give Beijing a glimpse into
the Taiwan air force's weaponry systems and to break through the U.S.
ban on arms sales to the mainland.</P>
      <P>The three espionage suspects were identified as Chen Shih-liang,
53, a technician at the CIST's Electronics Research Institute; Yeh
Wen-yuan, 55, a technology firm CEO who received training at the
CIST's electronics system design center; and Hsu Hsi-tse, 58, a
retired Chinese-American aerospace engineer who once worked at Boeing
Co.</P>
      <P>The trio were arrested last August. After nearly eight months of
investigation, prosecutors said the trio were found to have committed
a number of crimes, including disclosing national defense secrets,
document forgery and offenses to the national security law and the
trade law.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, Yeh got acquainted with a mainland
intelligence officer in 1991 during a trip to the mainland. Yeh later
set up a precision measurement equipment manufacturing firm on the
mainland and also opened a high-tech firm in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The mainland intelligence agent, surnamed Hsu, then asked Yeh to
help collect Taiwan defense intelligence and purchase banned
strategic high-tech products from the United States and major
European countries.</P>
      <P>Yeh began in October 2002 to collect documents concerning the
CIST's facilities and classified research programs with the
assistance of Chen Shih-liang, who worked at the CIST's radar
research department. The documents included an evaluation report on
whether Taiwan should join the U.S.-initiated theater missile defense
(TMD) program. Yeh personally brought the documents to his mainland
handler, earning at least US$26,000 from the deal.</P>
      <P>The indictment further says that Yeh made friends with Hsu
Hsi-tse in February 2002. Hsu resided in Los Angeles but often
traveled to Taiwan and the mainland for business purposes. As Hsu
needed Yeh's assistance in lobbying the mainland to purchase airport
flight control systems, he agreed to help gather information about
Taiwan-U.S. military cooperation programs and collected information
about Taiwan-U.S. cooperation in anti-submarine combat training.</P>
      <P>Hsu is also accused of having hacked into the U.S. government's
classified files to steal information about F-16 fighters' night-time
weaponry systems and strategic data links. U.S.-made F-16s, along
with French-made Mirages and locally built IDFs, form the backbone of
Taiwan's air force.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh helped the mainland authorities to purchase a
number of sensitive high-tech facilities, including PalmIR50 night
photography machines and a variety of night-vision equipment, sale of
which to the mainland have been prohibited by the United States since
the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>Yeh also counterfeited CIST "end-user certificates, " which
allowed Hsu to purchase sophisticated strategic night-vision
equipment for the mainland. The devices were sent to Taiwan first and
then brought to the mainland by Yeh himself.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO MAKE NEW PROPOSAL ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES IN INAUGURATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  2  (CNA)
(By Perry Hsieh and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in an
interview published by a major Japanese daily Friday that he will
make a new proposal on cross-Taiwan Strait relations in his May 20
inauguration.</P>
      <P>In the exclusive interview carried by the Yomiuri Shimbun, Chen
said the new proposal will be based on his inaugural address of four
years ago during which he made known his "four noes plus one" pledge,
including no declaration of independence if mainland China does not
use military force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that the idea of "one country on each side of
the Taiwan Strait" broached by him has become the view of the great
majority of the people and that the Taiwan people will never accept
the "one country, two systems" rhetoric espoused by the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he will press ahead with his plan to write a new
constitution in 2006 and implement it in 2008.</P>
      <P>In addition to cross-strait relations, the president also touched
on a broad range of issues, including Taiwan's first national
referendum, the year-end legislative elections, the election-eve
assassination attempt against him and the disputes in the wake of the
presidential election, as well as Taiwan's relations with Japan and
the United States.</P>
      <P>Speaking on his narrow victory over his sole challenger, Lien
Chan of the Kuomintang, by 0.228 percent, or 29,518 votes out of the
13 million votes cast in the March 20 election, Chen attributed his
success mainly to a rising national identity in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The national identity is a growing consciousness of the need to
protect Taiwan against the threat from the mainland, he said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the "one country, two systems" imposed on Hong Kong
by Beijing has failed, Chen said Taiwan will never accept that
formula as the basis for unification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The mainland leadership is afraid of the democratic development
in Taiwan, fearing it might affect Hong Kong and other restive areas
of the mainland, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chen denied that the referendum, which was held in tandem with
the presidential election, was a flop because the participation
threshold of 50 percent was not achieved. Instead, he said it was
"quite successful."</P>
      <P>Noting that there were concerns that the referendum would lead to
a vote on Taiwan independence and bring war and disaster, he said the
holding of the referendum attests that such was not the case and that
referendum has now become part of the life of Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The two questions posted in the referendum asked the voters
whether they approve of stepping up national defense in face of
missile threats from the mainland and whether a negotiation framework
for talks with the mainland should be established.</P>
      <P>Of the roughly 45 percent of eligible voters that voted in the
referendum, over 91 percent answered "yes" to both questions.</P>
      <P>He also spoke of the election-eve shooting that left him slightly
injured, saying it was the combination of "too many coincidences, "
although he added that it will not affect the democratic development
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the post-election turmoil in which supporters of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" protested against what they perceive
as "unfair election" because of voting irregularities and the
shooting -- which they believe swayed the bitterly contested election
in Chen's favor -- Chen said: "Even if the winning margin is only one
vote, it is still a win. This is what democracy is about," he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The next goal of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
will be to obtain over half of the seats in the 225-seat legislature
in the year-end legislative election, Chen said, adding that the DPP
had encountered difficulties over the past four years because it did
not have an overall legislative majority.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP is the largest party in the legislature, the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party between
them command a slight majority over the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>He said that continued protests by the opposition camp after the
election would help contribute to a DPP victory in the December
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The paper also reported that Chen wants to become a dominant
force in the legislature, probably because of his intention to push
for a new constitution.</P>
      <P>The president envisions the new constitution as calling for a
three-branch government, instead of the existing five-branch one,
along with measures to strengthen the president's power and halve the
number of legislative seats.</P>
      <P>But Chen stressed that the new constitution will not touch on
Taiwan independence and will be shaped mainly to make possible
further administrative reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TIMETABLE SET FOR BUILDING INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
has ruled out the feasibility of building an international airport in
southern Taiwan in the short term, on the grounds that there is no
immediate need for such a facility in the region.</P>
      <P>The decision was reached during a CAA meeting Thursday in which
officials discussed the location of a possible international airport
in southern Taiwan, according to a CAA spokesman.</P>
      <P>Although Chiku township in Tainan County and the Nanhsing Project
in Kaohsiung City are highly interested in vying for the opportunity
to host an international airport, the spokesman said that no
timetable has been set to decide on the airport's location, as such a
construction project requires long-term and comprehensive evaluation
and the local authorities must first remove any hurdles blocking the
way.</P>
      <P>For instance, if the airport were to be constructed in Chiku, the
Tainan county government would have to find ways to resolve problems
arising from its brine ponds and the conservation of the endangered
black-faced spoonbills that winter there, he said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the airport were to be located in Nanhsing,
the Kaohsiung city government would need to iron out a comprehensive
and detailed blueprint about its plans to reclaim land and submit an
environmental impact assessment regarding its marine ecology and
climate factors, he said.</P>
      <P>The CAA will be able to start an across-the-board study of the
issue in conjunction with the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications and the Ministry of Economic Affairs only after the
local authorities have put forward thorough assessments, the official
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT MEETS CHARITY HEADS, OUTSTANDING BENEFICIARIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lauded Friday the
Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) -- a Taiwan version of
the U.S. Christian Children's Fund (CCF) -- for its unconditional
care given to children from underprivileged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>During an audience at the Presidential Office, Chen cited the
TFCF as "a driving force enabling the government to try strenuously
and undauntedly to administer the country."</P>
      <P>During the audience, Chen met Edmund DeJarnette, a retired U.S.
ambassador and chairman of the U.S. Christian Children's Fund, Mrs.
DeJarnette, CCF CEO John Schultz, TFCF CEO Chen Pang-hung, and 10
newly elected "self-strengthening" children.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his gratitude toward DeJarnette and
Schultz for the CCF's long-term support of the TFCF that had enabled
the Taiwan charity organization to continue to beef up its services
to disadvantaged children and families.</P>
      <P>The CCF's assistance to the TFCF has also underlined the truth
that "love is without borders," Chen told his guests.</P>
      <P>Chen also gave a thumbs-up to the TFCF management, which has
helped more than 120,000 people since the organization's inception in
1950. For him, the name TFCF is shorthand for "home, " where orphans
and children from poor or broken homes can find shelter and warmth,
Chen added.</P>
      <P>He also offered his respects and encouragement to the 10 children
and teenagers that were elected as the 2004 TFCF "self-strengthening"
youths.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has been touched by the stories of each of the award
recipients and added that their zest for life and their success in
remaining undaunted by fate are worth emulation by all.</P>
      <P>The 10 youths, all from poor and broken families, were cited as
young "self-strengthening" heroes last week for their courage in the
face of adversity.</P>
      <P>The youths, aged between 10 and 16, were elected in recognition
of their vitality and endurance against challenges and hardships that
their counterparts from normal families could never imagine facing,
said TFCF CEO Chen.</P>
      <P>The 10 youths were selected from among 21,000 children and
teenagers who are on a TFCF list of recipients of aid from Taiwan
society.</P>
      <P>According to TFCF management, 10-year-old Kang Yao-wen, the
youngest among those cited, has undergone six operations over the
years because of assorted genetic illnesses. Yao-wen, however, has
never complained to his divorced and financially constrained mother.
Instead, he has studied hard, despite his physical weakness, and has
earned scholarships every year to help his mother out.</P>
      <P>Han Chia-yun, 14, was deserted along with her mentally challenged
older brother by their father and his second wife, who fled their
village to escape their creditors. One night, after days of severe
hunger, Chia-yun carried her brother on her back through farmland to
a country road to seek help. The police came to their aid and later
found their birth mother.</P>
      <P>Having since lived with her mother, Chia-yun has been doing all
the chores at home, including taking care of her brother, so that her
mother can work outside the home to support the family. Despite all
the adversities she has faced, Chia-yun has remained a top student at
school, TFCF personnel said.</P>
      <P>Chien Zi-chiang, 13, whose father died of illness and whose
mother is an alcoholic, also has an older brother who is mentally
challenged, but he has not been defeated by fate either. Instead, he
has excelled academically and has become a Hualien County badminton
champion. Zi-chiang has vowed to become a teacher when he grows up in
order to help others.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC)
Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said Friday that the Legislative Yuan
should revise the law to build up the election commission's
credibility.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks during an inspection tour of the Changhua
County Election Commission.</P>
      <P>Since the end of the March 20 presidential election, Huang has
been visiting election commissions in various parts of the island. In
addition to extending thanks to election staff for their devoted
services in handling the presidential poll, Huang has also reviewed
the sealed ballot boxes and the rosters of local-level election
staff.</P>
      <P>As the defeated opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential
candidate, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, has filed a lawsuit
contesting the election outcome, the Taiwan High Court has impounded
all ballot boxes and election staff namelists to use as evidence.</P>
      <P>Lien lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian by a razor-thin
margin of 29,518 votes, or 0.228 percent of the some 13 million
ballots cast. Lien claims that the election might have been rigged as
more than 300,000 ballots were invalid. He demanded a vote recount, a
demand to which Chen has acquiesced. The High Court held its first
hearing Friday afternoon as the first step in determining how and
when the recount should be carried out.</P>
      <P>Huang said the CEC has made every possible effort to prevent any
irregularities in the election. "Since the case has entered the
judicial process, we have to respect the court's ruling, " he added.</P>
      <P>Huang further pointed out that the CEC is impartial, but he
acknowledged that the procedure for selecting CEC members should be
revised in order to enhance the commission's credibility.
At the moment, CEC members are recommended by various political
parties. Huang said he feels the legislature should amend the current
rules to make the CEC recognized as a "credible, independent and
impartial" agency.</P>

      <P>A White House spokesman played down
Friday questions on the origin of Washington's congratulatory
statement on President Chen Shui-bian's re-election, saying that "he
wouldn't read greater policy implications into the statement."</P>
      <P>National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack made the
remarks while responding to media questions regarding the White House
statement congratulating Chen on his re-election and the fact that
the congratulatory message came from the White House press secretary
rather than from President George W. Bush himself.</P>
      <P>Chen defeated the opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket of
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate, People First
Party Chairman James Soong, by a razor-thin margin of less than
30,000 votes in the March 20 presidential election. Lien and Soong
have challenged the election result and have demanded a vote recount.</P>
      <P>The White House issued a statement March 26 in the name of the
White House press secretary congratulating Chen on his re-election
and reiterated its commitment to its "one-China" policy and the
Taiwan Relations Act. The statement also exhorted the Taiwan people
to resolve the election dispute through established legal mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Asked to explain why the statement was not issued in the name of
President George W. Bush, McCormack said that "we wouldn't read any
greater policy implications into what we said."</P>
      <P>"We congratulated Mr. Chen on his election victory and also noted
our confidence in the Taiwan people and Taiwan's democracy to resolve
any questions that surround that election," he added.</P>
      <P>As to a question relating to Vice President Annette Lu's request
that President Bush send a high-level delegation to attend the May 20
inauguration ceremony of the president- and vice president-elect, the

The jurors in the trial of two former Tyco were told to hold
off their deliberations Friday while the judge told them the case was
all over. There would be no verdict.

The frustration was especially intense among the jurors. What
caused the mistrial in the end, according to the judge, Justice
Michael J. Obus of the New York State Supreme Court, was outside
pressure brought to bear on one juror after her name was reported in
the news media.

Given just a bit more time, several jurors said yesterday, the
panel probably would have found the defendants guilty of at least
some of the 32 charges against them.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling and opposition parties kept
bickering over the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu Saturday, with the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (PFP) calling for an independent
investigation committee to be set up.</P>
      <P>Claiming the shooting negatively impacted their campaign in the
March presidential election, the KMT and PFP staged a rally in Taipei
Saturday, demanding that an independent investigation committee be
set up to probe the shooting in which both Chen and Lu were slightly
injured.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the rally, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou noted that
President Chen Shui-bian has agreed to a recount of the votes in the
election, which saw KMT Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate, PFP
Chairman James Soong, defeated by Chen and Lu by a narrow margin.
However, Ma went on, the president had not responded to the
opposition's call for an investigation committee.</P>
      <P>In order to clear the doubts surrounding the unexplained
shooting, Ma urged the president to respond positively to the request
for an independent probe into the accident by a special committee
under the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ma's calls were echoed by Wang Jin-pyng, the president of the
Legislative Yuan and a vice chairman of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Emerging from a closed-door meeting with KMT campaign workers in
Kaohsiung, Wang said the shooting dealt a heavy blow to the "pan-blue
alliance's" election campaign.</P>
      <P>The country's law enforcers owe the people an explanation of who
was behind the incident, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile a group of PFP lawmakers claimed Saturday that a scheme
is brewing among the president's aides to have the National Security
Bureau (NSB) take the blame for the shooting, citing what they called
"internal documents" of the NSB as evidence.</P>
      <P>The accusation has been denied by Cheng Wen-tsan, a deputy
director for the Department of the Culture and Communication of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Cheng challenged the PFP lawmakers to substantiate their
accusation with evidence or the credibility of their party would be
ruined by their irresponsible speculation.</P>
      <P>The opposition's questions about the shooting has put the
country's police chief Chang Si-liang in a tight spot.</P>
      <P>He told journalists that he will not dodge his responsibility for
the incident but shrugged off questions about a report that he is set
to offer to resign next week, following in the footsteps of the
former chief of National Security Bureau Tsai Chao-ming, who quit
earlier this week over the shooting.</P>
      <P>In a related story Saturday, Kuo Cheng-ni, a prosecutor at the
Tainan District Court who led the probe into the shooting, said
investigators are still trying to interview all the people filmed at
the scene of the shooting in Tainan by a TV news crew, adding that
some people who appear in the film are still unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>She also revealed that although two cartridges were found near
the shooting scene shortly after the incident, investigators are not

    <HEADLINE>OPENING OF DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS WILL COME: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although many enterprises see little hope
of the government opening direct cross-Taiwan Strait links in the
wake of the March 20 presidential election, some scholars claim that
the government will surely move in this direction.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with the Central News Agency, Chen
Poh-chih, chairman of the Taiwan Thinktank, said Saturday that the
promotion of direct transport links between the two sides of Taiwan
Strait is certainly a priority for the Democratic Progressive Party
administration, as shown in its campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that both the DPP and the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" made the promotion of direct cross-strait links one of
their campaign promises, with the only differences being the method
of implementation and other technical details.</P>
      <P>For example, Chen said, the government is more concerned about
the employment of local laborers and the possible impact direct
transport links could have on domestic industries.</P>
      <P>"I believe that even the opposition alliance will not advocate
the entry of mainland Chinese agricultural products into Taiwan, "
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government is already working unilaterally toward
the opening of direct transport links, citing the recent approval for
Air Macao to launch a new route connecting Shenzhen, in southern
China's Guangdong Province, and Taipei via Macao.</P>
      <P>"The total flight time is only two hours and 55 minutes, and it
can been seen as the best alternative until the completion of direct
transport links," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hung Teh-sheng, vice president of the Taiwan Institute
of Economic Research, claimed that the government knows well that
normalizing cross-strait economic and commercial relations is its
only option, so that direct links are a must.</P>
      <P>Although normalizing cross-strait economic and commercial
relations is quite important, the nation's interests should be the
government's main concern, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The economist also warned the government to pay more heed to the
problems resulting from Taiwan enterprises' growing dependence on the
mainland market.</P>
      <P>He noted that once mainland industries are highly developed and
are more competitive in the global market, Taiwan companies'
technical advantage in the mainland market will gradually decrease.</P>
      <P>Judging from the normalization of economic and trade ties, Hung
said local investors should see cross-strait trade as just one of the
points of their global positioning rather than the whole of their
investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CANCELS FIRST SCHEDULED TRIP OUTSIDE TAIPEI SINCE SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
canceled his first scheduled trip outside Taipei since the unsolved
March 19 shooting in which he and Vice President Annette Lu were
slightly injured.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said heavy rain forced Chen to cancel a
trip to his home village of Kuantien in the southern county of
Tainan. He was originally scheduled to pay his respects to his
ancestors and visit several temples in the county to mark Tomb
Sweeping Day, a major occasion in the Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>He had also planned to visit the southern city of Tainan, where
the shooting took place, although he was not expected to visit the
actual scene of the attack, an incident that the defeated
presidential challenger claims swung the March 20 presidential
election in Chen's favor.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office spokesman said it has not yet been
decided when Chen will return to his hometown to pay tribute to his
late father and other ancestors. This year's Tomb-Sweeping Day falls
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Police have yet to identify a suspect in the shooting and have
called for witnesses to come forward with information. U.S. forensics
experts have confirmed that Chen's injury was caused by a gunshot but
will not report on the details of their findings until later this
month.</P>
      <P>The opposition presidential candidate, Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan, has insinuated that the shooting might have been staged by Chen
to win sympathy votes.</P>
      <P>Chen won re-election by a narrow margin of 29,518 ballots or
0.228 percent of some 13 million ballots cast, prompting Lien to file
a lawsuit demanding a recount.</P>

(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairwoman Therese Shaheen will leave her post soon, reliable sources
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shaheen became the AIT's sixth-term chairwoman and managing
director in late 2002. She has been the top U.S. liaison officer with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties for only 15 months.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Shaheen will end her AIT service, a Bush
administration official said it is possible. He further said it's up
to high-level government authorities to make a final decision.</P>
      <P>Reliable sources said paperwork regarding Shaheen's departure is
already underway. According to the sources, Shaheen might be moving
to another job.</P>
      <P>Shaheen has been on leave over the past week and AIT staff said
they did not know when she will return to work.</P>
      <P>Shaheen is straightforward and passionate, but that persona made
her somewhat incompatible with the AIT post, which deals with
sensitive diplomatic affairs, critics said.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said Shaheen's friendliness toward Taiwan's
Democratic Progressive Party administration has sometimes surpassed
the Bush administration's limits. For instance, the sources said,
some of Shaheen's public statements last summer sent confusing
messages to Taipei, thus misleading the DPP administration into
underestimating the U.S. government's concern about its referendum
plan.</P>
      <P>Her remarks about the priority order for Taiwan's arms
procurements also drew criticism, but the last straw that may have
led to Shaheen's departure was her public expression of
congratulations March 26 on President Chen Shui-bian's re-election.
At the time, the White House had not yet issued a congratulatory
message.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear who will succeed Shaheen as AIT chief.
The post was left vacant for six months after her predecessor,
Richard Bush stepped down to take over the directorship of the
Northeast Asian Research Center of the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based think tank.</P>
      <P>The shortest-serving AIT chairman was James C. Wood, Jr., who was
appointed by former U.S. President Bill Clinton in December 1995.
Wood was in the post for only 13 months.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A strong convection current which covered
the island Saturday not only brought torrential rain to most of the
island but also brought snow to Hohuanshan and hail to Yushan in
central Taiwan, a very unusual occurrence for April, according to the
Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>Snowy season on the 3,416 meter Hohuanshan usually ends in
February, but the humidity brought to the island by a cold front the
previous day caused torrential rain in the island's mountain area
Saturday morning and prompted a rare fall of spring snow on
Hohuanshan that lasted for nearly an hour and covered the mountain
with two centimeters of snow, according to the CWB.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon was especially unusual as the temperature at the
summit of the mountain was 0.7 degrees Celsius at the time. Weather
forecasters attributed the snow to the strong convection current that
led to clouds as high as 5,000 meters or 6,000 meters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yushan -- the island's highest mountain -- had a
hailshower, although the temperature was only minus 0.3 to minus 0.5
degrees Celsius there at the time.</P>
      <P>However, a dryer cold current was beginning to take hold of the
island from noon, putting an end to the unseasonable wintry weather

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TEXTILE INDUSTRY TO BE BOOSTED BY LIFTING OF GLOBAL QUOTAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan textile enterprises are being urged
to establish a strategic alliance to cash in on the growing market
expected after the global lifting of textile import quota
restrictions from Jan. 1, 2005.</P>
      <P>Officials of the China Textile Institute (CTI) said Saturday that
the removal of global textile quotas are expected to bring additional
textile trade worth US$120 billion-US$324 billion per year.</P>
      <P>Starting from 2005, member countries of the World Trade
Organization will have easier access to markets in the European
Union, United States and Canada, which at present set textile quotas
on foreign importers, according to the CTI.</P>
      <P>The CTI officials predicted considerable growth after the quota
lifting for Taiwan's textile products in the United States, the
island's major textile market.</P>
      <P>The officials also predicted that Taiwan's textile industry will
benefit significantly in the mainland Chinese market due to its
high-quality products.</P>
      <P>For example, the officials added, Taiwan-made polyester is quite
competitive both in price and quality compared to that produced on
the mainland. Although mainland companies are working to improve
their technology, the quality of some specific items still lags
behind international levels.</P>
      <P>However, the CIT officials suggested that Taiwan textile
enterprises should establish a strategic alliance to jointly explore
the global markets in view of the growing competition from abroad
amid a tendency toward regional economic integration in North
America, Europe and Southeast Asian countries.</P>

      <P>A firm in Taiwan has been sanctioned by

items forbidden by the United States, the State Department reported
Friday.</P>

weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>These firms have violated U.S. legislation enacted in 2000 and

    <HEADLINE>DPP FACTIONS STEP UP PREPARATIONS FOR YEAR-END LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major factions within the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) have stepped up preparations for the year-end
legislative elections, party sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Now that President Chen Shui-bian has won re-election, the DPP
has made winning more than half of the seats in the year-end
legislative elections its top priority.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said the party must win a
majority in the Legislative Yuan if it is to facilitate the
implementation of Chen's reform agenda.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the DPP will hold intraparty primaries May 23
as the first step to deciding the party's nomination list. After
discussions with leading figures in the major intraparty factions,
Chang said the party will adopt an "elite" nomination strategy.</P>
      <P>"The number of party nominees will be based on our party
strength. We'll avoid excessive nomination," Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP charter, legislative nominations are based
on the results of the primaries and the outcome of a series of
opinion surveys conducted by the party. Opinion survey results are
even more important than the intraparty primary results (70 percent
vs. 30 percent) . The DPP will conduct opinion surveys between late
May and the first half of June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the major DPP factions have started internal
consultations and coordination in order to determine their nomination
recommendation lists. Basically, incumbent legislators will be given
priority, faction leaders said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, secretary-general of the Justice
Alliance said his faction will come up with a recommendation list in
mid-April.</P>
      <P>Other major factions, including the New Wave and the Mainstream
Alliance, have also started registration work for nomination
hopefuls.</P>
      <P>Party sources said several two-term legislators-at-large plan to
vie for regional seats in the December legislative elections. Among
them are Lin Chung-cheng, Chang Hsiu-chen, Yen Chin-fu, Parris Chang
and Liu Chun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The DPP now controls 87 seats in the legislature by garnering
33.4 percent of the ballots cast in the December 2001 legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP is the largest single party in the legislature,
it fails to control a majority. As a result, many of its reform
programs have remained on the drawing board during Chen's first
four-year term. The two major opposition parties -- the Kuomintang
and the People first Party that between them control half of the
legislative seats -- habitually block Cabinet-proposed reform bills.</P>
      <P>However, Chen captured 50.11 percent of the vote in the
just-concluded presidential election, indicating that the number of
DPP core supporters has increased.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, party sources said, the DPP plans to win
at least 84 regional seats in the legislative elections. If this goal
can be reached, the DPP will be able to win more at-large seats,
which are allocated among the major political parties according to
the ballots they bag in the regional-seat elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIDS INMATES INCREASINGLY PROBLEMATIC FOR CORRECTIONAL AUTHORITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of inmates with AIDS has soared
to a record high and correctional authorities in Tainan County are
finding it increasingly challenging to accommodate the special needs
of these prisoners.</P>
      <P>As of March 31 this year, the number of AIDS inmates in the
Tainan Prison had shot up to 20, up from only four last December,
making the Tainan Prison the correctional institution in Taiwan with
the largest number of AIDS patients, prison authorities said.</P>
      <P>The 16 newly arrived AIDS inmates - most being drug abusers who
shared needles -- have been posing a challenge to prison authorities
in terms of medical requirements and management of their daily lives.</P>
      <P>According to prison authorities, it used to be easier to manage
the AIDS prisoners when there were only four of them, with each
staying in a separate cell. Now, the 20 inmates are being housed in
five cells.</P>
      <P>The time for the AIDS inmates of go out for fresh air or to
exercise must be arranged at different times from those for ordinary
prisoners who do not have AIDS, the authorities said, adding that the
AIDS inmates are also prohibited from taking part in workshop
activities for security reasons.</P>
      <P>Since the prison has only basic medical and health facilities, it
is inconvenient for the prison when the AIDS inmates need medical
attention, they said, adding that the prisoners have to be sent to a
hospital outside the prison under the company of prison authorities
when special needs arise.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Detention Center, meanwhile, is currently the prison
in Taiwan with the second-largest number of AIDS patients at 14.</P>
      <P>Increasing numbers of AIDS inmates are posing a three-pronged
challenge to Tainan jail authorities: concern over whether the number
of cells is sufficient to meet demand; whether the prisons should be
staffed by professional doctors and nurses and equipped with specific
medications; and whether psychological specialists should be hired to
provide regular counseling to the AIDS inmates to prevent them from
becoming "time bombs" who could endanger other inmates, the Tainan
Prison authorities said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan captured global attention at the 32nd
Geneva International Invention Exhibition Saturday with all of its 23
entries winning prizes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's "golden minds" were awarded four national awards, 12
gold, seven silver and four bronze medals at the five-day Geneva
International Invention Exhibition, billed as the world's premier
trade show for inventors, which opened on March 31.</P>
      <P>A panel of 60 judges chose the masterworks by 21 Taiwan inventors
two days before the annual inventions expo closes on April 4.</P>
      <P>Four of Taiwan's gold-medal winning creations also garnered
national awards from four countries. They are Wang Hsing-ken's salt
water desalination processor, which receives a national award from
Hungary; Chung Yu-lin's explosion-proof lithium battery, receiving a
national award from Russia; Liu Teh-shan's mulberry tonic, receiving
a South Korean national award; and Kao Chih-hung's one-touch faucet,
receiving a Swiss national award.</P>
      <P>Other inventors from Taiwan who won gold medals at the expo
included Cheng Tsan-hsiung with his turnable inline skates; the Tseng
brothers with their equipment for instant drinking of hot spring
water; Tsai Chin-chen with his water-tight lock system; and Chou
Wen-li with his first-aid-kit flashlight.</P>

national award from Hungary and a gold medal for his salt water
desalination processor, received an order on the spot from a buyer
from Saudi Arabia. Wang signed a contract to sell an unknown number
of the desalination processors at NT$80 million (US$2.42 million) per
unit.</P>
      <P>Inventor Chou Wen-li has also received orders for his
first-aid-kit flashlights.</P>
      <P>Altogether 1,000 entries from 42 countries are on display at the
invention expo, which has attracted nearly 60,000 visitors, of whom,
40 percent were from countries beyond Switzerland. Many of the
visitors are looking for chances to commercialize the inventions.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will ask the Ministry of
the Interior and the Taipei City Government on Monday to cancel a
permission for a rally called by the opposition party of Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (PFP) in Taipei on April 10, Liu
Shih-fang, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liu said, the city government will be held responsible for all
consequences if it refuses to abide by the Executive Yuan's order and
withdraw apermission it already issued.</P>
      <P>Besides the city government, the Executive Yuan's order will be
delivered to the Ministry of the Interior because the police
department under the Taipei City Government is also a subordinate to
the National Police Administration which is controlled by the
Ministry of the Interior, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Judging by the city government's handling of previous rallies
organized by the KMT and PFP, Liu said the Executive Yuan is
concerned about the city's ability to prevent participants of the
April 10 rally from overstaying their permission and turning their

    <HEADLINE>OUTBOUND TOURISM REMAINS SLUGGISH FOLLOWING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Outbound sightseeing travel following the
March 20 presidential election remains sluggish, a stark contrast to
high expectations from local tourist agencies which had eagerly hoped
for an injection into their businesses, industry sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching, secretary-general of the Republic of China Tourism
Association, said that many tourist agencies specializing in outbound
travel are disappointed with the current situation because they had
keenly hoped for a booming market after the presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, they had high hopes that political
uncertainties would have been removed after the presidential poll and
the post-election situation in Taiwan would become stabler to bring
back customers.</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that many people are still fervently mired in a
dispute over the election result, bringing about a new cloud over
Taiwan's politics and slashing the travel willingness among the local
people.</P>
      <P>So far, market response to travel to mainland China -- the most
popular destination for a large number of outgoing Taiwan tourists --
has been lackluster, due to the election result, Hsu said. He
contended that the re-election of President Chen Shui-bian, a
pro-Taiwan independence advocator, has deepened the public worry over
the island's security and stability when it comes to mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, Hsu pointed out that pleasure travel to Japan has a
great market potential despite the current political woes in Taiwan.
A series of promotional activities marketed recently by the Japanese
central and local governments will attract a larger number of Taiwan
visitors, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to being a traditionally costly and upscale
destination for many Taiwan tourists, pleasure travel to Japan has
become much more diversified to court different clientele thanks to
the promotional efforts by local tourist agencies on the Internet.
Customers now are provided with a large variety of cheaper or economy
trips to Japan through the many tourism Web sites.</P>
      <P>According to an operator of a Taiwan-based tourist agency, Taiwan
tourists are increasingly getting used to hi-end travel after a
decades-old evolution.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan tourists heading to Japan this year is
expected to break the one million mark from the past average of more
than 900,000 per year, he claimed, adding that the number will place
Japan as the second-most popular destination for outbound Taiwan
tourists only after the greater China area composed of mainland
China, Hong Kong and Macau.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A TV personality who returned to Taiwan
after a miraculous recovery from a near fatal train accident in
London two years ago thanked Sunday all those who have been
concerned about her.</P>
      <P>Liu Hai-roh, who made her fame as a news anchorwoman for the Hong
Kong-based Phoenix Television Co., said excitedly, "Thank you all.
I've returned." Accompanied by her mother and brother, she returned
from Hong Kong Saturday night.</P>
      <P>Liu, together with friends Wu Chia-ching, a television
journalist, and Lin Chia-hsin, a former TV journalist, was on the
ill-fated train that crashed north of London May 10, 2002. The
accident, which was caused by faulty carriage couplings, killed seven
passengers, including Wu and Lin, and injuring more than 40 more.</P>
      <P>Liu was initially pronounced brain-dead after being sent to Royal
Free Hospital in London. She was later transferred to Beijing for
lengthy treatment.</P>
      <P>Her doctors at the Beijing hospital decided to grant her a
one-month leave last month, saying that they were satisfied with her
condition.</P>
      <P>After her one-month "journey of recovery, " Liu said that she
would return to the mainland for a thorough checkup to ensure that
she has fully recovered, and she will then return to her anchorwoman
post.</P>
      <P>Liu, who looks fatter because of the drugs she is taking, doesn't
recall anything about the train accident. In the beginning, she
didn't even realize that her two best friends had perished and she
could now only hope that they will have a better life in another
world.</P>
      <P>Liu visited the Wu's grave and had lunch with Wu's parents. She
is expected to travel to Hualien, eastern Taiwan, to pay tribute to
Lin and her parents Monday.</P>
      <P>The anchorwoman said to Wu's parents that she hopes to serve
them as a filial daughter on behalf of the deceased.</P>
      <P>The family of Liu expressed their heartfelt thanks to Taiwan
doctors for advising them not to ask that life support system be
disconnected during the most critical time at the urging of British
doctors.</P>
      <P>They also expressed thanks to the boss of Phoenix Television for
financial support during the lengthy medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Liu is expected to stay two weeks in Taiwan during which she will
meet with old friends and colleagues as well as do interviews with
political figures in preparation for her future work.</P>

tendered a written resignation to Premier Yu Shyi-kun, and the
premier is taking into consideration the overall situation in
assessing whether to approve his resignation, Liu Shih-fang,

      <P>Liu said that Yu had expressed his intention to resign orally to
the Premier in a recent meeting of the Executive Yuan over the
presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu on March 19.</P>
      <P>Yu believed that the Ministry of the Interior is the superior

take political responsibility, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The premier had told Yu that there will be more mass rallies by

      <P>THe supporters are protesting against what they perceive as an
"unfair election" because of the voting irregularities and the

      <P>Car safety seats for children under four
years old will be mandatory after June 1, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>An event to highlight the importance of child car seats was held
Sunday at Fishermen's Wharf in Tamshui, Taipei County, with more than
70 free child safety seats given to infants born on April 4 and 61
seats awarded in a lottery.</P>
      <P>The activity was jointly sponsored by the MOTC, the Jinchuen
Children's Safety Foundation and the ROC Car Safety Association.</P>
      <P>As of June 1, any child under four years old and weighing under
18 kilograms will be required to use a car safety seat. Parents who
ignore the law will be fined NT$500, an official of the Committee of
Traffic Safety Supervision under the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>Police will step up monitoring of the use of safety seats in
places frequented by families, the official added.</P>
      <P>Based on the statistics of the U.S. National Highway Traffic

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials were conducting tests in several
major fishery markets around the island Sunday following reports that
yellow-striped porgies, a very popular delicacy in Taiwan, tested
positive for toxic methyl alcohol in central Taiwan, the Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Officials of COA's Fisheries Administration said that they have
received the latest report from the Taichung City Government's
Department of Health, indicating that one sample had tested positive
for methyl alcohol, used as a preservative to keep its freshness.</P>
      <P>The fish came from Keelung, northern Taiwan, and the Fisheries
Administration has already sent officials there for inspections, they
said.</P>
      <P>Fishery official Hu Chi-hsiang noted that as fishermen have often
said that contaminated fish come from the mainland, the COA will not
only trace the source of the contaminated yellow-striped porgies, but
will also coordinate with the Coast Guard Administration to increase
their crackdown on illegally smuggled fish catches.</P>
      <P>Hu said that methyl alcohol, which has a strong odor and is
easily detected, has not been used in fish catches before and
therefore has not been included in the tests. If someone is using it
illegally now, the administration will begin an across-the-board
examination, he added.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Administration has asked the Taipei City
Government's Department of Health to provide test kits for methyl
alcohol and has invited officials in charge of the management and
development of fishery markets to take part in a seminar and teach
them how to conduct a quick test.</P>
      <P>If the fish test positive, they will be banned from being sold
immediately and will be sent to the local health authorities for
examination, Hu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taipei, the Fisheries Administration has sent
officials to major fishery markets in Taichung, Chiayi and Hsinchu to
teach how to inspect yellow-striped porgies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL CURRENCY  TO REMAIN LITTLE CHANGED AGAINST U. S. DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar may hover around the
33.0 to 32.8 mark against the U. S. dollar during this week after
experiencing a wave of surges last week fueled largely by a rising
Japanese yen, sources from the banking industry said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The local currency may increasingly lose stream in gaining in
value against other major foreign currencies in the coming days due
to a temporary halt to a rising Japanese yen as a result of strong
manufacturing data and a fall in new claims for unemployment benefits
announced by the United States, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar ended at 32.929 against the greenback last
Friday -- the highest closing level for the local currency since July
2002 -- which represents a marked rise of NT$0.345 from the
week-earlier level of 33.274. The gain in value was mainly prompted
by an appreciating Japanese yen, which finished at 104.24 against the
U. S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Central Bank of China did not intervene to stop the
local currency's rise last week, the sources noted, adding that it is
unlikely that the new Taiwan dollar will continue to appreciate this
week and surpass the 32.8 level unless the Japanese yen rises to
break the 103 mark against the greenback.</P>
      <P>For the time being, the delicate political situation at home will
play a key role in the new Taiwan dollar's short-term levels in the
run-up to the presidential inauguration on May 20, they said,
pointing out that the local currency will not see dramatic
fluctuations during that period and that the inaugural speech to be
given by the president-elect will be the focal point for the market.</P>
      <P>In essence, the local currency is not expected to continue rising
and will hover between the 33.0- 32.8 range against the U. S. dollar
this week under the pressure of a weaker Japanese yen, which may lose
in value against a rebounding U. S. dollar, the sources said, adding
that the lack of a bullish sentiment in the domestic stock market is
another factor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO UNDERGO MINOR RESHUFFLE FOR NOW: DPP LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet will undergo a minor reshuffle
to strengthen its financial lineup, a legislator of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, DPP whip in the Legislative Yuan, made the
remarks in response to reports of a Cabinet reshuffle following the
March 20 presidential election which saw President Chen Shui-bian win
re-election by a narrow margin. According to general practice, the
Cabinet will resign en masse before the inauguration of a new
president on May 20.</P>
      <P>"It is only appropriate to limit the scope of a reshuffle for
now, " Tsai said, adding that a major reshuffle would have to wait
until after the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the Executive Yuan will seek stability between now
and the year-end elections, believing it is best for political
development.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP is the largest single party in the legislature,
Tsai said that the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
and the People First Party between them will still command a slight
majority in the legislature before the legislative elections in
December.</P>
      <P>"If the scope of the Cabinet reshuffle is too big, it will have
an impact on the political situation," he said.</P>
      <P>"It is therefore not proper to make a dramatic adjustment of the
Cabinet lineup," he said, adding that any changes will base on the
principle of stability.</P>
      <P>"The moderately altered administration is aimed at bettering its
performance to attract voters in the year-end legislative elections,"
Tsai said, adding that this is the current major task for the DPP.</P>
      <P>To respond to the public's expectations of a new administration,
he said the reshuffled Cabinet will strengthen the functions of the
Executive Yuan, particularly those dealing with finance and
economics.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i may not have to serve concurrently as the
chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, and
instead a financial or economic expert may join the administrative
team, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that the Executive Yuan, if it can work toward improving
the economy and engage in continued reforms, will help to win more
than half of the 225-seat legislature, and only then "will it be the
best time for the Cabinet to undergo a major reshuffle."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A small village in mountainous central
Taiwan has found a way to balance the needs of some its smallest
residents -- fireflies -- and tourists who come to see the natural
phenomenon.</P>
      <P>The central Taiwan Tahsuehshan farming community, located 850 to
1,200 meters above sea level, is home to swarms of fireflies -- a
favorite of local tourists. Unfortunately, street lights installed
for the human residents of the village are too bright for the
fireflies, who refuse to multiply in appreciable numbers under the
lights.</P>
      <P>Residents, hoping to replenish the population of fireflies, have
turned off many street lights over the past three years and the
fireflies have responded by returning to the area.</P>
      <P>The problem is that tourists walking the darkened mountain trails
to see the fireflies are in danger of falling or getting lost.</P>
      <P>To address the situation, village authorities studied the problem
for a year and, with the help of Philips Electronics Taiwan, came up
with a solution -- light the pathways with low-level green LED
lights.</P>
      <P>The lights will cost NT$1 million (US$29,850) but will enable the
fireflies a natural environment in which to live and allow those who
wish to watch them to experience the sight in as close to natural
conditions as possible.</P>
      <P>The Philips LED lights have a life span of over 50,000 hours,
equivalent to 14 years at 10 hours of use each day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HOPES U.S. WILL PLAY BIGGER ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope
Monday that the United States will play a more active role as a
"peace envoy" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to help
build a bridge of friendship across the strait.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at the Presidential Office when he
received a delegation of the National Committee on American Foreign
Policy (NCAFP) , a major U.S. think tank, that came here to observe
the post-presidential election situation.</P>
      <P>Chen said that neither Taiwan, the United States nor mainland
China should ignore the situation and challenge faced by Taiwan after
the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The significance of the election was the display of the will of
the Taiwan people, which is to "protect Taiwan against China" and
Beijing should heed this rising Taiwan identify, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that in the 2000 presidential election, he won by
garnering 39.3 percent of the votes and that the victory was
considered a "win by chance." At the time, he said, he was a minority
president leading a minority administration without a broad-based
mandate from the people.</P>
      <P>Although he has made various proposals on cross-strait peace
interactions over the past four years, they have been repeatedly
questioned or rebuffed by the Beijing authorities, some groups in the
United States and even by the opposition parties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that this time, though only winning a narrow
victory against his rival, he garnered 1.5 million more votes than
last time, making him a national leader that truly represents that
mainstream will of the people.</P>
      <P>"After this election, " he said, he is sure "the Beijing
authorities will not regard him as a minority government or as
someone who does not represent the will of the majority of the
people" and will deal with him.</P>
      <P>He also said that in his May 20 inauguration for another
four-year term, he will make a new proposal on cross-strait relations
based on his 2000 inaugural speech -- in which he made known his
"four noes plus one" pledge, including no declaration of independence
if Beijing does not use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that in his last inaugural speech, he noted that the 23
million people of Taiwan cannot accept Beijing's "one China"
principle, which he said is in fact "one country, two systems" and
that the focus is "one country" and not "two systems" for Beijing,
which the Taiwan people find impossible to accept.</P>
      <P>Chen said that for Beijing, "one China" is a "principle," but for
Taiwan, it is an "issue" and as such, both sides can discuss a
solution. He added that he has urged the leaders of both sides to use
wisdom to solve the issue.</P>
      <P>"If Beijing had understood the appeal four years ago, then
cross-strait relations would not be so stalemated and the sentiment
of Taiwan identity would not have risen as high as it has, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"With the relentless stifling of Taiwan in military, diplomatic
and trade areas by Beijing over the past four years, " he said,
"Taiwan people have drifted further away from Beijing."</P>
      <P>He cited as an example polls in recent years showing that those
who identify themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese have
increased to more than 50 percent, which was something unimaginable
in the past.</P>
      <P>"If the Beijing authorities will not adjust their policy toward
Taiwan, the developments will be more unfavorable for them, " Chen
warned.</P>
      <P>In view of this, he said that he broached a peace and stability
interaction framework -- one of the two questions put forward in the
March 20 referendum vote -- so that both sides can negotiate and the
stalled cross-strait relations can return to normal.</P>
      <P>"The policy to unite Taiwan people, seek a stable cross-strait
relationship, a stable society and prosperous economy will remain
unchanged in the next four years, " the president said.</P>
      <P>To promote peace and stability under a cross-strait interaction
framework, he said he has commissioned Lee Yuan-tseh, president of
Academia Sinica and respected Nobel laureate, as a co-convener to
push for the operation of such a framework.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the United States will play a
more active role in helping build up the friendship between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On his plan to write a new constitution and implement it in the
next four years, he stressed that to put the new constitution to a
referendum in 2006 is a goal of democratic reforms and a time
schedule for deepening democracy, and will by no means represent a
timetable for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>"We seek the long-term national wellbeing and efficiency of the
government by putting the new constitution to a referendum vote, " he
said, adding that the referendum will have nothing to do with a vote
on independence.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that he will base constitutional reforms on the
principles of "openness and transparency" and the premise of "no
change of the status quo or sovereignty."</P>
      <P>The NCAFP delegation was led by its president, George D. Schwab,
with members including former Assistant Secretary of State for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord, Donald S. Zagoria and
UC Berkeley Professor Robert A. Scalapino.</P>
      <P>The delegation earlier visited opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan, who lost by a small margin to Chen.</P>
      <P>During the 90-minute meeting, Lien said that the issue of
cross-strait relations lies in "what is the status quo? " He said he
believes the status quo should be no advocacy of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Judging from former President Lee Teng-hui's words that "Taiwan
has no need to declare independence, " he claimed that the "pan-green
camp"-- referring to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its
ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- has made "status quo" equal
to "Taiwan independence." Former President Lee is the spiritual
leader of the TSU.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LOCAL CHAPTER CHIEF PAYS RARE VISIT TO CKS MAUSOLEUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  Taiwan, April 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) 's Hsinchu County chapter chief paid a rare visit Monday
to the late President Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum at Tzuhu in the
northern Taiwan county of Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Lin Wei-chou, chairman of the DPP Hsinchu County chapter, headed
more than 40 DPP members who paid tribute to the late president, as
Monday marked the 29th anniversary of Chiang's death.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that a senior DPP member has visited
Chiang's mausoleum. Surprised by Lin's action, the Tzuhu management
at first sent more than 10 security officers to keep guard, but the
visit ended smoothly and peacefully.</P>
      <P>Lin, a graduate of National Taiwan University's Graduate
Institute of History, said that through his study of Taiwan's
history, he had come to conclude that Chiang made certain
contributions to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a time when ethnic rifts have become increasingly serious in
the wake of the March 20 presidential election, Lin said he hopes his
move can help defuse ethnic divisions and contribute to social
harmony.</P>
      <P>"Let history belong to history. I hope those who live on this
island will identify themselves with this island," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Even though the DPP won the election, Lin said, he feels uneasy
about the mounting ethnic confrontation and Taiwan's future
development. "I hope the 23 million Taiwan people can live
harmoniously and work together for Taiwan's progress," he added.</P>
      <P>In the fiery and bruising presidential campaign, ethnic origin
was used by some politicians as a tool to woo voters. Ethnic rifts
seemed to become more serious after mainland-born opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan narrowly lost the election to incumbent
Taiwan-born President Chen Shui-bian. Lien has filed two lawsuits to
nullify the election on the grounds that an election-eve shooting of
Chen unfairly swayed sympathy votes in Chen's favor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTER PROMISES TO CONVEY APPEAL OF STUDENTS TO PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Huang Jung-tsun visited
college students going into the fourth day of a sit-in relay fast
Monday at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>The students started the sit-in under the arch of the memorial
hall last Friday. They were briefly dispersed -- literally carried
away by police -- Sunday night, but soon returned to resume their
protest against the political turmoil since the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed his concern about the students, saying that he
would like to convey their views to the authorities and that he has
coordinated with doctors to check their health and heed their safety.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-feng, a history student at National Taiwan University
who is one of the initiators of the sit-in campaign, expressed hope
to Huang that President Chen Shui-bian will come to meet the students
face-to-face.</P>
      <P>Chen said that they have several appeals and he expressed hope
that Huang would convey them to the president, adding that they hope
the president will show goodwill and produce a timetable to solve the
problems. He said neither the ruling nor opposition parties should
continue to divide the people along ethnic lines.</P>
      <P>Although Huang was verbally abused as he left the students, he
promised to convey their wishes to the president.</P>
      <P>Professors from National Taiwan University, National Chengchi
University and National Taiwan Normal University also visited the
students Monday.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Vice Education Minister Lu Mu-ling expressed
his concern and the hope that the sit-in will not affect the
students' schoolwork.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Education is unable to address the appeals of
the students, " Lu said, but is "concerned about the student's
safety, health and schoolwork."</P>
      <P>In response, the students said that they have brought their books
with them to prepare for upcoming mid-term exams.</P>
      <P>Chen told Lu that he does not blame the police who dispersed them
Sunday, although he said he felt wrenching pain that those
participating in a sit-in, which is quiet, rational, self-disciplined
and does not compromise environmental safety, should have been
dispersed.</P>
      <P>Chen said that they had taken their "spiritual lead" from the
"wild lily" student movement of 1990, when college students staged a
more than one-month sit-in at the CKS Memorial Hall to push for
constitutional reforms and express their discontent over senior
legislators who had not faced election since their first terms in
mainland China prior to 1949. The Legislative Yuan underwent a
comprehensive election in 1992.</P>
      <P>"We hope the leaders of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP), as well as those who took part in the 'wild lily' movement but
have now arisen as political stars such as Legislator Lo Wen-chia,
DPP official Cheng Wen-tsang and Executive Yuan spokesman Lin
Chia-lung will come to listen to the voice of the students, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He stressed categorically that they had not been manipulated by
any political parties and that more students from colleges and
universities in central and southern Taiwan will join their ranks.</P>
      <P>If they are dispersed again, Chen said, they plan to break into
teams of two and stage the sit-in in front of various government
agencies.</P>
      <P>Lu urged the students to keep in touch with their schools and
their parents. He also instructed police and security guards at the
memorial hall to heed the safety of the students, ensure a clean
environment and coordinate with National Taiwan University Hospital
to send doctors to check their health.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan, urged the
protesters Monday to return to school and leave the election disputes
to the judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>He also urged the KMT and the PFP to join him in appealing for
the students to return to school.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that chasing
away the students represents disrespect for local government and is
likely against the law.</P>
      <P>He said that as the students have not obstructed traffic or
created noise and their numbers are limited, he sees no need to
conduct the large-scale dispersal.</P>
      <P>Noting that he had earlier issued instructions that the students
were not to be disturbed, he lamented that the National Police
Administration bypassed him and gave direct orders to Taipei police
to make the raid.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that he represented the government when he visited the
students in the "wild lily" movement of 1990 and said that "there are
such activities in every democratic country."</P>
      <P>He accused the ruling party of adopting "double standards, "
noting that former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung and his followers in
the past staged a sit-in in front of the off-limits Executive Yuan to
highlight the cause of a nuclear-free homeland but the Executive Yuan
and police took no action against them.</P>
      <P>The students, sitting in front of a big banner bearing the slogan
"rebirth of wild lily, " wore headbands and masks. They said that the
protest will go on indefinitely and they welcomed other students to
join them.</P>
      <P>They also released a statement that read: We don't care for blue
or green, we want truth and we won't allow politicians to use
gimmicks to grab power... We are against discrimination and will not
allow politicians to incite ethnic hatred to lead Taiwan to bloody
Fascist rule... We will fight for a future based on justice and
fairness. We want a government that can be monitored and that will
not tell its people to shut up."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT DRAFTS BILL FOR FORMATION OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) came up with a draft bill Monday to pave the way for
the establishment of a special committee to investigate the March 19
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The bill, if passed into law, will allow for the formation of an
11-member investigative committee to probe the election-eve shooting
that slightly wounded President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>According to the draft bill, the special committee will be headed
by the president of the Control Yuan, the nation's supreme watchdog
body.</P>
      <P>It also requires the special investigative committee to complete
a thorough probe within three months and come up with a final report
to the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Liao Feng-teh told a news conference that
the draft bill is based on the principle of "case legislation."
According to a previous interpretation by the Council of Grand
Justice, "case legislation" does not violate the Constitution.</P>
      <P>"So our draft bill is constitutional, " Liao said, adding that
once it clears the legislature, the formation of an independent
investigative committee to look into the shooting will be legal and
constitutional.</P>
      <P>Two weeks have passed since the March 20 presidential election,
and Liao claimed that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration has not taken any active steps to clear up the mystery
surrounding the shooting.</P>
      <P>"To prevent it from becoming an unsolved case, we feel compelled
to come up with the draft bill with a view to integrating the
resources of the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan and the judicial
authorities to get to the bottom of the incident," Liao said.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
(PFP) claim that the March 19 shooting that grazed Chen's abdomen and
hit Lu's right knee unfairly affected the election by giving Chen
last-minute sympathy votes. Chen won by a wafer-thin margin of 29,518
ballots, or 0.228 percent of some 13 million ballots cast.</P>
      <P>Liao said the draft bill has already been sent to the
legislature's secretarial department and that the legislature's
steering committee is expected to discus whether to include it into
the legislative agenda Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We hope the ruling DPP and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity
Union -- will not boycott the bill," Liao said, adding that inability
to solve the case will cast a shadow on the DPP administration's
legitimacy and affect domestic political stability. The opposition
"pan-blue alliance" controls a majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT-drafted bill, the independent, interim
investigative committee will have 10 members, with the legislative
caucuses of various political parties jointly recommending five
professionals, the Control Yuan recommending four Control Yuan
members and the state public prosecutor-general occupying the 10th
seat. The Control Yuan president will serve as convener of the
committee.</P>
      <P>The draft bill stipulates that the committee should be formed in
10 days following the promulgation of the bill.</P>
      <P>According to the bill, the committee must have legal access to
all relevant files and documents and is entitled to seal and keep
evidence and documents, as well as to question relevant personnel and
ask them to undergo physical checkups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET ASKS TAIPEI CITY TO RETRACT APPROVAL FOR APRIL 10 RALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Out of grave concern that renewed conflict
will break out if a mass rally planned by the opposition camp goes
ahead this coming weekend, the central government has issued a
statement to the Taipei city government asking it to rescind its
permit for the event, Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung said
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the Executive Yuan has sent an official
notification to the city government asking it to push the municipal
police department withdraw its approval for the April 10
demonstration in front of the Presidential Office, to be staged by
the opposition "pan-blue alliance " of the Kuomintang (KMT) , the
People First Party and the New Party.</P>
      <P>Reminding Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of his own promise that he
will not allow Taipei to turn into a city of violence, Lin urged Ma
to come up with clear-cut measures in view of a fresh mass protest
April 10 -- the latest in a string of demonstrations attended by
hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters over the disputed
March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>However, Ma, who is also a vice chairman of the KMT,
categorically turned down the proposal and argued that the Executive
Yuan has no power to demand that the city follows the Cabinet's
bidding.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the "pan-blue alliance" rally held Saturday
at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall plaza ended with scattered
clashes between "pan-blue alliance" supporters and police on nearby
Ketagelan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office, Ma claimed
that "the central government must not pass the buck to the Taipei

      <P>New York Times: 7 U.S. Soldiers Die in

      <P>A coordinated Shiite militia uprising against the American-led
occupation rippled across Iraq on Sunday, reaching into Baghdad and
the sprawling Shiite slum of Sadr City on the capital's outskirts and
roiling the holy city of Najaf and at least two other cities in
southern Iraq.</P>
      <P>Seven American soldiers were killed in Sadr City, one of the
worst single losses for the American forces in any firefight since
Baghdad was captured a year ago.</P>
      <P>Wall Street Journal: U.S. forces closed off the turbulent city of

    <HEADLINE>PROBE INTO GUN ATTACK ON PRESIDENT HITS SNAG: TAINAN PROSECUTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The probe into the gun attack against
President Chen Shui-bian on the eve of the March 20 presidential
election has stalled, with no new progress made, a spokesman for the
Tainan District Prosecutors' Office said Monday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chen-ni, the prosecutor in charge of the investigation into
the March 19 assassination attempt in Tainan City and head of the
"3-19 task force" composed of Tainan district prosecutors, told a
daily news conference that the task force has found no new evidence
related to the shooting.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that 114 out of a total of 127 information tips
collected by the task force have been ruled out as having any links
with the shooting, Kuo noted that the Tainan prosecution authorities
are currently engaged in reconstructing the incident and relocating
the many Chen supporters who were filmed near the spot by TV crews.</P>
      <P>Kuo also claimed that the task force has not yet read a
preliminary report carried out by a team of three forensic experts
from the United States that visited Tainan City last week to search
for evidence under the commission of Dr. Henry Lee -- a worldwide
respected Chinese American forensic scientist who will travel to
Taiwan in the middle of this month as part of the investigation.</P>
      <P>Lee was invited by State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa to
assist in the investigation at the request of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance, " which claims that the presidential election was
unfair and has demanded a recount through legal process, as well as
the establishment of an independent committee under the Legislative
Yuan to investigate the shooting.</P>
      <P>The slight gunshot wound sustained by Chen in his lower abdomen
is believed by the opposition to have given Chen a large number of
sympathy votes that allowed him to win a second term in office by a
very slim margin of 0.228 percent over the "pan-blue alliance"
challenger -- opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUNDATION LAUNCHES PROGRAM TO HELP YOUNGSTERS BEAT THE BLUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-profit John Tung Foundation on
Monday invited pop idol singer Jolin Tsai to be the spokeswoman of a
fund-raising program to help youngsters to beat the blues.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ya-hsin, director of psychological health of the foundation,
noted that suicide is the third-leading cause of death of local
youth, and that there are at least three percent, or 72,000 out of
2.4 million youngsters in Taiwan, who suffer from depression, and
this is a conservative estimate.</P>
      <P>The causes of their depression range from pressure from school
work, not enough pocket money, and inharmonious relations with
friends, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Though there are counseling services in schools, the counselors
may not be able to handle the youngsters' depression, and the first
task of the "youngsters embracing the sunlight" program will be to
set up a support network on campuses, so that the youngsters
suffering from depression can be sent to hospitals or so that
doctors can be stationed on school campuses.</P>
      <P>The second task will be to collect the dreams of the youngsters
and provide them with a chance to realize their dreams so that they
can derive some positive values from living a happy life.</P>
      <P>The third task will be to establish a Web site for youngsters for
their emotional outlet so that psychiatrists and psychological
experts can provide an immediate online response to their questions.</P>
      <P>The foundation will cooperate with the chainstore 7-11 in its
fund raising program until the end of June, and the public is urged to
donate their small change. The goal is to raise NT$18 million
(US$545,454).</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The goal of industrial development should
be creating new jobs in the future rather than holding work
opportunities that were created in the past, Intel CEO Craig Barrett
said in Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>It is wrong for people, even the U.S. presidential candidates, to
argue how existing job opportunities should be protected, Barrett
said, because any industrial development or business company should
target creating new jobs in the days to come rather than preserving
old ones.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a round-table meeting on how to strengthen Taiwan's
competitiveness in the global market in the next wave of competition,
Barrett said the world as a whole is becoming an increasingly
competitive place and no country, including Taiwan, can be spared the
harsh competition.</P>
      <P>Barrett said that one of the best ways to judge a country's
competitiveness is to find out the quality of its education.
Educational essence is seen virtually in every area and in the face
of a crucial juncture, education factors hold a decisive key to
winning or losing.</P>
      <P>He said the United States is currently the most competitive
country in the world because it has successfully attracted top-notch
people from around the world by providing them a framework of an open

    <HEADLINE>REVISIONS IN TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT A U.S. ISSUE: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is up to the United States whether or
not the 25-year-old Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) should be revised,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The TRA, which will turn 25 April 10, is a domestic law of the
United States and we, the people of Taiwan, are in no position to
comment on anything about U.S. law, " Chien said during a meeting at
the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will respect any decisions that
the U.S. administration or Congress make should the Americans decide
to revise the TRA after they reach a consensus on the matter, Chien
added.</P>
      <P>The TRA, passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by
President Carter in 1979 after Washington switched its diplomatic
ties from Taipei to Beijing, has since served to protect the
interests and security of Taiwan and regulate unofficial ties between
Taipei and Washington.</P>
      <P>Ling-hu Jung-da, deputy director of the foreign ministry's
department of North American affairs said recently that the TRA
virtually ensures Taiwan the best possible treatment from the United
States next to formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan would rather the United States keep the TRA intact than
revise it, because attempts to do so could lead to 'unexpected
results,'" Ling-hu said.</P>
      <P>He added that the TRA is not out of date in any way; rather, it
has stabilized relations between Taipei and Washington and has
prevented the United States from tilting the balance of power in
Beijing's favor over the last 25 years.</P>
      <P>Noting that some pro-Taiwan U.S. Congressmen tried in vain to
push for a Taiwan Security Enhancement Act in 1999, Ling-hu said that
any attempts to revise the TRA might backlash and lead to results not
intended by the initiators. Therefore, he went on, Taipei prefers
"not to fix it if it is not broken."</P>
      <P>Actually, Ling-hu said, the TRA gives the U.S. administration
considerable leeway in dealing with Taiwan, and can accommodate most
attempts on the part of the Congress to promote bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Also at the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs Committee meeting
Monday, Chien was asked by opposition Kuomintang Legislator Sun
Kuo-hua whether U.S.-Taiwan ties have dropped to their lowest point
in 20 years since President Chen Shui-bian proposed a nationwide
referendum in Taiwan and carried it out March 20.</P>
      <P>Chien said that U.S.-Taiwan ties have been "deep and wide, " and
he sees the current bilateral relations as "not bad at all."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chien said relations between Taiwan and France had
apparently hit a snag before March 20 over the referendum issue, but
that bilateral ties have gradually been restored. Chien,
nevertheless, said that he would rather not disclose the details of
the latest developments for fear that Beijing might try again to
intervene or undermine them.</P>

      <P>The John Tung Foundation and the 7-11 chain
convenience stores have jointly created an online suicide prevention
network to help Taiwan's 2.4 million teenagers cope with depression
and keep a positive outlook on life, a spokesman for the foundation
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman called for greater social concern for the many
adolescents troubled by depression and pointed out that mental
illness is already the third-leading cause behind local teenagers'
deaths.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey made by the foundation, the
spokesman reported that as many as 195,000 local teenage boys and
girls went online during the Oct. 2002 - Oct. 2003 period to take
part in a program aimed at testing whether they are prone to feel
upset easily or even all the time.</P>
      <P>In a society that is clouded by lingering conflict and
instability since the March 20 presidential election, depressed
teenagers are a special group that needs adequate consultation and
assistance to help them stay away from attempting suicide, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The lack of a professional suicide prevention network or center
for Taiwan's youth may lead to greater social losses in the future,
he stressed.</P>
      <P>In an effort to help many local teenagers lead a healthy and
normal life instead of just killing time with video games or abusing
drugs, the two organizations also have invited Jolin Tsai, a pop
music singer and a teen icon, to promote the activity and call for
widespread attention to the many depressed young men and young women
in Taiwan society.</P>

      <P>Police said Monday they seized more than 27
kilograms of liquid ketamine and arrested two suspects at Kaohsiung
International Airport a day earlier for smuggling the illegal drug in
mainland Chinese liquor bottles.</P>
      <P>Police reported that they were tipped off in January that a woman
drug trafficker surnamed Fu was planning to smuggling ketamine after
she saw how popular it was in pubs and that the ketamine in mainland
China was cheap and only a controlled substance.</P>
      <P>After three months, police were able to learn of Fu's connection
and trace the source of the ketamine from the manufacturer in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Fu also used women and youngsters to serve as air couriers to
bring in the substance in their luggage, police said.</P>
      <P>Police further learned that Fu, together with three other women
and an eight-year child, left for Zhuhai in Guangdong province via
Macau on March 31 and were scheduled to return on Tombsweeping Day,
which falls on Sunday this year.</P>
      <P>Fu and another suspect surnamed Lee arrived at Kaohsiung's
Hsiaokang International Airport Sunday afternoon and were found to
have 96 bottles of mainland Chinese liquor in which the ketamine was
hidden.</P>
      <P>Fu told police that she bought the ketamine for NT$200,000
(US$6,069) from a drug manufacturer in mainland China and then mixed
the drug with water and liquor. Fu said she planned to retrieve the
ketamine by evaporation.</P>
      <P>Although police arrested Fu and Lee Sunday, they requested that
the media not report the case since they knew a second batch of air
couriers would arrive later. But the group failed to show up,

March 20 presidential election outcome ending peacefully, the
statement said, Chang tendered his written resignation to Minister of
the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien Sunday afternoon. The NPA is subordinate
to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Chang called a meeting of city and
county police chiefs last Friday. During the meeting, the statement
said, Chang said he would assume full responsibility for the
election-eve shooting. He also encouraged all local police chiefs to
make continued efforts to maintain law and order in the wake of the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>During his nine-month stint as head of the NPA, the statement
said, Chang has actively promoted police administrative reforms and
beefed up police counterterrorism capabilities to enhance public
trust in the nation's police force.</P>
      <P>Since Premier Yu Shyi-kun has already accepted Minister Yu's
resignation over the shooting, Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said
it's up to the new interior minister to decide on Chang's successor.</P>
      <P>Lin said Premier Yu will name a new interior minister before May
12 when the Cabinet will resign en masse in line with a
constitutional precedent. The Cabinet has traditionally resigned en
masse before the inauguration of a new president. President Chen
Shui-bian will be sworn in for another four-year term May 20.</P>

      <P>Beijing's attempts to suffocate Hong Kong's
democracy by denying its people the right to elect their chief
executive through a popular election provide sharp contrast between
the dictatorship of the Beijing regime and the democracy of Taiwan, a
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing's National People's Congress is set to decide
to keep intact the current government system in Hong Kong under which
the chief executive of the government is chosen by a group of
representatives rather than by the people, Yang Meng-hsun, deputy
director of the DPP's Cultural and Propaganda Department said it
belies Beijing's 1997 promise of "one country, two systems, " the
formula it touted when it took over Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>By turning down the Hong Kong people's calls for a popular
election of their chief executive, Beijing has exposed its contempt
for democracy and its lack of care for the will of the people, which
is unimaginable in a democracy, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwan people should draw a lesson from Hong Kong
that democracy is the country's most valuable asset and the only
safeguard upon which it can count.</P>
      <P>In order not to damage the country's democracy, Yang urged the

      <P>Taiwan is facing three major crises of

slim margin of 29,518 votes out of more than 13 million ballots cast,
of handling too slowly the disputes over the election and the
election-eve shooting of Chen and Vice President Annette Lu, which he

      <P>A five-year-old boy from Indonesia who
suffers from Von Recklinghausen's disease was recovering well after
recent surgery to remove a gigantic tumor covering his face and neck,
officials of Tzu Chi Hospital in eastern Hualien said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-jen, deputy director of the hospital, said that as the
boy was recovering well, they plan to carry out the second phase of
surgery to reconstruct his jaw in two weeks.</P>
      <P>The boy, named Novendry, came to Taiwan last month from
Indonesia's western island of Padang with the assistance of a group
of volunteers from the Taiwan-based Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu
Chi Foundation, who met Novendry when they traveled to the island to
offer free medical services.</P>
      <P>Novendry, who has suffered from Von Recklinghausen's disease
since he was a year old, has been almost blinded in his right eye by
the pressure caused by the facial tumor. With his thick facial skin
and lips, and protruding teeth, the boy had been cruelly dubbed
"hippo boy" by the ignorant Indonesian villagers.</P>
      <P>Von Recklinghausen's disease is a genetic disorder of the nervous
system that causes tumors.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi officials estimated that Novendry will probably have to
stay in Taiwan for two more months to undergo long-term facial
reconstruction operations.</P>
      <P>Even after the facial reconstruction, Tzu Chi medical team
members said, the boy could suffer other facial problems in the years
to come. They said his case will require long-term medical planning.</P>
      <P>Last year, a teenage boy from Burkina Faso who also suffered from
Von Recklinghausen's disease received a series of similar operations

claimed it has forced all people in the country to take sides in the
dispute.</P>
      <P>He urged the two camps to stop their political confrontation and
embrace a colorful future for the country which is neither green nor
blue.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liao Feng-teh, the KMT whip at the Legislative Yuan,
lauded the students' efforts to heal the rift between the two
political blocs, while his DPP counterpart, Legislator Tsai
Huang-liang, said the students' desire is exactly what the DPP has
fought for in the past.</P>
      <P>In a jab at the KMT and the PFP, Tsai said the two opposition
parties' demand for a special committee to probe the March 19
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and his administration's
handling of the shooting incident is a travesty of the rule of law
and that the two parties' repeated calls for rallies to protest the
election outcome are likely to cause violence.</P>
      <P>In an unrelated story Tuesday, a sit-in fast staged by around 10
students at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall went into its fifth
day, with one protester collapsing and being rushed to a nearby
hospital for treatment.</P>
      <P>The students vowed to keep up their protest until Chen's
administration agrees to their demand for a thorough investigation
into the shooting.</P>
      <P>The shooting, on the eve of the March 20 presidential election,
is at the center of a dispute between the DPP and the "pan-blue
alliance, " which believes the shooting contributed to Chen's success
in winning a second term.</P>
      <P>Although the students were driven away by policemen Sunday on the
grounds that they had overstayed their protest permit, they returned
to the site afterward and were greeted Tuesday by supporters who gave
them bouquets of flowers.</P>
      <P>Among the supporters was Lien Fang Yu, the wife of failed
presidential candidate Lien Chang. She visited the protesters Tuesday
afternoon and, without saying a word, placed flowers in front of
them.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from journalists camped out at the memorial
hall, Lien Fang Yu said she felt pain in heart to see the student
protesters, who are even younger than her own children. She said she
could not understand why the government had not responded to their
demand.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday he hopes
that all the disputes over the March 20 presidential election can be
resolved through the existing legal system as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks at an annual conference of the Chinese
National Federation of Industries (CNFI), one of the largest trade
associations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu said he feels regret that confrontation and unease
linger in local society more than two weeks after the
bitterly fought presidential race.</P>
      <P>"I hope both the ruling and opposition camps can refrain from
resorting to irrational ways in dealing with election disputes. Let's
remain calm and rational and use solely legal means to settle all
election disputes.</P>
      <P>Noting that the global economic competition is fierce and brutal,
Yu said Taiwan cannot afford to lag behind in the current wave of
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>"Our economy will suffer and the well-being of our posterity will
also be affected if we drag feet on reform," Yu warned, adding that
the government is actively promoting 10 new major construction
projects.</P>
      <P>"If all those projects can be implemented with the Legislative
Yuan's support, our economic growth rate will largely increase this
year and transformation of local industrial structure will also
accelerate," he added.</P>
      <P>The defeated opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential
candidate, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, has contested President
Chen Shui-bian's narrow re-election victory. In addition to filing
lawsuits to nullify the election and call for a new election, Lien's
camp has staged large-scale protests at the Presidential Office
square. Last weekend's demonstration ended in violence and the camp
has applied to stage another one this weekend, causing public
misgivings.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, CNFI President Hou Chen-hsiung
said he hopes all domestic political parties can engage in
constructive competition instead of power struggle.</P>
      <P>"Continued inter-party war of attrition will only

    <HEADLINE>SHOOTING OF PRESIDENT REGARDED AS MURDER ATTEMPT: PROSECUTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The March 19 shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian is being regarded as an attempted murder or assassination
for the time being, a prosecutor in the southern city of Tainan said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chen-ni, a prosecutor at the Tainan Prosecutor's Office who
concurrently serves as spokeswoman for a special task force
investigating the election-eve shooting, made the remarks while
reporting on the progress being made in the case.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the investigative panel has collected 130 leads, 116 of
which have been ruled out as having anything to do with the case. The
remaining 14 leads are still being pursued and scrutinized.</P>
      <P>Judging from the available evidence and an analysis of the crime
scene, Kuo said she believes that the assailant could have hidden
among crowds of cheering supporters while firing shots at Chen and
Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>But Kuo said the investigative panel still cannot determine the
motivation of the gunman. "We are also not sure whether the shooter's
skill was good or bad. In any event, we are not ruling out any
possibility at the moment," she added.</P>
      <P>The shooting slightly wounded both Chen and Lu. Chen was grazed
on the abdomen and Lu was hit in the right knee as they were
campaigning in Tainan a day before he was narrowly re-elected March
20.</P>
      <P>The defeated contender, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan, has demanded that the vote be held again, partly because he
insists the shooting unfairly influenced the election. Lien has also
insinuated that Chen orchestrated the shooting, although he has
provided no evidence to support his claim.</P>
      <P>By the same token, however, investigators have yet to find any
suspects or solid leads to satisfy the skeptics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Dr. Henry Lee, a prominent Taiwanese-American forensic
expert, said in a TV interview in the United States that the gunshot
that wounded Chen was not self-inflicted and he also claimed that it
was not the work of professional assassins.</P>
      <P>He said in a the cable TV interview aired Tuesday that he would
need to see more evidence before he could comment on other theories
about the shooting.</P>
      <P>"We can rule out a professional assassination. We can also rule
out that it was self-inflicted," Lee told Taiwan's TVBS cable news at
a conference in the United States.</P>
      <P>"About other (theories) , we have to see the evidence and then
exchange opinions, " said Lee, who has been invited by State Public
Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa to assist in probing the shooting.</P>
      <P>The TV report did not include any explanation from Lee about why
he has ruled out a professional hit or a self-inflicted shooting, but
Lee said earlier that a professional assassin would have used a more
powerful gun and would have aimed at the chest, heart or head.</P>
      <P>According to investigators, the handgun used in Chen's shooting
was a cheap weapon made in an illegal workshop.</P>
      <P>Chen is eager to debunk conspiracy theories that he staged the
incident to give him an edge in the tight presidential race.</P>
      <P>Lee is leading a group of forensic experts who visited Taiwan
last week to analyze evidence and the shooting scene in Tainan. The
scientists also examined the open-top jeep Chen and Lu were riding in
when they were shot.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to arrive in Taipei this weekend to help with
the investigation and is expected to issue a final report later this
month.</P>
      <P>Lee has been involved in several high-profile U.S. cases,
including the O.J. Simpson murder trial and the still-unsolved
JonBenet Ramsey child abduction and murder case. Recently, he has
been involved in record producer Phil Spector's murder case.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will conduct a comprehensive lineup change in the Cabinet and
the party in the wake of President Chen Shui-bian's re-election, DPP
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ruling party is poised to carry out the personnel
changes in an effort to repay its supporters for their backing, which
helped Chen win a second four-year term in office in the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Changes will be across the board so as to create the best lineups
for both the Cabinet and the party to meet the supporters' high
expectations, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In the face of an extra national congress of the DPP slated for
April 10 and a full national congress planned for July, Chang said
that personnel at the party's headquarters and local city and county
committees will be adjusted during the April-July period in a gesture
of its resolve to do well in the legislative polls at the end of the
year, as well as in the city and county chief elections scheduled for
next year.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came after the announcement a day earlier by the
Executive Yuan that Pingtung County Magistrate Su Chia-chuan will
take over the Ministry of the Interior from Friday, a change that has
stirred up widespread speculation as to the extent of a Cabinet
reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Su will replace outgoing Interior Minister Yu Cheng-shien, who
offered to resign to assume responsibility for Chen's shooting during
a campaign rally in the southern city of Tainan on the eve of the

up a special committee to look into the March 19 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian was put on the Legislative Yuan's agenda

      <P>The KMT and PFP, whose joint ticket in the March 20 presidential

the shooting on the eve of election day and the ensuring response

      <P>However, Legislator Lee Chun-yi of the ruling Democratic

    <HEADLINE>INVESTMENT FLOODING INTO HI-TECH PARK IN NORTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fueled by an encouraging domestic economic
outlook, a large amount of investment has flooded into the Hsinchu
Science-based Industry Park (HSIP) in northern Taiwan, the park's
management said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park Administration, administration Director James J. Lee
said that NT$23.9 billion (about US$725 million) -worth of investment
expected to be injected by 12 companies at the HSIP was approved by
the administration in the first quarter, an astounding increase of
795 percent compared to the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>In addition, applications for capital increment worth NT$3.76
billion by nine companies which are already operating at the HSIP
were also approved by the administration in the three-month period,
marking a 241.8 percent growth over the previous year's level, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, other investment projects worth about NT$10.9
billion raised by another 46 companies are awaiting approval, an
indication that the current economic recovery has led to strong
investment willingness.</P>
      <P>However, Lee pointed out that demand to open up shop in the
science-based industrial parks in northern, central and southern
Taiwan is running high, creating space problems at these compounds,
which have been doing their best to lure investment in recent years.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, the HSIP and the Central Science-based
Industrial Park (CSIP) in Taichung County succeeded in courting 54
and 32 companies to set up footholds, respectively, last year.</P>
      <P>In view of the fast-growing business at these facilities, in
which hi-tech companies are provided with a suitable environment and
infrastructure for their operations, Lee said that the various park
management authorities should step up the pace of drawing up new
development plans for these parks.</P>
      <P>The HSIP -- Taiwan's first hi-tech stronghold, which has been the
major driving force behind the country's economic development over
the past two decades -- is aimed at housing IC and semiconductor
companies, while the CSIP is mainly geared toward opto-electronic
businesses.</P>

The General Accounting Office disclosed that corporate tax

    <HEADLINE>NEW INTERIOR MINISTER VOWS FULL DEVOTION TO JOB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister-designate Su Chia-chuan
said Tuesday that he will devote his full energy to his new job after
he assumes office Friday.</P>
      <P>Su, incumbent magistrate of Pingtung County in southern Taiwan,
made the remarks at a news conference held at the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Su will fill the post left vacant by Yu Chen-hsien, who resigned
Monday to assume political responsibility for the March 19 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu in the
southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is one of the largest
government departments, tasked with issues related to public order,
fighting crime, civil affairs, social welfare services, land
administration and urban planning.</P>
      <P>Su said he will work with all MOI staff to improve public order
and social welfare. "It's no easy task, but I'll do my utmost to live
up to public expectations," he said.</P>
      <P>Su said he will come up with a detailed work agenda after
consulting with professionals at various MOI departments in line with
the principles of policy continuity and creativity.</P>
      <P>His first tough decision after assuming office will be choosing a
new police chief.</P>
      <P>National Police Administration (NPA) Director-General Chang
Si-liang has also tendered his resignation to take the blame for the
March 19 shooting that grazed Chen in the abdomen and hit Lu in the
right knee.</P>
      <P>Su said Chang is an outstanding police officer with a
down-to-earth work style. "His departure is a great loss to the NPA,"
Su said, adding that he will consult with Chang and refer to public
opinion in selecting a successor.</P>
      <P>"Capability, seniority and credentials in police administration,
public order maintenance and criminal investigation will be major
concerns in deciding Chang's replacement and party affiliation will
play no role, " Wu said, adding that he will make a final decision
soon after taking up his new post.</P>
      <P>Su further said he hopes to cooperate with Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou to handle an opposition "pan-blue alliance" protest rally
at the Presidential Office square scheduled for April
10.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has suggested that the Taipei city government revoke
the permit it issued for the rally, but it remains unclear whether
the city government will accept the Cabinet's advice. Under the
Municipal Self-Governance Law, it is up to the city government to
decide whether to approve such activities.</P>
      <P>Su, 48, has been Pingtung county magistrate for six years. Upon
his re-election in late 2001, he became the first incumbent county
chief to manage to win a second four-year term in Pingtung in two
decades.</P>
      <P>He has been a National Assembly member and served two terms as a
legislator before becoming Pingtung county chief in 1997. At that
time, Pingtung was reputed as a hotbed of gangsterism. Su pushed for
county administration reform. Through his strong lobbying, the
central government lifted a longstanding construction ban on many
parts of the island's southernmost county, paving the way for
rezoning of farmland and facilitating the county's economic
development.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, Su is said to have transformed Pingtung
from "a home of gangsters" to "a home of the bluefin tuna fishery and
of top-quality bell fruit."</P>
      <P>Su set a goal of developing Pingtung into a heartland of tourist
and high-tech industries. He has initiated a number of cultural and
recreational programs to attract tourists, including the Bluefin
Festival and the Kenting Wind Bell Festival. He has also turned the
previously military-controlled Tapeng Bay into a new beach resort.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he has managed to acquire central government approval
for locating many national-level construction projects in Pingtung,
including a new-style export processing zone, a biotechnology and
agriculture park and a Hakka culture park, to help create jobs and
revitalize the economy in the otherwise rural county.</P>
      <P>Su's efforts have earned him wide popularity in the county.
He also ranks high in many public opinion surveys on the performance
of local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Pingtung
County's average household income registered a 10 percent increase
last year, the highest growth rate among all cities and counties
around the nation.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the March 20 presidential poll, Su had
campaigned very hard for Chen's re-election bid. The Chen-Lu ticket
garnered nearly 300,000 ballots in the county, outpacing the rival
"pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong by more than 84,000 ballots.
Moreover, the county electorate's participation rate in the nation's
first referendum, held simultaneously with the presidential election,
also exceeded 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Political observers say Su's administrative achievements and his
outstanding presidential campaign record won him Chen's trust and
the important Cabinet post.</P>

      <P>The National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP) members
expressed concern about the disputes in the wake of the March 20

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian won re-election to a four-year term by a
razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes against his rival of the "pan-blue

cast.</P>
      <P>Lien, claiming the election to be "unfair, " and was marred by

    <TEXT>
      <P>A bomb scare on a UNI Airways Corp. flight
from central Taichung to the outlying island of Kinmen Tuesday
morning was a hoax, but many Taiwan passengers were nevertheless
angered at having their trips to mainland China delayed.</P>
      <P>The UNI Airway's DH-8 plane with 58 passengers left from
Chingchuankang Airport in central Taichung at 9: 55 a.m. and was
informed of the bomb threat when it was some 12 nautical miles away
from Shangi Airport on Kinmen Island, where it was scheduled to land
at 10: 50 a.m.</P>
      <P>Police evacuated all the passengers and underwent a thorough
security check of the aircraft and passengers' baggage at the Kinmen
airport.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Air Traffic Control issued an alert after receiving
information from UNI Airways that indicated that it had been told
that explosives had been planted on board Flight 685 from Taichung to
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Air Traffic Control immediately activated a set of
emergency mechanisms to cope with the situation by dispatching fire
engines and a task force of policemen equipped with bomb-disposal
equipment to sweep the airplane and the passengers' bags.</P>
      <P>After security checks that lasted until around noon, no
explosives were found either aboard the aircraft or inside
passengers' baggage. The bomb threat was lifted at 11: 40 a.m. and
the four fire engines were recalled from the airport.</P>
      <P>Although the incident was eventually deemed a hoax, many
passengers, mainly Taiwan businessmen preparing to transfer to
mainland China via the "mini three links, " were angered by the fake
bomb incident and complained bitterly for having to wait for the
security check before proceeding with their journeys.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu islands are the key transshipment hubs for a
large number of Taiwan businessmen who have to travel frequently
between Taiwan proper and mainland China. The two frontline islands
maintain direct trade and transport links with Xiamen and Fuzhou
ports in Fujian province -- the so-called "mini three links" -- in
the absence of full links between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>

      <P>Singapore budget travelers will soon be
spoiled with choice, as several airlines have started or are planning
to offer budget flight services.</P>
      <P>Australia's Qantas has said it will launch a new budget airline
based in Singapore in a joint venture with Temasek Holdings and two
local businessmen.</P>
      <P>Temasek is already backing another low cost airline, Tiger
Airways, in conjunction with Singapore Airlines, and it is not ruling
out making further investments in this fast-emerging market.</P>
      <P>Temasek has already held talks with Malaysia's AirAsia, which is
looking to spin-off a separate budget carrier in Singapore, but there
has not been any news so far on that score.</P>
      <P>Qantas is investing S$50 million (US$29 million) to obtain a 49.9
percent stake in a new low-cost airline that may be called Jetstar
Asia after Qantas' existing domestic budget carrier. Temasek will
have a 19 percent stake.</P>
      <P>It is slated to start flying by the end of this year to Asian
cities within five hours of Singapore's Changi Airport, becoming the
fifth budget carrier to fly out of Singapore.</P>
      <P>The other backers are Tony Chew, chairman of diversified group
Asia Resource Corp., who will have a 21.1 percent share, and F.F.
Wong, chairman of Boustead Singapore, who will own 10 percent.
Neither of the two businessmen is new to the aviation industry as
they both were previously involved with Myanmar Airways.</P>
      <P>The new airline will enter a market that is already crowded with
players. Qantas has said it is confident it will get a licence to
operate out of Singapore. As for the routes, the airline has said
that is up to the authorities to hand out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should not
make drastic changes to his administration's policy toward
cross-Taiwan Strait relations during his second term, former ROC
Premier Vincent Siew said in Washington, D.C. Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Siew, a vice chairman of Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
made the remarks at a seminar on the long-term impact of Taiwan's
March 20 presidential election in which President Chen narrowly
defeated KMT Chairman Lien Chan to win another four-year term.</P>
      <P>The seminar was co-sponsored by the Carnegie Foudnation, a U.S.
think tank, and Taipei-based Taiwan Strait Exchanges Foundation, with
the participation of Taiwan and U.S. scholars and experts.</P>
      <P>Siew said Chen's re-election reflects a strengthening of
Taiwan identity.</P>
      <P>"It also indicates that under mainland China's strong diplomatic
and military pressures, the people of Taiwan have actively sought
to determine their own future destiny as well as Taiwan's status,"
Siew said, adding that this trend will have a far-reaching impact
on the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Beijing should not ignore this political reality, Siew
said. More important, he said, Beijing should not equal Taiwan
identity to support for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>In his view, Siew said, the majority of Taiwan people want to
maintain the current status quo of "neither unification nor
independence" and to further strengthen cross-strait economic
exchanges in a stable environment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew said Chen's narrow victory indicates that he
should refrain from making radical changes to his administration's
cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>IN the run-up to the presidential poll, Chen unveiled his
plan to forge a viable mechanism for peaceful and stable
interaction with mainland China. Siew urged Beijing to seriously

billion, respectively, on encouraging growth for the first quarter of

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO PROTECT FULL FREEDOM OF SPEECH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday his
administration will protect the "100 percent" freedom of speech that
the people of Taiwan enjoy today.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a memorial ceremony marking the 15th
anniversary of the death of Nylon Cheng, a pro-democracy activist who
immolated himself in a drastic move to push for removal of
restrictions on freedom of speech during the previous Kuomintang
(KMT) administration.</P>
      <P>"Although some people say irresponsible speech could lead to
social unrest, I would rather see 'excessive' freedom of speech than
'insufficient' freedom of speech," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Referring to a raft of allegations against him in the wake of his
narrow re-election victory last month, Chen said he will tolerate all
those false accusations and harsh criticism instead of "turning back
the clock."</P>
      <P>"I'm grateful for those who are critical of my policy initiatives
or my leadership style and I'll reflect on my words and deeds
frequently in the future," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Before coming to the Chinpaoshan Cemetery on the outskirts of
Taipei to pay tribute to Cheng, Chen said he visited Buddhist Master
Sheng Yen, who lives in the vicinity.</P>
      <P>"I sought Sheng Yen's illumination and wise counsel. He told me
two short stories during our two-hour conversation which offered me
fresh inspiration," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The first story was related to Buddha Sakyamuni (563-483 B.C.) .
According to Sheng Yen, Sakyamuni had often encountered boycotts and
opposition from a young monk before he became a Buddha. Even after
Sakyamuni's enlightenment, the young monk continued his confrontation
with Sakyamuni. Sakyamuni said he was convinced that the monk would
also become a Buddha one day. Sakyamuni said the monk's opposition
had helped lead to his enlightenment. "Since he can help me become a
Buddha, he himself would be able to become a Buddha, too, " Sakyamuni
was quoted as having said.</P>
      <P>The second story was related to Sheng Yen himself. Sheng Yen
recalled that many local Dharma masters once opposed his plan to do
advanced studies in Japan. Their opposition prompted a Malaysia-based
overseas Chinese to cancel his plan to offer Sheng Yen a scholarship
to help finance the study program in Japan. Without the scholarship,
Sheng Yen had to redouble his efforts to complete his study program
as early as possible to save money.</P>
      <P>After Sheng Yen obtained a doctoral degree in Japan and returned
to Taiwan, he visited all those who had opposed his Japan study plan
to express his gratitude. Some of those Dharma masters were confused
by Sheng Yen's move. Sheng Yen told them that without their
opposition, he would not have been able to complete his Ph.D. program
so quickly.</P>
      <P>President Chen said he was moved by these two stories. In the
face of disputes over the March 20 presidential election, Chen told
many senior members of his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
present at the memorial ceremony that they should feel grateful.</P>
      <P>"We should thank all those who have challenged us. Their
questioning and opposition should inspire us to reflect, review and
pursue progress. I'll remember these two stories and push myself to
reflect and seek continued progress," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since Cheng's death, Chen went on, Taiwan has evolved into a full
democracy.</P>
      <P>"We have held three direct presidential elections and a
nationwide referendum. We have seen the value of Cheng's promotion of
freedom of speech and democracy. He sacrificed his life to oppose the
previous authoritarian rule. We have come a long way to establish a
legal system to ensure full freedom of speech. We should treasure
this system," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Even though the opposition camp's large demonstrations in protest
against what it calls an "unfair" presidential election have created
chaos and inflicted huge social costs, Chen said, the government has
addressed the issue with respect and tolerance.</P>
      <P>"I have found comfort in the fact that we have learned to solve
disputes with reason and legal means instead of violence and
suppression," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR RATIONALITY, CALMNESS IF APRIL 10 RALLY GOES AHEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun called Wednesday for
rationality and calmness in the run-up to a mass rally planned by the
opposition on Saturday, stressing that national economic development
should not be hampered by politics.</P>
      <P>Yu made the call at a weekly Cabinet meeting after hearing a
briefing about the April 10 demonstration planned by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance," which has vowed to call hundreds of thousands of
supporters to protest in front of the Presidential Office against the
disputed March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the country's economic development and
industrial progress must not be blocked by political unrest at this
juncture, Yu urged the opposition leaders to collaborate in forging
social and ethnic harmony to maintain law and order in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Any dispute should be settled through a legal process in a
society ruled by law, and the people of Taiwan keenly hope that a
genuine democratic system takes root in the country, the premier
said.</P>
      <P>Yu again urged the Taipei City Government to take adequate
precautions against all possible scenarios which might break out at
the April 10 rally in Ketagelan Boulevard to prevent violence.</P>
      <P>A concerned Yu said he was worried that the organizers will be
unable to cope with the situation should the emotional public get out
of control and attack police as they did in the aftermath of a
protest at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall plaza on April 3.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has sent an official notification to the
Taipei City Government and the Ministry of the Interior asking them
to demand that police authorities under their jurisdiction take
adequate measures and deploy the necessary forces, he noted.</P>
      <P>The premier also urged the students who have been staging a
sit-in hunger strike at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall plaza since
late night of April 2 to go back to school as quickly as possible,
citing his grave concern for their health and study.</P>
      <P>The group of about 10 university students started taking turns
fasting for about 12 hours each day six days ago, demanding a meeting
with President Chen Shui-bian and the establishment of an independent
committee to investigate the election-eve shooting of President Chen
during a campaign rally in southern Tainan City, among other things.</P>
      <P>Chen sustained a flesh wound across his abdomen in the shooting,
which has been viewed by the opposition as winning the president
enough sympathy votes to be re-elected.</P>

Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks as the Executive Yuan passed a draft

    <HEADLINE>KMT FAILS TO WIN MAJORITY OF HOKLO VOTES: KMT OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) failed to
win a majority of the Hoklo vote -- referring to Taiwan people whose
ancestors immigrated here from Fujian Province -- which led to its
failure in the March 20 presidential election, a KMT official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the second meeting of the party's Central Standing Committee
after the March 20 election, Chen Chien-chih, deputy executive
director of the party's Policy Coordination Committee, said the KMT
garnered only 40 percent of the Hoklo vote, which accounts for nearly
63 percent of the population, while President Chen Shui-bian won 60
percent.</P>
      <P>Chen defeated Lien in the election by a margin of less than
30,000 votes out of 13 million ballots cast.</P>
      <P>Kuan Chung, president of the KMT-run Institute on Policy Research
and Development, supported Chen's claims, saying that opinion polls
conducted by his institute showed that Lien and Chen were
neck-and-neck among the Hoklo voters in the run up to the election.
Following the March 19 shooting in which Chen was slightly injured,
the balance was tilted, with Hoklo people, especially women, shifting
in large numbers away from Lien to Chen.</P>
      <P>Lien who presided over the Wednesday meeting as party chairman
said he didn't care about his personal loss or win in the election,
but he wants a truth about the March 19 shooting to calm down the KMT
supporters.</P>
      <P>Lien and his running mate, People First Party Chairman James
Soong, have been staging protests in Taipei ever since March 20 to
pressure the Chen administration into agreeing to their demands for a
committee to be established under the Legislative Yuan to investigate
the election-eve shooting of Chen.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is a vice chairman of the KMT,
said his city government will defend the people's right to assemble
and protest, but he added that the organizers should appeal for
public support for these protests with a clear aim and should have
pickets on hand to prevent protesters from scuffling with police, as
that will cause a backlash in public opinion.</P>
      <P>As mayor of the capital city, Ma is caught on the horns of a
dilemma. He has to keep order and peace in the city while at the same
time allowing the supporters of the KMT to express their frustration
with the election.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has asked Ma to withdraw a permit for a KMT
protest April 10 after some protesters were hurt in scuffles with the
police April 4.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's yield of dynamic random access
memory (DRAM) chips this year will reach US$4.3 billion, an increase
of 35 percent over last year, officials of the Industrial Economics
and Knowledge Center (IEK) under the Industrial Technology Research
Institute said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Due to rosy prospects for DRAM, together with manufacturers'
continuing to expand their operations to 12-inch fabs, and each DRAM
maintaining a price of US$4-US$5, Taiwan's DRAM output is expected to
account for over 20 percent of the global market share, according to
an IEK report.</P>
      <P>Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation in the first quarter of 2004
yielded 22,000 wafers per month in its 12-inch fab and will have
reached at least 40,000 units per month by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>ProMOS Technologies Inc. produced 14,000 wafers per month in the
first quarter and will be turning out 25,000-30,000 wafers per month
by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In addition, a new fab joint-venture by Nanya Technology
Corporation and Infineon Technologies AG is producing test-run wafers
and will have achieved 12,000 per month by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Based on the IEK report, Taiwan's global market share of DRAM
will rank third in the world, behind only South Korea and the United

      <P>A task force formed to investigate the
March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu is reviewing video tapes of the rally at which the
shooting took place to screen out possible suspects, including
mainlanders and expatriates, in the shooting, an official of the
National Police Administration (NPA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liu Shih-ling, NPA deputy administrator, said that in addition to
local people, the task force is also screening out mainland Chinese
arriving in Taiwan and illegal immigrants, as well as "suspicious
expatriates."</P>
      <P>He made the remarks when he was reporting to the National Defense
Committee in the Legislative Yuan on the investigation into the
election-eve shooting that left Chen and Lu slightly injured when
they were canvassing in Tainan, southern Taiwan on the eve of March
20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The task force has urged the public and television companies to
provide all available photos, video tapes and other information to
help the probe.</P>
      <P>The task force is questioning all those who have been previously
convicted with possession of guns in Tainan, as well as radicals, the
unemployed, and anyone who is unhappy with the government in
neighboring cities and counties, as well as those arriving in Taiwan
from mainland China and foreign expatriates.</P>
      <P>"We are screening out the suspects and narrowing the field of our
investigation," said Liu.</P>
      <P>In a related development, security officials said Wednesday at
the Legislative Yuan that they did not follow standard security
procedures for the president and vice president after the shooting
because they were not clear about the situation.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chung-nan, deputy commander of a special squad under the
National Security Bureau, also said that although their handling of
the incident was a fiasco, nothing will be concealed and the NSB will
not shirk its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks at a legislative appellation session during
which legislators pointed out several incidents of negligence on the
part of security staff.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party
asked why the security men did not form a human shield to protect the
president, why there was no immediate sealing off of the area and why
security men did not hear when Lu cried out that the president had
been shot and that they should immediately leave the scene. They also
questioned why the head security guard, Chen Tsai-fu kept on talking
on the phone without noticing the bullet hole that had appeared in
the windshield of the open-top jeep in which they were riding.</P>
      <P>The noise of firecrackers, which are traditionally fired during
election rallies, and the smoke they generated, drowned all other
sounds and sights, including Lu's warning, Chiu said, adding that
they initially thought the president had been hit by a firecracker,

      <P>Taiwan agricultural goods have great appeal
for foreign buyers, as scores of them from Asia and Europe attended a
procurement seminar organized by the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) Wednesday at the Taipei World Trade
Center, according to a TAITRA spokesman.</P>
      <P>More than 30 foreign buyers and importers from chain stores and
supermarket groups in Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan, South Korea
and Britain seized the opportunity to purchase local agricultural
products, the spokesman said, adding that Taiwan businesses should
also be encouraged to grab the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's seminar was just a warm-up for a series of similar
activities slated for June through October in cooperation with
hypermarkets in Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore and Japan to
promote Taiwan fruit and vegetables, the spokesman revealed.</P>
      <P>Oriental City, a popular shopping center in northern London, has
also for the first time sent officials to purchase locally grown
produce at the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture-sponsored event,
according to the spokesman. Other foreign-based business concerns,
including APPOLO and City Super from Hong Kong and Lotte from South
Korea, also dispatched buyers to the event.</P>
      <P>Oriental City now sells some 25,000 items of Asian origin in its
supermarket, from countries that include mainland China, Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and South Korea, an Oriental City
executive said. However, only a few products from Taiwan, such as
noodles and condiments, are shelved there, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to the Oriental City official, the area in which the
shopping center is located has a large Asian population that is very
interested in food from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Oriental City registers an average monthly customer turnout of

      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" said
Wednesday it has temporarily withdrawn a lawsuit that sought to
nullify the bitterly contested March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lawyers of the defeated "pan-blue alliance" presidential
candidate, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, said the withdrawal
of the election nullification suit was mainly aimed at avoiding
interference with the proceedings of another alliance lawsuit that
demands an annulment of the election result and a recount of all
ballots cast in the election.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
(PFP) filed the election result nullification lawsuit with the Taiwan
High Court March 29 and the election nullification lawsuit April 5.</P>
      <P>The first petition calls on the court to nullify incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian's re-election victory and hold a recount.
The second petition asks the court to declare the whole election
invalid so that a new one can be held.</P>
      <P>In Lien's first lawsuit, the defendant was listed as the
president, while his second lawsuit targeted the Central Election
Committee (CEC) and local-level election commissions in various
cities and counties around the country.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawyers said their decision to temporarily withdraw
the second lawsuit was based on concerns that the judges might order
recounts in both cases, increasing the confusion. A separate panel of
judges would have had to handle the second petition and might have
ordered a recount as an interim step in deciding whether there were
enough irregularities to order a completely new election.</P>
      <P>"If the court decides to have simultaneous recounts in both
cases, and if the recount methods are different, then they could
interfere with each other," said opposition lawyer Lee Yi-kuang.</P>
      <P>Lee said the plaintiff plans to re-file the election
nullification suit before April 10. By that time, he said, the
plaintiff and the defendant in the first lawsuit should have reached
an agreement on the recount method.</P>
      <P>The High Court held a hearing last Friday on the first lawsuit
and gave the two sides five days to sort out terms for the requested
vote recount. Chen has already endorsed a complete vote recount, but
the two sides have yet to reach agreement on who should pay for the
recount and on several other technical details. The two sides were
required to present their recount proposals to the High Court
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the plaintiff's proposal, opposition lawyers said
they want judges, not election staff, to play a key role in the
recount. They claimed that judges are more likely to be impartial
than election staff.</P>
      <P>The lawyers also want the recount to be detailed, with judges
poring over each disputed ballot, comparing the rolls of registered
voters with the names of voters who actually cast ballots. The
president favors having election workers handle the recount.</P>
      <P>"We want judges to certify each disputed ballot," said opposition
lawyer Yu Ta-wei.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawyers said they know this could slow down the
process, going against opposition demands for a quick recount made
shortly after the election. "Even though this recount method will
need more time and manpower, we think it's worth the investment, "
said Yu.</P>
      <P>Chen defeated Lien by only 29,518 ballots, or 0.228 percent out
of more than 13 million cast, after an election-eve assassination
attempt on the president that Lien claims swung the March 20 poll in
Chen's favor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG SHOWS NATURE OF BEIJING REGIME: CABINET SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Hong Kong had Taiwan's democracy, it
would not be at the disposal of another regime, the Cabinet spokesman
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung made the remarks in the wake of a ruling by
mainland China that Hong Kong must get Beijing's blessing before
trying to change the way it selects its leader and its lawmakers --
giving the Beijing authorities more power over such matters than is
spelled out in the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution.</P>
      <P>The Standing Committee of mainland China's National People's
Congress put forth the ruling in an interpretation of the territory's
constitution, a move viewed by many Hong Kong people as an attempt to
quash growing calls for full democracy.</P>
      <P>"One should see clearly the nature of the Beijing regime from
this matter," Lin said, adding that the mainland will never agree to
the existence of a democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the mainland's implementation of the "one country,
two systems" formula it uses to govern Hong Kong has proved to be
fake and anti-democratic.</P>
      <P>As the mainland tries to smear Taiwan's democracy, likening its
democratic development to "Taiwan independence and violence, " Hong
Kong provides a good comparison of the two systems, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He said it is obvious that if Beijing will not allow even partial
democracy in Hong Kong, it will never allow full democracy in Taiwan.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen
claimed Wednesday that Taiwan's first nationwide referendum "reflects
clearly" the Taiwan people's position regarding the military threat
from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The referendum was conducted alongside the March 20 presidential
election, with voters being asked whether Taiwan should buy more
anti-missile systems amid the mainland's increasing missile threat
and whether the island should negotiate a "peace and stability"
mechanism with mainland China for future interaction between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Only 45.12 percent of the 16 million eligible voters cast ballots
in the referendum, so it failed to pass the 50 percent threshold of
total voters to be considered valid.</P>
      <P>In a seminar organized by Taiwan Advocates, Yao noted that more
than 90 percent of those who cast their ballots said "yes" to both
questions, which he claimed "indicates clearly" to the world
community that the Taiwan people would choose to fight the mainland
missile threat rather than keeping silent as they have in the past.</P>
      <P>Yao said more referendums will be held in the future, although he
added that consensus must be reached on a sound referendum system
that can last."</P>
      <P>According to Huang Kun-hui, vice chairman of Taiwan Advocates, a
total of 7.45 million eligible voters cast referendum ballots,
exceeding the 6.57 million votes received by President Chen Shui-bian
in the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FUJIAN CHILD SAVED FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKERS VIA ONLINE CHAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A teenage girl from Fuzhou, the capital
of the southern mainland Chinese province of Fujian, who was abducted
to Taiwan by cross-strait human traffickers April 2, has been rescued
by law enforcement officers in southern and northern Taiwan working
in concert.</P>
      <P>Relying totally on the Internet and information technology, the
Kaohsiung county police managed to discover where Lin Ling, 13, was
being held captive by her abductors, and went to her rescue.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lin, a sixth grader at an elementary school in Fuzhou
City, did not come voluntarily to Taiwan to work in the sex trade,
Kaohsiung county police said the child should be sent back under an
arrangement to be made by Taiwan's intermediary body, the Straits
Exchange Foundation, and its Beijing counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The story of Lin's Taiwan ordeal began on the night of April 5
when a resident of Fengshan, Kaohsiung County, went to the Fengshan
Police Department for help, claiming that a friend of his living in
Fuzhou had called him to say that his 13-year-old daughter had been
abducted to Taiwan, probably by members of a "snake-head" ring
planning to sell her to an underground brothel in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the Fengshan resident, surnamed Cheng, the only
thing he knew besides the fact that Lin Ling had been abducted to
Taiwan, was that Lin had sent S-O-S signals to her schoolmate, Weng
Shi, via an online chat engine called QQ, over the last several days.</P>
      <P>Through Cheng, the Kaohsiung county police were able to contact
Weng, and from that child, they managed to connect with Lin Ling,
also via QQ.</P>
      <P>The police officers were thrilled when they received their first
response from Lin Ling. Their excitement, however, was soon
dissipated as Lin had no idea where she was and could not identify
her location due to the tight control imposed on her by her Taiwanese
abductors.</P>
      <P>While keeping waiting for new messages from Lin, the police
called for help from specialists from an information technology
teaching institute and a telecommunications company in an attempt to
trace the spot from where Lin's QQ messages were being transmitted.</P>
      <P>By early Tuesday morning, the police and the IT experts had
finally pinpointed Lin's location -- a room in a residential building
in Hsinchuang, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>They immediately contacted their counterparts in Taipei County,
who immediately raided the building and saved the girl.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, she and several of her schoolmates went to play
near Mt. Fuzhou April 1, where she was first conned by several men
who persuaded her to "have fun somewhere else." She was then forced
aboard a fishing boat headed for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin's parents only became aware that their daughter was missing
two days later and called for help from their friends in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GEARING UP TO ATTRACT JAPANESE TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an all-out effort to attract Japanese
tourists to Taiwan, the private sector and the government have joined
forces to work toward that aim, a tourism industry source said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Affected by the situations in both Taiwan and Japan, Taiwan must
do its best to upgrade its attractions and inject new incentives to
its promotional campaigns aimed at courting Japanese tourists, the
source said.</P>
      <P>To achieve the objective set by the government of luring more
than 1 million tourists from Japan this year, Taiwan has to display a
greater attraction and appeal in the face of a decline in Japanese
tourist arrivals, the source added.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, the number of Japanese tourists
to Taiwan has been dropping. Statistics compiled by the Tourism
Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications show
that the number of tourist arrivals from Japan fell by 38 percent and
32 percent in January and February, respectively, as compared to the
previous year's levels.</P>
      <P>The number for March is not expected to improve due to Taiwan's
heated March 20 presidential election and the problems arising from
the disputed results, the source predicted.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chien-hsun, secretary-general of the Taiwan Visitors
Association, claimed that according to tourist agencies in Japan,
many Japanese people living in rural areas are still very concerned
about whether severe acute respiratory syndrome is still spreading in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This, he said, is an indication that Taiwan has to further
enhance and improve its promotional activities in Japan, particularly
in small- and medium-sized cities, such as Kobe and Hiroshima, Tseng
said, pointing out that such a campaign should be very intensive in
every corner in the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, few groups composed of Japanese farmers and
livestock raisers -- once the bulk of Japanese tourists to Taiwan --
have traveled to Taiwan for pleasure trips since foot-and-mouth
disease broke out here several years ago.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Visitors Association will set its sights on this
sector this year in line with the government's campaign, he noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) urged the government Wednesday to convene a
national energy conference to review energy policies.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lai Chin-ling made the remarks at a seminar held
at the Legislative Yuan by a civic group known as the No Nuke Taiwan
Union. Participants in the seminar included President of the Taiwan
Association of Unveristy Professors Wang Tu-fa, Taiwan Environmental
Protection Union Vice President Chen Ming-hua and No Nuke Taiwan
Union Convener Cheng Hsien-you, as well as representatives from other
environmental protection groups.</P>
      <P>Lai said that due to insufficient global stocks of petroleum, the
cost of petrochemical raw materials are bound to rise and in
comparison, the cost of recyclable energy will be low. If the
government continues to develop recyclable energy, costs could be cut
even further, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that currently, Taiwan's annual spending on recyclable
energy at NT$3 billion (US$90.63 million) is too low and that the
government should spend more on such recyclable energy such as
thermal energy, tidal and solar power.</P>
      <P>Amid the call for recyclable energy, Wu Huang, vice executive
secretary general of the Energy Commission under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, said that the development of alternative energy
sources in Taiwan is "not so good."</P>
      <P>He said that recyclable energy can make energy supplies more
stable and meet environmental protection needs. If the
administration can effectively develop recyclable energy, the sun
and wind will provide the most potential, and he added that
wind-generated electricity will be the most economically efficient.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former National Security Bureau (NSB)
Director Tsai Chao-ming informed the United States of the March 19
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
shortly after it occurred, an NSB official confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chung-nan, deputy commander of the NSB's Special Service
Center, made the confirmation at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lu
Hsiu-yen asked Chiu whether then-NSB Director Tsai telephoned the
U.S. authorities after Chen and Lu were shot on the campaign trail in
the southern city of Tainan a day before the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>To the best of her understanding, Lu Hsiu-yen said, Tsai made
phone calls to Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Pacific Command in
Hawaii during an emergency trip to Tainan right after the shooting.</P>
      <P>In response, Chiu said that Tsai made many phone calls on his way
to Tainan, including informing the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
presidential and vice presidential ticket of KMT Chairman Lien Chan
and People First Party Chairman James Soong, as well as former
President Lee Teng-hui, of the shooting.</P>
      <P>Chiu said Tsai also called the U.S. Pacific Command but he
declined to elaborate.</P>
      <P>An NSB source later confirmed that Tsai indeed called Washington
and the U.S. Pacific Command.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of the calls was to remind the U.S.
authorities to keep alert to mainland China's activities after
President Chen and Vice President Lu were shot," the source said.</P>
      <P>Tsai resigned last week to assume political responsibility for
the shooting that slightly wounded both Chen and Lu. Chen was grazed

by Illsley to search for any tiny amounts of chemicals or other
substances that cannot be detected by the naked eye. For example, ALS
can detect blood stains even after they have been washed away or
coated with paint.</P>
      <P>Sources said that ALS has played an important role in criminal
investigations in the United States and that evidence collected at
crime scenes by the technology has been important in many criminal
court cases.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the ALS technology, Lee hopes to shed
light on the truth behind the election-eve shooting in which the
president's lower abdomen was grazed by a bullet and the vice
president suffered a minor wound to her right knee. Taiwan police
have still not arrested anyone in connection with the assassination
attempt.</P>
      <P>Lee was invited by State Public Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa to
come to Taiwan to help in the investigations after the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" called for an independent investigation committee
to be set up to look into the incident. The opposition camp has said
that the shooting incident won last minute sympathy votes for the
incumbent president in the close March 20 election.</P>
      <P>At the commission of Lee, a trio of U.S. forensic experts had
come to Taiwan last week for two days to collect information and
examine the scene of the shooting for clues. They also visited the
hospital where the President Chen was treated and called on him at
the Presidential Office March 30.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of students who staged a sit-in
fast to demand an investigation into the March 19 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian should give the president "due respect" and
not insist on meeting the president on their terms, a Chen aide said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-fang, director of the Public Affairs Department at the
Presidential Office said at a news conference Thursday that the
president is head of state and president of all the people, not only
the president of the protesters. He therefore deserves the
protesters' due respect, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Chen has decided to exchange views with 40 to 50 student leaders
from various schools at a theater in Taipei Monday. The president
hopes the student protestors will join the others at the meeting,
Huang went on.</P>
      <P>He said the timing of the meeting was fixed after consulting the
president's schedule, adding that any changes would cause
inconvenience to both the president and the other students invited to
the meeting, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after the student protesters at the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall insisted that the president come to see them
before April 9, when they were set to end their fast, rather than
have the protesters join the other students in Monday's meeting.</P>
      <P>The make-up of the protesters has been changing ever since it
started April 2. Three of the five original strikers collapsed and
were rushed to hospital before Wednesday. One has left the protest
and only one remains. The others are newcomers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHOOTING PROBE SHOULD BE CONDUCTED BY JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance's"
proposal to form an investigation committee under the Legislative
Yuan to probe the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu is unconstitutional, government spokesman
Lin Chia-lung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the government has already established a special
investigation group composed of judicial agencies to look into the
assassination attempt and said the idea of the opposition conducting
a referendum to solicit public support to form a legislative
investigation committee is against the law.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Lu were slightly injured in the election-eve
shooting.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
and People First Party Chairman James Soong was defeated by Chen in
the March 20 election by a slim margin of 0.228 percent, or less than
30,000 votes. Many "pan-blue alliance" supporters believe that the
shooting gave Chen many sympathy votes, while the "security
mechanism" triggered by the shooting deprived many military
servicemen and policemen of their right to vote.</P>
      <P>The issue has resulted in serious political turmoil, evidenced by
a string of large-scale protests in front of Presidential Office and
astudent sit-in demanding the "truth" in the aftermath of the
presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Lin said the alliance's committee would invite Control Yuan
President Fredrick Chien to be convener, with legislators, members of
the Control Yuan and State Public Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa as
members, which Lin pointed out would violate the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Lin also announced that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
is planning to promote a public-sponsored referendum alongside the
year-end legislative elections, with four issues to be discussed,
including halving the number of seats in the legislature, the fate of
the controversial fourth nuclear plant, Taiwan's entry to the World
Health Organization, and the management of political party assets.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Law, the president, the Legislative
Yuan and the public can sponsor a referendum.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said there are many defects in the Referendum Law,
such as a too-high threshold in terms of the percentage of voters
needed to sponsor a referendum and that issues related to
constitutional amendments have been excluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASEAN POISED FOR STRONGEST GROWTH SINCE FINANCIAL CRISIS: MINISTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations' (ASEAN's) economies are poised this year to witness their
strongest growth since the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the
region's finance ministers said at the annual ASEAN meeting held
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We expect our region to continue its growth momentum in 2004
with a projected gross domestic product growth of 5.5 percent to 5.9
percent," the ministers said in a joint statement at the end of their
one-day summit.</P>
      <P>The ministers painted a buoyant picture of the region's growth
prospects after seven years of major setbacks that began with the
financial crisis and included terrorist attacks and the outbreaks of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird flu.</P>
      <P>"Growth is expected to be broad-based, with both domestic and
external demand providing the impetus for expansion, " the joint
statement said.</P>
      <P>Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a keynote
speech at the one-day summit, said the economies of most ASEAN
members had recovered strongly from the setbacks in recent years.</P>
      <P>"ASEAN has taken quite a few hard punches in the last few years.
Although we might have been bruised, we are far from being knocked
out," said Lee, who is also the finance minister.</P>
      <P>"Now, most ASEAN economies are on the mend. Economic growth has
been strong in many countries. Exports are growing, and stock markets
are up... ASEAN is now back on its feet and up and running again," he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministers also said that they had made progress in
efforts to liberalize the financial sector, a crucial pillar of
ASEAN's ambitions to create a common market by 2020.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of former student movement leaders
issued a statement Thursday demanding that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) launch all-out reforms in the face of what
they claimed is mounting chaos in society following the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>About a dozen student leaders of the 1900 "wild lily" movement --
who now hold high positions in the government and academic spectrums,
such as Academic Sinica assistant researcher Fang Yun, Council for
Hakka Affairs Secretary-General Yang Chang-chen and various DPP party
members -- jointly endorsed the statement in view of the many
disputes in the wake of the election.</P>
      <P>Describing self-reflection and continued reforms as the best
response to new challenges, they demanded that the DPP assume
responsibility for the "rising discontent in society" related to a
wide range of issues that include the consequences of the March 20
referendum results, electoral, educational, fiscal and parliamentary
reforms, and a new constitution.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan is plagued by confrontation, distrust and
rifts, they urged the country's leaders and political parties to take
full accountability to help the people mend the widening gap if
society is to continue advancing.</P>
      <P>"The people's discontent and pain should awaken their
consciousness to push for a new agenda of continued and comprehensive
reform in the beginning of a new stage in Taiwan's democratic
development," they said.</P>
      <P>They appealed for joint efforts from all the political parties
and private organizations to strengthen Taiwan's democratization at
this juncture when the country's democratic course is at a
crossroads.</P>
      <P>"All the political parties and civilian groups concerned about
Taiwan's democratic development should forswear their strife and
bickering to devote their energy to building common benefits for our
children and the younger generation," they said.</P>
      <P>Looking back over the past four years, the DPP should be held
accountable, at least for the increased rifts among Taiwan's ethnic
groups and a deterioration in government service quality, they
claimed.</P>
      <P>Should a political party fail to respond to the deep public
expectations in these fields, it should be recorded by history and
eventually deemed as a loser even though it grabs power, according to
the former student leaders.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that collective learning and contemplation is the
driving force behind society's progress, they appealed to all the
political parties to stop fighting and expressed their strong hope
that 2004 will be viewed as a proud watershed in Taiwan's long-term
pursuit of peace, freedom and unity.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The France-based Matra Armaments and
Telecommunications Company has won damages of more than NT$1.1
billion (US$30.07) pluses interest from the Department of Rapid
Transit systems under the Taipei city government, according to
ajudgment rendered by the Taiwan High Court Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a reversal of a judgment it made three years ago, the court
determined that the statue of limitations on the arbitration award
won by Matra is 15 years rather than five years applied in the
previous trials, and thereby the award is still valid and capable of
being exacted.</P>
      <P>The Taipei rapid transit department, which had successfully
rejected the damages claim in two previous trials, was astounded by
the latest twist in the trial and department chief Fan Liang-hsiou
said he will appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The case arose from a construction contract won by Matra in the
late 1980s to build a mass rapid transit system from Mucha to
downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>After the construction was finished, Matra won an arbitration
award of NT$1.1 billion in 1993 for damage caused to the company by
the foot-dragging of the city government in performing its part of
the construction contract.</P>
      <P>The rapid transit department filed a lawsuit in an attempt to
have the award thrown out, but failed in 2000 after having exhausted
all avenues of appeal over a period of seven years.</P>
      <P>The department then filed another lawsuit claiming that a five
year statute of limitations on the award had elapsed by 1998.</P>
      <P>The rapid transit department was successful in defeating Matra in
the first two trials, but the Supreme Court threw out the judgment of
the lower court and ordered a retrial by the Taiwan High Court, which
judged in favor of Matra.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three public institutions -- the Coast
Guard Administration (CGA) , National Police University and Taiwan
Police College -- came under fire Thursday for having recruitment
policies that discriminate against women.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, senior executives of major women's rights
groups showed pamphlets issued by the three institutions concerning
their recruitment plans to back up their gender discrimination
claims.</P>
      <P>Quoting the data shown in the pamphlets, the women's rights
activists said the number of women to be admitted to National Police
University and Taiwan Police College account for only 7.89 percent
and 7.09 percent, respectively, of the total number of available
places.</P>
      <P>The percentage falls far below the required level set forth in
the General Equality in Employment Law, the activists noted.</P>
      <P>"We feel regret that the three public units have failed to abide
by the gender equality law, " said You Mei-nu, president of the
National Federation of Taiwan Women's Associations.</P>
      <P>Noting that legislation alone is not enough to ensure gender
equality, You said enforcement is equally important in substantiating
the ideals of gender equality.</P>
      <P>According to the CGA's plan, this year it will recruit 60 male
administrative clerks and 10 female clerks, as well as 75 offshore
male patrol officers. Women to be recruited account for only 6.9
percent of the total. The CGA has restricted the number of female
staff to be recruited on the grounds that the working environment and
job planning are "tough and not suitable for women."</P>
      <P>You, a lawyer, said the CGA's stated reasons fail to justify its
restrictions on women's rights to pursue a career in coast guard
service. You said women hopefuls can file complaints with local labor
affairs offices and that major women's groups will offer legal

the president will not meet them earlier.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lo Wen-chai, accompanied by National Chengchi
University Professor Feng Chien-san, visited the students at their
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall sit-in at around 5 a.m.</P>
      <P>Lo, who was one of the students that initiated the "wild lily"
student movement in 1990, listened to the students' views and
conveyed them to Chen at the Presidential Office. He said Chen was
"very concerned about the health of the students and would like to
meet with them to discuss national affairs and hear their views."</P>
      <P>Lo said that since the students do not want the meeting to take
place at the Presidential Office, the venue and the issues to be
discussed will be open without preconditions.</P>
      <P>The students who attend the meeting will not be confined to those
who have staged a hunger strike at the CKS Memorial Hall over the
past few days. Only one student per school will be allowed to attend
the meeting, which is expected to last for one or two hours.</P>
      <P>The number of participating students will be limited to between
40 and 50 and the meeting will be open to the public so that those
who cannot participate will be able to observe the proceedings.</P>
      <P>Upon hearing the news, the striking students expressed their
discontent and demanded an earlier meeting.</P>
      <P>The students, who had originally decided to end the hunger strike
Friday night out of concern for the health of the students -- two of
whom collapsed Tuesday -- said they would continue until the
president gives a substantial goodwill response.</P>
      <P>A student surnamed Keng from Soochow University also read a
five-point statement in which she claimed that after nearly a week of
hunger strike, the majority of the students were nearing the point of
breakdown, and accusing Chen of ignoring their appeal.</P>
      <P>Lo expressed regret over the students' dissatisfaction, pointing
out that "the president has agreed to meet and they have achieved
their aims."</P>
      <P>Lo said that he was surprised to learn that when the president
agreed to a meeting, they wanted to continue their hunger strike
indefinitely. He was "dismayed" by the development and "had no stance
to convince the president to change the time of the meeting."</P>
      <P>The students began their hunger strike April 2, saying that the
"wild lily" student movement of 14 years ago was their "spiritual
guide." They are protesting against the ethnic divisions in society
and demanding the truth about the March 19 shooting of Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu that the defeated "pan-blue alliance" believes
gave Chen last-minute sympathy votes and victory in the bitterly
contested March 20 election. Chen won by a narrow margin of 29,518
votes out of more than 13 million votes cast.</P>
      <P>The students have aroused concern, with some members of the
public expressing pain at seeing the students "harming themselves" to
press for their ideals.</P>
      <P>In March 1990, college students staged a sit-in at the CKS
Memorial Hall that lasted for more than one month to push for
constitutional reforms and express their discontent over senior
legislators who had not faced election since their first terms in
mainland China prior to 1949. The Legislative Yean underwent a
comprehensive election in 1992.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH COURT TO DISCUSS ELECTION LAWSUIT AGAIN NEXT MONDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court said Thursday it will
hold a closed-door meeting next Monday to discuss how to conduct a
recount of ballots cast in the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>High Court spokesman Wen Yao-yuan said the three judges handling
the opposition "pan-blue alliance's" lawsuit to nullify the
presidential election result will meet with lawyers of the two
feuding parties to hash out technical details regarding the recount.</P>
      <P>The defeated "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate,
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, filed the petition to annul
President Chen Shui-bian's narrow re-election victory and for a vote
recount March 29.</P>
      <P>The judges have already given the feuding parties five days to
iron out their disputes about how to retabulate the votes. The
deadline passed Wednesday, but the two sides have yet to come to
terms on some critical points.</P>
      <P>Both sides have agreed on a full retally of the more than 13
million ballots cast in the election, including the examination of a
record 330,000 invalid ballots -- triple the number in the last
presidential election. Chen defeated Lien by a narrow margin of
29,518 votes.</P>
      <P>The two sides have yet to reach agreement on other details,
including who should pay for the recount and the retallying methods
to be used. Wen said Monday's meeting will focus on procedures and
methods for the recount.</P>
      <P>"After the negotiations yield an agreement, the court tribunal
will announce whether to hold a recount, as well as the scope and
method of a recount," Wen told reporters at a news conference.</P>
      <P>He further said the court will announce its decision on the
recount April 13 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>One of the disagreements between the feuding parties is over the
scope of the recount. Lien's attorneys want judges to match the names
of the 13 million voters who cast ballots with the roster of eligible
voters, but the president's lawyers only want to do a simple recount
of the ballots and an examination of the 330,000 ballots deemed
invalid.</P>
      <P>Chen's lawyer, Wellington Koo, told reporters that the law
governing recounts only requires that the ballots be retallied and
inspected. The voters' names don't need to be double-checked with the
roster of eligible voters, he added.</P>
      <P>"If they insist on inspecting the roster, they need to present
evidence of fraud," Koo said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the election result nullification lawsuit, Lien's
lawyers have also filed a separate suit with the High Court aimed at
nullifying the entire election so that a new one can be held. They
first filed the election nullification lawsuit April 5, but withdrew
it Wednesday only to refile it hours later after making revisions.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to see two recounts that might produce different
outcomes so we decided to revise our election invalidation suit
saying a separate recount is not necessary, " said Huang Shan-shan, a
lawyer for Lien.</P>
      <P>The lawsuit claims that the Central Election Commission should
have postponed the election after the shooting of Chen on the eve of
the March 20 poll, and that it was illegal for a referendum to be
held alongside the poll.</P>
      <P>Analysts see little chance of a new election but say a recount is
much more likely since it has Chen's consent.</P>
      <P>Lien also seeks an "independent" inquiry into the election-eve
shooting, a demand that Chen has rejected, although he has allowed
U.S. forensic experts, including world-renowned forensic scientist
Dr. Henry Lee, to assist in forensic examinations.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party has
proposed a draft bill to pave the way for the establishment of a
committee under the Legislative Yuan to investigate the shooting that
slightly wounded Chen and Vice President Annette Lu. Lien alleges
that the incident unfairly swayed the election result in Chen's
favor. The "pan-blue alliance"-controlled Legislative Yuan will
discuss the bill Friday.</P>
      <P>If the bill fails to clear the legislature, the opposition
alliance will push for a referendum on the issue. The alliance will
also mobilize some 200,000 supporters to demonstrate at the
Presidential Office square in downtown Taipei Saturday, the
alliance's third large protest since the election.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: U.S. Increases Efforts to
Put Down Sunni and Shiite Fighters.

The Iraqi uprising against the American-led occupation
intensified Wednesday and spread to new parts of the country, with
United States forces increasing their efforts to put down Sunni and
Shiite combatants.

Pentagon officials in Washington signaled that they would
probably delay bringing home as many as 25,000 troops as scheduled
and probably move reinforcements to the south.

Wall Street Journal: Shiite Militiamen Control Parts Of Three
Iraqi Cities.

Militiaman loyal to an anti-U.S. Shiite cleric controlled large
swaths of three Iraqi cities Thursday after clashes with U.S.-led
coalition forces, while U.S. Marines backed by airstrikes fought
insurgents for the second day around a mosque complex in the Sunni
Muslim stronghold of Fallujah.

Fighting this week has left 35 Americans and at least 459 Iraqis
dead. This includes more than 280 Iraqis killed since the Marines'
siege against insurgents in Fallujah, west of Baghdad, began early
Monday said Taher Al-Issawi, the director of the city's hospital.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Rome, April 7 (CNA)
(By Tony Fang and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a rare and strongly worded-statement, the
Vatican condemned Beijing Thursday for the detention of a Catholic
bishop in the mainland, criticizing the action as "unacceptable."</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, the bishop, Jia
Zhiguo, was taken away from his home in the northern city of
Zhengding, Hebei province, about 250 kilometers southwest of Beijing,
Tuesday by government agents who gave no explanation for the
detention.</P>
      <P>Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls said in the statement
that this is again another case of a member of the Roman Catholic
Church being deprived of personal liberty without legal explanation.</P>
      <P>The statement added that in a country that boasts of religious
freedom and says that it is ruled by law and respects human rights,
this kind of action is extremely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>According to Navarro, Jia has been in jail for a total of 20
years. Some religious sources said that Jia has been repeatedly
arrested for his refusal to accept government demands to affiliate
himself with the Communist Party-controlled Catholic Patriotic
Association, which rejects Vatican authority over several issues such
as the naming of bishops.</P>
      <P>This was the second case in about a month, following the

    <TEXT>
      <P>World-renowned Chinese-American forensic
expert Henry Lee is expected to arrive in Taiwan Friday to help
investigate the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Thursday that it
will compile all information related to the shooting for Lee's team,
which will include ballistics expert Charles Illsley, who developed
an alternative light source technology that enables the detection of
trace evidence invisible to the naked eye.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said that when a trio of forensic experts, which
included Cyril H. Wecht, who was involved in the investigation of the
assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, came in late March,
police provided them with information regarding the bullets that were
recovered, blood samples, and crime scene reconstructions.</P>
      <P>Lee, who commissioned the trio to come to Taiwan because he was
engaged with other matters and couldn't come earlier, reportedly had
a meeting with the three men via a teleconference prior to his
departure from San Francisco to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They discussed evidence they had collected during their stay in
Taiwan, but said that their two-day stay in Taiwan was too short and
they weren't able to see enough evidence.</P>
      <P>The trio talked with the CIB, visited the crime scene in Tainan,
southern Taiwan and the Chi Mei Medical Center where the president
and vice president were treated after being shot and slightly
injured. They also called on President Chen at the Presidential
Office March 30.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has been involved with several high-profile cases in the
U.S. including O. J. Simpson's murder trial, was invited by State
Public Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa to help with the investigation,
which has made no major progress so far with no suspects and few
clues.</P>
      <P>His arrival is eagerly awaited as the public hopes he can help
solve the shooting on the eve of the March 20 presidential election,
which saw President Chen win by only 29,518 votes out of more than 13
million votes cast against his sole rival Lien Chan of the "pan-blue
alliance."</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" has claimed that the election
was marred by voting irregularities and the mysterious shooting, which
gave Chen last-minute sympathy votes and handed him the victory in
the bitterly contested election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMANY URGED NOT TO SUPPORT EASING OF ARMS SALES BAN TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed the hope
Thursday that Germany will not support an easing or lifting of a
European Union ban to sell arms to mainland China that was imposed in
the wake of the Tiananmen Massacre in Beijing in 1989.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks when he met Klaus Rose, head of a
Germany-Taiwan friendship group from the federal parliament, at the
Presidential Office. Rose arrived in Taipei Sunday for a six-day
visit.</P>
      <P>The president took the chance to thank Rose first for the
hospitality extended to Chen's wife, Wu Shu-chen, when she visited
Germany in July 2003 to help open a National Palace Museum exhibition
there.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Germany-Taiwan friendship group is one of the
largest groups in the parliament, with 59 members, the president
expressed his appreciation for the group's support and assistance to
Taiwan under Rose's leadership, especially in cultural exchanges and
trade cooperation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the exhibition of National Palace Museum artifacts
was successful, the president said that a Prussian cultural heritage
foundation from Germany will have an exhibition in Taiwan after May.</P>
      <P>In terms of trade exchanges, the president pointed out that
Taiwan is the third-largest trading partner of Germany in Asia, while
Germany is the largest trading partner of Taiwan in Europe, with
bilateral trade hitting US$10 billion last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan manufacturers have been active in taking part in trade
fairs in Germany, with the number of manufacturers taking part in the
prestigious Cebit exhibition in Hanover exceeded those from other
countries for the sixth consecutive year.</P>
      <P>The president also said that he was concerned that some countries
in the European Union are trying to lift or east the arms sales ban
on mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said that the ban was imposed because of the poor human rights
record in the mainland. So far, Beijing has not improved its human
rights record to warrant lifting the ban, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Rose would use his influence in the
parliament by urging his country not to ease or lift the ban.</P>
      <P>The president also is concerned about Germany's intention to sell
a plutonium factory to mainland China, saying that Beijing could
someday use it to produce nuclear weapons, therefore jeopardizing
world peace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TUNG BLOSSOM OF HAKKA FESTIVAL TO BEGIN APRIL 17</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2004 Tung Blossom of Hakka Festival
will be held from April 17 through May 16, the Cabinet-level Council
for Hakka Affairs (CHA) Chairwoman Yeh Chu-lan announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the festival will begin April 17 with a fun-filled
ceremony at the West Lake Resort in the northern Taiwan county of
Miaoli, a Hakka stronghold.</P>
      <P>This will be the third consecutive year that the CHA has
organized a tung blossom festival to boost tourism and cultural
development in Taiwan's major Hakka communities, particularly those
in northern parts of the island.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the event generated NT$500 million in business revenues
last year and that the festival will be expanded to cover Hakka
communities in Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Taichung and Nantou
counties.</P>
      <P>"We have arranged 21 paths for appreciating beautiful tung
flowers in full bloom, " Yeh said, adding that the festival offers
tourists lavish opportunities to enjoy the scene of "snow in summer"
created by the white tung flowers that look like snowflakes.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the CHA describes the flower of tung tree as a "blossom
of Hakka" because tung trees mainly flourish in Hakka communities in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to flower appreciation, Yeh said, the CHA has also
planned more than 600 other festivities, including pottery-making,
ecological tours, extracting tung seed oil, painting exhibitions,
woodcarving shows, photo competitions, Hakka singing contests, Hakka
food tasting, and seminars on Hakka cultural heritage and literature.
The activities will take place in some 30 townships in northern and
central parts of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A number of gift items in tung flower motifs, including lunch
boxes and wine, will be marketed in connection with the festival, Yeh
said, adding that state-owned Chunghwa Telecom will sell phone cards
bearing the motifs of the tung flower.</P>
      <P>Yeh said she hopes the annual tung blossom festival can help
enrich local cultural activities and promote tourism and economic
development in major Hakka communities.</P>
      <P>She also encouraged tourists to learn some basic Hakka
conversation during their trips to Hakka communities to experience
Taiwan's cultural diversity and the beauty of Hakka culture.</P>
      <P>More travel tips are available at the Web site www.hakka.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>The flourishing of tung tree, also known as tung oil tree
bearing the academic name of aluerites fordii hemi, on the mountain
regions in northern Taiwan was described as a "beautiful fallacy"
made decades ago.</P>
      <P>With a view to cashing in on the thriving demand for wooden
furniture materials to be exported to Japan, farmers in Taoyuan,
Hsinchu and Miaoli areas started planting wutung tree (firmiana
simplex, commonly named Chinese parasol tree) in the 1960s. But the
difficulty in growing wutung trees later forced many farmers to
switch to plant tung trees, which are much easier to take care of.
Both trees trace their roots to Yangtze River area in China.</P>
      <P>After the Japanese customers discovered the wrong wood and
stopped purchases from local suppliers, the tung oil trees were left
uncut.</P>
      <P>Three decades later, those trees are flourishing with
profuse blossoms in spring and have become a major tourist attraction
in the Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli area.</P>
      <P>The trees can still be used for carving, furniture and wood pulp.
The oil extracted from the seeds was used as a key ingredient for
varnish in old days and it remains a must for Hakka people who
produce hand-made umbrellas with oil paper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MASTER SHENG YEN TO CHAIR ZEN SESSION IN SWITZERLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World renowned Taipei-based Zen master
Sheng Yen is scheduled to preside over a Zen study session in
Switzerland in early May, local religious sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, founder of the Taiwan Buddhist group Dharma Drum
Mountain (DDM) Social Welfare and Charity Foundation, is set to
arrive in Switzerland in late April. He will give public sermons on
April 30 and May 1 before presiding over a seven-day Zen meditation
session to be held at the Beatenberg Zen Center in Bern beginning May
2.</P>
      <P>According to Beatenberg authorities, all 70 spots for the Zen
meditation session to be chaired by Master Sheng Yen were booked long
ago, with some being reserved by Buddhist followers from as far away
as Spain and the United States.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, a Buddhist monk since his formative years who later
obtained his doctorate in Buddhist studies in Japan and has since
founded numerous Buddhist associations and institutes in Taiwan and
elsewhere overseas, has drawn a lot of attention and publicity in
Switzerland even before his arrival.</P>
      <P>Traveling with some 20 world religious leaders to Israel and
Palestine last December, Sheng Yen, a member of the 2003 World
Council of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, tried to use the power of
religion to bridge the differences among people in the ethnic
conflict afflicting region.</P>
      <P>Presenting two words -- mercy and wisdom -- Sheng Yen called for
the leaderships of both Israel and Palestine to use wisdom to work
out solutions to their differences while practicing mercy on all the
people in the region regardless of their political affiliation or
religion, so as to not let down the people living in the Holy Land.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen and his party met with Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed
Qureia during a symposium held in Jerusalem Dec. 11. After hearing
Sheng Yen's preaching, Qureia reportedly applauded enthusiastically
and said to his aides that he looks forward to seeing Sheng Yen's
suggestions put into practice.</P>
      <P>At a colloquium held at the Israeli prime minister's office Dec.
14, Sheng Yen delivered a speech to ranking Israeli officials,
including Cabinet officials, parliamentary advisers and government
consultants in news and religious affairs.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Sheng Yen interpreted Islamic doctrine as
stipulating that Jihad -- or holy war -- does not mean to strive to
defeat others, but instead to defeat one's own evil thoughts. "This
is an idea almost the same as the Buddhist concept of conquering the
evil in one's mind," Sheng Yen noted.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen said he hopes that all the followers of Islam, Judaism
and Christianity will reach out their hands to one another so that
world peace will prevail.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, author of many books on Buddhism both in Chinese and
in English, is respected in Taiwan, mainland China and around the
world. As a Zen master, his teachings emphasize that practitioners
should in their daily lives be constantly aware of the thoughts
circulating in their minds.</P>
      <P>Such awareness allows people to simplify their minds and to
clearly perceive changes in themselves and in their environment, he
said. Wisdom is developed so that people can apply it in their
workaday lives to face themselves, grow and dissolve their
attachments and enter into a state of "no-self, " according to his
teachings.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen has been actively engaged in inter-faith exchanges that
advocate and promote religious understanding. His involvement in such
global activities includes being a member of the 2003 World Council
of Religious and Spiritual Leaders and delivering the keynote address
at the 2000 Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual
Leaders in New York.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, he founded the DDM Buddhist Association, which now has
over one million followers. In the United States, he has been
teaching the Buddhadharma since 1975, leading to the founding of two
centers, one in New York City and one in Upstate New York.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen's DDMBA made a donation of US$100,000 in post-quake
relief aid to Iran immediately after a devastating earthquake struck
the historic city of Bam last Dec. 26.</P>
      <P>Days later, after dispatching a four-member mission to Bam for a
fact-finding trip, the DDMBA launched a fund-raising drive to channel
another US$100,000 into Iran to foster children who were orphaned and
deprived of schooling by the deadly earthquake.</P>

      <P>A total of 11 officers charged with the

      <P>Also disciplined were Lu's Chief Aide-de-Camp Lee Ke-kang and
eight other officers and secret agents who either accompanied Chen

      <P>Chiu Chung-nan, a deputy chief for the president's security

guilty of dereliction of duty or other crimes, said the statement.</P>
      <P>The punishment of the president's aides should be subject to the
approval of the president, said the statement.</P>
      <P>These security officers were punished nine days after Tsai
Chao-ming, the former director of the National Security Bureau

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan
told Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Friday that people in the south of
Taiwan have the impression that Taipei is in anarchy with protesters
usurping control of law and order.</P>
      <P>Su, formerly Pingtung County magistrate, made the statement in a
meeting with Taipei Mayor Ma over a planed rally by supporters of the
opposition Kuomintang and People First Party in Taipei on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Su said that people in southern Taiwan can't understand why
protesters in Taipei were able to take control of the boulevard in
front of the President Office for nearly a week after the March 20
presidential election, and why the city government didn't rein them
in.</P>
      <P>The minister, who assumed his new post as head of the interior
ministry only two hours before the meeting, told Ma that Taiwan is a
democratic country that settles disputes through its judiciary
system, so why should people in Taipei vent their grievances through
demonstrations rather then seeking remedies via the legal process.
"Does that mean we should go back to the primitive time and fight
disputes out with fist or hoes," Su asked.</P>
      <P>Ma told Su the protesters gathered in front of the Presidential
Office to press their demands and simply driving them away without
addressing their claims would not have calmed them down.</P>
      <P>The minister shot back: "I am not in a position to talk with you
about politics. I am talking about law."</P>
      <P>The minister said the central government would respect Taipei
citizens' right to assemble for political reasons as well as City
Hall's authority to approve such events; however, he urged Ma's city
government to be sure it can deal with any violence arising from the
Saturday rally before it becomes intolerable for residents.</P>

(By  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's optical communication industry is
growing fast and poised to play a greater role in the world market if
locally made key components and materials possess superior quality,
an expert said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu Yung-sun, director of the Opto-Electronics and Systems
Laboratories under the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI), made the remarks in a forum jointly sponsored by the ITRI and
the Taiwan Optical Communication Industry Alliance.</P>
      <P>Specialists from world famous companies, such as Telcordia,
Lucent, Intel and Alcatel, also gave keynote speeches and discussed
the industry's latest development trends.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the domestic industry has expanded quickly in
recent years, with 96 companies now engaged in the sector, a jump
from 39 companies five years ago.</P>
      <P>Although the domestic industry now owns a stronger technology and
a more competitive marketing network thanks to its past experience as
a major contractor for many world-class big companies, Liu pointed
out that Taiwan companies still need to upgrade the quality and
supply chain of their key parts, components and materials.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies must further enhance the image and the quality
of their products to meet buyers' requirements, he suggested.</P>
      <P>An investigation made public by ElectroniCast Group shows that
global demand for optical devises in 2003 rose by between 10 percent
and 15 percent, while demand in 2004 will increase by between 25
percent and 30 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE IMPORTANT TO NEW INTERIOR MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Minister of the Interior Su Jia-quan
said he will give priority to fighting crime and maintaining law and
order to provide a stable environment for economic development and
political reform.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at a changeover ceremony where he accepted
the ministry's official seal from his predecessor, Yu Cheng-hsien.
The event was witnessed by Minister-without-Portfolio Yeh Chun-jung.</P>
      <P>Yu resigned Monday to assume political responsibility for the
March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu in the southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>Su, who was magistrate of Taiwan's southernmost county of
Pingtung, said the incident compelled him to list cracking down on
crime and safeguarding public order as his top priority.</P>
      <P>Su said his wife is a graduate of Central Police University. "As
the dependent of a police officer, I'll work to improve welfare
services for police and upgrade their dignity and self-confidence as
well as enhance public trust in police officers," he added.</P>
      <P>While pledging to uphold good existing policies and measures, Su
said he will also scrap or amend outdated policies.</P>
      <P>"I hope to inject more creativity, entrepreneurship and vitality
into the Ministry of the Interior," Su said.</P>
      <P>In addition to fighting crime, Su said he will also prioritize
several other tasks, including narrowing the gap between rural and
urban areas, formulating a fair and just social welfare policy and
strengthening convenient digitalized services for the public.</P>
      <P>Shortly after taking office, Su met with Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou to exchange views on how to maintain order at the
opposition "pan-blue alliance's" protest rally at the Presidential
Office square this weekend.</P>
      <P>Su said the central government respects people's right to
assembly and demonstration. "But we hope the Taipei City Government
can quickly and properly handle unexpected incidents during the
rally. In any event, we want the rally to end as scheduled, " Su told
Ma.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma said the city government will do its utmost to
ensure that the event proceeds peacefully and orderly.</P>
      <P>It will be the "pan-blue alliance's" third large protest rally
since the March 20 presidential election in which the alliance's
candidate, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, narrowly lost to incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian. The alliance claimed that the election-eve
shooting of Chen unfairly swayed the outcome in Chen's favor.</P>
      <P>Su, 48, has been Pingtung County magistrate for six years. Upon
his re-election in late 2001, he became the first incumbent county
chief to win a second four-year term in Pingtung in two decades.</P>
      <P>He has been a National Assembly member and served two terms as a
legislator before becoming Pingtung County chief in 1997. At that
time, Pingtung was reputed to be a gangster stronghold. Su pushed for
county administration reform. Through his strong lobbying, the
central government lifted a longstanding construction ban on many
parts of the island's southernmost county, paving the way for
rezoning of farmland and facilitating the county's economic
development.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, Su was said to have transformed Pingtung
from "the home of gangsters" to "the home of bluefin tuna fishing and
top-quality wax apples."</P>
      <P>Su set a goal of developing Pingtung into a heartland of tourism
and high-tech industries. He has initiated a number of cultural and
recreational programs to attract tourists, including the Bluefin
Festival and the Kenting Wind Bell Festival. He has also turned the
previously military-controlled Tapeng Bay into a new beach resort.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he has managed to acquire central government approval
for locating many national-level construction projects in Pingtung,
including a new export processing zone, a biotechnology and
agriculture park and a Hakka culture park to help create jobs and
revitalize the economy in the otherwise rural county.</P>
      <P>Su's efforts have earned him wide popularity in the county. He
also ranks high in many public opinion surveys on the performance of
local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Pingtung
County's average household income registered a 10 percent increase
last year, the highest growth among all cities and counties around
the nation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROPOSAL FOR LEGISLATIVE PROBE INTO MARCH 19 SHOOTING SCUTTLED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A draft bill proposed by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) for a committee set up
under the Legislative Yuan to probe the March 19 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and the ensuing government response were
scuttled at the Legislative Yuan Friday by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>Both camps called in all their lawmakers for a vote on the
proposal.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT-PFP "pan-blue alliance," which commands a narrow
majority of 112 seats in the 223-seat legislature, succeeded in
pushing through a resolution to refer the bill to related committees
for deliberation -- the so-called second reading -- the TSU took
issue with the idea of investigating the government's response to the
March 19 shooting, while the DPP raised objections to the idea of
forming a special committee to probe the shooting.</P>
      <P>As a result, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is a
KMT vice chairman, ruled a four-month negotiation period among the
various parties, as is usual for such disputes.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of this result, "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers
produced placards reading "seeking truth" and "what does Chen
Shui-bian fear? " and shouted slogans to show their anger at being
thwarted.</P>
      <P>Speculating that the shooting might have been a political scheme
aimed at boosting Chen's popularity on the eve of the presidential
election, the KMT and PFP are eager to set up a committee under the
Legislative Yuan to look into the incident, even though such cases
fall under the authority of the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-liang, the DPP caucus whip at the
Legislative Yuan, pointed out that the proposal is doomed to fail
because it is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Tsai said his party will press for a plebiscite in conjunction
with the year-end legislative elections on the reform of the
Legislative Yuan, the abolishment of the fourth nuclear plant,
Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization, and a bill
for handling the KMT's ill-gotten assets.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Ming-hao, secretary of the TSU caucus at the
legislature, said his party would support the KMT-PFP proposal if the
two parties would support the enactment of a bill to govern the
handling of the disputed KMT assets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STRENGTHENING TRA IMPLEMENTATION MORE CRUCIAL THAN REVISION: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Strengthening the implementation of the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) is more important than revising the law
itself, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Kau Yin-mao said Friday.</P>
      <P>Kau made the remarks while attending a seminar to mark the 25th
anniversary of the enactment of the TRA, which was signed into law by
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter April 10, 1979.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar sponsored by Legislator Parris Chang of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party at the Legislative Yuan, Kau
said that with the law going into its 25th year, some have proposed a
revision, but he pointed out that there would be positive and
negative aspects to a revision.</P>
      <P>He said that if the TRA is revised, it should be done in order to
strengthen Taiwan's national identification and try to upgrade the
development of bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>However, if Taiwan were to propose too many revisions, the United
States could also reduce its protection of Taiwan under the TRA, he
said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang for his part said that the TRA acts as a
protection umbrella for Taiwan and that Taiwan has had security and
economic development over the past 25 years because of the TRA.</P>
      <P>The TRA has also made great contributions to Taiwan's democratic
development, he said.</P>
      <P>On the issue of a TRA revision, Chang noted that former U.S.
President Ronald Reagan listed "no revision of the TRA" in a list of
six assurances to Taiwan in 1982. "This is why Taiwan should also be
very careful about seeking revisions," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if that Pandora's box is opened, the U.S. could
also make revisions that have unfavorable repercussions for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Liao Hung-hsiang, a researcher of the Taiwan Research
Institute, a local think tank, said that with the changing times, the
Taiwan of today is different from that of 25 years ago, so it is
necessary to try to persuade Washington to review the TRA and pass a
bill to make up for the TRA's deficiencies. He added that the most
crucial aspect of the revisions should be the display of a
"paramilitary alliance relationship" between Taiwan and the United
States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kau said that chances of the European Union lifting an
arms sale embargo against mainland China are slim.</P>
      <P>Kau said that while EU members such as France and Germany indeed
intend to lift the embargo that was imposed in the wake of the
Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, the EU will base its decision on
the views of the majority of members.</P>
      <P>As the EU will be increased from 15 to 25 member countries from
May 1, the decision making process will be even more complex, so the
chances of the ban being lifted will not be great, despite efforts by
the mainland to have it lifted.</P>

      <P>EPZs, which are no longer just OEM (original equipment

respectively.</P>
      <P>Chou indicated that the EPZs around the island attracted around

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION TO INITIATE FORMATION OF COMMITTEE TO PROBE SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party said Friday that it can
complete at a rally Saturday the initiation stage of establishing a
"truth committee" to investigate the March 19 shooting of President
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Justin Chou said it is expected that the initiation
will be completed in one day and that the collection of the required
number of signatures will be completed in a week.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" is scheduled to stage a major rally with
the theme of "fight for truth through referendum." Judging from the
number of people attending "pan-blue alliance" rallies in Taipei
recently, the initiation process can be completed in one day alone,
said Chou.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Law passed in late November, a
referendum proposal must first have the support of 0.5 percent of the
electorate to make it an issue, after which the names of more than 5
percent of the voters must be collected to make it a valid proposal.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the alliance will not "rule out holding the
referendum simultaneously with the year-end legislative elections."</P>
      <P>The March 19 shooting in which Chen and Lu were slightly injured
is at the center of the dispute between the "pan-blue alliance" and
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The alliance, whose candidate, KMT Chairman Lien Chan, lost the
election to Chen by a narrow margin of 29,518 votes out of more than
13 million cast, believes the election-eve shooting played a role in
bringing Chen last-minute sympathy votes that helped him win the
bitterly contested election.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the opposition Taiwan Solitary Union, a
DPP ally, said that it will hold a night-time rally Saturday in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan to celebrate Chen's victory.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen will speak at the rally, although a
scheduled television hookup with former President Lee Teng-hui -- the
TSU's "spiritual leader" -- was scrapped to avoid "pan-blue alliance"
supporters creating disturbances at the rally.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. decision to deploy six B-52 bombers
on Guam is mainly aimed at coping with the North Korean situation,
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau said Friday.</P>
      <P>Kau made the remarks in response to a press inquiry about his
views on the recent U.S. announcement that it will again deploy B-52
bombers on Guam.</P>
      <P>Kau said the U.S. decision does not have any direct relations
with the Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>After the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Kau said, the United
States is now focusing its attention on North Korean issues with the
aim of maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"The B-52 deployment is part of the U.S. efforts to strengthen
Asia-Pacific security measures. It is mainly related to the situation
on the Korean peninsula and does not directly relate to cross-Taiwan
Strait ties," Kau said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the resignation of American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairwoman Therese Shaheen, Kau said personnel reshuffles are a
normal procedure in any government.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States has a well-crafted administrative
system, Kau said a single personnel change will not affect its policy
line.</P>
      <P>"We need not be overly worried about the AIT personnel
reshuffle, " Kau said, adding that Shaheen's departure will in no way
affect Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>AIT is a quasi-official U.S. organization authorized to handle
relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>As to the possibility of the European Union lifting its ban on
selling arms to mainland China, Kau said the proposal is not expected
to be approved soon.</P>
      <P>Kao said some E.U. member states, such as France and Germany,
indeed intend to lift the mainland China-bound arms export ban.
However, according to the E.U.'s decision-making style, the proposal
must obtain the approval of all E.U. member states. Moreover, Kau
said, the number of E.U. members will expand from the current 15
to 25 May 1.</P>
      <P>"By then, the E.U. deicion-making procedure will have become even
more complicated. Against this backdrop, I don't think the arms ban
lifiting proposal can be passed any time soon," Kau added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDENT PROTESTERS WANT TO MEET PRESIDENT IMMEDIATELY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leader of a group of student protesters
who have launched a sit-in "fast" since April 2 said Friday that they
were not planning to attend a meeting at a theater with President
Chen Shui-bian April 12, but wanted the president come to see them at
their sit-in that very day.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-feng, who was rushed to National Taiwan University
Hospital due to fatigue but who later returned to the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall complex where the protest is taking place, said the
Presidential Office's offer of an April 12 meeting with the president
has blurred the focus of the students' protest and their cause.</P>
      <P>Chen demanded that the president come to see the students at the
CKS complex before Saturday, when they were set to end their
so-called "fast" -- which involves them doing without meals for
several hours at a time.</P>
      <P>"The president is welcome to come to have a dialogue with us
today, no matter how late it is, " Chen said, adding that "all of the
people here are students and the president should not be afraid of
seeing them."</P>
      <P>According to Huang Chih-fang, a Presidential Office spokesman,
the president has decided to exchange views with 50 student leaders
from various colleges and universities next Monday and has expressed
hope that the protesters, who number about 20, will join the other
students at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the student protesters are not politicians
and what they are pursuing is not the same as the goals chased by the
country's politicians. All they want is peace and reconciliation in
Taiwan society, he said, adding that the protesters are not afraid of
being labeled and that they are not accepting any donations.</P>
      <P>He also reduced the original five demands of the students to just

the March 20 presidential election should apologize to the people for
causing political chaos and social restlessness, and that an

Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Water reserves at various major reservoirs
in southern Tainan County have dropped to dangerously low levels as a
result of continued dry weather over the past few months, the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsengwen Reservoir -- Taiwan's largest -- is facing a historic
30-year low, with its water level coming to about 172 meters as of
Thursday, only some 1.2 meters away from the lowest level at which it
can maintain normal operations. At present, it holds about 5.2
million cubic meters of water.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that it rained the previous night in the Tainan
area -- 20.5 millimeters in Tainan City and 43.5 millimeters in
Tainan County -- the amount was far from sufficient to bring relief
to the reservoirs in the region.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the water level of the nearby Wushantou
Reservoir stood at 44.87 meters, representing reserves of 9.57
million cubic meters.</P>
      <P>The situation at the Nanhua Reservoir, which supplies water to
the Chiayi and Kaohsiung areas, was better, with its water level
standing at 163.52 meters, with more than 66 million cubic meters
contained.</P>
      <P>Nanhua reservoir authorities said that normal water supplies are
expected to last through May before being supplemented when the
typhoon season begins in June or July.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been troubled by a continued dry spell in recent
years, with northern regions being most affected. However, rainfall
from late January to early February brought some relief.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM IS A BASIC CIVIL RIGHT: MAYOR MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday The
opposition "pan-blue alliance" is eligible to initiate a referendum
to authorize the Legislative Yuan to form a special committee to
investigate the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"Referendums are a basic civil right and can be held so long as
they proceed in strict accordance with the law," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after the "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) announced a day
earlier that it would begin to collect endorsement signatures
for its "referendum for truth" proposal Saturday when the alliance
will stage a protest rally at the Presidential Office square in
downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" will mobilize at least 200,000 supporters
to demonstrate at Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office in protest against what it calls the unfair March 20
presidential election. It will be the alliance's third large protest
since the bitterly fought election in which the alliance's candidate,
KMT Chairman Lien Chan, narrowly lost to incumbent President Chen
Shui-bian. The alliance claimed that the mysterious election-eve
shooting unfairly swayed the result in Chen's favor.</P>
      <P>Ma, who concurrently serves as a KMT vice chairman, said the
Taipei City Police Headquarters will be responsible for maintaining
order at Saturday's rally to ensure that the event ends smoothly and
peacefully. Violent clashes between riot police and some radical
"pan-blue" supporters erupted during last Saturday's protest rally.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has asked the "pan-blue alliance" authorities to join
forces with city police to maintain order and prevent a recurrence of
violence at this weekend's demonstration.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's plan to initiate referendums on four critical issues to be
held alongside the year-end legislative elections, Ma said he is not
opposed to such a plan so long as the referendums are held in
accordance with the provisions of the Referendum Act promulgated last
November.</P>
      <P>DPP sources said Thursday that the party plans to initiate
referendums on four issues -- halving the number of legislative
seats, scrapping the nation's fourth nuclear power plant now under
construction, joining the World Health Organization, and enacting a
special statute to deal with the KMT's ill-gotten party assets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RENOWNED FORENSIC EXPERT HENRY LEE ARRIVES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World renowned Chinese-American forensic
scientist Dr. Henry Lee and four other experts arrived in Taiwan
Friday to help look into the March 19 shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>The forensic expert said the team will examine all physical
evidence concerning the shooting as well as visit Tainan City in
southern Taiwan where the shooting took place and the Chi Mei Medical
Center where the president and vice president received treatment
after being wounded.</P>
      <P>"We will let the evidence speak for itself," Lee stressed.</P>
      <P>He also said that as some time has passed since the shooting, he
will probably not visit the president to observe his wound but will
review carefully the medical treatment record and related photos.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has come to Taiwan at the invitation of State Public
Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa, said that his task is purely to examine
the physical evidence and that his political views are not an issue,
referring to allegations that he is an opposition "pan-blue alliance"
supporter.</P>
      <P>Having been involved in forensic work for 45 years, Lee said, he
has maintained good relations with both the Democratic and Republican
parties in the United States and has made friends with members of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as well as the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First Party in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"My work in Taiwan will be purely to examine the physical
evidence, " Lee said, adding that he will have no part in the
investigation into the motives of the assailant or assailants.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are some 26,000 murder cases and around one
million sexual assault and robbery cases in the United States every
year and that many of them remain unsolved due mainly to insufficient
evidence, Lee said Taiwan's presidential election-eve shooting
will probably remain unsolved if there is not enough evidence
gathered.</P>
      <P>Accompanying Lee are Charles P. Illsley, who developed an
alternative light source technology that is used to detect trace
amounts of substances that are invisible to the human eye, as well as
crime scene special photographer Calvin D. Ostler, legal consultant
Austin J. McGuigan, and his special assistant Dr. Jacob S. Loke.</P>
      <P>Lee's arrival is eagerly awaited as the public hopes he can help
solve the shooting on the eve of the March 20 presidential election,
which saw President Chen win by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 voces
out of more than 13 million votes cast against his sole rival Lien
Chan of the "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" has claimed that the election was
marred by voting irregularities and the mysterious shooting, which
gave Chen last-minute sympathy votes and handed him the victory in
the bitterly contested election.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Doctors in Singapore are using the
latest techniques in key-hole surgery to correct medical problems in
men and women who have trouble conceiving.</P>
      <P>Coupled with less expensive day surgery, childless couples may
now have a better chance of having a baby.</P>
      <P>Channel NewsAsia found out at an international symposium on the
future of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) that using technology like
ultra-sound imaging has almost doubled the success rate of couples
trying to babies.</P>
      <P>Not only are Singaporeans getting married at a later age, they
are also postponing having children -- leading to a declining
fertility rate in the city-state.</P>
      <P>But there are some who also have problems conceiving because of
medical reasons. These range from sperm problems to ovulatory
dysfunctions. Local fertility expert Dr. Christopher Chen has seen
more than 1,000 male patients who have swollen varicose veins at
their genitals. This prevents them from producing healthy sperm,
while hundreds of women need to remove fibroids or cysts in their
wombs.</P>
      <P>Non-intrusive surgeries to correct such problems can now be
performed as day surgery, and patients can be back at work about
three days later.</P>
      <P>But the biggest breakthrough is the use of existing ultra-sound
imaging technology to track the process of Assisted Reproduction
Technology (ART) and IVF.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen says the technology helps fertility experts better
monitor the reproductive systems of patients as well as the
fertilization process, thereby improving the success rate of couples
using artificial methods to conceive.</P>

Grappling with his worst crisis since taking office, Prime

intention of meeting the demands of a group threatening to 'burn
alive' the hostages unless Tokyo pulls its 550 troops out of Iraq by
tomorrow night.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Riot police turned water cannons on angry
supporters of the defeated "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan as they tried to storm
barbed-wire barricades outside the Presidential Office Saturday.</P>
      <P>Riot police took the action with the consent of Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, a KMT vice chairman, Taipei City Government spokesman Wu
Yu-sheng said.</P>
      <P>Ma agreed to the municipal police headquarters' decision to
turn water cannons to angry demonstrators after they threw bottles,
tables and chairs at barbed-wire barricade as the earlier peaceful
rally of some 80,000 people turned violent in the evening.</P>
      <P>It was the third large protest rally organized by the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) since Lien
lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian in the bitterly fought
March 20 presidential election by a razor-thin margin of 29,518
votes.</P>
      <P>Lien and his running mate, PFP Chairman James Soong, led the
crowd to Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office in
downtown Taipei to demand the formation of an independent committee
to investigate the "mysterious" election-eve shooting of President
Chen. Lien claimed that the shooting unfairly swayed the election in
Chen's favor, and insinuated that the shooting might have been staged
for sympathy votes.</P>
      <P>Although "pan-blue alliance" organizers announced that the rally
ended at 6 p.m., some demonstrators declined to leave the site and
then later tore down several barbed-wire barricades.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the rally earlier in the day, Lien said
President Chen has shied away in the past three weeks and ignored the
people's demands for "truth of the shooting."</P>
      <P>"This is not a long-term strategy," Lien told the crowd. Lien
said sympathy votes swung the election and wanted an impartial
investigation into the mysterious shooting, in which Chen was
slightly wounded.</P>
      <P>The president has rejected the demand for the establishment of an
independent committee under the Legislative Yuan to investigate the
shooting on the grounds that creation of such a body violates the
constitutional principle of division of power.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" is now moving to push for a referendum to
be held alongside the year-end legislative elections for setting up
the proposed independent investigative committee.</P>
      <P>Speaking at Saturday's rally, Lien's running mate PFP Chairman
James Soong said if Chen fails to approve the proposal for creating
an independent investigative committee, the "pan-blue alliance" plans
to stage another large protest rally on the eve of Chen's
inauguration for a second four-year term on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen was gashed across the stomach and Vice President Annette Lu
was wounded in the knee when an unknown assailant with a homemade
handgun fired two bullets at them as they campaigned in an open-top
jeep in the southern city of Tainan on March 19. Police have so far
not arrested any suspect.</P>
      <P>World-renowned Chinaese-American forensic expert Henry Lee, a
veteran of such high-profile cases as the O.J. Simpson murder trial,
joined the probe this week and recreated the crime scene in Tainan on
Friday night using lasers to trace the path of the bullets.</P>
      <P>Lee said he found 20-30 tiny glass fragments on the dashboard and
floor of the jeep, which prove the bullet that struck Lu was fired
from the right side. His team also found machine markings on the
bullets and casings that Lee said needed further study. His findings
allay some suspicions the shooting was faked.</P>
      <P>Lien has filed two lawsuits -- one to invalidate Chen's victory
and order a recount, and the other to nullify the election and order
a new one -- citing a record 330,000 invalid ballots, alleged voting
irregularities, the March 19 shooting and other factors.</P>
      <P>Analysts say a recount is almost certain since Chen has
consented to one but a new election is unlikely.</P>

      <P>The planned meeting between President Chen
Shui-bian and student leaders from around the nation for March 12
will not be confined to certain topics, a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lo Wen-chia, who is also director in charge of
youth affairs in the party, noted that as the president is willing to
talk with the students on any subject, the meeting is much
anticipated.</P>
      <P>The meeting had originally been planned for the students engaged
in a hunger strike at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall calling for an
end to the ethnic split in Taiwan society and the truth behind the
election-eve "mysterious" shooting of Chen and Vice President Annette

slightly injured. Many believe that the shooting won many sympathy
votes for Chen and contributed to his re-election.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) passed a proposal Saturday to reform its nomination rules for
at-large legislative seats.</P>
      <P>The proposal, initiated by a group of young and middle-age
legislators, was passed at a DPP extraordinary party congress chaired
by President Chen Shui-bian in his capacity as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>The new nomination rules will be implemented in the upcoming
intraparty primaries for the year-end legislative elections. At-large
legislative seats are alloted among major political parties in
proportion to the number of ballots they garner in regional-seat
elections.</P>
      <P>According to the new rules, DPP candidates for at-large
legislative seats will be divided into two categories -- political
group and academic/expert group.</P>
      <P>Candidacy for the political group will be decided in terms of the
results of both voting by DPP members to be held in May and a series
of follow-up public opinion surveys.</P>
      <P>Candidacy for the academic group will be decided by a nomination
commission with the endorsement of the DPP's Central Executive
Committee. The nomination commission will be composed of seven to
nine members appointed by the party's chairman with the endorsement
of the Central Executive Committee.</P>
      <P>The new rules also include a provision that the nominees in the
academic/expert group must be those who support the DPP's charter and
platform and have clearly contributed to the DPP and society as well.</P>
      <P>For years, the DPP has been criticized for cronyism in the
nomination of candidates for at-large legislative seats, with family
members of influential party elders dominating the nomination list.</P>
      <P>With a view to promoting women's political participation, the new
rules set a quota for women hopefuls. To cultivate senior
parliamentary leaders, the new rules lift a two-term ceiling for
at-large seats.</P>
      <P>It was also decided at the congress that the nomination rules for
the academic/expert group will be applied to nomination for
candidates for overseas representative seats.</P>

      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party launched a massive rally
Saturday in front of the Presidential Office, demanding the truth
about the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Municipal Police Department, some 80,000
"pan-blue alliance" supporters gathered at the venue at 3: 30 p.m.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 2,200 police officers sent by Taipei Police
Department, the central government's National Police Administration
also sent some 2,500 police officers, while some 6,000 police
officers stationed around the country were on standby for any
emergency situation that might arise.</P>
      <P>Supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" are demanding the truth
behind the election-eve assassination attempt against President Chen
and Vice President Lu during a campaign activity in Tainan, southern
Taiwan, in which both were slightly injured.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
and People First Party Chairman James Soong was defeated by Chen and
Lu in the March 20 election by the slim margin of just under 30,000
of the more than 13 million votes cast. Many believe that the
shooting won many sympathy votes for Chen, while the "security
mechanism" triggered by the shooting deprived many military service
members and police officers of their right to vote.</P>
      <P>Failing to obtain a clear explanation about the "mysterious"
shooting, the "pan-blue alliance" is now planning to push for a
referendum to seek the public's support for the formation of an
"investigation committee" under the Legislative Yuan to probe the
March 19 shooting of Chen and Lu.</P>
      <P>Lien, Soong, as well as the KMT's two vice presidents -- namely
Wang Jin-pyng, who concurrently serves as the Legislative Yuan
president, and Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, and several "pan-blue
alliance" legislators also attended the rally, urging the public to
support the establishment of such a committee.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Law, the signatures of more than 5
percent of eligible voters must be collected to validate the
opposition alliance's proposal.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) needs to obtain a majority of seats in the Legislature in the
legislative elections later this year so that it can carry out its
promises to the Taiwan people, a DPP official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an interim party congress held in Taipei, DPP
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said that the ruling party will
push ahead with legislative reform and the writing of a new
constitution for Taiwan over the next four years, and thus make
Taiwan a "normal democratic nation."</P>
      <P>"Only by the DPP obtaining a majority of seats in the Legislative
Yuan can these historic missions be accomplished," Chang claimed.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Vice President Annette Lu said in
her capacity as a DPP member that deepening Taiwan's democracy,
governing according to the law and constructing the country based on
human rights will be the three major missions to be accomplished by
the ruling party over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The DPP has fulfilled two historic missions in the past -- namely
ending authoritarian rule in Taiwan and making a peaceful power
transfer between political parties happen, she added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the congress as a guest, Huang Chu-wen, chairman of
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), called for cooperation between his
party and the DPP in December's legislative elections to obtain a
combined majority in the 225-seat Legislature. The TSU is an ally of
the DPP in the "pan green camp."</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should insist on reform in
the wake of the March 20 presidential election in order to respond to
mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while presiding over an extraordinary party
congress in his capacity as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP campaigned on a platform of "Believe in
Taiwan, Insist on Reform" in the run-up to the election, Chen said
his re-election indicates that the commitment to reform has received
resounding support in local society.</P>
      <P>To live up to public expectations, Chen said, the DPP should
carry out intraparty reform after winning the presidential election.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, the road to deepen and normalize Taiwan's
young democracy can be accomplished in three stages.</P>
      <P>"We have realized our first-stage goal by winning the 2004
presidential election, and now we must step up efforts to realize our
second-stage goal by capturing more than half of the seats to be up
for grabs in the year-end legislative elections," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the third stage, Chen said, the DPP wants to write a new
constitution suitable for Taiwan's present situation.</P>
      <P>"We have scheduled putting the proposed new constitution to a
referendum in 2006, " Chen said. "Now that we have again won the
presidency, we must accelerate preparations for the year-end
legislative elections in order to control a majority in the
Legislative Yuan to facilitate implementation of our reform agenda
and complete '100 percent' transition of power between different
political parties."</P>
      <P>Stressing that unceasing intraparty reform is the best way to
guard against corruption, Chen said the DPP must not stop its reform
drive after the recent election victory.</P>
      <P>"Even though the path of reform is usually winding and bumpy, the
DPP should not be daunted by any challenge and should instead serve
as a driving force behind Taiwan's reform and progress, " Chen said,
adding that reform is the DPP's commitment to the 23 million people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the first step for intraparty reform, Chen said, the DPP must
overhaul its nomination rules for at-large legislative seats which
are alloted among major political parties in proportion to the number
of votes they garner in regional-seat elections.</P>
      <P>"We should revise our nomination rules for at-large legislative
seat candidacy in order to attract more talent to join our ranks and
win more voter support," Chen urged.</P>
      <P>Several proposals regarding the nomination rule changes will be
put up for discussion at the half-day extraordinary party congress
which began at 1 p.m. Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAA ALLOWS TAICHUNG AIRPORT TO HANDLE INTERNATIONAL CHARTER FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
will allow the newly inaugurated Taichung International Airport in
central Taiwan to handle international charter flights on a limited
and conditional basis, CAA officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>CAA director-general Chang Kuo-cheng said the agency originally
planned not to allow Taichung International Airport to handle
international charter flight services in the short term, except for
three international charter flights to Tokyo, Phuket Island in
Thailand, and Palau on its inaugural day, due to the limited space in
its hangars for larger airplanes. The airport was inaugurated March 5
this year.</P>
      <P>However, Chang added, residents in central Taiwan have expressed
a strong desire that the only international airport in central Taiwan
be allowed to handle more international charter flights, and
furthermore, to open charter flight services between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait for the next Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>Although the agency plans to allow international charter flight
services out of the airport, Chang said, there have been conditions
attached so as not to affect the domestic flights operating from the
airport. International flights must depart earlier in the morning
than domestic flights and arrive at the airport after all domestic
flights for the day have done so.</P>
      <P>On the public's calls for cross-strait flight services for the
Chinese New Year period, Chang said this is not an issue for the CAA
to decide. He added that if the government gives the green light,
there won't be any technical problems for the CAA in implementing it.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's top official in
the United States on Friday urged overseas Chinese to tolerate and
respect each other in the wake of Taiwan's controversial presidential
election March 20.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's representative to the United States,
made the remarks in response to media questions regarding the
seriousness of the split within local overseas Chinese communities
after the election.</P>
      <P>Admitting that serious disunity exists in the local Chinese
communities, the representative said that the problem has been
complicated by mainland China's attempts to take advantage of the
situation to gain more support from the local Chinese communities.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan society has become deeply divided between the rival
pan-green and pan-blue camps, the split has also appeared in overseas
Chinese communities in the United States, he said.</P>

extension of internal affairs, the envoy said, adding that the mood
within the overseas Chinese communities could be a reflection of the
current situation within Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Promising that his office will do its utmost to help promote
harmony among those within the overseas Chinese communities in the
United States who have different views and stances, the
representative also urged the members of these communities to have
open minds and tolerate and respect one another.</P>
      <P>He also called for leaders in all areas of Taiwan society to use
their influence to promote social harmony as this will also
facilitate unity within Chinese communities abroad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ANNOUNCES NEW FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun announced Sunday that
Legislator Chen Tan-sun of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has been appointed new minister of foreign affairs, replacing
Eugene Chien, who tendered his resignation last Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Yu described Chen, a U.S.-trained
scientist-turned-lawmaker, as an appropriate substitute for Chien,
and asked for support from everyone so that Chen can lead Taiwan's
diplomatic front to a broader horizon.</P>
      <P>Yu said that Chen demonstrated shrewd initiative and execution
power during his eight-year stint as magistrate of the southern
county of Tainan between 1993 and 2001. During the period, he was
ranked by public opinion polls as the top county chief, enjoying the
highest approval rating among all magistrates in Taiwan in five
years, Yu added.</P>
      <P>Yu said he and Chen share mixed feelings about Chen's climb of
the ladder of success -- from a student activist blacklisted by the
then-Kuomintang government to a popularly elected magistrate, a
legislator and now a foreign minister.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen, who was chairman of the Taiwanese Association
of America, the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations and the
Formosan Association for Public Affairs, said he has never harbored
thoughts of becoming foreign minister.</P>
      <P>Accepting his appointment, Chen lauded his predecessors,
including outgoing Chien, for having laid a solid foundation for him
to start with as a newcomer.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will not be a new broom after assuming his post and
will take advantage of the experiences of his predecessors. However,
he said he will use creativity and take new initiatives in reviewing
Taiwan's diplomatic ties with its 20-odd allies in efforts to broaden
the country's diplomatic horizon.</P>
      <P>There are many ways to do this, Chen went on, adding that the
best way for Taiwan is to enable the head of state to travel out of
the country to visit allies and friendly countries that maintain no
formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, 68, holder of a PhD from Purdue University in the United
States, also served with the Department of Commerce of the U.S.
federal government for 19 years before returning to Taiwan at the
beginning of the 90's.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Yu also praised Chien as a capable and
brilliant foreign minister who has given an outstanding performance,
particularly in Taiwan's efforts to establish a representative office
at the headquarters of the European Union and in President Chen
Shui-bian's landmark visit to the United States, with which the
Republic of China maintains no formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Chien offered to resign last Friday over the departure of
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairwoman Therese Shaheen -- the
top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"Ms. Shaheen was a good friend of Taiwan and a bridge between
Taiwan and the U.S. State Department, and we appreciate her
contribution to Taiwan-U.S. relations, " Chien told a news conference
last Friday.</P>
      <P>In Shaheen's resignation, Chien said the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs had been guilty of dereliction of duty and insufficient
supervision.</P>
      <P>Yu also said that excellent government officials with ability and
integrity will not be left idle and that new Cabinet assignments will
be announced after May 12, when the Cabinet will resign en masse
before the May 20 inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT DOLLAR EXPECTED TO HOVER BETWEEN 32.8-33.0 AGAINST GREENBACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar is expected to hover
around the 32.8-33.0 mark against the U.S. dollar this week after
experiencing a wave of fluctuations last week fueled largely by a
depreciating yen and a rising U.S. dollar, banking sources said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The local currency could continue to lose steam against other
major foreign currencies in the coming days due to a temporary halt
to the depreciating yen, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar ended at 32.940 against the greenback last
Friday, which represents a marked fall of NT$0.011 from the
week-earlier level of 32.929. The loss in value was mainly prompted
by the depreciating yen, which finished at 106.3 against the U.S.
dollar, and a lackluster local bourse.</P>
      <P>For the time being, the volatile political situation at home
caused by continuing protests over their presidential election defeat
by "pan-blue alliance" supporters will play a key role in the new
Taiwan dollar's short-term levels, they said, adding that the local
currency will not see dramatic fluctuations and foreign exchange
traders maintain their wait-and-see attitude.</P>

      <P>A group of students who have been staging
a sit-in protest at the Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall have
decided not to attend a meeting planned Monday by President Chen
Shui-bian with student leaders from across Taiwan in Taipei, group

      <P>Chen Cheng-feng said that the protesters have reached a final

which nearly 100 student leaders from universities and colleges from
around the country will exchange views on a broad range of issues

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC TRAVEL INDUSTRY SHOWS SIGNS OF RECOVERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the disputes over the March 20
presidential election still cast a shadow over the political
situation at home, the domestic travel industry has showed noticeable
signs of recovery, a tourism source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>At a time when both outbound and inbound travel remains affected
by the disputes, tourism at home has rebounded and is expected to
become more prosperous in the coming months, the source said.</P>
      <P>For instance, the occupancy rate at hotels in the eastern Hualien
area averaged lower than 50 percent in March, but the ratio has
increased to about 60 percent or 70 percent, the source said,
forecasting that travelers will pay more than 100 million visits to
tourist spots and resort facilities around Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>The source attributed the increased popularity of domestic travel
to an improved quality in both the software and hardware of many
tourism-related businesses. The Internet in particular, he pointed
out, provides effective and swift access for travelers looking for
services and information.</P>
      <P>In contrast, outbound and inbound travel has remained sluggish
since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the
first half of last year, according to the source.</P>
      <P>As a result of the lingering uncertainties over ties between
Taiwan and mainland China and the re-election of President Chen
Shui-bian, mainland-bound tourist travel might further decline, he
said. Businessmen now form the bulk of Taiwan travelers heading for
the mainland.</P>
      <P>At the same time, long-haul pleasure trips to the United States
and Europe also remain lackluster because of grave security concerns
among the public, while travel to destinations in Southeast Asian
countries has increasingly lost its appeal for Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>However, outbound travel to Northeast Asian countries, especially
Japan, has been on the rise, he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, inbound travel has been the most affected by a wave of
recession hitting the domestic tourism industry, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Many tourist groups from neighboring countries have put off or
canceled their trips to Taiwan, especially those from Japan, because
of various reasons, ranging from last year's SARS outbreaks to the
recent political unrest.</P>
      <P>To reverse this trend, the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications has launched prominent campaigns
overseas to lure foreign tourists to Taiwan, as part of the
government's agenda under "Challenge 2008, " a six-year national
development plan, the source said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CRITICIZES ORGANIZERS OF OPPOSITION-LED PROTEST IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun criticized the
organizers of an April 10 opposition-led mass protest in Taipei that
ended in violence Sunday, saying that they failed to control the
protesters.</P>
      <P>Yu also called on opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, who have
challenged the results of the March 20 presidential election, to
allow the election disputes to be settled through judicial channels.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong, who formed the opposition "pan blue alliance"
ticket, lost the presidential poll to President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu by a narrow margin of 29,518 votes out of
more than 13 million cast.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the organizers of the demonstration should be blamed
for the violence that left nearly 100 people injured, including
police officers, demonstrators and innocent bystanders.</P>
      <P>The organizers should have been capable of controlling the
participants in their rally, Yu said, adding that the "irresponsible
politicians" involved in the gathering should be condemned.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed the hope that Saturday's protest would be
the end of all "irrational activities" and that society will be
allowed to get back onto the normal tack.</P>
      <P>The protest, organized by the KMT-PFP alliance in front of the
Presidential Office, was to call for the establishment of a
legislative investigation task force to look into the March 19
shooting of Chen and Lu.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong led the crowd to Ketagalan Boulevard in front of
the Presidential Office to demand the formation of a special
committee under the Legislative Yuan to investigate the shooting.</P>
      <P>Lien claims that the shooting unfairly swayed the election in
Chen's favor, and insinuated that the shooting might have been staged
in order to gain sympathy votes.</P>
      <P>The rally of some 80,000 people, which began peacefully, turned
violent in the evening after the organizers of the event announced an
end to the gathering.</P>
      <P>Riot police clashed with angry protestors who tried to storm
barbed-wire barricades outside the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The violence ran through early Sunday morning, with riot police
using water cannons against protestors in efforts to disperse them
after they began throwing bottles, rocks and ball bearings, and
wielding flag poles and clubs.</P>
      <P>The police said that 96 people were injured in the clashes,
including 55 police officers.</P>
      <P>The police arrested 13 initiators of the violence, of whom six
were found to have criminal records. They also confiscated
slingshots, rocks, gas cans and handicraft knives.</P>
      <P>Responding to criticism by "pan blue alliance" supporters for the
police handling of the dispersal, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is a
KMT vice chairman, defended the actions as "necessary and according
to the law." However, he admitted that there is room for improvement
in police methods of handling violent protests.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Su Chia-chuan also affirmed the measures
and actions taken by the Taipei city government and the police in
dealing with the incident.</P>
      <P>It was the third large protest rally organized by the "pan-blue
alliance" since Lien lost to incumbent President Chen in the bitterly
fought March 20 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RARE HISTORICAL TAIWANESE POSTAGE STAMPS UNEARTHED IN ITALY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Rome, April 11 (CNA)
(By Tony Fang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two rare historical Taiwanese postage stamps
carrying the name "The Taiwan Republic" in Chinese issued in the late
Ching Dynasty were recently unearthed in Italy and have been obtained
by a Republic of China official posted in Rome, philatelic sources
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The "Sole Tiger, Taiwan Republic" stamps, believed to have been
issued in 1895 by a then-nascent republic government in Taiwan led by
self-styled militia leader Liu Yung-fu in Tainan, southern Taiwan,
are said to have appeared in a stamp-collecting exchange market in
Rome several weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The stamps, known by oriental stamp collectors as the "Sole
Tiger" stamps, are almost legendary, so seldom are they seen.</P>
      <P>The pair of stamps, each bearing a picture of a tiger and the
name of the Taiwan Republic in blue-green and light pink,
respectively, lay in the Rome market for weeks without arousing
attention from collectors as none of them knew Chinese, until a
Taiwan liaison official came across the stamps and snapped them up on
the spot.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwanese, surnamed Lin, the two stamps have
greater value to the people of Taiwan in terms of the island's
contemporary history than the stamps' market value.</P>
      <P>The two stamps can serve as a mirror on history through which the
people of Taiwan can look back at what happened on the island more
than 100 years ago and how the Han people, Hakka people, Japanese and
other foreigners fought among themselves for the island.</P>
      <P>According to historical archives, Liu Yung-fu (1837-1917) ,
originally an opium trader between the highlands on the border of
Vietnam and Canton, molded his followers into a well-disciplined band
skilled in martial arts and ruled an effectively independent fiefdom
on the Sino-French border in the 1860s and beyond.</P>
      <P>Although initially regarded as a rebel leader by the Ching court,
Liu parlayed his way into favor by fighting for the tribute kingdom
of Vietnam against the assertive French from 1873 and 1884. After
returning to Canton in 1885, Liu and his Black Flag militia proved a
problem for the Ching Court, which welcomed the opportunity to
dispatch Liu to Taiwan in 1895 with the lure of creating his own
tribute state there.</P>
      <P>Liu and his famed Black Flag troops arrived in southern Taiwan in
early 1895, only months before Taiwan yielded to Japan colonialism in
April that year.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Sino-Japanese War the Ching Court was forced
to cede Taiwan to Japan upon the signing of the Shimonoseki Treaty
April 17, 1895.</P>
      <P>Liu established the Taiwan Republic in Tainan on July 31, 1895,
shortly prior to the Japanese invasion. The Taiwan Post Office was
also established during that period, although it lasted for only 80
days. The "Sole Tiger" stamps are believed to have been issued during
that time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT SUFFERED GUNSHOT WOUNDS: FORENSICS EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned forensics expert invited to
Taiwan to help investigate the March 19 presidential election-eve
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
said Sunday that they did indeed suffer gunshot wounds.</P>
      <P>Dr. Henry Lee made the remarks at a press conference held at the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) prior to his departure after a
whirlwind two-day stay.</P>
      <P>He said that the two bullets collected at the shooting scene in
Tainan, southern Taiwan bore traces of clothing fibers and windshield
glass, which Lee said shows that they were the two bullets that hit
Chen and Lu. Chen was grazed on the lower abdomen, while Lu received
a scratch to her knee.</P>
      <P>At the press conference in which Lee summarized the forensic
evidence examination, he spoke on his team's progress with the
bullets and the shells, the clothing worn by the president and vice
president when the incident took place, an examination of their
wounds, the bullet hole in the windshield of the jeep in which they
were riding when they were shot, and a reconstruction of the
trajectories of the bullets.</P>
      <P>He said that judging from glass shards found in the jeep, the
bullets came from outside the jeep -- some skeptics believe
bodyguards riding in the jeep shot the president.</P>
      <P>Showing pictures of Chen's bloodstained clothing, he said that
there was little actual blood on the jacket and that some of the
large blotches on Chen's jacket and shirt were in fact a
petroleum-based ointment.</P>
      <P>Chen has said that after being shot, he thought he had been hurt
by one of the firecrackers that the crowd was igniting to greet him,
so he asked his bodyguards to help him apply ointment to the wound.</P>
      <P>Lee determined that the two bullets used in the shooting appear
to have been home-made in the same illegal workshop because they bear
similar marks left by machinery or tools.</P>
      <P>He suggested that CIB forensic personnel should trace the machine
marks, carefully examine the ingredients of the gunpowder used, and
conduct trial shooting on clothing and windshield glass. He also said
that the attacker used a semi-automatic weapon.</P>
      <P>He was unable to speculate as to whether the shooting was carried
out by a professional killer.</P>
      <P>Lee would not respond to questions of whether there is a
possibility that the shooting was staged to win last-minute sympathy
votes for Chen, saying only that he expressed his stance before
coming to Taiwan that he is "coming to examine the physical evidence
and not to conduct a criminal investigation." Before his arrival,
some had doubted his impartiality, pointing out his support of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>He added that the knowledge that many people in Taiwan are
pinning their hopes on his being able to shed more light on the case
has made the case "the most daunting in terms of difficulty and
pressure" since he started forensics work.</P>
      <P>Lee said he will further examine the evidence when he returns to
the United States.</P>
      <P>He was very positive about the performance of the CIB, saying
that it kept the evidence intact and that the "physical evidence
collected has not been contaminated or replaced."</P>
      <P>Lee, who was involved in such high-profile cases as the O.J.
Simpson murder trial, was invited by State Public Prosecutor General
Lu Ren-fa to help with the case.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival in Taiwan Friday morning, he went straight to
the Presidential Office to examine the president's wounds. He then
went to the CIB to listen to a briefing on the shooting and examine
the evidence, traveling later to the Chi Mei Medical Center in Tainan
County where the president sought medical treatment after shooting,
where he viewed X-rays of the president. He went to the scene of the
shooting in Tainan City later, where he determined a possible attack
location by using a laser pointer.</P>
      <P>He returned from Tainan to Taipei Saturday afternoon and went
straight to the vice president's residence to examine her wound.</P>
      <P>After a dinner hosted by the state public prosecutor general, he
continued to discuss the case with his team.</P>
      <P>Accompanying him were Charles P. Illsley, who developed an
alternative light source technology that is used to detect trace
amounts of substances that are invisible to the human eye, as well as
crime scene special photographer Calvin D. Ostler, legal consultant
Austin J. McGuigan, and his assistant Dr. Jacob S. Loke.</P>
      <P>Lee said that during his two-day hours in Taiwan, he had slept
for only 90 minutes and was "practically exhausted. "</P>

      <P>Singapore's real gross domestic product
(GDP) in the first quarter 2004 increased by 7.3 percent over the
same period in 2003, the government said Monday.</P>
      <P>This represents the fastest year-on-year growth since the fourth

      <P>Growth was broadbased, supported by improvements in both the
manufacturing and services industries, the Trade and Industry
Ministry said in a statement.</P>
      <P>On an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP rose by an
estimated 11 percent, maintaining the same strong growth momentum as
the previous quarter, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>"In light of the strong growth in the first quarter and the
favorable external environment, especially in the IT markets, the GDP
growth range for the whole year is likely to be higher than the
current forecast of between 3.5 percent and 5.5 percent," it said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a surprise move, the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) said Monday that it will tighten policy
by shifting from neutral to allow a modest and gradual appreciation
of the Singapore dollar.</P>
      <P>The central bank said it made the decision because of the strong
growth in the Singapore economy and rising inflation.</P>
      <P>Most economists had expected Singapore to continue with a neutral
monetary policy until the next policy statement in October.</P>
      <P>The MAS said it was shifting from a zero percent appreciation
path to a policy of modest and gradual appreciation of the Singapore
dollar, starting from the mid-point of the current policy band.
However, it added that the width of the band will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>The central bank also revised upward its inflation forecast for
this year from between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent to between 1.5
percent and 2 percent.</P>
      <P>"Consumer price inflation has trended up in recent months,
averaging 1.4 percent year-on-year for the January-February period
this year, compared to 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent in the last two
quarters of 2003, respectively," the MAS said.</P>
      <P>It said the increase largely reflected supply-side factors,
including the effects of global commodity-related price increases and
Singapore's goods-and-services tax hike in January 2004.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is
working on amendments to the Referendum Law to lay the groundwork for
a referendum on at least four issues along with the year-end
legislative elections, Vice Minister of the Interior Lee Chin-yung
said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a briefing for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party caucus
at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said the ministry has already laid down
10 proposals to improve the Referendum Law, which was enacted by the
Legislative Yuan in March.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI's proposal, the number of sponsors needed to
initiate a referendum should be cut, the criteria for an effective
referendum should be relaxed, the Legislative Yuan's right to start a
referendum should be abolished, and the Referendum Proposal Committee
-- which duplicates the function of the Central Election Committee --
should be scrapped.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the vice minister said, an article in the Referendum
Law that requires all Constitutional amendments be approved by the
people through referendum should be rescinded as it usurps the power
of the National Assembly, which is the only organization with the
authority to vote on amendments to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Since the DPP intends to put at least four issues to referendum
in conjunction with the year-end legislative elections, Lee said the
revision of the Referendum Law is high on the MOI's agenda. He
promised to submit a set of draft amendments to the Legislative Yuan
by mid-May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GUNS, AMMUNITION SEIZURES LAST YEAR SET RECORD HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Illegal guns and ammunition seized last
year set a four-year high, according to statistics released Monday by
the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB).</P>
      <P>The statistics were revealed as an investigation into the
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu on
the eve of the March 20 election still has made no major
breakthroughs and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" is demanding
that the "truth of the incident" -- which it claims swayed the
election in Chen's favor -- be uncovered.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that the CIB seized 2,643 illegal guns and
31,239 rounds of ammunition last year. Compared with the year-earlier
level, the number of gun seizures increased by 680, while the amount
of ammunition seized increased by 6,575 rounds.</P>
      <P>Of the guns, 1,363 were homemade, accounting for 51.57 percent of
the total, while police- and military-issue guns numbered 1,210.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that the number of homemade guns has hovered at
around 1,000 for the last four years, at 1,130 in 2000, 1,009 in
2001, 970 in 2002, and a surge to 1,363 last year.</P>
      <P>The more powerful police- and military-issue guns seized in 2000
numbered 703, with 621 seized in 2001, 883 seized in 2002 and a new
high of 1,210 seized last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL PARTIES MUST SET UP SPECIAL ACCOUNTS TO ACCEPT DONATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A political donations bill enacted March
31 means that all political parties, political groups and political
aspirants must set up special accounts and register with the Control
Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, to accept donations.</P>
      <P>So far, two political parties -- the opposition Kuomintang and
the New Party -- and nine legislators who intend to take part in the
year-end legislative elections have completed the registration
process.</P>
      <P>Under the bill, political figures are not allowed to accept
political donations during non-election periods and only those who
intend to run in an election can do so.</P>
      <P>The bill also stipulates the period in which donations can be
accepted, with the president allowed to accept political donations up
to one year before his term expires, legislators allowed to accept
donations up to 10 months before their term expires, and elected
mayors, city councilors, magistrates and county councilors allowed to
accept donations up to eight months before their term expires.</P>
      <P>According to the bill, if the political donation accepted is not
directly remitted into the special account, the recipients must
deposit the donation into the account within 15 days of receipt.</P>
      <P>The bill also stipulates that the maximum individual donation to
one political party or group per year cannot exceed NT$300,000
(US$8,982). Donations to different parties or groups cannot exceed an
accumulated NT$600,000 per year. Individual donations to individual
political aspirants cannot exceed NT$100,000 a year while individual
donations to more than one political aspirant cannot exceed
NT$200,000 per year in total.</P>
      <P>For-profit businesses can donate no more than NT$3 million to a
single political party or group annually, while donations to more
than one political parties or groups cannot exceed NT$6 million
annually in total. Corporate donations to more than one political
aspirant cannot exceed NT$2 million annually in total.</P>
      <P>If political parties or aspirants accept donation prior to
approval, they will face prison terms of no more than three years and
could also be fined between NT$200,000 and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Donations collected by political parties can be channeled to
political aspirants, the Control Yuan said, with no upper ceiling.</P>
      <P>Political donation bill was passed amid high-profile
revelations by several figures, including disgraced former Tuntex
Group Chairman Chen You-hao, that they made political donations to
various political figures, which sparked heated debate about the
practice.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
(HSBC) has adjusted upward its forecast on Taiwan's economic growth
to 6.5 percent for this year, HSBC officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to an HSBC report, the officials said, the adjustment
is based on Taiwan's rapid economic recovery, its solid manufacturing
sector and the diminishing impact of the March 20 presidential
election disputes on the confidence of businesses and consumers.</P>
      <P>The election disputes are apparently to be settled rationally,
the London-based international banking giant predicts in its report.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report says there are many indications that

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH OPPOSITION LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
willingness Monday to meet with two opposition leaders unconditionally
for exchanges of views on wide-ranging topics.</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation during an unprecedented meeting
with a group of university student leaders at the Red Chamber Theater
in Taipei's Hsimenting shopping district.</P>
      <P>"I'm willing to talk with Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong at any time of their
convenience. The venue can be outside the Presidential Office. We
need not set any preconditions. So long as we can sit down to talks,
we'll be able to narrow our gap and reduce misunderstanding and
misjudgment," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen and Vice President Annette Lu narrowly defeated the
Lien-Soong ticket to win a second four-year term in the bitterly
fought March 20 presidential election. Lien and Soong have
contested the result with sometimes violent street protests and two
lawsuits.</P>
      <P>Lien told the 130-plus student representatives from major
universities around the country that he is willing to meet with
groups from all walks of life before his May 20 inauguration for
another presidential term.</P>
      <P>"I'm more than willing to listen to different voices and iron out
differences with the opposition camp. I want to be the president of
all the 23 million Taiwan people, not of just the 6.47 million
voters who voted for me in the election," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In response to students' criticism that divisive rhetoric made by
Chen and other ruling party politicians during the presidential
campaign had hurt social harmony, Chen assured the students
that he and his party would reflect on their rhetoric and work to
narrow the widening gap between different political parties and
ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>"We do have a crisis and it's something the ruling party and I
need to review and to address, " Chen said. "We are all proud of
Taiwan, and we have no need to pigeon-hole people. We all love Taiwan
and we shouldn't try to paint someone black or red."</P>
      <P>As part of the efforts, Chen said he will push relevant
government agencies to organize a conference to discuss issues
regarding ethnic equality in education, language and cultural
development.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he believes that love and tolerance are the
best way to defuse ethnic divisions and promote social harmony and
internal unity.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a great country. The Republic of China is a big
family. If our country is divided, we can never stand up in the
international community," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also promised that he will push for the holding of a
national youth affairs conference after the May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen promised to adopt a low-tuition fee policy, offer
students a greater say in the formulation of education policy,
further ease unnecessary restrictions on campus freedoms, and allow
students to hold referendums on major education or school issues.</P>
      <P>Chen further promised to develop Taiwan into a major hub
for non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>"My administration will organize more international conferences
or activities and encourage young people to work as interns at major
NGOs," Chen said, adding that he hopes Taiwan can join the World
Health Organization in two years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROGRESS MADE IN RECOUNT MECHANISM PLANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Progress was made at a court hearing
Monday on the method for recounting the ballots cast in the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>After two and a half hours of negotiations before the Taiwan High
Court, attorneys representing the two election tickets agreed in the
lawsuit concerning the validity of the presidential election that the
votes to be re-examined should include all valid votes for both
tickets, all invalid ballots, all unused blank ballots and the result
reports from each polling station.</P>
      <P>The lists of qualified voters and lists of overseas voters who
returned to Taiwan to cast ballots will only be examined as a
formality and will not affect the re-count. However, if there is any
obvious evidence of irregularities in the lists, representatives of
both sides can ask the court for a further investigation afterward.</P>
      <P>The court insisted that the people appointed by the respective
parties in the lawsuit to supervise the re-count must be attorneys or
probation attorneys in practice, and asked both sides to present a
list of attorneys they can retain before Friday.</P>
      <P>Given there are more than 13 million ballots cast in more than
10,000 polling stations around the country, lawyers for both sides
admitted they will have problems retaining enough attorneys so
quickly.</P>
      <P>Even if both sides come up with lists of attorneys, the recount
is not expected to begin until mid-May, according to an anonymous
judiciary official close to the lawsuit.</P>
      <P>The retained attorneys, the official said, should first join
clerks and bailiffs from district courts around the island for
training in Taipei to familiarize themselves with the rules for
judging the validity of votes and the practices in the recount.</P>
      <P>After the training, the attorneys will team up with court clerks
and bailiffs to conduct the recount, the judicial official went on.</P>
      <P>The lawsuit was brought by the defeated presidential candidate,
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, and his running mate,
People First Party Chairman James Soong, after they lost by a slim
margin to the incumbent President Chen Shui-bian and his running
mate, Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Citing what they claim to be irregularities in the election, Lien
and Soong challenged the fairness of the election and demanded a
recount.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) , which between them fielded a joint ticket in the
March 20 presidential election, will not campaign jointly in the
year-end legislative elections, a KMT lawmaker said Monday.</P>

candidates they will name in every constituency and campaign on
their own, said Legislator Shyu Jong-Shyong.</P>

      <P>He made the comment after a meeting between Wang Jin-pyng,
president of the Legislative Yuan and a vice chairman of the
Kuomintang, and a group of KMT lawmakers. Shyu said he recommended
during the meeting that the KMT and PFP leaders should admit that
they bungled the March 20 presidential election and should do away
with an existing six-man policy-making group composed of members of
both parties.</P>
      <P>Wang was quoted as telling the KMT lawmakers that KMT Chairman

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION DISPUTES RELATED TO FLAWED MEDIA REPORTING: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed Monday
that the disputes over his re-election victory are related to flawed
reporting by some electronic news media during the vote-counting
procedure.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Columbia University
President Lee C. Bollinger, who is currently on a speaking tour of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to offering his congratulations on Columbia's 250th
founding university, Chen exchanged views with Bollinger on freedom
of the press and media responsibility. Bollinger will deliver a
speech on challenges and opportunities for news media in the era of
globalization during his Taipei visit.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guest that Taiwan still has much to learn in terms
of upgrading the news media's sense of moral responsibility while
defending press freedom.</P>
      <P>Taking the disputed March 20 presidential election as an example,
Chen said some cable television stations reported too hastily on vote
tabulation in order to attract audiences amid the fierce ratings
competition.</P>
      <P>"Some of them didn't base their reports on the ballots actually
tallied by the Central Election Commission (CEC) and instead based
their reports on the results of exit polls they conducted. Because
those exit polls were not correct, their vote-counting reports failed
to reflect the CEC's actual tabulation, thus misleading the
audience and opposition politicians," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he hopes Columbia will continue its cooperative
research projects to with local academic bodies, including those
aimed at upgrading media professionalism and moral responsibility.</P>
      <P>Chen narrowly defeated his sole challenger, opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan, in the March 20 election -- a result that Lien
has contested with two lawsuits while his supporters have resorted to
sometimes violent street protests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SCHOLARS CALL FOR NEW CROSS-STRAIT FRAMEWORK TO AVOID CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 12 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two noted American scholars have urged
both sides of the Taiwan Strait to establish a new long-term stable
cross-strait framework to avoid conflict.</P>
      <P>David Lampton, director of China studies at the Johns Hopkins
School of Advanced International Studies, and Kenneth Lieberthal,
professor of political science at the University of Michigan, made
the appeal in an article titled "Heading off the Next War" that
appeared in the Washington Post Monday.</P>
      <P>The article said that President Chen Shui-bian's March 20
re-election highlights the fact that the framework that has
buttressed peace in the Taiwan Strait for decades is disintegrating
and that changes in Taiwan, as well as some of Beijing's
counterproductive behavior, are undermining its foundations.</P>
      <P>"Unless an improved framework is adopted soon, war across the
strait will become increasingly probable, with the United States
likely to be drawn into it, " the article claimed. "No matter who
would `win' such a conflict, the consequences for China, Taiwan,
America and Northeast Asia would be dire," it continued.</P>
      <P>"The conundrum is stark, " the article said, noting that Taiwan
sees itself as an independent sovereign country, while the mainland
has staked the legitimacy of its regime on not allowing Taiwan
juridicial stature as a sovereign country. And the U.S. has for more
than three decades been committed to a "one China" policy, combined
with a threat to become militarily involved if Beijing uses force to
effect a resolution of cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney will visit the mainland
Tuesday, the article noted, and he is expected to "follow the
traditional American path of recommending cross-strait dialogue and
warning of severe consequences should military conflict flare."</P>
      <P>The article urged Cheney to also "signal to both Beijing and
Taipei that America is prepared for new thinking in the search for
peace and growth in the region."</P>
      <P>According to the article, the reality is that "there is no final
resolution to cross-strait issues that the two sides are likely to
reach peacefully for decades."</P>
      <P>The major effort, it said, should shift to "establishing a stable
framework across the strait for a long period -- counted not in years
but in decades." For such a framework to be effective, all sides must
agree on its fundamentals and its minimum duration, and they must
seek the support of the international community in reinforcing it.</P>
      <P>Under such an arrangement, Taiwan could continue to assert its
independent sovereign status, but would not take the additional step
of turning de facto independence into de jure independence.</P>
      <P>The mainland could continue to assert that there is only one
China of which Taiwan is a part, but it would have to give up its
threat to use force to change Taiwan's status, it said.</P>
      <P>"On this basis, Beijing and Taipei would agree on terms for
expanded international space for Taiwan, including the island's
involvement in global and regional international organizations, " the
article said.</P>
      <P>Beijing and Taipei would also agree to engage in
"confidence-building measures" to reduce concerns about potential
conflict, and the United States and others would commit to "play
appropriate supporting roles if tensions across the strait diminish"
that would include reducing military sales to Taiwan, it said.</P>
      <P>The United States, Japan and the European Union would also
guarantee that "they will not recognize an independent Taiwan during
the framework period and that all would regard Beijing's unprovoked
use of force against Taiwan as a matter of the gravest immediate
concern," the article went on.</P>
      <P>However, the article admitted that even a "modest framework will
be very difficult to establish, " although it called for "courageous
initiatives" from leaders in Beijing, Taipei and Washington and
"considerable diplomatic skills" to put it into place.</P>
      <P>The article concluded by saying that the "foreseeable
alternatives are too destructive for responsible leaders to avoid
taking a serious look -- and soon-- at ways to get things off a very
dangerous track."</P>

      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at the KMT headquarters, Lien
said that the election has not yet ended and that investigators are
still struggling to dig out the facts surrounding various key issues
that resulted in what Lien claims was "an unfair election."</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman said that he will continue working toward
clarification and that he will be wholly accountable for the final
election result.</P>
      <P>Lien promised to push for a transfer of power within the KMT
regardless of the eventual outcome and said that he actually
initiated a move in this direction before the presidential election.
He added that the legislative elections in December will provide a
good chance for the party to undergo the power transfer.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, he went on, the KMT is poised to launch
adjustments to trim its structure across the board while seeking to
recruit new blood.</P>
      <P>Turning to the question of whether the KMT is facing an ideology
rift, Lien claimed that such a problem does not exit in the party, as
those who betrayed the party left it four years ago.</P>
      <P>Describing the KMT as the major driving force behind Taiwan's
progress, stability and prosperity over the past 50 years, he said
that the KMT has fully devoted its energy to building Taiwan for the
sake of its people's well-being.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng echoed Lien's remarks by
making clear his determination to also resign to take responsibility.
Lin vowed that he will immediately step down from his post as long as
the truth is discovered.</P>
      <P>Lien and his running mate, People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong, claim that the election was unfair and fraudulent and
immediately lodged two lawsuits to nullify the election.</P>
      <P>Supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" formed by the
KMT, PFP and the New Party have staged a series of sometimes violent
mass rallies in Taipei to protest the disputed election.</P>
      <P>They are demanding a vote recount, to which President Chen
Shui-bian has already agreed, and a legislative investigation into
the election-eve shooting of Chen, which they claim unfairly swayed
the poll in Chen's favor.</P>
      <P>Lien lost to Chen by a very slim margin of 29,518 votes out of
more than 13 million ballots cast in the bitterly contested
presidential poll.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHRISTIAN GROUPS TO PRAY FOR ETHNIC HARMONY FOR 50 DAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major Christian churches in Taipei
launched a prayer drive Monday in an effort to promote social harmony
in the wake of the bitterly fought March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Christians from various churches gathered at a
Presbyterian church adjacent to the Legislative Yuan in downtown
Taipei early in the morning to pray for peace and harmony in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The one-hour prayer meeting was the first of a series of similar
services to be held at the church over the coming 50 days.</P>
      <P>During the fiery and bruising presidential campaign, voters were
divided over their political preferences and even Christian churches
were divided into pro-"pan-blue alliance" and pro-"pan-green camp"
groups.</P>
      <P>The political divisions became even more serious after incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian narrowly defeated the "pan-blue alliance"
presidential candidate, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan. Lien has
contested the election result with sometimes violent street protests
and two lawsuits.</P>
      <P>Rev. Chou Lien-hua took the initiative to invite major churches
in Taipei to hold a joint prayer service at the Chinan Presbyterian
Church each morning until May 30 with a view to promoting social
harmony and internal unity.</P>
      <P>"We must pray for this piece of land because our country is
divided after the election. Not only are offices and families divided
over politics, even Christian churches have also been divided, " Chou
said at the prayer gathering. "I earnestly hope that this series of
prayer meetings can help mend political and ethnic divisions."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Pastor Lee Yao-pin said Taiwan is
so small that it cannot afford to see divisions over political,
ethnic and regional differences.</P>
      <P>"We must learn to pray for the political party or individual
politicians we hate most in line with the biblical teaching of
'praying for your foes,'" Lee said.</P>
      <P>Except for a small group of aboriginal tribes, most of Taiwan's
23 million people are ethnic Chinese, with the population divided
into two sub-ethnic groups: the "mainlanders" -- those whose families
fled to Taiwan when the Chinese communists took over the mainland in
1949 -- and the "native Taiwanese" -- whose ancestors began arriving
in Taiwan in the 17th Century or earlier.</P>
      <P>The mainlanders, who make up about 15 percent of the population,
largely support the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party, and their support base is in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The native Taiwanese control the south and they tend to favor
President Chen's Democratic Progressive Party and the smaller Taiwan
Solidarity Union, which jointly form the "pan-green camp."</P>
      <P>The mainlanders traditionally support eventual unification with
mainland China, while the native Taiwanese lean more toward formal
independence.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Bush Says Brief on Al
Qaeda Threat Was Not Specific.

President Bush said on Sunday that the intelligence briefing he
received on Al Qaeda one month before the Sept. 11 strike contained
no specific "indication of a terrorist attack" on American soil. He
also defended the adequacy of his response to the warnings that
terrorists in the United States might be planning hijackings.

Mr. Bush, in his first public remarks since the release of his
top-secret briefing Saturday evening, played down the urgency of the
information he was given at his ranch 36 days before terrorists flew
airplanes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in
Pennsylvania. In doing so, Mr. Bush echoed the testimony last week by
his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, before the
commission investigating the attacks, which had pushed for the
release of the briefing.

Wall Street Journal: Cease-Fire Holds in Fallujah, As Talks
Continue.

Gunfire was largely silenced Monday in the second day of a truce
in Fallujah, where doctors said 600 Iraqis, including many civilians,
were killed in the past week's U.S. Marine siege of Sunni insurgents.
In the south, the military suggested it is open to a negotiated
solution in its showdown with a radical Shiite cleric.

But additional U.S. forces have been maneuvering into place
around Fallujah, and the military has warned it will launch an
all-out assault on the city if talks there between pro-U.S. Iraqi
politicians and city officials -- which were continuing Monday --
fall through.</TEXT>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan
vowed Monday that he will do his best to improve social order while
serving as head of the ministry.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan, with lawmakers raising questions surrounding the
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian on the eve of the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>It was Su's debut at the legislature after taking over the post
from his predecessor, Yu Chen-hsien, last Friday. Yu offered to
resign to assume responsibility for the shooting.</P>
      <P>Stressing that law and order play a pivotal role in a country's
economic development, the new interior minister made it clear that
maintaining good order in society will be the centerpiece of the
agenda of his ministry and pledged that he would rather step down
should no progress be made in this field.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from lawmakers of opposition parties
about the attack on Chen, Su said that no one wants to see any action
that could endanger the life of the president.</P>
      <P>As the nation's top chief in home affairs, Su said he will ask
the president and vice president not to appear together in public
activities.</P>
      <P>President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were injured in an
assassination attempt on March 19 during a campaign rally in southern
Tainan City. The two were standing together in an open-top jeep
waving to supporters along the road when they were hit by two
bullets. One grazed Chen's lower abdomen and the other hit Lu's right
knee.</P>
      <P>The shooting was widely viewed by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" as an orchestrated drama to win sympathy votes for Chen.
The president succeeded in his re-election bid by winning over the
"pan-blue alliance" candidate, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, in the
presidential election by a margin of only 0.228 percent.</P>
      <P>The narrow margin prompted the opposition camp to demand a vote
recount and the establishment of an independent "truth committee"
under the Legislative Yuan to investigate the shooting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO ADDRESS ETHNIC DIVISION ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he
and his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will reflect on
their presidential campaign strategy and consider how to narrow
political and ethnic divisions.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge during an unprecedented meeting with a group
of university student leaders at the Red Chamber Theater in Taipei's
Hsimenting shopping district.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, some students claimed that divisive rhetoric made
by Chen and other DPP politicians during the presidential campaign
had hurt social harmony.</P>
      <P>During the presidential campaign, Chen often assured voters that
he wouldn't cave in to Beijing, and he often questioned his sole
challenger Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's willingness to stand
up to Beijing. Some observers feel that political and ethnic
divisions have become even more serious after Taiwan-born Chen
narrowly defeated mainland China-born Lien.</P>
      <P>President Chen assured the students that he and his party would
reflect on their rhetoric and work to narrow the widening gap between
different political parties and ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>"We do have a crisis and it's something the ruling party and I
need to review and to address, " Chen said. "We are all proud of
Taiwan, and we have no need to pigeon-hole people. We all love Taiwan
and we shouldn't try to paint someone black or red."</P>
      <P>As part of the efforts, Chen said he will push relevant
government agencies to organize a conference to discuss issues
regarding ethnic equality in education, language and cultural
development.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he believes that love and tolerance are the
best way to defuse ethnic divisions and promote social harmony and
internal unity.</P>
      <P>Except for a small group of aboriginal tribes, most of Taiwan's
23 million people are ethnic Chinese. But the population can be
divided into two sub-ethnic groups: the "mainlanders" whose families
fled to Taiwan when the Chinese Communists took over the mainland in
1949, and the "native Taiwanese" whose ancestors began arriving the
island in the 17th century or earlier.</P>
      <P>The mainlanders, about 15 percent of the population, have largely
supported the opposition KMT and its ally People First Party, and
their support base is in northern Taiwan. The native Taiwanese

with mainland China, while the native Taiwanese lean more toward

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said
Monday that it has proposed a package of revisions to the Public
Functionary Assets Disclosure Law that will require the president and
other senior officials to put their assets into blind trust.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Chen Chien-ming said that before the March 20
presidential election, both President Chen Shui-bian and the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate, Kuomintang
Lien Chan, had publicly supported the proposal that political
appointees be required to put their family assets into trust.</P>
      <P>"Now that the election is over, we should take concrete steps to
substantiate the proposal, " said Chen Chien-ming, who concurrently
serves as party whip of the TSU, a political ally of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>According to the TSU-drafted revision package, the president,
vice president, as well as presidents of the five yuans, and other
senior political appointees should put their family assets into blind
trust. The assets to be put into trust cover those owned by the
public functionaries themselves as well as those owned by their
spouses and underage children.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming said the TSU-drafted bill doesn't require elected
representatives, including legislators, to put their assets into
trust because elected representatives do not enjoy pension benefits.</P>
      <P>He said the TSU hopes the Legislative Yuan's steering committee
can discuss the draft revision bill Tuesday so that the bill can be
included into the legislative agenda for the current session.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the presidential election, first lady Wu
Shu-chen's stock trading activities came under fire. President Chen
acknowledged that even though Taiwan has not enacted a law to ban the
first lady from trading stocks, such activities were inappropriate.
He made a public apology for his wife's stock trading activities and
promised to put his family assets into blind trust after the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen won re-election by a slim margin 0f 29,518 votes -- a result
his opponent has contested with street protests and two lawsuits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN MEETS WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS FOR DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met with about
130 college and university students Monday for dialogue, marking the
first meeting of its kind in Chen's nearly four years as president.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although he is not bound by law to take part in
interpellation sessions at the Legislative Yuan, he is sincerely
willing to be questioned by the students.</P>
      <P>"Today, I am here to hear your voices and even your criticism, "
Chen said to the students from 44 student groups in various colleges
and universities around the country.</P>
      <P>"You don't have to worry that my purpose is to gain your favor or
win your hearts, " he told the students. "Instead, I will touch my
own heart and be sincere in listening to you."</P>
      <P>He said the age difference between himself and the students is
not a problem in terms of understanding each other. "What is
important is people's attitude," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen told the students he thinks they are much "taller" than a
lot of the politicians, many of whom he said have displayed below
standard performances.</P>
      <P>The president also said later that he found the students he met
with to be very eloquent and to have strong arguments. He said these
students were by no means below those students who have continued
their sit-in in front of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and who turned
down his invitation to join Monday's dialogue.</P>
      <P>The student protesters had turned down President Chen's
invitation to join Monday's meeting on the grounds that the arranged
meeting "would blur the focus of their protest and their cause."</P>
      <P>The two major demands of the student protesters are that
political leaders from the two rival camps that contested the March
20 presidential election should apologize to the people for causing
political chaos and social restlessness, and that an independent
committee should be established to conduct an investigation into the
March 19 election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Monday's meeting between Chen and the students from 44 student
groups around the island was organized by the Presidential Office as
a way of increasing mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Prior to the meeting, some 10 student groups jointly released a
statement in which they said that the students would not be used by
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" as a tool and that they would not
try to gain favor with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
either.</P>
      <P>The four-point announcement stated that student activities are
beyond political boundaries, that student movements are
self-motivated, that politicians creating havoc in the country should
be forced to step down, and that a just and fair society should be
built in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also taking part in Monday's meeting were Education Minister
Huang Jung-tsun, Interior Minister Su Chia-chuan, National Youth
Commission Chairwoman Lin Fang-mei and Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Lo Wen-chia.</P>

      <P>Chiou Yi-jen, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT WANTS RIOTERS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE QUICKLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged law
enforcement authorities Tuesday to bring to justice quickly the
rioters who clashed with police April 10 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>After being briefed on the clashes by newly appointed Minister of
the Interior Su Jia-chyuan in a meeting of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) Central Standing Committee, Chen, who is
also DPP chairman, said the law enforcement authorities should
prosecute those responsible to the fullest extent of the law to show
the government's determination to maintain stability and order.</P>
      <P>Chen said his party regrets that some 100 people -- about half of
them policemen -- were injured in the nearly twelve-hour
confrontation between supporters of the opposition Kuomintang and
People First Party and police in the square in front of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He expressed gratitude to the policemen who stopped the rioters
from bursting into the Presidential Office and drove them away early
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen said he empathized with the feelings of the KMT/PFP
"pan-blue alliance" followers after their joint ticket in the
presidential election was defeated, and he defended their right to
expression.</P>
      <P>"However, our tolerance toward different opinions and our
receptiveness to criticism should not be misunderstood. We will not
appease rumormongers given to stirring up confrontation and dividing
the society," Chen said, adding that "freedom of speech is protected
by law but is not above the law."</P>
      <P>"The DPP prefers to refer all questions about the March 20
presidential election to the judiciary and will cooperate with
investigators looking into the disputes. We will respect the results
of the investigation."</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" has organized rallies to protest what
they call the "unfairness" of the presidential election almost every
weekend since March 20. Their followers have refused to disperse
after the rallies ended and instead, have confronted police in
fruitless attempts to storm the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The April 10 rally was the latest and most violent, in which 13
people were arrested.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a related story, Chen Hung-ta, a spokesman for the
Public Prosecutors' Office at the Taipei District Court, said
prosecutors at his office are looking into the riots that have
followed every pan blue alliance rally since March 20.</P>
      <P>Chen said there are always about 20 prosecutors posted to the
police command center to monitor the situation whenever the KMT and
PFP have called in their supporters for rallies.</P>
      <P>"Whoever led the riots will be held to account regardless of
their status or political affiliation," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT BLASTS CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday
that it was a miracle she survived her March 19 shooting, but she
added that she deplores the conspiracy theories that the unsolved
attack has spawned.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while meeting with a group of international
affairs and defense strategy scholars from Singapore. It was Lu's
first meeting with foreign guests since the election-eve shooting.</P>
      <P>"What I regret most is not the shooting itself but the suspicions
raised by some people. I thus suffered a second blow, " Lu told her
guests.</P>
      <P>Lu and President Chen Shui-bian were shot while they were
parading in a motorcade in the southern city of Tainan on the last
day of campaigning ahead of the March 20 presidential election. One
bullet grazed Chen's stomach and another hit Lu's right knee. No
suspects have been arrested and no solid leads have been discovered.</P>
      <P>Lu said "various miracles" enabled her to survive with only a
minor injury when the bullet hit her knee after piercing the
windshield of the open-top jeep she was riding in.</P>
      <P>The Chen-Lu ticket won the election by a narrow margin and the
defeated ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party Chairman James Soong has insinuated that the president might
have staged or faked the shooting to win sympathy votes. Lien has
contested the results with sometimes violent street protests and two
lawsuits, even though he has so far provided little evidence to back
up his "unfair election" allegations. Lien has demanded that what he
calls an "independent" commission be created under the Legislative
Yuan to investigate the shooting.</P>
      <P>After examination of the physical evidence and a painstaking
recreation of the crime scene, a team of U.S. experts headed by
renowned forensics scientist Dr. Henry Lee have said the wounds were
not self-inflicted and were caused by bullets rather than knives, as
some conspiracy theorists have speculated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan said Tuesday that it will
craft a mechanism to audit whether any domestic political party,
political group or individual political aspirants have accepted
political contributions from abroad.</P>
      <P>According to the newly enacted Political Contributions Law,
political parties, political groups and individual political
aspirants are prohibited from accepting financial contributions from
citizens, organizations and institutions in foreign countries,
including mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. Infraction of this ban
is liable to a maximum five-year prison term.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yu-nan, a Control Yuan department chief in charge of public
functionary assets declarations, said the Control Yuan -- the
nation's supreme watchdog body -- will join forces with the Ministry
of the Interior to establish an auditing mechanism and work out audit
rules to prevent donation recipients from unwittingly breaking the
ban.</P>
      <P>Hsieh suggested that local political parties, political groups or
individual hopefuls intending to run for public office hand over any
donations from unidentified sources to the national coffers to avoid
breaking the Political Contributions Law.</P>
      <P>Under the law, the amount of political donations from
unidentified sources should not exceed 10 percent of the total
declared amount. Recipients of unlawful donations must hand over the
funds to relevant administrative agencies within two months.</P>
      <P>The new law also stipulates that political parties, political
groups and individual political aspirants must set up special bank
accounts for political donations and must register them with the
Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party, the main opposition
Kuomintang and the opposition New Party, as well as some 20
legislators who intend to seek re-election in the year-end
legislative elections have completed the registration process.</P>
      <P>According to the law, individual politicians are not allowed to
accept political contributions during non-election periods and only
those who intend to run in an election can do so.</P>
      <P>The law also prescribes the period in which donations can be
accepted, with the president allowed to accept political donations up
to one year before his term expires, legislators allowed to accept
donations up to 10 months before their term expires, and elected
mayors, city councilors, magistrates and county councilors allowed to
accept donations up to eight months before their term expires.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved various law
amendments Tuesday designed to enhance the scope of products that can
take advantage of tax-free and tax-rebate treatment.</P>
      <P>The revisions to the Customs Duties Law were made in conjunction

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui is expected
to testify in court Wednesday in the trial of Hsu Ping-chiang, a
former chief accountant of the National Security Bureau (NSB).</P>
      <P>Lee has been summoned as a witness and is expected to testify
behind closed doors at the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>Lee is the last of a series high-profile witness, including
former Foreign Minister Jason Hu and former NSB Director Ting

      <P>Hsu stands accused of diverting NT$250 million (US$10.5 million)
from a secret slush fund managed by the NSB to Taiwan Research
Institute (TRI) President Liu Tai-ying in 1999. According to the
charges against him, Liu used some of the money to finance the
institute and the rest to line his own pockets.</P>
      <P>The money was paid by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the NSB
as reimbursement for a political donation made in 1994 by
then-President Lee Teng-hui to South Africa's ruling African National
Congress using the secret NSB slush fund.</P>
      <P>Hsu argued that he acted on the orders of late NSB Director Yin
Tsung-wen and that Yin was basically acting on Lee's instructions.</P>
      <P>As president at the time, Lee was also chairman of the National

    <TEXT>New York Times: Bush Sees Need for
Reorganizing U.S. Intelligence.

President Bush said Monday that "now may be a time to revamp and
reform our intelligence services, " opening the way for consideration
of changes at the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and other agencies.

Expanding the powers of the director of central intelligence and
establishing a domestic intelligence agency like the MI5 in Britain
are among ideas now circulating in Washington as the independent
commission looking into the attacks holds hearings and prepares to
make its own recommendations.

The president's comments are an indication that he is turning
attention to intelligence matters at a moment when the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are under
intense criticism.

Wall Street Journal: Gunmen Attack U.S. Convoy Heading to Najaf,
Killing 1 Soldier.

Gunmen attacked a large convoy of U.S. troops heading toward
Najaf with gunfire and roadside bombs, killing one soldier and
wounding two others and an American civilian contractor, officers in
the convoy said Tuesday.

A U.S. Apache helicopter, meanwhile, was burning on the ground
outside Fallujah, and witnesses said it had been hit by a rocket from
the ground.

Coalition forces also came under mortar attack and fought
militiamen off at a water distillation plant in Najaf.

Senior U.S. military officials in Iraq have asked for more troops
to battle insurgents, who are increasingly targeting aid workers and

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO SET UP SPECIAL ACCOUNT TO ACCEPT POLITICAL DONATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) applied Tuesday to the Control Yuan, the nation's highest
watchdog body, to set up a special bank account in which to deposit
political donations.</P>
      <P>The move follows the March 31 implementation of a political
donations bill that requires all political parties, political groups
and political aspirants to receive political donation only through
the special accounts and to obtain prior approval to open the
accounts from the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang Hung-ming, the DPP's cashier, said that with the new bill,
soliciting donations will be made more difficult.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that under the new bill, individuals can make a
maximum donation to one political party or group of NT$300,000
(US$8,982) per year, while corporate donations cannot exceed NT$3
million per year.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that the new bill makes it more difficult for
parties to get donations, as some individuals or corporations will
not like to be seen as supporters of the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Under the new bill, all revenues other than party fees are
counted as political donations.</P>
      <P>The bill stipulates that political parties can receive political
donations at any time, but individual political aspirants can only
receive donations during election periods.</P>
      <P>Seven legislators from the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU), a DPP ally, also registered with the Control Yuan that day to
set up a special donations account.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Interior Minister Lee Chin-yung said that
political aspirants cannot receive political donations from companies
run or financed by political parties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENTREPRENEUR PROMISES US$3.03 MILLION TO HELP PAY FOR VOTE RECOUNT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A successful Taiwan entrepreneur based in
the United States has said that he would donate NT$100 million
(US$3.03 million) to help pay for the recount of the March 20
presidential election votes.</P>
      <P>The two contestants of the election have agreed to a vote
recount, although they still differ on who should pay the expenses,
with the ruling "pan-green camp" saying that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance," who asked for the recount, should foot the bill, while the
"pan-blue alliance" wants the government to pay.</P>
      <P>David Sun, co-founder of Kingston Technology Corp., one of the
largest memory module manufacturers in the world, said through his
friend, Hsu Cheng-ki, that he hopes to end the post-election turmoil
quickly by speeding up the recount so that peace and order can return
to Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Although Sun has said that his political leanings favor the
"pan-blue alliance, " his intention to donate the money is
non-political.</P>
      <P>Sun was quoted as telling Hsu that he worried about the continued
disturbances in post-election Taiwan. When he saw Taiwan protesters
clashing with police April 10 on TV at his Los Angles home, he was
heartbroken and couldn't help but want to do something for the
country.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, Sun wants to help speed the vote tallying so
that the rivalry between the ruling and opposition parties can end
quickly.</P>
      <P>Sun reportedly told Hsu that Taiwan was still in turmoil after
the election, and that the unstable political situation will "affect
Taiwan's international image and damage the confidence of foreign
investors, and as an ordinary citizen who cares for Taiwan's future
economic prosperity" he's willing to make the donation.</P>
      <P>Scott Chen, vice president of Kingston Technology's Asia Pacific
business division, said Tuesday at the company's Taiwan branch in the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, that he was "not surprised by
Sun's move."</P>
      <P>Chen said that some of the company's staff also said that they
would like to chip in to pay for the recount.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Sun will donate the money in his own capacity, and
the money will not be to publicize the company or to save on taxes.</P>
      <P>Chen said the money will be turned over to an "impartial third
party," as Sun's mother is a Christian, the company will contact the
Presbyterian Church to handle the money.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, which is now
convening a four-day conference in Changhua, central Taiwan, said
the church has yet to receive formal notification about the donation.</P>
      <P>Lin Chung-cheng, a church official, said that as far as he
understands, the donation is not for any specific political party or
organization, but was given out of a hope that Taiwan people can put
aside their divisions and hatred after the election and move forward
in reconciliation.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian won by a small margin of 29,518 votes out
of the more than 13 million cast against his rival, Lien Chan of the
"pan-blue alliance." But Lien has yet to concede defeat because of
what he said was an "unfair election" that was marred by voting
irregularities and an election-eve shooting which the supporters of
the "pan-blue alliance" believe swayed the election to Chen's favor
in the bitterly contested election.</P>
      <P>Sun and his co-founder, John Tu, became millionaires when they
sold a large chunk of their memory chip-making company in 1996 and
made headlines worldwide when they decided to share US$100 million of
the windfall with workers, roughly at 450 at the time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOURIST ARRIVALS FALL FAR BELOW TARGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of tourist arrivals fell far
below the projected target in the first quarter of this year because
of political factors, travel sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The government has designated 2004 as the "Year of Tourism" for
Taiwan with an aim of attracting at least 3.2 million tourists.
However, the number of tourist arrivals in the first quarter declined
significantly from the year-earlier level. Tourism Bureau Director Su
Cheng-tien has admitted that it's a very difficult task to realize
the goal of attracting 3.2 million tourists this year.</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau tallies, tourist arrivals numbered
212,854 in January and 221,020 in February, down 10.58 percent and
14.98 percent, respectively, from the same months of last year.</P>
      <P>In March 2003, the number of tourist arrivals reached 258,128.
This year's figure has yet to be formally tallied, but a preliminary
tabulation also showed a downward trend.</P>
      <P>Japan has traditionally been a main source of tourists to Taiwan,
but the number of Japanese visitors declined by more than 30 percent
in the first two months of this year.</P>
      <P>Japanese citizens made 53,350 visits and 61,006 visits to Taiwan
in January and February, respectively, marking a 38 percent and 32
percent drop from the year-earlier levels.</P>
      <P>Tourist industry sources said the sometimes violent protest
rallies in front of the Presidential Office organized by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) after the March 20 presidential election have
discouraged Japanese citizens from making sightseeing trips to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the period from April 29 through May 3 is traditionally known
as a "golden week" for overseas pleasure trips for Japanese people,
many local travel agencies originally expected to receive a large
numbers of tour groups from Japan.</P>
      <P>However, the sources said, Japanese news media's prominent
coverage of recent "pan-blue alliance" street rallies in protest
against what it called the "unfair" presidential election has
prompted many Japanese tour groups to cancel their Taiwan-bound
travel plans.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, 12 travel agencies and tourist hotels
have sent a joint petition to Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou asking him
not to approve "pan-blue alliance" applications for street rallies in
the city any more for the sake of "rescuing" Taiwan's battered
tourist industry. Duplicate copies of the petition letter were also
sent to the Legislative Yuan and headquarters of the KMT, the PFP and
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate KMT Chairman Lien
Chan narrowly lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian in the
bitterly fought March 20 presidential election. Lien has since
contested Chen's re-election victory with street protests and two
lawsuits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PINGPU ETHNIC GROUPS SUMMIT SCHEDULED TO BE HELD IN TAINAN IN OCTOBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan County,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Anthropologists have said that at
least one-third of Taiwan's population have the blood of "Pingpu"
groups -- aboriginal people who lived in low-lying areas around the
island, many of whom intermarried with Han Chinese.</P>
      <P>Just like their languages and cultures, the "Pingpu" aboriginal
people are now very hard to identify and people in Taiwan generally
believe that "Pingpu" people no longer exist on the island.</P>
      <P>In an effort to distinguish the identity of "Pingpu" people and
recover or retain their cultures, the Tainan County Government
decided to sponsor the "Taiwan Pingpu Ethnic Groups Summit" meeting
in October, inviting representatives from "Pingpu" groups from around
the island and anthropological researchers to take part, officials
from the Tainan County Bureau of Cultural Affairs said.</P>
      <P>According to ethnic archives, Taiwan's "Pingpu" people used to be
roughly divided into 10 different groups, including the Ketagalan in
the Taipei area, the Kavalan in the eastern Ilan area and Siraya in
the southwest area of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The remnants of these groups have been working to establish the
identity of their respective tribes and refuse to accept the notion
that their tribes have died out.</P>
      <P>In Tainan County, in particular, part of the "Pingpu" Siraya
culture has continuously been observed by "Pingpu" offspring. For
example, "night worship" rituals have been practiced annually by
residents in Tahnei and Tongshan to worship their ancestors.</P>
      <P>In the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park complex, there is
even a "Siraya Boulevard, " indicating that people there still have a
strong identity of their aboriginal origins.</P>
      <P>The government currently divides Taiwan's aboriginal people into
10 major mountain tribes and 10 "Pingpu" groups. While elements of
the languages and cultures of the 10 mountainous races have been
maintained, most of the native languages of the "Pingpu" people have
died out, with no traces remaining.</P>
      <P>The 10 mountainous races include the Atayal, Amis, Bunun,
Saisiat, Tsou, Puyuma, Rukai, Paiwan and Dawu tribes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people could either have originally come from
the southern part of China or from the vast region called the
Austronesian-language area, which spans from Madagascar eastward
across the Indian and Pacific oceans to Easter Island, and from
Taiwan southward to New Zealand.</P>
      <P>In a new theory developed in Australia and New Zealand in recent
years, anthropologists believe that Taiwan is the place where the
Austronesian-language people originated.</P>
      <P>Professor Geoffrey Chambers of Victoria University in Wellington,
New Zealand, believes that the Maori people and other Polynesian
peoples of the Pacific "island-hopped" from Taiwan through the
Philippines and Indonesia to West Polynesia. From there, he says,
they traveled to the islands of East Polynesia and then southwest,
eventually settling in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's mountain tribes, the Saisiat and the Atayal are
believed to have migrated to Taiwan some 3,000 years ago.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Health Department's Center for Disease
Control (CDC) reported Tuesday the 20th dengue fever case this year,
confirming that this latest case was imported into Taiwan by a Tainan
County citizen's wife from the Philippines.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said that the woman returned to Shanhua township,
Tainan County April 2 after a visit to her hometown in the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>After suffering some symptoms related to dengue fever, the woman
took the initiative and reported to the local health authority in
Shanhua saying that she might have contracted dengue fever. Her case
was confirmed April 5, Wu Ping-hui, a CDC section chief, said.</P>
      <P>The Shanhua case increased the number of dengue fever cases
involving foreign brides in Taiwan to five so far this year. Of the
total, four were Vietnamese wives and one Philippine wife, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, a total of 106 suspected dengue fever cases have
been reported around Taiwan this year, with only 20 being confirmed
as dengue fever.</P>
      <P>All of these 20 confirmed dengue fever cases were imported, with
seven originating from Indonesia, seven from Vietnam, four from the
Philippines and one each from India and Thailand, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wu called for stepped-up education to foreign spouses from
Southeast Asia and Taiwan citizens who wish to visit Southeast Asian
nations about dengue fever and its prevention and treatment, pointing
out that dengue fever has continuously been spreading in that part of
the world and the situation in Indonesia and Vietnam has become
especially serious.</P>
      <P>In order to check the outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease, the
Department of Health sponsored a conference on the prevention of
dengue fever in early April, with health authorities from eight
cities and counties in southern Taiwan participating.</P>
      <P>Wu also called for the Taiwan public to keep tabs on their own
health regularly and keep their residence environments clean as one
of the ways to stem the disease.</P>
      <P>Schools and communities should also destroy the breeding grounds
of mosquitoes to cut down on the possibility of infection, he added.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) will earmark NT$200 million (about
US$6.1 million) this year for the establishment of an innovation and
research and development hub in southern Taiwan, according to a
spokesman for the CEPD.</P>
      <P>The decision was made during a CEPD meeting Monday in which
officials got together to study the effects of the "Challenge 2008, "
a six-year national development plan and set new objectives for the
coming phases, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Citing CEPD Vice Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh, the spokesman said that
the innovation and R&amp;D center planned for southern Taiwan will be
located inside the Southern Tainan Science-based Industrial Park, as
a similar establishment in northern Taiwan has obtained initial
achievements.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of the innovation and R&amp;D hub in southern
Taiwan is to attract companies from the private sector to open shop
and train 1,000 hi-tech researchers, the spokesman quoted Ho as
saying. The government-funded Industrial Technology Research
Institute will take the initiative to set up a foothold there.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's innovation and R&amp;D hub plan has successfully courted

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 1,465 foreigners were
naturalized as Republic of China citizens last year, down 4.44
percent from the 2002 level, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOI officials attributed the decline mainly to a significant
decrease in the number of voluntarily naturalized citizens. In 2003,
only 85 foreigners were voluntarily naturalized as ROC citizens,
marking a 59 percent drop from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Since the ROC Nationality Law was largely revised in 2000, the
conditions for naturalization have become more stringent. As a
result, the officials said, the number of naturalized citizens has
been dwindling steadily.</P>
      <P>In 2003, only 54 foreign men were naturalized as ROC citizens,
accounting for a mere 3.69 percent of the total, while female
naturalized citizens made up 96.91 percent or 1,411.</P>
      <P>The MOI tallies also showed that foreign wives of local men
formed the bulk of naturalized citizens in 2003, accounting for more
than 80 percent or 1,340. The figure marked a 7.63 percent
rise from the 2002 level.</P>
      <P>Among those who were naturalized last year, 408 hailed from
Vietnam, 317 from Cambodia, 264 from Indonesia, 193 from the
Philippines, 135 from Myanmar, and 93 from Thailand. Marriage was the
main reason for their naturalization.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOI officials said 869 ROC citizens lost their
nationality last year, up 6.76 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>

      <P>Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min

spokesman for the defense ministry said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng made the remarks in response to
reports that Tang had retracted his resignation and had agreed to
stay on.</P>
      <P>Tang earlier tendered his resignation, citing a serious eye

government wants him to stay, some even saying that former President
Lee Teng-hui called Tang to ask him to consider political stability
and not to leave.</P>
      <P>But Huang said that Tang is adamant about resigning because of
his eye problem.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Tang developed eye problems after his strenuous
efforts in relief work in the wake of the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake.
Doctors say that Tang will require long-term follow-up treatment and
time to recuperate.</P>
      <P>"Minister Tang still believes that it is not appropriate for him

Tang will stay no longer than the day before the presidential

      <P>Mainland Chinese who immigrate to Taiwan
through their marriage with local people will have their fingerprints
taken by local authorities, Johnnason Liu, vice chairmen of the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a denial of local news reports that all mainland Chinese who
visit Taiwan should record their fingerprints, Liu said the newly
revised Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area borrows an article from the Exit
and Immigration Law to require mainland Chinese who come to Taiwan to
reunite with their family members to have their fingerprints taken
when they apply for permits for residency.</P>
      <P>This requirement also applies to foreigners who want to take
residence in Taiwan or be naturalized, and, therefore, is not a form
of discrimination against mainland Chinese, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Although a detailed plan to carry out the program was already
worked out and promulgated by the Ministry of the Interior on April
8, Liu said fingerprint identification equipment, which is vital to
the whole program, is not yet in place, and thereby it is impossible

    <HEADLINE>LIEN VOWS TO LEAD KMT TO WIN YEAR-END LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Wednesday he will do whatever he can to lead the party to
win an many legislative seats as possible in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Lien, who narrowly lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian in
the March 20 presidential election, made the pledge while meeting
with a group of KMT legislators.</P>
      <P>It was the first of a series of Lien's planned meetings with
incumbent KMT lawmakers over the next few days to discuss the party's
strategies for the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lien said the upcoming legislative elections are crucial to the
party's survival.</P>
      <P>"It will be a life or death battle for us. We must gear up to win
the battle. We cannot afford to lose," Lien was quoted
as having told KMT lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by winning the presidential election, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is now setting its eye on winning
more than half of the seats in the Legislative Yuan. The DPP now
controls 87 seats in the legislature, compared to the KMT's 68 seats.</P>
      <P>As the KMT and its ally -- the People First Party -- jointly
control half of the legislative seats, the DPP administration has had
a hard time implementing its reform agenda during Chen's first
four-year term. The DPP has vowed to win more than half of the seats
in the year-end legislative elections. One of DPP's strategies to
realize this ambitious goal is to court promising KMT legislative
hopefuls to join its ranks and run for legislative seats under its
banner.</P>
      <P>In the face of this situation, Lien said the KMT must make
all-out efforts to prevent such a miserable scenario from happening.</P>
      <P>"If our national resources are controlled by a handful of people,
our democratic system will be at stake, " Lien said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT founded the Republic of China nearly a
century ago and has made Taiwan a stable, prosperous and democratic
island during its 54-year rule, Lien said the KMT should not be
daunted by its current setbacks.</P>
      <P>"We must stand united and work hard to expand our grassroots
power base and inject new blood and vitality into our party
apparatus, " Lien said, adding that the KMT must not let the DPP
control both the administrative and legislative branches.</P>
      <P>He further said election lawsuits, legislative elections and
intra-party reforms will be the KMT's three most important tasks at
the current stage.</P>
      <P>"All these must be carried out simultaneously, " Lien said,
adding that the party must review its overall structural problems as
well as decision-making and grassroots mobilizations to make
necessary improvements and upgrade operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Lien said he remains confident of the KMT's prospects for staging
a comeback to power.</P>
      <P>Lien has contested Chen's narrow re-election victory with
sometimes violent street protests over the past three weeks and has
also filed two lawsuits to nullify the election result and have the
votes recounted.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the March 19 shooting of President Chen unfairly
swayed the election result in Chen's favor, Lien is now pushing for
an independent inquiry into the shooting.</P>
      <P>Lien said he will begin an islandwide speaking tour later this
month to seek popular support for the KMT's proposal that a
referendum be held alongside the year-end legislative elections to
pave the way for the establishment of a special committee under the
Legislative Yuan to investigate the shooting, which slightly wounded
Chen and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL TOURISM OPERATORS EYEING ASIA FOR MORE VISITORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Luring people from Asia, particularly
South Korea, to visit Taiwan should be the focus of local tourist
agents, according to industry insiders.</P>
      <P>Arrivals from Hong Kong and Macau have remained steady, although
Japanese visitors are on the decline, they said.</P>
      <P>Tourism operators pointed to signs that tourist arrivals in
Taiwan this year may not be as good as expected, although the Tourism
Bureau has set 2004 as "Taiwan tourism year" with the aim of
attracting 3.2 million foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Tourism Bureau showed that foreign
arrivals in the first quarter are not as high as expected, especially
Japanese tourists, who have been the top source of foreign Visitors.
Their numbers have declined by more than 30 percent on average.</P>
      <P>This means that Japanese tourist groups have yet not returned to
Taiwan since the island was hard hit by severe acute respiratory
syndrome between March and June 2003, and that only individuals and
small groups have come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The operators said that although the government has no lack of
money in promoting tourism in Japan, the result has been very
limited. Therefore, they think that it is better not to rely on a
single market.</P>
      <P>They also stressed the importance of the government adopting
measures to facilitate foreign visitors, saying that the effect is
almost immediate, citing South Korea as an example.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan and South Korea severed diplomatic relations in
August 1992 and the subsequent disruption of direct air links, they
said that it was more difficult for South Koreans to come to Taiwan
because of visa procedures and air transportation. Nowadays, with
charter flight services and no-visa treatment, arrivals have grown
rapidly.</P>
      <P>The operators said that people from South Korea make 15,000
visits to Taiwan on average every month, and this is expected to
continue to grow to make South Korea the third-largest source of
tourists in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The number of mainland Chinese, including professionals, coming
to Taiwan showed a decline because of political reasons, they noted.</P>
      <P>The operators said that the government-set goal of 3.2 million
visits will require more active promotion and the reduction of other
unfavorable factors, although they will be content to welcome 2.5
million visitors judging from the present situation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged law enforcement
authorities Wednesday to bring to justice rioters who clashed with
police in Taipei on the night of April 10 after a rally organized by
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>In a written statement read by Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i at a
weekly Cabinet meeting, the premier, who began a three day of leave
of absence Wednesday, said his administration won't let rioters who
attacked police with Molotov cocktails and iron bars go without
paying for their crimes.</P>
      <P>He also condemned the leaders of the KMT and PFP for urging their
supporters to take to the streets even though they were unable to
prevent them from running riot.</P>
      <P>Demonstrations -- including the one on April 10 -- orchestrated
by the two opposition parties to protest what they called the unfair
presidential election on March 20, have damaged the nation's tourism,
economy and competitiveness and have dampened foreign investors'
enthusiasm for the country, the premier said in his statement.</P>
      <P>He urged the opposition parties to resolve their disputes
stemming from the election through legal processes without disturbing
social order and stability.</P>
      <P>After the permitted time for the Saturday, April 10 rally had
passed, many protesters refused to disperse. The time was extended
from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., but a stubborn mob remained. They confronted
police in front of the Presidential Office for nearly 12 hours,
during which some 100 people were injured in scuffles with police.</P>
      <P>Also in his statement, the premier asked the Taipei Power Company
(Taipower) to find the cause of an hour-long power outage on April 10
that affected the Hsinchu Science-based Industry Park, causing an
estimated NT$1.5 billion in losses to the roughly 350 companies
there.</P>
      <P>Yu praised Taipower for restoring the electricity to the park
quickly, but urged the company to find out what caused the outage and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ling Fong, a mainland Chinese
neurosurgeon, who came to fame in Taiwan after successfully treating
a critically injured Taiwan-born TV anchorwoman, arrived in Taipei
Wednesday for a four-day speaking tour.</P>
      <P>Ling headed a five-member medical team at Xuanwu Hospital in
Beijing that treated Tanya Liu, a former anchorwoman for Hong
Kong-based Phoenix Satellite TV, who barely survived a London train
crash in May 2002.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held shortly after her arrival for
her first-ever visit to Taiwan, Ling said she integrated Western and
traditional Chinese medical expertises to treat Liu.</P>
      <P>Ling also stressed that Liu had never been brain dead. "A
brain-dead person can never be cured," she said.</P>
      <P>Stunned by her achievements in treating Liu, some of Ling's fans
have called her a "magic doctor." But a modest Ling said she is just
a doctor.</P>
      <P>Liu was pronounced brain dead at one point in London, and British
doctors gave up efforts to treat her. But Liu managed to pick up a
pen and write her name about five months after she was transferred to
Xuanwu Hospital, where she received neurosurgery and rehabilitation
treatment from Ling's team.</P>
      <P>Ling said the British doctors' announcement might be based on a
different medical philosophy. She repeated again that Liu was
absolutely not brain dead two years ago.</P>
      <P>As to her Taiwan itinerary, Ling said she was invited by a local
medical research foundation to deliver two speeches. She will also
visit Shin Kong Wu Ho Su Memorial Hospital in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ling will serve as a keynote speaker at the seventh
Asian-Oceanian International Conference on Skull Base Surgery
scheduled to open this weekend.</P>
      <P>Ling was greeted by Liu, who is currently convalescing in Taiwan,
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport -- Taiwan's main gateway.
Ling said she is very glad to see Liu in good health and good
spirits.</P>
      <P>Liu was on the ill-fated train with her friends, Wu Chia-ching
and Lin Chia-hsin, both Taiwan-born television journalists. Seven
people died, including Wu and Lin, and more than 70 others were
injured in the accident, which was caused by faulty carriage
couplings.</P>
      <P>Liu is scheduled to return to work at Phoenix TV in the near
future, after having almost fully recovered from her injuries.</P>
      <P>Sources said Ling will travel to Hong Kong together with Liu to
attend a charity fundraiser after her current Taipei visit.</P>

he visited a hospital in Luotung, Ilan, and in 2003, he visited the
Leshan Institution in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>On January 25, 2002, he designated May 20 as the annual "Taiwan

      <P>Chen not only advocates "voluntarism in Taiwan, " but has put the
ideals into action, the officials said, adding that this year will be
no exception.</P>
      <P>The scale of this year's inauguration ceremony will be bigger
than that of four years ago, with 500,000 expected to attend rallies

behind closed doors in court Wednesday in the trial of Hsu
Ping-chiang, a former chief accountant of the National Security
Bureau (NSB).</P>
      <P>Lee testified as a witness and answered questions from
prosecutors before Hsu was brought into court to read the transcript

an hour.</P>
      <P>Lee is the last of a series high-profile witness, including
former Foreign Minister Jason Hu and former NSB Director Ting
Yu-chou, to bear testimony in the case.</P>
      <P>Hsu stands accused of diverting NT$250 million (US$10.5 million)
from a secret slush fund managed by the NSB to Taiwan Research
Institute (TRI) President Liu Tai-ying in 1999. According to the
charges against him, Liu used some of the money to finance the

      <P>The money was paid by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the NSB

    <HEADLINE>TSU WELCOMES KMT LEGISLATIVE HOPEFULS TO JOIN RANKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said
Wednesday that opposition Kuomintang (KMT) members intending to
participate in the year-end legislative elections are welcome to join
its ranks and run for legislative seats under its banner.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative whip Chen Chien-ming said the TSU will campaign
on a platform of expanding Taiwan consciousness and Taiwan national
identity for the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>While the TSU cooperated with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) during the just-concluded presidential election, Chen
said, the TSU will define itself as a "loyal opposition party" in the
run-up to the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"We'll present our own financial, economic, cultural and social
reform agenda to distinguish the TSU from the DPP and to attract
those who agree with our national reform vision and ideals to join
our ranks," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that elections provide good opportunities for political
parties to seek popular support for their concepts and platforms,
Chen said the TSU will take advantage of the legislative elections to
expand its power base and secure new allies.</P>
      <P>The TSU now controls 12 seats in the Legislative Yuan, but Chen
said the party hopes to garner more than 15 percent of the votes in
the legislative elections so as to secure 30 seats in the new
legislature to be inaugurated early next year.</P>
      <P>Stressing that a rising Taiwan identity contributed to President
Chen Shui-bian's re-election, Chen said he is convinced that the
additional 1.5 million ballots Chen garnered in the March 20 poll
over the number of ballots he netted in the 2000 election could be a
guarantee for the TSU's success in the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The TSU was formed about three years ago, with former President
Lee Teng-hui as its "spiritual leader." Incumbent TSU Chairman Huang
Chu-wen and several other senior party officials are former KMT
members.</P>
      <P>Chen said the TSU welcomes KMT members who share the values of
national reform and a "Taiwan first" stance to join its ranks and run
for legislative seats under its banner.</P>
      <P>In the 2001 legislative elections, the TSU nominated 39
candidates. Chen said the party plans to nominate 40 candidates this
time, with one or two for each constituency. For some constituencies,
such as the outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu and Taitung,
the TSU will not field candidates, Chen added.</P>
      <P>As for the TSU's relationship with the DPP, Chen said the two
parties have yet to discuss any joint strategies for the
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"The TSU doesn't rule out the possibility of forming a strategic
alliance with the DPP for the elections. We may adjust our
cooperative strategies in terms of distinctive conditions in various
constituencies," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERWORK DEATH CRITERIA CAN BE LOWERED: LABOR COUNCIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The criteria for deciding when a death is
the result of overwork could probably be lowered if there were
precedents in other countries that could be used as reference, a
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-chi, director of the CLA's Department of Labor Safety
and Health, said the standard for reaching a verdict of death by
overwork, known in Japan as karoshi, would not be based solely on
work hours and that other occupational factors should also be
included when such a case is judged.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CLA will not reject opinions from any private
organization or specialist group on criteria for death by overwork
when considering revisions to the existing regulations in this
regard.</P>
      <P>The CLA official made the remarks in response to several private
groups, which lodged a protest to the CLA headquarters Wednesday
against the government's harsh standards for judging when death is
the result of overwork.</P>
      <P>An official of the Taiwan Association for Victims of Occupational
Injuries (TAVOI) said that it is unacceptably harsh that the CLA
regulates that an overwork verdict can only be applied when an
employee has worked for 24 hours continuously before dying or has
worked for over 16 hours every day one week before dying.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Confederation of Taipei Trade Unions also
pointed out that the CLA criteria are too narrow, as they relate
largely to the diseases as cause of death, but barely mention any
reasons concerning working conditions and other social and
psychological factors that could be involved.</P>
      <P>Many causes of death, including heart attack, stroke and suicide,
can be the results of pressure derived from overworking, but are
excluded from the CLA criteria, the spokesman said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY SHOULD BE INAUGURATED ON SCHEDULE: THSRC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first high-speed railway should
be inaugurated in October 2005 as scheduled, despite some financial
hitches, Taiwan High Speed Railway Corp. (THSRC) President Liu
Kuo-chih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that THSRC has had bumpy performance in its
fund-raising efforts and the company has only recently been hit by an
international arbitration body for massive damages to its former
partner, THSRC will try its utmost to catch up with the building
schedule so that the high-speed railway system can be inaugurated
Oct. 31, 2005, Liu said during a meeting at the Legislative Yuan
Transportation Committee.</P>
      <P>Liu added, however, that he is not 100 percent positive that the
high-speed railway system will be completed on time, as there are
still too many uncertainties surrounding the huge project.</P>
      <P>After failing to secure necessary funding of NT$10 billion
(US$303 million) by the end of February for part of an increment in
corporate capital, THSRC has consulted its banking consortium and
reached a new agreement that THSRC will raise NT$7.5 billion by the
end of July, followed by another NT$10.2 billion by the end of
September and a further NT$10 billion before Nov. 30 to finance the
development of the railway.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san, who
was also present at the legislative meeting, said that so far, the
high-speed railway development has not stalled because of the funding
difficulties.</P>
      <P>However, he added that if the THSRC cannot raise enough funds in
the days to come, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
will have no choice but to buy out the project at a cost of at least
NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the THSRC management has been mulling whether to
accept or appeal an arbitration award wherein it is ordered to pay
US$73.04 million in damages to its former partner, Eurotrain.</P>
      <P>THSRC teamed up with the Eurotrain consortium in 1996 to vie for
the right to construct the island's first high-speed railway, but
ditched Eurotrain for Japan's Shinkansen consortium in 1999 after it
won the US$16 billion contract in 1997, on the grounds that Eurotrain
charged too much for its system and refused to become a THSRC
partner.</P>
      <P>Eurotrain filed for arbitration with the International Chamber of
Commerce in New York in 2001.</P>
      <P>The development of the high-speed railway, the world's largest
BOT (build-operate-transfer) project currently under construction,
was launched in July 1998.</P>
      <P>When the new railway is inaugurated, it will take less than 90
minutes to travel from Taipei in the north to Kaohsiung in the south
and it will become the backbone of a mass rapid transportation
network for western Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 345-kilometer railway will connect eight metropolitan areas
between Taipei and Kaohsiung, the two biggest cities on the island.
It will be able to transport at least 300,000 passengers daily when
it becomes fully operational.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure, including broadband communication systems, are
being built in special zones in the vicinity of the high speed
railway stations at Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi and Tainan to
facilitate the formation of special business complexes in the five
cities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DETAINING MAINLAND STOWAWAYS PUTS FINANCIAL BURDEN ON TAIWAN: CIB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The large number of mainland Chinese
stowaways detained at centers across Taiwan has created a heavy
financial burden for the government, a spokesman for the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With the launch of an across-the-board campaign to clamp down on
illegal immigrants from mainland China, many mainland stowaways have
been seized and detained by police and coast guard authorities, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>However, the mainland side's reluctance to take them back has
generated serious expenses for the Taiwan authorities, who have to
maintain their needs here such as personnel costs, transport fees, as
well as spending on clothes, meals, medical care and insurance fees,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the bureau, he reported that Taiwan
repatriated a total of 2,237 illegal immigrants to the mainland in 14
groups last year. In the first two months of this year, 674 people
were sent back.</P>
      <P>However, some 2,155 people still remain detained -- 1,132 at the
eastern Ilan detention center, 1,011 at the northern Hsinchu
detention center and 12 at the center on Matsu Island, he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the police authorities warned that more and more young
mainland women have illegally sneaked into Taiwan to make money in
the sex industry.</P>
      <P>CIB statistics show that 577 female mainland stowaways were
arrested in 2001, with the number picking up to 1,393 and 1,962 in
2002 and 2003, respectively. In 2001, 259 mainland women were nabbed
by police for prostitution, while the number rose to 642 in 2002 and
894 in 2003.</P>
      <P>In 2001 and 2002, women aged between 16 and 30 formed the largest
group of mainland female stowaways arrested in Taiwan, but a total of
1,233 mainland female stowaways detained last year were in the 16-20
age group, while 96 children aged below 15 years were caught, the
same tallies show.</P>
      <P>Police said that many women from the mainland who legally enter
Taiwan also engage in the sex business through fake marriages with
Taiwan men. "This problem is getting worse," they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO RESUME CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE AFTER MAY 20</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should squarely face up to
Taiwan's democratic development and resume dialogue with the country
after President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration for a second four-year
term May 20, Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after the Taiwan Affairs Office of mainland
China's State Council claimed earlier in the day that Taiwan's
timetable for holding a referendum on the formulation of a new
constitution is tantamount to a schedule for pursuing de jure Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>In democratic countries, Lin said, constitutional reform is a
matter of course. Mainland China should not viciously distort
Taiwan's constitutional reform plan as a plot to pursue formal
independence, he added.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is a democratic country, Lin continued, Taiwan's
future political development hinges on its mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chen won a second term by securing slightly more than
half of the votes cast in the March 20 presidential election, Lin
said Beijing's leaders should squarely face up to this reality and
resume cross-strait dialogue in order to forge peaceful and stable
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>As Chen had campaigned on a platform of strengthening Taiwan's
separate identity, Lin said, Chen's re-election indicates that Taiwan
identity has received majority support in local society.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has come a long way in political democratization, Lin went
on, adding that from the lifting of martial law to legislative
reform, direct presidential elections and the first-ever referendum
last month, Taiwan has earned much acclaim from home and abroad for
its democratic reform.</P>
      <P>Lin said he is convinced that Taiwan's experience can serve as
reference for mainland China's future political reform. Against this
backdrop, he said, the mainland should refrain from distorting
Taiwan's planned constitutional reform as steps toward formal
independence.</P>
      <P>Warning that spiteful criticism and allegations will only bring
about more confrontation and animosity, Lin said Beijing should show
"more sincerity and inclusiveness while reducing distortion and
criticism" so that cross-strait relations can enter a new stage of
reconciliation and rapprochement.</P>
      <P>As to Beijing's claim that Chen's "one country on each side the
Taiwan Strait" advocacy will gravely hinder cross-strait exchanges
and delay the opening of direct cross-strait shipping and air links,
Lin said the obstacles to direct cross-strait transportation links
lie in Beijing's hegemonic attitude toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have consistently adopted an open-minded and pragmatic
attitude toward cross-strait ties, and we hope Beijing can refrain
from 'politicizing' the direct shipping and air link issue, " Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Chen has announced a plan to write a new constitution suitable
for Taiwan's present status quo to be put to a referendum in 2006 for
implementation in 2008. Even though Chen has on many occasions
stressed that formulation of a new constitution will be carried out
on the principle of "no change to Taiwan's present status quo" and
has nothing to do with Taiwan independence, the Beijing authorities
still consistently distort it as a timetable for promoting Taiwan
independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN POLICY TO REMAIN LARGELY UNCHANGED: VICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's foreign policy will
remain largely unchanged even though a new foreign affairs minister
has been appointed, Vice Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kau said he does not see the nation's foreign policy changing
significantly as a result of the changeover. However, he added that
the question of how Taiwan's overall foreign policy will be directed
depends on the decisions to be made by the incoming minister.</P>
      <P>He noted that Foreign Minister-designate Chen Tan-sun is a
statesman with a pragmatic approach. "I believe that pragmatism will
secure Taiwan substantive progress on its diplomatic front at a time
when the country is facing increasing challenges in the international
community," he added. Chen will assume office Friday.</P>
      <P>The vice foreign minister made the remarks during an
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, where opposition
legislators questioned him about the government's foreign policy and
Taiwan's relations with the United States in the wake of President
Chen Shui-bian's re-election.</P>
      <P>Kau said he does not think that ROC-U.S. bilateral ties have
dropped to their "all-time low ebb" as some politicians have claimed,
although he added that there is always room for improvement in the
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>In response to a question about his possible appointment as
Taiwan's top representative to the United States to succeed outgoing
Chen Chien-jen, Kau said that he has been "ordered" many times by his
wife to "retire and go home" and that he would do so if given the
chance.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added that if his superiors require him to be
the top liaison officer to the United States, he will not shirk his
duties, saying that it is every citizen's responsibility to serve
their country.</P>
      <P>Kau declined to speculate on who will be appointed to the post of
top ROC representative to the United States, saying that the
authority to decide lies with the ROC president. He added that it
also requires the consent of the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>He said that the MOFA has provided President Chen with a "short
list" of candidates for the post, adding however that the MOFA is not
in a position to dictate the president's decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>The people on the "short list" include Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's top representative to the United
Kingdom Tien Hung-mau, Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen, Vice Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau, and Legislators
Parris Chang and Hsiao Bi-khim from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>Kau declined to say anything further when asked whether any other
individuals not on the "short list" are being considered for the
post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN AIDE LAUDS OPPOSITION DECISION TO USE LEGAL MEANS IN DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An aide to President Chen Shui-bian lauded
an opposition People First Party (PFP) decision Thursday to stick to
legal means to settle their election disputes.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-fang, the director of the Department for Public
Affairs under the Presidential Office, said Taiwan has a sound
judiciary system to deal with the opposition's questions about the
March 20 presidential election and the opposition should let justice
run its course rather than organizing protests to press their demand
for a vote re-count.</P>
      <P>As a president elected by the people, Huang said, Chen will be
inaugurated to his second term May 20 as scheduled, an event that
won't be affected by the opposition's questions about the election
results.</P>
      <P>He made the comment after the PFP Caucus at the Legislative Yuan
threatened to ask the court to stop Chen assuming office May 20 if
there has been no ruling on a lawsuit brought by PFP and its election
partner, the Kuomintang (KMT), to invalidate the election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Ying-yuan, the deputy secretary-general of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said the court will not grant
PFP's request, adding that the president has done his best to
cooperate with investigators to clear up the election disputes.</P>
      <P>In a related development Thursday, KMT Chairman Lien Chan told
the Tokyo-based Asahi Television Station that there are hints
suggesting the March 19 shooting of Chen was a political ploy.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the shooting took place, Lien claimed, the DPP and
many unlicensed radio stations in southern Taiwan began circulating
the rumor that the KMT and PFP colluded with Beijing to assassinate
the president. They also used campaign cars to hand out prepared
leaflets to this effect, he claimed.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, Chen won the election by a narrow margin the
next day.</P>
      <P>Lien claimed that the opposition's questions about the fairness
of the election are well-grounded and he repeated his party's calls
for a thorough investigation into the March 19 shooting.</P>
      <P>However, Lee Ying-yuan denied Lien's claims.</P>

      <P>A total of 12 heads of foreign states have

    <HEADLINE>DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES HOPE FOR CROSS-STRAIT DIRECT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has great potential to serve as a
global distribution center, but the opening of full direct transport
links with mainland China is the key issue in its bid to achieving
this status, business executives said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Executives from world famous express delivery companies --
Germany-based DHL, U.S.-based FEDEX, U.S.-based UPS and Britain-based
EXCEL -- and representatives from the local industry made the call at
a seminar sponsored by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) to collect opinions and proposals from
the private sector about the government's goal to build Taiwan into a
global distribution hub.</P>
      <P>Huang Chung-jen, chairman of the Republic of China Distribution
Association, hailed the government's hub goal as the correct path,
but he also issued a reminder that mainland China, Hong Kong and
Singapore are strong competitors in this field and urged local
businesses to build brand consciousness.</P>
      <P>Citing Yangming Marine Transport Corp. Ltd. and Evergreen Marine
Corp. Ltd. as examples, Huang said that the two Taiwan-based shipping
firms, each with a world-class reputation, are capable of helping the
country move a big step closer toward its distribution hub dream if
they effectively consolidate their transnational supply chains in
cooperation with the many Taiwan companies operating in mainland
China and Taiwan's e-commerce clout.</P>
      <P>Taiwan stands a good chance of becoming an international
distribution center if this is done, Huang said, but he pointed out
that in addition, direct transport links between Taiwan and the
mainland must be established.</P>
      <P>DHL Taiwan General Manager Yang Fei agreed with Huang's
viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan's geographic location and cheaper
operational costs are far beyond comparison with Hong Kong, Singapore
and Japan, Yang contended that direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport
links would enable Taiwan to definitely gain the upper hand over
other countries in the region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's status as the world's 17th-largest foreign trader and a
prime supplier of information industry-related products in the world
market are other advantages that it possesses, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that full and direct cross-strait transport,
trade and postal services are of maximum importance as to whether or
not Taiwan can be a global distribution hub. He urged the government
to pay special heed to the direct transport issue and called for a
cut in government sector red tape.</P>
      <P>Putting aside the sensitive cross-strait ties issue, government
officials attending the seminar promised to do what they can to
improve the existing practices, including easing rules in order to
shorten the documentation process.</P>
      <P>Scores of officials from the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, Bureau of Foreign Trade, Industrial
Development Bureau, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of

    <HEADLINE>PFP  TO ASK COURT TO BAN MAY 20 PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) said Thursday it plans to ask the Taiwan
High Court to ban the May 20 presidential inauguration if the two
election lawsuits are not concluded before that day.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative whip Hsu Yuan-kuo claimed that since the
"pan-blue alliance" presidential and vice presidential candidates --
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong -- have
contested the election result with two lawsuits, incumbent President
Chen Shui-bian is not eligible to take the oath for a second term
before the lawsuits are settled.</P>
      <P>Chen defeated Lien by a slim margin of 29,518 ballots in the
March 20 presidential election. Claiming that the election-eve
shooting of Chen unfairly swayed the result in Chen's favor, the
Lien-Soong ticket has filed two lawsuits to nullify Chen's
re-election victory and to annul the entire election so that a new
one can be held.</P>
      <P>The High Court has held two hearings on the election result
nullification lawsuit and is expected to begin a full-scale judicial
vote recount early next month.</P>
      <P>Hsu said if the court fails to settle the lawsuits before May 20,
the president-elect should not formally assume office.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the "pan-blue alliance's" lawyers are studying relevant
regulations and plan to file a petition with the High Court in early
May demanding that the court ban Chen from being sworn in for a
second four-year term.</P>
      <P>However, under the President and Vice President Election and
Recall Law, lawsuits regarding election results should be settled
within six months. During the court proceedings, the president-elect
and vice president-elect formally announced by the Central Election
Commission (CEC) can take office as scheduled. The CEC announced
March 26 that Chen and Vice President Annette Lu won the March 20
poll.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that although the law does not prescribe that the
plaintiff of an election lawsuit can petition the court to ban the
inauguration of a president-elect, the court should not reject the
"pan-blue alliance's" petition, because many disputes involved in the
just-concluded presidential election have never happened before.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman James Huang refrained from
commenting on the PFP's planned petition, saying that the
Presidential Office would not comment on any specific lawsuit.</P>
      <P>Instead, Huang said Chen will take the oath May 20 for a second
four-year term in line with the law.</P>
      <P>Huang further said he is pleased to see the "pan-blue alliance"
willing to resolve the election disputes through the judicial system.</P>
      <P>In the past few weeks, the "pan-blue alliance" has staged
sometimes violent street protests against the election outcome. The
alliance first demanded a vote recount and later a redo of the
election and the formation of a special committee under the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan to investigate the March 19
shooting that slightly injured Chen and Lu.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou urged supporters
of the "pan-green camp" and the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
Thursday to exercise self-restraint during the May 20 inauguration of
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in response to suggestions by city councilors
from the opposition New Party that the central government should
change the venue of the inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office has planned a 500,000-strong celebration
rally in the square in front of the Presidential Office and has asked
Taipei city government to block off the roads in the surrounding area
for five consecutive days.</P>
      <P>Councilors Lee Chin-yuan, Fei Hung-tai, Chang Chung-tien and Pan
Fai-chung raised questions at the Taipei City Council about the
Presidential Office's request.</P>
      <P>They said the area proposed for traffic control is too big and
the period is too long, which will affect the lives of Taipei
citizens. In addition, the inauguration could also trigger protests
from the "pan-blue alliance " that the police might not be able to
handle.</P>
      <P>They asked for "a truce" between the "pan-green" and "pan-blue"
camps and expressed hope that Ma will suggest in an Executive Yuan
meeting that the venue of the inauguration be changed to within the
Presidential Office or to Linkou Stadium in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that he favors a "true, " peaceful and rational
activity. He said that if there are clashes at the president's
inauguration ceremony, they will have an adverse effect on Taiwan's
future.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Sept. 11 Panel Cites
C.I.A. for Failures in Terror Case.

An interim report by the Sept. 11 panel's staff offered a
stinging assessment of the C.I.A. was made public during a hearing at
which Mr. Tenet, the director of central intelligence since 1997,
disclosed that he had little contact with President Bush during much
of the summer of 2001, a period when intelligence agencies were
warning of a dire terrorist threat.

Mr. Tenet testified that he had no contact at all with Mr. Bush
in August, the month in which the president received a C.I.A. report
suggesting that terrorists of Al Qaeda were already in the United
States and might be planning a domestic airplane hijacking.

Wall Street Journal: With '80s Tactics, U.S. Fund Shakes Japan's
Cozy Capitalism.

"U.S. Fund On Wild Rampage, " declared a headline in a Japanese
news magazine. A U.S. fund's takeover attempt of two Japanese
companies has caused more than 200 other companies, many fearing that
they may be next, to increase their own dividends in the past three
months. Some also are scurrying to investm ent bankers and securities
lawyers for advice on avoiding a potential takeover.

The uproar signals the arrival in Japan of American-style
capitalism and the loud voice it gives shareholders. As in the U.S.
in the 1980s when hostile takeovers and corporate raiders thrived, a
lot of executives are decrying the development as a destabilizing
force, fearing it puts too much power in the hands of financiers
looking for a short-term payday. On the other hand, as in the U.S.,
it could spur companies to be more efficient and accountable.</TEXT>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
issued a travel advisory against Iraq because of the mounting
insurgency there, a senior MOFA official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Iraq has been listed as a highly dangerous area in which to
travel, " MOFA's West Asian Affairs Department Deputy Director Lin

for the time being.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOFA has crafted a three-level travel warning system
for countries that have bad public order, an unstable political
situation, backward infrastructure construction and terrorist
activities. Under the system, a yellow color means a low-level travel

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES OPPOSITION LEADERS TO FACE DEFEAT SQUARELY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (DPP) should
have the courage to face the truth and the fact that it lost the
March 20 election, an official of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, DPP vice secretary-general, made the remarks after
KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong said that they
would not attend the May 20 inauguration ceremony of President Chen
Shui-bian, who won by only 29,518 votes out of more than 13 million
ballots cast.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong were running for president and vice president as
an alliance of their parties.</P>
      <P>Instead, Lien and Soong reaffirmed that the government should
establish an independent committee before May 20 to look into the
election-eve shooting of President Chen, which left him lightly
injured and which they deemed unfairly swayed the bitterly contested
election in Chen's favor.</P>
      <P>Lee said that in past elections, if the DPP lost an election, the
party chairman would take responsibility, compared with the KMT's
approach, which reviews its grass-root support and its
decision-making process.</P>
      <P>He noted that the DPP respects the difference of various
political parties, but he said that, "As party leaders, they should
be close to the people's will, " adding that they "should have the
courage to face the truth, " and that when legislators demand that
the defeat be accepted squarely, they should not shift the focus.
Lien recently began a series of meetings with KMT legislators to
review the election result and discuss the year-end legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that world-renowned forensics expert Dr. Henry Lee had
concluded that the president sustained gunshot wounds on the eve of
the election, he urged Lien and Soong to accept the fact that the
shooting was not fake as some claimed in an attempt to win
last-minute sympathy votes.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong should learn a lesson from President Chen when he
lost to Ma Ying-jeou in the Taipei City mayoral election in 1998,
during which time Chen appealed to his supporters to throw their
support behind the elected Ma, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks followed that of Tseng Wen-tsang, a DPP deputy
director in charge of party promotion, who said that both Lien and
Soong had been invited to attend the inauguration and urged the two
to show "grace" in attending.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong ran separately against Chen in the three-way
presidential election in 2000, and both failed to show up at his
inauguration ceremony after the defeat.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World-renowned forensics expert Dr. Henry
Lee is expected to give a follow-up report on the March 19 shooting
of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee, who visited Taiwan April 9-11 and examined the wounds of the
president and vice president, visited the scene of the shooting and
the Chi Mei Medical Center in Tainan, southern Taiwan, gave a
preliminary report before his departure.</P>
      <P>Lee then brought back the information he collected to his
Connecticut laboratory for further analysis.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said that Lee could make his follow-up report
Sunday morning Taipei time.</P>
      <P>Lee set up a re-enactment of the shooting in Tainan focusing on
the trajectory of the bullet, the speed of the vehicle carrying the
president and vice president and the possible "hot zone" where the
shooter would have been likely located.</P>
      <P>Before leaving Taiwan, Lee confirmed that the president and the
vice president sustained gunshot wounds and the bullet was shot from
outside the open-top jeep that the president was riding in on the eve
of the March 20 presidential election, dashing the claims by some
political pundits that the shooting was faked to win last-minute
sympathy votes.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" has held a series of rallies,
the latest one on April 10 that ended violently, since the March 20
election to protest what they perceived as an "unfair election, "
which it said was marred by voting irregularities and the shooting,
which it claimed swayed the bitterly contested election in President
Chen's favor.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has taken
steps to tighten control over chemical residuals in certain
domestically raised fish to upgrade quality and increase exports, a
spokesman for the COA said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Setting its sight on the locally raised mouth breeders, a common
and popular fish in Taiwan, the COA's Fisheries Administration called
a meeting a day earlier in southern Chiayi County to discuss the
issue, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Experts from the government, the academic sector and mouth
breeder raisers from Chiayi, Tainan and Yunlin areas got together to
mull measures and a development strategy for business, the spokesman
added.</P>
      <P>It was decided at the meeting that the COA will set up a national
tracking system to monitor the quality of the country's fisheries
exports through the whole process, covering upstream to processors
and distributors in the middle stream and foreign traders in
downstream, an official from the Chiayi County government said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, authorities will also educate local fish
raisers to increase their knowledge and know-how over the correct use
of chemicals and collect more samples from local fishery ponds, he
added.</P>
      <P>About half of Taiwan's 85,000 metric tons of mouth breeders were
exported last year, but its outbound shipments to the European Union
were detected by EU authorities to have contained chemical
substances, dealing a heavy blow to local fish raising businesses
which are clustered mainly in central and southern Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE-AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY MEN WANT REST OF DONATION GOING TO CHARITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angles,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two successful Chinese-American
entrepreneurs in technology said Wednesday that any money that they
have donated to cover the expenses of recounting the presidential
votes in Taiwan that is left over should go to charity to promote
ethnic harmony.</P>
      <P>John Tu and David Sun, co-founders of Kingston Technology Corp.,
one of the leading memory module manufacturers in the world, decided
to donate NT$100 million (US$3.03 million) earlier this week to help
pay for the recount of the March 20 presidential election, hoping to
end the controversy soon so that society can return to normal.</P>
      <P>Sun and Tu, after learning from the Central Election Commission
that the recount would cost about NT$31.1 million, spoke through Hsu
Sheng-chang, the company's vice president of technology, and
instructed him to earmark the money above that needed for the recount
to go to charities, especially to those that will promote ethnic
harmony.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the donation aims to bring the election disputes to
a swift conclusion.</P>
      <P>"Ethnic groups have been divided after the election, and the
generosity and forbearance among the people has been destroyed, but
with the passage of the time, the wounds should be healed through
tolerance and rationality," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Sun and Tu lamented that although nearly one month has passed
since the presidential election, which saw President Chen Shui-bian
win another four-year term by a small margin against Lien Chan of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance, " controversy has continued over the
result.</P>
      <P>Supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" have staged several large
protest rallies against what they perceived as an "unfair election"
which they claimed was marred by voting irregularities and the
election-eve shooting of President Chen and Vice President Annette
Lu. The latest rally on April 10 ended in violence.</P>
      <P>The protestors demanded a ballot recount as well as the
establishment of an independent committee to investigate the shooting
that they said swayed the election in Chen's favor. Although both
candidates agreed to a recount, they remain differed on who should
pay for it, with the ruling "pan-green camp" saying that Lien's
alliance, which ask for the recount in the first place, should foot
the bill, while the latter wants the government to pay.</P>
      <P>Sun said that the NT$100 million is a non-political donation and
has nothing to do with his pro- "pan-blue alliance" sentiments.</P>
      <P>Sun and Tu became millionaires when they sold a large chunk of
their memory chip-making company in 1996 and made headlines and envy
of every company employee worldwide when they decided to share US$100
million of the windfall with workers, roughly 450 at the time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN HAS PUT FAMILY ASSETS INTO TRUST: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has honored his
campaign promise of putting his family assets into trust,
Presidential Office spokesman James Huang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen promised on the campaign trail that he would put his family
assets into blind trust after the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chen's accountant and lawyer already finalized initial
preparatory work and entrusted Chen's assets to a local bank's trust
department Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The president's accountant will brief the press on the trust
amount, trust company and relevant management terms later this
month, " Huang said, adding that as asset trust involves a lot of
detailed professional knowledge, he is not in a position to address
the details regarding Chen's asset trust contract.</P>
      <P>Responding to press reports that first lady Wu Shu-chen failed to
report a January stock trading deal to the Control Yuan's public
functionaries asset declaration department, Huang said the
unintentional omission was mainly caused by an accountant's
negligence.</P>
      <P>Huang said Wu has not engaged in stock trading since Jan. 16. The
undeclared stock trading deal of NT$21.46 million was struck before
Jan. 16.</P>
      <P>"Because of staff changes at the accountant's office, the deal
was not reported to the Control Yuan. The accountant has confessed to
the fault, " Huang said, adding that the accountant would report the
deal to the Control Yuan later in the day.</P>
      <P>According to the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law, senior
officials and their spouses who conduct stock trading worth more than
NT$10 million within two months must report it to the Control Yuan,
the nation's supreme watchdog body.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the presidential election, the first lady's
stock trading activities came under fire. President Chen acknowledged
that even though Taiwan has not enacted a law to ban the first lady
from trading stocks, such activities were inappropriate. He made a
public apology for his wife's stock trading activities and promised
to put his family assets into blind trust after the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) proposed a package
of revisions to the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law that
would require the president and other senior officials to put their
assets into blind trust.</P>
      <P>According to the TSU-drafted revision package, the president,
vice president, as well as presidents of the five yuans, and other
senior political appointees should put their family assets into blind
trust. The assets to be put into trust cover those owned by the
public functionaries themselves as well as those owned by their
spouses and underage children.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear when the Legislature will begin screening this
revision bill.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO NOMINATE 92 CANDIDATES FOR LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will nominate 92 candidates of constituencies for the
December's legislative elections, a DPP official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, deputy secretary-general of the DPP, said that the
party's candidate nomination and campaign strategy panel for the
legislative elections set the figure at a meeting held earlier the
same day.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the number will not be subject to a conspicuous
change in the future and that he told this to Huang Chu-wen, chairman
of Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), which is the DPP's political ally.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian won his re-election in the
March 20 presidential election by obtaining more than 6.47 million
votes, or 50.12 percent of the total and 1.5 million votes over the
amount he got four years ago, Lee noted that the DPP will take a
conservative manner in nominating candidates for legislators by
taking its real political resources into consideration.</P>
      <P>The DPP is expected to win at least 80 seats for legislators of
constituencies based on the election rate of the last legislative
elections in 2001, for which the DPP nominated 83 candidates of
constituencies, Lee said.</P>
      <P>If this is the case, he added, the DPP will seize at least 20
seats of legislators-at-large which will be elected proportionally
with the number of votes obtained by political parties in the
elections.</P>
      <P>Based on the estimation, he went on, the DPP and the TSU that is
expected to win more seats in the year-end legislative elections than
the 13 it has now in the legislature, will certainly control more
than half of the 225 seats in the legislature after the elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO MINISTERS VOW TO CHECK RAMPANT FRAUD, HOAX KIDNAPPINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Cabinet ministers unanimously vowed
Friday to curb the rampant acts of fraud and hoax kidnappings in a
move underlining the government's determination to fight crime.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a conference of the country's senior prosecutors in
Hsinchu City, northern Taiwan, Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan
called law enforcement officials in the country to launch an all-out
fight against the fraud and hoax kidnappings.</P>
      <P>He suggested the prosecutors of the nation prosecute offenders of
these crime as "rogues" who are punishable by heavier sentences under
a special law.</P>
      <P>Coincidentally, Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan made
similar remarks during a visit to the Criminal Investigation Bureau
in Taipei Friday morning.</P>
      <P>Flanked by the newly appointed national police chief, Hsieh
Yin-tang, Su urged the police of the country to make curbing fraud as
their top priority, saying that many of his friends have fallen
victim to this widespread crime.</P>
      <P>In a common set-up, the fraudsters will pretended to be tax men
calling the victim by phone, asking them to use their ATM card to
take their tax returns.</P>
      <P>If the victims fall for this, they will actually transfer their
money to a bank account used by the fraudsters.</P>
      <P>Also, fraudsters will pose as hospital workers asking people by
phone to transfer money to a bank account "because their family
members were in the hospital's intensive care ward after a traffic
accident." Imprudent people transferred the money via ATM machines
and rushed to the hospital only to find that it was a hoax.</P>
      <P>The pretext used by the fraudsters also includes hoax kidnapping.</P>

      <P>The U.S. Department of Commerce is
offering chances to Taiwan companies at a symposium in Seoul called
to apprise Asian companies of the business opportunities in
rebuilding Iraq, according to the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>An anonymous TAITRA official said there are only 28 placements
for Taiwan businessmen to attend the April 28 symposium in Seoul, and
those companies that are interested should contact the TAITRA before
April 23.</P>
      <P>Citing estimates made by American research institutes, the
official said Iraq is 30 years behind its neighboring states in
infrastructure, and will need US$35.81 billion for reconstruction
between 2004 and 2007.</P>
      <P>This includes US$12.12 billion for the electricity-supplying
system, US$7.19 billion for medical care and education, US$6.84
billion for the water-supplying system and garbage disposal, US$3.4
billion for transportation and telecommunications, US$3.02 billion
for agriculture and US$1.83 billion for housing and municipal
administration, the official said.</P>
      <P>There is virtually no chance for ordinary countries to have a
finger in the pie of rebuilding Iraq except for the Western powers or
those who have chipped in with forces in the U.S.-led military attack
against Iraq, said the official.</P>
      <P>The only chance for Taiwan firms is to bid on the subcontracts
farmed out by the prime contractors, and the Seoul symposium is aimed
at offering companies in Asia opportunities to join in Iraqi
construction as subcontractors.</P>
      <P>During the symposium, the participants can understand their
chances of landing subcontracts, familiarize themselves with the
bidding process, and meet with the U.S. prime contractors that are
trying to outsource their contract works.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign investment continued flocking to
Taiwan in recent weeks despite the fact that political woes over the
disputed March 20 presidential election are not yet over, government
authorities reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
made the report after having approved capital worth a total of US$412
million funneled by four famous multinationals into their Taiwan
investment plans in a meeting held earlier the same day -- the first
of its kind in the wake of the presidential election.</P>
      <P>The figure is about the level of the US$468 million worth of
foreign capital channeled into Taiwan during the period between late
February 20 and April 4, a spokesman for the commission said, adding
that it is an indication that the willingness of foreign investors in
the domestic market has not been affected by the current political
situation at home.</P>
      <P>One among the five foreign companies was the Germany-based
Infineon Technologies Holding B. V., which put US$124 million in
capital investment into a company funded by Infineon, while the
Sweden-based Aktiebolaget Skf put an additional US$42 million into
its affiliate in Taiwan, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>An application by a Hong Kong-based company to inject capital
worth NT$75 million for its Taiwan operations was also approved, he

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATOR URGES PRESIDENT TO WORK TO DEFUSE ETHNIC DIVISIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An outspoken legislator of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged President Chen Shui-bian
Friday to "do something" to rein in worsening ethnic divisions and
disharmony in the wake of the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Shen Fu-hsiung, a physician-turned-lawmaker, made the appeal at a
news conference, dubbed the "love Taiwan presentation."</P>
      <P>Noting that he is convinced that an overwhelming majority of
local residents love Taiwan, Shen said the DPP should not make "love
Taiwan" its campaign theme or platform for the year-end legislative
election.</P>
      <P>"All politicians, particularly DPP members, should refrain from
taking advantage of this topic," Shen urged.</P>
      <P>As a ruling party, Shen went on, the DPP should not use
differences over policy toward mainland China, feelings toward
mainland China and the time of immigration from mainland China as
standards to measure whether an individual person loves Taiwan or
not.</P>
      <P>Since there is not an objective and scientific method to gauge
the depth and breadth of "love for Taiwan," Shen said, the DPP should
not bring up this topic in its campaign literature or rallies in the
run-up to the December legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"As the DPP chairman, President Chen is obligated to 'do
something' to mend ethnic divisions which have become very serious
after the presidential election, " Shen said, adding that Chen should
order all party members intending to run in the year-end legislative
elections to refrain from campaigning on a "love Taiwan" platform and
from bringing up ethnic issues.</P>
      <P>During the presidential campaign, Chen often assured voters that
he wouldn't cave in to Beijing, and he often questioned his sole
challenger Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's willingness to stand
up to Beijing. Some observers feel that political and ethnic
divisions have become even more serious after Taiwan-born Chen
narrowly defeated mainland China-born Lien.</P>
      <P>Except for a small group of aboriginal tribes, most of Taiwan's
23 million people are ethnic Chinese. But the population can be
divided into two sub-ethnic groups: the "mainlanders" whose families
fled to Taiwan when the Chinese Communists took over the mainland in
1949, and the "native Taiwanese" whose ancestors began arriving on
the island in the 17th century or earlier.</P>
      <P>The mainlanders, about 15 percent of the population, have largely
supported the opposition KMT and its ally, the People First Party,
and their support base is in northern Taiwan. The native Taiwanese
control the south, and they tend to favor Chen's DPP and the smaller
Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>The mainlanders have traditionally supported eventual unification
with mainland China, while the native Taiwanese lean more toward
formal independence.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs is
pushing local cargo carriers to use the Internet to reduce their
operational costs.</P>
      <P>Noting that the cost of cargo transportation accounts for 17
percent to 18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) , compared
to 14 percent to 15 percent in advanced countries, the
officials of the ministery said the more the cost of cargo
transportation as apercentage of the GDP, the less competitive is the
whole industry.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the officials said, government statistics show that
foreign firms made up 15 of the top 20 air carriers in Taiwan in
2001, with a market share of 77 percent between them, which means
local cargo carriers need to strengthen their competitiveness and
expand their operational scale with the government's aid and
guidance.</P>
      <P>As a way of remedying the situation, the officials said the
ministry has contracted the Taipei Computer Association to help
domestic cargo carriers make good use of the Internet for business,

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of outbound travelers declined
by more than one million in 2003 from the previous year because of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks and the 911
terrorist attacks in 2001, government sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the National Police
Administration (NPA) , Taiwan citizens made 5.92 million overseas
visits in 2003, down 1.32 million from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The number of travelers to Hong Kong and Macau -- major transit
stops for mainland China-bound visitors -- as well as those to Japan,
North America and Southeast Asian countries all registered negative
growth, NPA tallies showed.</P>
      <P>As Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China were all gripped by SARS
between March and June last year, the number of Taiwan travelers to
those regions dropped to 2.7 million from 3.6 million registered in
2002.</P>
      <P>Partly because of the 911 terrorist attacks, NPA officials said,
the number of Taiwan visitors to Southeast Asia declined to 1.2
million from 2002's 1.5 million; the number of travelers to Japan
fell to 730,000 from 2002's 800,000; and the number of North
America-bound visitors dropped to 570,000 from 2002's 660,000.</P>
      <P>South Korea was the only exception. The number of Taiwan visitors
to South Korea jumped from 120,000 in 2002 to 180,000 last year

    <HEADLINE>Q1 PRODUCTION VALUE OF BASIC METAL INDUSTRY SETS NEW HIGH: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fueled by soaring prices of steel goods at
home and abroad, the output value of Taiwan's basic metal industry
set a new quarterly high of NT$298.9 billion (US$9.05 billion) for
the first three months of this year, according to a report made
public Friday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents an annual 20.7 percent growth rate and it
will further pick up in the fourth quarter after hovering around the
first quarter level in the second and third quarters, reported the
Industrial Technology Information Service (ITIS), a project funded by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Standing firm on the rebounding trend since 2002, the world's
steel industry put out a total of 970 billion tons of crude steel
last year, up by 7.53 percent from the 2002 level, the report said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the overall production value of its basic metal
industry totaled NT$1.075 trillion in 2003, marking an annual growth
rate of 19.9 percent, according to the report. It forecasts that its
2004 production value will increase by 18 percent to NT$1.264
trillion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan out put 9.43 million tons of steel in the first quarter,
only up by 0.4 percent over the previous year's level. Its 2004
full-year production level is predicted at 38.62 million tons, a 1
percent annual increase rate.</P>
      <P>The ITIS estimates that Taiwan's steel businesses will reap a
handsome earning this year thanks to voracious demand from both the
domestic and foreign markets, especially that from mainland China in
the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>The price of steel products has markedly soared in the
international market since December 2001 until now, except for last

    <HEADLINE>ITALIAN MISSIONARY WINS MEDICAL AWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  Taiwan, April 16 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chech Felice, vice president of St.
Mary's Hospital in the northeastern Taiwan county of Ilan, has won
this year's government-sponsored Medical Award for his dedicated
services to local underprivileged people.</P>
      <P>The Italian Catholic father came to Taiwan 33 years ago at the
age of 28. He first worked in Taiwan's island county of Penghu for
six years and then came to work at St. Mary's Hospital in Ilan's
Lotung township.</P>
      <P>Over the past 27 years, Felice has actively promoted community
preventive medical services and cared for aboriginal and
disadvantaged people in the Ilan area where agriculture, fishing and
tourism form the backbone of the economy.</P>
      <P>Felice recalled that he has followed the lead of many other
missionaries of the Order of the Ministers of the Sick, also known as
the Camillians to work in remote and backward areas.</P>
      <P>"Before my arrival, many of my Camillian colleagues had already
worked in Penghu and Ilan to help improve local people's lives,
public health and medical services," Felice said.</P>
      <P>Since his arrival in the coastal town of Lotung, Felice said he
has devoted much energy in promoting community preventive medical
services.</P>
      <P>Felice organized a medical team to offer door-to-door medical
services for those who were unable to go to hospital to see a doctor.</P>
      <P>"No matter how far away or how difficult to reach a patient may
be, we try to show our concern and offer them attentive medical
treatment," Felice said.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Felice has also led medical teams to offer free
physical checkups, including blood pressure, blood sugar and cervical
tests, in residential communities around Ilan County.</P>
      <P>In view of the insufficient medical resources in the Ilan area,
Felice has spent a great deal of time raising funds for building a
new medical center at St. Mary's Hospital to treat patients of
serious diseases. Thanks to his strenuous efforts, construction on
the center began early this year and the new center is scheduled to
be inaugurated by 2007.</P>
      <P>The 61-year-old missionary said he has made medical services a
personal hobby. "I have found great interest in offering medical
services for needy people and over the past decades I have overcome
numerous difficulties in accomplishing my job as a religious preacher
and medical volunteer," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER DESCRIBES HIS IDEAL U.S. REPRESENTATIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Chen Tan-sun
said Friday that it would be appropriate to finalize the selection of
a new representative to the United States before the May 20
inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after meeting with the media shortly after
taking over the post from the outgoing foreign minister, Eugene
Chien.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that diplomatic work between Taiwan and the United
States is important, saying that an ideal representative should have
excellent language ability and social skills, as well as an
understanding of American culture.</P>
      <P>Asked about who will replace the incumbent representative, Chen
Chien-jen, who has said that he will step down before May 20, Chen
did not answer directly, pointing out that he had only been in the
job for 10 minutes.</P>
      <P>On reports that the government is eying Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen for the job, Chen said that he learned from
reports that Tsai is not enthusiastic about the idea.</P>
      <P>However, he added that there will be national leaders and foreign
dignitaries attending the May 20 inauguration ceremony and that it
would be best to have decided upon a candidate by that time.</P>
      <P>As to whether Therese Shaheen, former chairwoman of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), will be invited to the inauguration, he
said that the "matter needs further study."</P>
      <P>Shaheen, one of the most friendly AIT chairperson toward
Taiwan, stepped down in early April amid reports that the Bush
administration had ordered her dismissal after a long bout of policy
disagreements and questions about her management ability at the
institute.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: U.S. Open to a Proposal
That Supplants Council in Iraq.

The Bush administration accepted on Thursday the outlines of a
United Nations proposal to dissolve the Iraqi Governing Council
installed last year by the United States and replace it with a
caretaker government when Iraqi sovereignty is restored on July 1.

Administration officials said that the proposal by Lakhdar
Brahimi, the special United Nations envoy in Iraq, to create a new
government of prominent Iraqis had many details to be worked out, but
that for now it was acceptable to President Bush.

Wall Street Journal: How Insurance Spat Further Frayed
U.S.-French Ties.

In a highly humiliating move, the French government was recently
forced to plead guilty in U.S. District Court in California to fraud
in connection with French bank Credit Lyonnais's 12-year-old
acquisition of the U.S. insurer. It was a costly admission: The plea
negotiated with American prosecutors came with a $770 million fine --
the biggest criminal settlement in U.S. history.

Credit Lyonnais admitted it had circumvented laws barring it from
owning a U.S. insurer by using a consortium of French investors to
buy Executive Life and its ailing bond portfolio. When the bonds
rebounded, the bank and French billionaire Francois Pinault reaped a
$2.54 billion profit. France itself also was tarnished because a
French government agency admitted it had helped cover up the fraud.

The case has tracked the steep decline in French-American
relations during the Bush administration. Initially seen as an
obscure affair, the dispute became so charged that it aggravated the
rift between Paris and Washington opened by last year's diplomatic
clash over Iraq.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun is hoping that Vice
Premier Lin Hsin-i and Executive Yuan Secretary-General Liu Shih-fang
will be kept in their posts in the upcoming new Cabinet, the
Executive Yuan spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung quoted the premier as saying that Lin, a business
executive of a motor company before he was invited into the Cabinet,
is a rare talent who would be difficult to replace.</P>
      <P>The premier will also meet with Liu Saturday to try to persuade
her to stay, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that over the past two years, the Cabinet under the
three leaders has operated smoothly, with Yu setting the course, Lin
coordinating financial and economic affairs and Liu in charge of
communication and implementation.</P>
      <P>If Lin and Liu insist on leaving, the premier will respect their
wishes, but in the future, the roles of the premier, vice premier and
secretary-general will be to run the various work divisions and
complementary principles in the most efficient manner possible, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Asked if two other female Cabinet-level officials -- Council for
Hakka Affairs Chairwoman Yeh Chu-lan and Council of Labor Affairs
Chairwoman Chen Chu -- will be promoted to vice premier positions to
replace Lin if he insists on leaving, the spokesman said only that
the premier will promote more female Cabinet members, giving them
more power in the decision making process.</P>
      <P>Lin's words came as the Cabinet prepares to resign en masse
according to the Constitution prior to President Chen Shui-bian's May
20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>The interior minister and the foreign affairs minister have
already been replaced, while National Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min

    <HEADLINE>DAUNTING VOTE RECOUNT BEGINS CRUCIAL STEP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The daunting task of recounting the March
20 presidential election votes began a crucial step Friday after the
rival camps presented name lists of their representatives that will
take part in the recount process.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) presented the Taiwan High Court with the
names of 312 lawyers, while President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu presented a list of around 400 lawyers.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chi-chun, one of the "pan-blue alliance" lawyers, said
that the alliance will provide additional lawyers in the next few
days because the alliance cannot be sure if all lawyers will be able
to go through the long counting process.</P>
      <P>He estimated that if a recount team can tally 4,000 votes a day,
it will take about 14 days to complete the recount of more than 13
million votes cast.</P>
      <P>Lee Yi-kuang, the "pan-blue alliance" lawyer who presented the
name list, also presented his views on the standard for verifying
votes -- especially three stamp patterns that the Central Election
Commission (CEC) has designated as "invalid" votes -- and expressed
the hope that district courts will first list the contentious votes
that the court can determine later.</P>
      <P>Accounting to the prior consensus reached between the rival
teams, each recount team of around eight people will comprise one
lawyer or trainee lawyer from each of the rival teams,
representatives from a district court (judge, court clerk, recording
clerk or bailiff), and representatives from the CEC.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court will coordinate with the two rival teams on
matters concerning the recount in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Chinese-American entrepreneur who promised to donate
NT$100 million (US$3.03 million) to pay for the vote recount so that
post-election disputes could end quickly has decided to commission a
private judicial reform committee to handle the money.</P>
      <P>Representatives of David Sun, co-founder of Kingston Technology
Corp., and the reform committee, signed a contract Friday stating
that the committee will use the money after the High Court finalizes
the details and expenses of the recount.</P>
      <P>The KMT-PFP requested a judicial recount rather than an
administration recount by the CEC because it distrusts the CEC,
claiming that it wavered in the runup to the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The recount is one of two demands by the "pan-blue alliance"
since its candidate, Lien Chan, lost the election by a narrow margin
of 29,518 to President Chen Shui-bian. The other demand is to nullify
the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Supporters of the alliance have since staged several often
violent mass rallies to protest what they perceive as an "unfair
election" marred by so-called voting irregularities and the
election-eve shooting of Chen and his running mate, Vice President
Annette Lu. The shooting swayed the election in Chen's favor, they
claim.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW FOREIGN MINISTER OUTLINES VISION,  AGENDA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Foreign Affairs Minister Chen Tan-sun
said Friday he will uphold "three insistences" in performing his duty
as the nation's diplomatic chief.</P>
      <P>"The three insistences are maintaining our nation's sovereign
status, maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and
participating in international cooperative projects to fulfill our
international obligations," Chen said at a changeover ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chen, a U.S.-trained physicist who entered domestic politics
after he returned to Taiwan in the early 1992 after working for
almost 20 years in the United States, also said at the ceremony that
he has long dreamed of integrating government and private resources
to let the world know that there is an island country in the West
Pacific called the Republic of China, which has stood firmly against
giant communist China.</P>
      <P>In the changeover ceremony, Chen took the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) official seals from his predecessor, Eugene Chien, who
resigned last week as a result of fallout surrounding the resignation
of American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairwoman Therese Shaheen, the
top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic
ties.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been a legislator and two-term magistrate of the
rural southern Taiwan county of Tainan, said that in the face of
mainland China's suppression, Taiwan's diplomatic work is always
fraught with tough challenges and difficulties.</P>
      <P>"I'll exercise prudence in carrying out my mission, " Chen said,
adding that he will use passion, energy and perseverance to fulfill
his duties.</P>
      <P>Chen further expounded on his insistence on maintaining Taiwan's
sovereign integrity, stressing that after undergoing three direct
presidential elections, as well as the first-ever transition of power
between different political parties in 2000, Taiwan has become a "100
percent" democratic country.</P>
      <P>With the deepening of democracy, Chen said, the people of Taiwan
have reached a consensus on "Taiwan first" and on a Taiwanese
identity.</P>
      <P>During his stint as foreign affairs minister, Chen said he will
do his utmost to promote Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations and
other major international organizations and non-government
organizations (NGOs) , as well as working to upgrade Taiwan's
international profile.</P>
      <P>Noting that maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait
is not only "Taiwan's insistence" but also a common policy in the
international community, Chen said stable and peaceful cross-strait
relations are critical to Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian
security.</P>
      <P>"Maintaining cross-strait peace and stability is not only in
Taiwan's interest but also in the international interest," Chen said,
adding that Taiwan will strengthen its security dialogues and
cooperation with the United States, Japan and Southeast Asian
countries in order to safeguard regional peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, Taiwan's democratic experience and
achievements are precious assets for Taiwan to forge cooperative ties
with major countries around the world.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA-affiliated Taiwan Foundation for Democracy can be a
good conduit for promoting international cooperation in democratic
reform and development," he added.</P>
      <P>In the future, Chen said, the MOFA will work to expand Taiwan's
participation in international cooperative programs in the security,
trade, economic and democratic development fields in order to
contribute to world peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chien noted that the heads of
state of 12 of the ROC's diplomatic allies will travel to Taiwan to
attend President Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inauguration for a second
four-year term.</P>
      <P>"They will come here to witness Taiwan's progress in democratic
development, " Chien said, adding that he is convinced that the MOFA
will score even more diplomatic achievements under his successor's
stewardship.</P>
      <P>At the changeover ceremony, Chen presented a "diplomacy medal" to
Chien in recognition of his contributions to the promotion of
Taiwan's foreign relations during his two-year stint.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GDP TO GROW BY 5.4 PERCENT FOR 2004: ESCAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, April 16 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) will
grow by 5.4 percent and 4.9 percent for 2004 and 2005, respectively,
according to a report released Friday by the United
Nations-affiliated Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP).</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan's economy will perform better in
these two years. The country's GDP increased by 3.3 percent in 2003,
while mainland China and South Korea registered growth of 9 percent
and 3 precent, respectively. The mainland's fast growth did not pay
off the poorer ratios posted by Taiwan and South Korea last year,
with the region's GDP averaging a ratio lower than the 2002 level of
6.4 percent.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the overall outlook for economic development in the
Asia-Pacific region this year is optimistic, the report says, adding
that the economies of Taiwan and South Korea are steadily recovering
but pointing out that political situations may affect their economic
performance.</P>
      <P>The economies in East Asia and Northeast Asia, including mainland
China, Hong Kong, Mongolia, South Korea and Taiwan, will register an
average GDP growth of 6.6 percent for 2004, with mainland China
expected to outperform others with an 8.5 percent growth rate.</P>
      <P>However, the report warns that continued snowballing financial
deficits are an issue of major concern in the short term for
countries in the region. A cumulative public debt will result in
stronger pressure to push up key interest rates and lead to greater
investment risks.</P>
      <P>The ESCAP suggests that Asia-Pacific countries launch fiscal
reform across the board to lower their debt levels in comparison with
their GDP growth rates.</P>

      <P>A business and industrial mission from
Taiwan is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia from May 6 to promote
bilateral economic ties, the English-language Arab News reported
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan business and industrial mission, to be comprised of
executives from 43 manufacturing companies and officials from the

      <P>The 2003 GITEX attracted some 70,000 visitors, TAITRA officials
said, adding that the number of visitors to the show is expected to
be larger this year as economies in the Middle East have been

      <P>The Taiwan mission, which will also include traders and suppliers
of rubber products, auto parts, furniture, construction materials,
hardware and machinery, will also visit the west Saudi Arabian city

    <HEADLINE>CEPD RULES OUT POSSIBILITY OF SHORT-TERM INFLATIONARY PRESSURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite soaring commodity prices in the
domestic market, there will be no problem of inflation in the short
term, a spokesman for the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of an assessment carried out by the CEPD's
Economic Research Department, the spokesman said that a 10 percent
hike in steel prices will result in a 0.85 percent increase in
commodity wholesale prices, particularly in the industrial sector. At
the same time, a 10 percent price hike in petroleum-related products
will lead to a 0.4 percent rise in consumer product prices, he added.</P>
      <P>Although oil and steel prices have surged since the beginning of
this year in Taiwan, the CEPD official said that the issue will only
have a limited impact on domestic commodity prices and he ruled out
the feasibility of inflation in the coming months.</P>
      <P>But he called on the public not to speculate, especially on the
prices of staple commodities, and said that the government will
continue to closely monitor the price of retail packages of rice,
soybeans and toilet paper to stop any unreasonable price jumps in the
domestic market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CLOSELY MONITORING REPORTED BEIJING SPY CRACKDOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
closely monitor developments in a reported new mainland Chinese
crackdown on Taiwan espionage activities in mainland China, a senior
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong was responding to Hong Kong
media reports that Beijing uncovered a Taiwan spy ring shortly before
Taiwan's March 20 presidential election, arresting at least three
Taiwan intelligence agents and several People's Liberation Army (PLA)
officers.</P>
      <P>Noting that intelligence work is basically strategic warfare,
Chen said that media reports on the issue are usually not factual.</P>
      <P>"We'll keep a close watch on whether the report has any political
implications, " Chen said, adding that intelligence warfare often
involves using various ploys and misinformation to divide or sow
seeds of discord in the enemy camp.</P>
      <P>According to the Hong Kong media reports, two senior PLA air
force officers were arrested last month on charges of furnishing
Taiwan with information about mainland China's new generation of
Su-27 and Su-30 jetfighters and other military intelligence.</P>
      <P>The Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) under the Ministry of
National Defense declined to comment on the reports, but an anonymous
MIB officer said Thursday that his bureau was perusing them and has
not yet worked out why the reports claim that senior PLA officers
supposedly detained by Beijing were spying for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland China arrested several Taiwanese businessmen late last
year on charges of spying for Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior U.S. State Department press
officer on Thursday reiterated that the U.S. government has no
intention of amending the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) despite
Beijing's requests that the act be abolished.</P>
      <P>Adam Ereli, deputy spokesman of the State Department's Bureau of
Public Affairs, made the comments while responding to media questions
raised at the Foreign Press Center in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese leaders appealed to U.S. Vice President Dick
Cheney during his recent visit to Beijing that the U.S.
administration should abrogate the TRA and cease arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the TRA is a U.S. law and that U.S. sales of
defensive weapons to the island have proceeded under the framework of
American law, the official said that the United States does not have
any intention of altering the act.</P>
      <P>In response to questions regarding the Taiwan leadership's
intentions of amending the ROC Constitution by 2006, Ereli said that
the U.S. administration has not discussed the issue with Taiwan's
government nor received any explanation related to the issue from
Taipei.</P>
      <P>As to the Taiwan leadership's push to hold a referendum on a new
constitution for the island by 2008, Ereli said that U.S. opposition
to the island's holding of such a referendum remains unchanged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW 4.99 PERCENT FOR Q2</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to grow by
4.99 percent for the second quarter of this year, given that the
domestic economy has continued to regain momentum, the Chung-Hua
Institute for Economic Research (CIER) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The domestic economy registered brisk growth of 5.58 percent for
the first quarter of this year, largely as a result of the strong
recovery in the global economy, CIER President Chen Tian-jy said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since the beginning of this year, the global
economy has witnessed several interesting developments, including the
apparent rebounding of Japan's economy following ten years of
stagnation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy, according to Chen, has begun to pick up steam
since the third quarter of 2003, with its fourth quarter growth
topping those of its "Asian Dragon" counterparts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first quarter growth of 5.58 percent is the highest
quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2000, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Although second quarter growth will be strong, it is expected to
be slightly lower than the previous quarter's because of the
post-election social unrest which has been reflected in a volatile
stock market. The volatile bourse has in turn adversely affected
investors' confidence and consumers' willingness to spend, he added.</P>
      <P>The CIER has estimated Taiwan's economic growth for the whole of
2004 at 4.26 percent. The figure could turn out to be higher if
Taiwan's exports, particularly high-tech products, continue to boom
in the months to come, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ILAN GOVERNMENT REGISTERS TIAOYUTAIS AS PART OF TAIWAN TERRITORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan, April 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ilan County Government has recently formally
registered the uninhabited Tiaoyutai island group as territory under
the Republic of China's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The registration, with the National Property Bureau, of the
island group located some 200 kilometers east of Ilan's coast has
caused concern in the local government of the southern Japanese
island of Okinawa, which claims that the Tiaoyutais, known as the
Senkaku Islands in Japan, are part of Japanese territory.</P>
      <P>Ilan County Government officials said Friday that the
registration was made in accordance with a Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) plan, adding that if there are any disputes or controversies
over the matter, they should be settled by the MOI or the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>The officials from the Ilan County Land Administration Office
said the Ilan county government will respect any decisions made by
the central government on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai islets, located between Taiwan and Okinawa, are
claimed by Taiwan, mainland China and Japan.</P>
      <P>China ceded the Tiaoyutai island group to Japan in 1895 at a time
when the last Chinese imperial dynasty, the Qing dynasty, was in
sharp decline and losing territory to aggressive foreign powers.</P>
      <P>After World War II, the islands were put under U.S. control, at
which time the ROC government demanded their return. In 1972,
however, the United States returned the islands to the Japanese
government -- a decision that governments and patriotic groups on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait continue to protest.</P>
      <P>The Ilan County Land Administration Office incorporated the
Tiaoyutai islets under the jurisdiction of the Toucheng township
government in the northeastern county of Ilan in February of this
year to signify the ROC's sovereignty claim over the island group.</P>
      <P>Responding to the Ilan county government's move, the Japanese
government recently reiterated its sovereignty claim over the
Tiaoyutai island group and submitted a written statement on the
matter to the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 14.</P>
      <P>Yu Lien-hsing, director of the Ilan County Land Administration
Office, said the Ilan government registered the Tiaoyutai islands
under the county government's jurisdiction in accordance with
regulations stipulated by the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Yu said he believes that if there are any international disputes
or controversies over the island group, the MOI and the MOFA will
handle the issue appropriately and through diplomatic channels.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the southern port city of Kaohsiung, when
hosting the Taiwan Games in 1990, decided to include the Tiaoyutai
islands as one of the stops in a nationwide torch relay. Current
Premier Yu Shyi-kun, who was Ilan magistrate at that time, led the
Ilan torch relay team to the Tiaoyutai islands and reclaimed Taiwan's
sovereignty over the island group.</P>

Taiwan to reunite with their family members or to settle in
Taiwan through their marriage with local people will be required
to have their fingerprints taken by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The NPA was commenting on mainland Chinese and South Korean
press reports that Taiwan will fingerprint all mainland Chinese
visitors.</P>
      <P>"The reports were not correct," an NPA official said,

come to Taiwan for short visits will not be required to have their
fingerprints taken.</P>
      <P>The official said the newly revised Statute Governing

mainland Chinese who immigrate to Taiwan to be fingerprinted
when they apply for residency permits.</P>
      <P>"This requirement also applies to foreigners who want to take
permanent residence in Taiwan or be naturalized, and, therefore, is

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian paid a
visit to Chen Lan Kung Temple in Taichung County in central Taiwan
Saturday to thank Matsu -- the Chinese goddess of the sea -- for her
blessings in helping him win re-election.</P>
      <P>Chen's visit to Chen Lan Kung, one of Taiwan's most popular
Taoist temples dedicated to Matsu, came at the beginning of the
deity's annual pilgrimage to a sister temple in Chiayi County's
Hsinkang township.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the March 20 presidential election, Chen visited
Chen Lan Kung to pray for Matsu's blessings. At the time, he promised
to visit the temple again if he won re-election. Chen defeated the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" candidate Lien Chan by a razor-thin
margin.</P>
      <P>Chen said Matsu is the first deity that he has come to know since
his childhood.</P>
      <P>"For centuries, Matsu has protected fishermen from both sides of
the Taiwan Strait. She is also a common guardian of the 23 million
Taiwan people. With a common belief in Matsu, all Taiwan residents
will stand united and work together for the nation's development and
prosperity," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed his commitment to "unifying Taiwan,
stabilizing cross-strait relations, promoting social harmony, and
revving up the economy" during his second four-year term.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Che-nan, Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan,
Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, and Chen Lan Kung
Temple Chairman Yen Ching-piao, who is also a legislator, during his
visit to the temple in Taichung County's Tachia township.</P>
      <P>The Chen Lan Kung Matsu icon's annual pilgrimage to Feng Tien
Kung Temple in Hsinkang has become a major religious, tourist and
cultural event in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the eight-day journey which will span four counties,
namely Taichung, Changhua, Yunlin and Chiayi, a number of religious
rituals and traditional dance performances will be presented at major
temples in the four counties. Tens of thousands of Matsu followers
will accompany the deity on the journey.</P>
      <P>In connection with the Matu pilgrimage, the Taichung County
Government has organized an annual international cultural and tourism
festival to boost regional economic and cultural development.</P>
      <P>At Saturday's opening ceremony, 11 local and foreign
music and dancing troupes, including those from Australia, Japan,
Africa, India, Tibet and Latin America, performed exotic music and
dances along a thoroughfare to Chen Lan Kung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD WORK HARD ON STRENGTHENING COMPETITIVENESS: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April  17 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-raking official on mainland
China affairs said Saturday that Taiwan should strengthen its
domestic economy and competitiveness amid the growing globalization
and mainland China's magnetic effect in attracting foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made
the remarks at a symposium on the nation's economic and trade
policies toward mainland China held in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the globalization of mainland Chinese enterprises having a
great impact on many industrialized countries, Tsai said Taiwan
should maintain stable cross-strait ties and an internal balance,
including ethnic harmony and a narrow gap between the rich and poor
and among the different regions of the island, in the face of the
fierce global economic competition.</P>
      <P>On the much anticipated cross-strait direct transport links, Tsai
said she is concerned that the links will make the strong even
stronger and the weak even weaker, as well as accelerate the
relocation of Taiwan enterprises to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the March 20 presidential election, Tsai noted that the
Taiwan people's democratic maturity has overcome the political unrest
resulting from the controversial election, adding that if the
island's economic maturity can overcome its political turbulence,
then Taiwan will be considered as a model among democratic countries.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai admitted that a split has developed in Taiwan
society -- between the north and the south, judging in terms of
ethnicity and technological levels. She stressed that the government
should try its best to mend the differences in order to further
strengthen the country's competitiveness so that time will stand on
Taiwan's side in the economic battle between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TUNG BLOSSOM FESTIVAL KICKS OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Miaoli,  Taiwan,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2004 Tung Blossom Festival
kicked off Saturday with a fun-filled ceremony at the West Lake
Resort in the northern Taiwan county of Miaoli, a Hakka stronghold.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Council for Hakka Affairs (CHA)
Chairwoman Yeh Chu-lan said this year's Tung Blossom Festival
promises to be bigger and better than ever, with more than 600
cultural events to be held in 32 Hakka communities in Hsinchu,
Taoyuan, Miaoli, Taichung, Nantou and Taipei counties.</P>
      <P>This is the third consecutive year that the CHA has organized a
tung blossom festival to boost tourism and cultural development in
Taiwan's major Hakka communities, particularly those in the northern
parts of the island.</P>
      <P>Yeh said tung trees have steadfastly watched over the mountains
and hills where the Hakka people have historically made their homes
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Tung trees have always been a part of Hakka culture, so we have
'adopted' the tung blossom as a symbol of Hakka culture, " Yeh said,
referring to the choice of tung flowers as the focus of the festival.</P>
      <P>The trees, also known as paulownia trees in English, used to be
an important source of income for the Hakka, Yeh said, adding that
through the festival, the CHA hopes that tung trees will once again
bring prosperity to Hakka communities. Last year's festival drew an
estimated 180,000 tourists and generated NT$500 million in business
revenues.</P>
      <P>This year, Yeh said, the CHA has arranged 21 paths for
appreciating beautiful tung flowers in full bloom.</P>
      <P>"The festival offers tourists lavish opportunities to enjoy the
scene of 'snow in summer' created by the white tung flowers that look
like snowflakes," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>In addition to flower appreciation, Yeh said, the CHA has also
planned a variety of other festivities, including pottery-making,
ecological tours, tung seed oil extracting, painting exhibitions,
woodcarving shows, photo competitions, Hakka singing contests, Hakka
food tasting, and seminars on Hakka cultural heritage and literature.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the festival is the result of collaboration among
various government departments, local administrations and corporate
sponsors.</P>
      <P>"We hope the annual tung blossom festival can help enrich local
cultural activities and promote tourism and economic development in
major Hakka communities," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>She also encouraged tourists to learn some basic conversational
Hakka during their trips to Hakka communities to experience Taiwan's
cultural diversity and the beauty of Hakka culture.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony began with a traditional Hakka drum
performance. Yeh then led other senior officials attending the
ceremony, including Taiwan Provincial Government Chairman Lin
Kuang-hua, Vice Minister of the Interior Lee Chin-yung and Vice
Minister of Transportation and Communications Chang Chia-chu, in
greeting Mother Nature with tung flowers and praying for Taiwan's
well-being.</P>
      <P>After the opening ceremony, several Hakka singers and child
choirs sang Hakka folk songs to entertain tourists. Some Hakka poets
presented their own creations praising tung flowers and the beautiful
scenery in and around Hakka communities.</P>
      <P>This year's Tung Blossom Festival will last through May 16.
Couples will be able to get married in a group ceremony with a tung
flower theme. A number of gift items in tung flower motifs, including
lunch boxes and wine, will be marketed in connection with the
festival. State-owned Chunghwa Telecom will sell phone cards bearing
the motifs of the tung flower. More travel tips are available at the
Web site www.hakka.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>The flourishing of tung trees, also known as tung oil trees and
bearing the academic name of aluerites fordii hemi, on the mountain
regions in northern Taiwan was described as a "beautiful fallacy"
made decades ago.</P>
      <P>With a view to cashing in on the thriving demand for wooden
furniture materials to be exported to Japan, farmers in the Taoyuan,
Hsinchu and Miaoli areas started planting wutung trees (firmiana
simplex, commonly named Chinese parasol tree) in the 1960s. But the
difficulty in growing wutung trees later forced many farmers to
switch to planting tung trees, which are much easier to take care of.
Both trees trace their roots to the Yangtze River area in China.</P>
      <P>After Japanese customers discovered it was the wrong kind of wood
and stopped purchasing from local suppliers, the tung oil trees were
left uncut.</P>
      <P>Three decades later, the trees are flourishing with profuse
blossoms in spring, having become a major tourist attraction in the
Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli area.</P>
      <P>The trees can still be used for carving, furniture and wood pulp.
The oil extracted from the seeds was used as a key ingredient for
varnish in olden days, and it remains a must for Hakka people who
produce hand-made umbrellas with oil paper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEMINAR ON NEW E.U. MEMBERS TO BE HELD IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A seminar aimed at preparing local
companies for venturing into the markets of the ten soon-to-be
members of the European Union will open April 22, economics officials
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Angela T. Chu, director general of the Industrial Development and
Investment Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said next
month's entry of 10 new members into the European Union, namely
Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, will make it the world's
largest economic entity, with a population of 450 million, a gross
domestic product of US$10.4 trillion, and a trade volume of US$4.8
trillion.</P>
      <P>The entry of the ten countries will bring about direct trade
opportunities totalling 10 billion euros (US$83.8 billion) for the
current E.U. members, and the newcomers' sound industrial
infrastructure and cheap workforce will inevitably squeeze out some
outside competitors.</P>
      <P>In order to break into the E.U. market, non-E.U. countries may
have to invest in E.U. states. In this case, the 10 newcomers offer a
favorable option, according to Chu.</P>
      <P>Among the 10 newcomers, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland,
which boast good industrial infrastructure and a high-quality
workforce, have been the first choice of many current E.U. member
states when considering investing overseas, Chu said.</P>
      <P>The Czech Republic is known for its textile, machinery and
car-manufacturing industries, while Hungary is famous for its
machinery industry, and Poland has well-developed textile and
machinery industries, Chu continued.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan companies have already set up plants in these three
countries as a bridgehead in exploring the E.U. market, Chu said.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage Taiwan businesspeople to venture into the
new horizons of the European Union, Chu said, his office is
organizing the seminar to introduce the business environment in the
new E.U. member states.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEDIA MONITORING GROUP URGES BOYCOTT OF TV STATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A self-proclaimed media monitoring group
called for a boycott in response to reckless news reporting by TV
stations regarding the March 20 presidential election and the
protests in Taipei that followed.</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-wei, a leader of the Audience Alliance for Media
Monitoring and a professor at National Chengchi University, said
that local TV stations unanimously inflated their vote counts for the
two candidates in the March 20 election during their live broadcasts
of the vote-counting process in attempts to show falsely that they
were ahead of other stations in summing up the results.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the alliance said that many TV stations extensively
covered the post-election protests in front of the Presidential
Office while neglecting many other important news stories. Their
unbalanced coverage of the incidents gave people a false perception
that the country was slipping into chaos, sending the stock market
into a nose dive and hurting the economy, it said.</P>
      <P>Naming CtiTV and ERA News TV as the most serious offenders, the
alliance urged advertisers not to run commercials on the two stations
between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. from April 26 to May 15 as a form of
protest.</P>
      <P>The alliance also urged the public not to buy anything advertised
during the above period on the two stations to press the two stations
to mend their ways.</P>
      <P>Liao Fu-hsun, the director of the CtiTV news department refused
to comment on the alliance' accusation, while Tai Chung-jen, a deputy
editor-in-chief at ERA News, said the station has responded to
similar criticism before and won't bother repeating it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>13 ILLEGAL MAINLAND CHINESE IMMIGRANTS SEIZED OFF EASTERN COAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung, Taiwan, April 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirteen illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants were seized in waters off Taitung County in eastern Taiwan
early Saturday, coast guard authorities said.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that human smuggling rings, also known
as "snakeheads, " have been discovered trying to smuggle mainland
Chinese immigrants into Taiwan via the island's eastern coast,
officials said.</P>
      <P>All of the seized immigrants are women, with the youngest being
only 17 years old. Two of them had on a previous occasion been
repatriated after being found to have come to Taiwan through marriage
of convenience to engage in the sex trade.</P>
      <P>The skipper of the fishing boat that ferried the illegal
immigrant group to Taitung, identified as Cheng Chi-ming, was
detained for questioning. Criminal investigators said they will try
to track down a man nicknamed A-sheng who had allegedly organized the
smuggling operations.</P>
      <P>The 13 illegal mainland immigrants are being detained at the
Taitung Police Bureau's detention center and awaiting repatriation.</P>
      <P>Last summer, six female mainlanders attempting to enter Taiwan
illegally were thrown overboard by human smugglers off Tunghsiao in
northwestern Taiwan to evade pursuing coast guard patrol ships.
Tragically, all six drowned.</P>
      <P>Coast guard authorities have since launched a "snakehead"-hunting
project and stepped up patrols in waters off the island's west coast.
Coast guard officials said they had received tips showing that
snakeheads planned to smuggle illegal mainland immigrants into Taiwan
from the east coast.</P>
      <P>"We have heightened our alert and intensified patrols in both the
western and eastern coastal regions to crack down on smuggling of
humans and contraband goods," said a coast guard official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SUPPORTERS SAID NOT VERY WILLING TO CARRY ROC FLAGS MAY 20</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DDP) official said Saturday that as far as he knows, DPP supporters
don't have much willingness to carry Republic of China flags during
the president's inauguration ceremony set for May 20.</P>
      <P>Liang Wen-chieh, deputy director of the DPP's Policy Research
Department, made the remarks in response to proposals made by DPP
lawmakers that supporters of the party carry national flags at the
inauguration ceremony as a move to contribute to ethnic harmony which
has been strained since the controversial March 20 election which
President Chen Shui-bian won by a slim margin.</P>
      <P>The DPP official noted that holding national flags has nothing to
do with ethnic problems and that it is hard to convince the party's
supporters to accept a national flag which is very similar to the
flag of the rival Kuomintang, which ruled Taiwan for half a century
before losing the 2000 presidential election to the DPP.</P>
      <P>Liang said the DPP legislators' proposal can be discussed, but
added that the DPP supporters haven't expressed much willingness to
accept it.</P>
      <P>Ethnic divisions in Taiwan society have been exacerbated in
almost every election, with politicians differentiating for their own
political gain between "native Taiwanese" and mainlanders who came to
Taiwan in 1949 after the Chinese civil war and their offspring.</P>
      <P>The "mainlanders" are traditionally supporters of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party, while the
"native Taiwanese" are inclined toward the "pan-green camp" of the
DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ASKS TO JOIN CHINA-U.S. WTO CONSULTATION MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April 16 (CNA)
(By C.S. Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has asked to attend a China-U.S.
consultation meeting on semi-conductor value added tax (VAT) set for
April 27 in Geneva, but it has not yet received any response from
Beijing, a well-placed source in Geneva said Friday.</P>
      <P>The source said that Beijing has not yet agreed to the
participation of Taiwan or several other WTO members, including the
European Union, Japan and Mexico, as third parties.</P>
      <P>Washington has requested the consultation meeting in accordance
with the WTO's Dispute Settlement Agreement, claiming that mainland
China has violated the organization's rules of "national treatment."</P>
      <P>"National treatment" is defined as any citizen of a party to a
contract that signs an agreement or a treaty having the same rights
and legal protections as citizens of any other party to the contract.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that mainland China-made and designed
semiconductors enjoy tax rebate treatment of up to 14 percent in
mainland China, Beijing has imposed a VAT of 17 percent on
semiconductor products from other countries, the source said.</P>
      <P>The source said that Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent
representative to the WTO, sent a letter on behalf of Taiwan's
government to delegations of the United State and mainland China in
Geneva as well as to the WTO's dispute settlement body at the
beginning of this month asking to attend the consultation meeting as
a "third party."</P>
      <P>A trade official of Taiwan's permanent mission to the WTO said
Friday that Taiwan's request to participate in the consultation
meeting is significant for Taiwan's semiconductor industry as well as
cross-strait interactions within the WTO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan attaches great importance to participation in the
consultation meeting since the island is one of mainland China's main
suppliers of semiconductor products, the official added.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that last year, Taiwan's semiconductor exports to
mainland China amounted to US$1.8 billion and that the growth rate of
the island's semiconductor exports to mainland China in the past three
years was 13.9 percent, 181.6 percent and 105.1 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Although interaction between Taipei and Beijing in the WTO has
not been smooth since the two became members of the organization, the
official said that he would not predict whether mainland China would
refuse Taiwan's request to attend the consultation meeting for
political reasons.</P>
      <P>He said that as of Friday, the mission had still not received any
response from the mainland Chinese delegation in Geneva, adding that
several other WTO members that hope to join the meeting are also
awaiting Beijing's reply.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, an observer in Geneva said he thinks a political
dispute could occur if Taiwan is excluded from the consultation
meeting while the European Union, Japan and Mexico are allowed to
join the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, EBRD OFFICIALS MEET FOR BILATERAL CONSULTATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan official delegation met with
senior officials from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) Saturday to discuss ways of promoting bilateral
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Tien Hung-mao, Taiwan's representative in London, and EBRD
Chairman Jean Lemierre and their respective group members reached a
consensus after a brief meeting, agreeing that Taiwan will render
assistance to the EBRD in facilitating development of small- and
medium-sized enterprises in countries that the EBRD are helping
financially.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held on the eve of the annual meeting of the
European Bank's Board of Directors.</P>
      <P>Lemierre thanked Taiwan for its assistance in developing market
economies in former communist countries in Central and Eastern
Europe. He said it is keenly hoped that both sides will continue to
bolster the bilateral cooperation in years to come.</P>
      <P>Lemierre said he was in Taiwan three years ago. Although it was a
short eight-hour visit, he said, he had an opportunity to gain a
better understanding of Taiwan's economic strength and its
willingness to share.</P>
      <P>He said he has also visited mainland China and there he was
impressed with an energized economy and fast-growing industrial
development.</P>
      <P>Tien, in turn told Lemierre that about 70 percent of mainland
China's information technology products have been churned out by
Taiwan-invested manufacturing companies.</P>
      <P>Tien invited Lemierre and other EBRD ranking officials to visit
Taiwan in the latter part of May to take part in President Chen
Shui-bian's inauguration ceremony and to view again Taiwan's
vibrancy.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation, consisting of financial officials and
diplomats, will also attend the 13th annual meeting of the EBRD in
London from Sunday to Monday, including its Board of Directors'
meeting, a business forum and a donors meeting.</P>
      <P>Tien said before the meeting that Taiwan shares the EBRD's aim of
promoting democracy and market economies and looks forward to closer
cooperation with the EBRD on the basis of reciprocity. Founded in
1991 following the collapse of communism in Eastern and Central
Europe, the EBRD has used the tool of investment to help build market
economies and democracies in 27 countries from Central Europe to
Central Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to cooperate with the EBRD in 1991, and it has
donated more than US$21 million to the bank since that time. In May
2003, Tien and his Taiwan delegation attended the EBRD annual meeting
held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. During which, Tien, on behalf of
Taiwan, endorsed an agreement with Lemierre, committing one million
euros to an EBRD fund to finance infrastructure development in
Mongolia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan funds have helped the EBRD to expand its operations and
have given Taiwan the valuable opportunity to rub shoulders with EBRD
members. Taiwan was able to set up an office within the EBRD in
February of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ORDERS ADVANCED OCEAN BOTTOM SEISMOMETERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has ordered four advanced ocean
bottom seismometers from the United States to help measure quakes
taking place at sea, a researcher from the nation's highest research
institute said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Pen-yuan, deputy director of the Institute of Earth Sciences
of Academia Sinica, said that Taiwan has an adequate number of
earthquake observation stations on land, and substantial results have
been achieved in the research of earthquakes, plate structures and
movements, but it lags in measurements of earthquake taking place at
sea.</P>
      <P>Kuo noted that there were records of disasters on land brought
about by quakes at sea off eastern Taiwan, most notably the incident
that took place in March 2002, when a quake measuring 6.8 on the
Richter scale took place 10 kilometers deep at sea and scores of
kilometers off Hualien, eastern Taiwan, resulting in the crane for
the Taipei 101, the world's tallest building which is still under
construction, to fall to the ground, killing four people.</P>
      <P>"This shows that Taiwan's measurements of temblors at sea is not
sufficient, and that it has to step up the information collection of
quake at seas, " Kuo said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said that eastern Taiwan sits on the joint of the
Euro-Asian and the Philippines plates, and that the plate movement is
one of the major reasons for quakes, and the rupture of the faults at
sea is what the seismologist want to know most about.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that Academia Sinica is cooperating with Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution of Massachusetts to build the four ocean
bottom seismometers.</P>
      <P>The construction of the four seismometers is expected to begin
this September, and they will be shipped back to Taiwan at the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that the initial plan calls for the four seismometers to
be placed 4,000 meters deep at sea and 150 kilometers off eastern
Taiwan, and they would probably be placed in the southern Taiwan
Strait, and off the cities of Taitung, Hualien and Ilan.</P>
      <P>The Academia Sinica will work with colleges and universities to
decide the exact locations, the use of the information as well as the
strengthening of international cooperation.</P>

      <P>To cope with the rapidly changing
economic situation both at home and abroad, Taiwan is seeking
cooperation from Singapore to promote the distribution industry to
expand mutual business opportunities, a source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of Taiwan's strategic position and strong
manufacturing capabilities, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the semiofficial Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA) have planned a seminar for April
22 in which industry executives of the two countries will get
together to try to create cooperative ventures, a spokesman for the
TAITRA Kaohisung office said.</P>
      <P>To create new horizons for the continued survival and development

Asia, thanks to its key location and a strong industrial base, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, the largest city in southern Taiwan, is specially
suited for promotion of the distribution industry because of its
various ports and export processing zones and a planned free port
trade zone at the Kaohsiung Port, he noted.</P>
      <P>With this aim in mind, the BOFT and the TAITRA have taken a
concerted move to sponsor the seminar for the domestic distribution
industry in the hope of helping it catch up on the world's latest

e-commerce in order to develop it into a full-dimensioned and
service-oriented sector, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR TO REGAIN MOMENTUM GRADUALLY: BANKING INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of last week's fluctuations as
a result of the U. S. dollar's marked rise, the new Taiwan dollar
will regain momentum gradually this week, sources from the banking
industry said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The local currency is expected to regain strength against the
greenback this week in the 32.85-33.05 range this week, as the
rebounding trends of the U. S. dollar are likely to slow down in the
days ahead due to a lower than expected consumer price index made
public Friday by the U.S. authorities, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Against a strongly appreciating Japanese yen early last week, the
new Taiwan dollar once gained in value against the U.S. dollar
jumping to a three-year high of 32.798 during a trading session. But
an appreciating U.S. dollar prompted by the release of optimistic
U.S. economic indexes later the same week pushed down the Japanese
yen to lose in value at 109 against the greenback.</P>
      <P>A depreciating Japanese yen also brought down the value of the
new Taiwan dollar, which fell from 32.8 against the U.S. dollar to
below the 33 mark. The local currency lost a total of NT$0.217 in
value against the greenback Wednesday and Thursday, with it closing
NT$0.04 higher at 32.975 Friday.</P>
      <P>With a weaker Japanese yen pegging to a stabilizing U.S. dollar
this week, the new Taiwan dollar will remain largely unchanged and
gradually regain momentum, the sources forecast.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's Central Bank of China has not intervened to decide
the local currency's value in recent weeks, the sources predicted
that it will still adopt a hands-off policy in the foreseeable future
as long as the new Taiwan dollar fluctuates within a reasonable
range.</P>
      <P>Should the Japanese yen remains stable at between 106 and 109
against the U.S. dollar, the new Taiwan dollar will also remain
little changed as well, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan urged the Legislative
Yuan Monday to approve during this legislative session its request
for NT$500 billion (US$14.98 billion) over five years for 10 major
projects.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said that if
the legislature cannot reach a decision during this session, then the
Executive Yuan hopes it will hold an extraordinary session to discuss
the budget.</P>
      <P>As long as the Legislative Yuan approves the budget, the
Executive Yuan will not mind if the total amount of the budget is
somewhat cut, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Noting that half of the budget will go to transportation
projects, Lin said that if the budget is scuttled by the Legislative
Yuan, some of the country's important transportation projects will be
affected, including the construction and expansion of mass rapid
transit systems in Kaohsiung and Taipei.</P>
      <P>In that case, Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications
Tsai Duei said, the two municipal cities will have to finance the
construction with their own funds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PREMIER REFUTES REPORTS ABOUT GOING TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i said Monday that
it is unlikely that he will pursue another career in mainland China
after he steps down from his civil service post.</P>
      <P>Lin, who concurrently serves as chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , made the remarks after a
CEPD meeting to refute media reports that he might go to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible for me to go in the capacity of a businessman
and pursue another career there," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As a civil servant, he said, he had to report to the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) before he could even
accompany his wife on a pilgrimage to mainland China's Putuo
Mountain, so it would not be possible for him to obtain permission to
work there after stepping down.</P>
      <P>Lin, a successful businessman before he was invited to enter
politics, declined Premier Yu Shyi-kun's invitation to stay on in his
post, saying that the economy is on a rebound and that he feels his
task at this stage has been completed.</P>
      <P>Sources in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said that
it is possible Lin might be asked to serve as a presidential adviser
or as chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF).</P>
      <P>The sources said that the present SEF chairman, octogenarian Koo
Chen-fu, has expressed his desire to step down because of his age.
Lin's wide connections in the business world, and his familiarity
with government policies during his term as vice premier,
would make him a suitable candidate for the post left vacant by
Koo's retirement.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin is not a DPP member, which would be more
acceptable to the mainland leadership, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Yu's Cabinet will resign en masse May 5 according to tradition
before the May 20 presidential inauguration. The new Cabinet lineup
has largely been mapped out.</P>

addressed concerning the development of baseball in Taiwan, including
the dilapidated stadium and how to lay a solid framework for baseball
games.</P>
      <P>In response to their suggestions, Chen said that the four top
priorities will be to issue a sports lottery, build new stadiums,

      <P>Taiwan is very willing to take part in the
reconstruction program led by the United States in Iraq as part of
its efforts to assist in rebuilding a democratic Iraq, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Richard Shih said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks in response to an invitation from the

take part in a seminar sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce
April 28 in Seoul to seek cooperative opportunities as subcontractors

      <P>Taiwan appreciates the goodwill gesture made by the United States
and will be very happy to see Taiwan companies participate in Iraq's
reconstruction, Shih said, adding that Taiwan is determined to gain a
presence in the task along with other countries as part of its

said that the fund has rescued 44 failed banks from bankruptcy by
paying off NT$89.8 billion (US$2.72 billion)-worth of bad loans, but
he noted that there are still several insolvent banks that need to be
dealt with, making it necessary to extend the fund for another year.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
expressed concern about a trip by a Vietnamese tour group to the
disputed Spratly Islands, a MOFA spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Richard Shih said the ministry has called the director of the
Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei to urge him to convey
to the Vietnamese government the message that it should exercise
self-restraint so as not to trigger regional tensions.</P>
      <P>Wire reports said that Vietnamese government announced March 25
that it had decided to open the disputed archipelago to tour groups,
drawing concern from Taiwan, mainland China, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Brunei, all of which claim all or part of the island
group.</P>
      <P>Reports said that a boatload of Vietnamese -- including 60
tourists and 40 "invited" officials left a port in the southern
business capital of Ho Chi Minh City Monday for the inaugural voyage
to Hanoi's military outposts in the Spratly Islands, which straddle
vital shipping lanes and fishing grounds and are believed to contain
vast oil and gas reserves.</P>
      <P>Shih said the MOFA sent messages between late March and early
April to its Vietnam representative office -- the Taipei Economic &amp;
Cultural Office in Hanoi -- to express the government's concern and
to reaffirm that Taiwan has sovereignty over the archipelago.</P>
      <P>Lin Sung-huan, director-general of MOFA's Department of East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, also called the director of the Vietnam
Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei twice to express the concern,
to be told that it is purely a tourism activity and that the
Vietnamese government has no intention of triggering regional
tensions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintains a manned military outpost on Taiping Island, the
largest of the island group.</P>
      <P>Shih said the MOFA also expressed regret that Taiwan is excluded
from a multilateral mechanism between the members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and mainland China, a situation it
described as "most inappropriate."</P>
      <P>Taiwan urges ASEAN to address the fact that it is one of the
claimants and should help it join the multilateral mechanism so that
the concerned parties can find solutions to disputes through peaceful
dialogue in a rational and self-restrained manner.</P>

      <P>Chen has said on several occasions since his March 20 re-election
that he will honor his campaign promise to write a new constitution
in 2006 for implementation in 2008 through a referendum. Beijing has
blasted Chen's plan as it regards the plan as a step toward declaring
Taiwan independence or permanent separation from mainland China -- a
move that could provoke a military attack by Beijing.</P>
      <P>If Beijing does attack Taiwan, Terrill said, it would certainly
inflict grave losses to the mainland, a worst-case scenario that is
unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, Taiwan must still maintain its
self-defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>Since Chen has pledged to be a president for all the Taiwan
people, Terrill went on, he must take the well-being and mainstream
opinion of all Taiwan people into account while carrying out his
reform agenda.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan indeed needs a new constitution suitable for
its present status quo, Terrill said, Beijing's leaders do not
necessarily understand this need.</P>
      <P>For mainland China, Terrill said, a change to Taiwan's
Constitution would affect Beijing's theory that Taiwan is an integral
part of the mainland.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan's long-term development, Terrill said Chen should give
priority to addressing Taiwan's social and economic development
issues for the moment.</P>
      <P>Although Chen won re-election by slightly more than half of the
vote, Terrill said, he must first ascertain the people's true
aspirations before moving toward writing a brand new constitution.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Terrill went on that he does not think the U.S.
government will forever insist on its "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>He said developments in Hong Kong since its return to Beijing's
rule have prompted some politicians in Washington, D.C.
to dislike talking about "one China" any more.</P>
      <P>Terrill further said the U.S. government has consistently
stressed that Taiwan's future, regardless of unification or
independence, should be determined by the people of Taiwan
themselves.</P>
      <P>As to whether the result of the U.S. presidential election this
November will affect Taipei-Washington ties, Terrill said that if
Senator John Kerry wins the election, Taiwan will have to be wary of
Kerry's previous statement that he feels the "one country, two
systems" formula would be good for Taiwan. Numerous opinion surveys
have shown that Beijing's "one country, two systems" unification
scheme is unacceptable to the majority of Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>If incumbent President George W. Bush wins re-election, Terrill
said, Taiwan-U.S. interaction will remain cordial.</P>
      <P>Terrill was previously regarded as a pro-Beijing scholar, but his
view on China changed fundamentally after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre
in which Beijing used tanks to crush a student-led pro-democracy
demonstration. Terrill then wrote a book titled "The New Chinese
Empire, " which was nominated for the Los Angeles Times' annual book
award.</P>

the Philippines in the wake of an attack on a building in Manila in
which a foreign oil firm is located.</P>
      <P>Wu issued the call after suspected communist guerrillas fired a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some may joke that it's never too late to
start smoking, but for 89-year-old Huang He-ping, it's never too late
to quit.</P>
      <P>Huang is the oldest participant in Taipei's "quit and win"
competition aimed at getting people to stop smoking cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Huang said Monday that as a smoker for the past 73 years, "I've
quit smoking more than 300 times, but haven't succeeded yet in really
stopping." He said that this time might be the one, given that there
is a big case prize as an incentive.</P>
      <P>Huang, who worked as reporter and policeman when he was young,
said that the high pressure of the two jobs started him smoking. He
used to smoke a pack and half of cigarettes a day, and still smokes
around a dozen cigarettes daily.</P>
      <P>"Quitting smoking is like writing an article, and one has to
undergo some excruciating trial, " Huang said, adding that the best
way to quit smoking is to go to public places where you can't bother
others with your smoking. But the urge to smoke surfaces later, he
added, when you get back home or go outdoors.</P>
      <P>He said that going cold turkey has never worked for him and only
led to heavier smoking. Cutting back gradually is Huang's advice.</P>
      <P>Huang's wife said that her husband did quit smoking several
times, but could only manage to abstain from tobacco for four or five
days at a stretch. She said that the "quit and win" competition has
given him the motivation to "give it a try one more time."</P>
      <P>The Taipei event is one of the "quit and win" competitions held
islandwide in conjunction with the World No Tobacco Day on May 31.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One year after the implementation of
Taipei's tree-protection regulations, the city's Cultural Affairs
Bureau is happy to see that the concept of protecting trees is more
widespread among the public.</P>
      <P>A tree protection committee inaugurated last August has convened
several meetings and reviewed 23 cases, saving a great many old trees
in the process.</P>
      <P>Committee members recalled their first case, which involved the
Shihpai Elementary School in Peitou when the school and a
construction company decided that they would fell six small-leaf figs
to make way for new classrooms and underground parking lots.</P>
      <P>However, scholars and experts intervened and after discussions,
saved the six trees, proving that campus construction can co-exist
with green resources.</P>
      <P>The most notable case of community involvement involved the
protection of an old tree in Chitung Street. Two elementary school
students wrote to Liao Hsien-hao, then director of Taipei's Cultural
Affairs Bureau, and attached with the letter the signatures of local
community residents and arts and literary figures. Their efforts
helped a 50-year-old lungan tree from being cut down by a
construction company.</P>
      <P>Liao met with environmental experts, elementary school
students, and community representatives to exchange experiences in
protecting trees Monday in a press conference marking the first
anniversary of the passing of the tree-protection regulations.</P>
      <P>He said that the bureau is now mulling several measures to help
trees, including setting up a file for protected trees, nurturing and
training of tree rangers, preserving green resources of old Japanese
dormitories, and planning trails by old trees in Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH CONDUCTING SURVEY ON HEALTH OF BABIES BORN TO FOREIGN BRIDES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Monday
it is conducting a large-scale survey on the health situation of
infants born to foreign and mainland Chinese brides married to Taiwan
men.</P>
      <P>"The survey is expected to help us clarify misinformation or
misperceptions about health conditions of babies born to foreign and
mainland brides, " said an official with the DOH's Bureau of Health
Promotion.</P>
      <P>There have been media reports that foreign and mainland brides are
more likely to give birth to physically or mentally-challenged
children. "Such reports may be just a result of bias," the official
said.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, the official said, 244,228 new births
were reported in 2002, of which 242,105 were live births. Among the
newborns, 8 percent weighed less than 2,500 grams and 9 percent were
prematurely born.</P>
      <P>In the same year, 31,296 mainland and foreign brides gave birth
and 31,124 of them were live births. Among live babies born to
foreign and mainland brides, only 6.6 percent weighed below the
standard and 6.8 percent were prematurely born.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the officials said, the ratios of live births and
premature births by mainland and foreign brides showed similar
trends to those recorded in 2002.</P>
      <P>Between 2001 and 2002, the official said, babies born to foreign
and mainland brides accounted for 10 percent to 12 percent of the
total newborns.</P>
      <P>Official tallies showed that the ratios of stillbirths and
premature births by Taiwan-born brides were all higher than the
ratios recorded by mainland and foreign brides during the same
period, the official noted.</P>
      <P>He said this phenomenon could be attributed in part to the fact
that the average childbearing age of Taiwan women has become older
than previously while foreign and mainland brides are generally
younger.</P>
      <P>With a view to clarify an apparently biased perception that
mainland and foreign brides are more likely to give birth to
handicapped or mentally-challenged children, the official said the
Bureau of Health Promotion is conducting a mass survey on health
conditions of babies born to foreign and mainland brides.</P>
      <P>"We should avoid classifying foreign and mainland brides in terms
of unfounded speculation or misperception. Pigeon-holing will only
prevent us from helping people overcome language barriers and
assimilate into local society," the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY TO MALAYSIA SURE OF PUBLIC ORDER IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kuala Lumpur,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Y. P. Chin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Representative Wu Wen-ya called on the
Malaysian people Monday to visit or invest in Taiwan as in the past,
as public order is fine in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at an alumni gathering attended by social
elite of Chinese original who are graduates from Taiwan-based
universities.</P>
      <P>Giving his assurances that the political situation in Taiwan has
fully stabilized and that there is no need to worry about public
order, Wu urged Malaysians to visit and to invest in Taiwan as they
did in the past because everything has returned to normal following
the recent disputes over the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, bilateral trade and investments between Taiwan
and Malaysia have been close and steady. Taiwan is Malaysia's
fifth-largest trading partner, while Malaysia is Taiwan's
eighth-largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>Last year, the two-way trade totaled US$7.8 billion, up by 7.1
percent over the 2002 level with Malaysia enjoying a trade surplus of
US$3 billion. The figure for the first three months of this year hit
around US$2.1 billion, thanks to an economic recovery taking shape in
both countries since the fourth quarter of last year.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Malaysia approved US$1.06 billion worth of Taiwan
investments, an increase of 14.7 percent over the 2002 level.
Taiwan's accumulative investment totals US$9.4 billion, making the
island the third-largest foreign investor in Malaysia only after the
United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>Wu hailed the outstanding performance in Malaysia of the Chinese
elite with educational backgrounds in Taiwan, especially their roles
in boosting trade and economic exchanges between the two countries,
and he also thanked them for their efforts in promoting the rights of
ethnic Chinese in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>In a similar meeting in Malacca, Wu also appealed for support of
the participants and asked them to get backing from the Malaysian
government for Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization
(WHO). Taiwan is applying to enter the world body as a health entity,
which he pointed out has nothing to do with the dispute related to
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The WHO is slated to hold its 57th General Assembly on May 17 in
Geneva.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A tiny intruder from mainland China is
costing pear-growers in Taiwan dearly this year and consumers may be
paying more at the grocery store for the fruit soon.</P>
      <P>Cacopsylla qianli -- first brought into Taiwan in 2001 by fruit
growers when illegally importing pear seedlings from mainland China
-- is eating out pear blossoms in major pear orchards across Taiwan,
literally nipping pear growth in the bud for this season, agriculture
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
(BAPHIQ) of the Council of Agriculture (COA) has responded by putting
about 4,800 hectares of pear orchards under a pest prevention
program.</P>
      <P>The pear-damaging pest is far from the only problem in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pomacea canaliculata, or golden apple snails, which were
misguidedly introduced into Taiwan as a potential food resource more
than 20 years ago, have become one of the most deadly pests in
Taiwan's rice paddies and other aquatic plantations.</P>
      <P>Golden apple snails have caused so much damage to Taiwan crops
that even a NT$130 million (US$3.93 million) COA annual budget has
made little difference. The problem is so sever that the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum has decided to convene an
international symposium on Pomacea canaliculata control and
prevention in Taiwan this coming October.</P>
      <P>Mikania micrantha Kunth, a vine-like plant that is known as the
"green cancer" and was inadvertently imported in 1970, has been
causing major biological damage to Taiwan's forests ever since. The
weed spreads rapidly, blanketing the canopies of any other plant and
effectively blocks the host from receiving enough light to survive.</P>
      <P>The Pine Wood Nematode, an imported quarantine pest infesting
pine trees and causing wilt disease, has been threatening the healthy
forestation of pine trees in mountainous areas around the island,
agricultural sources said.</P>
      <P>Fire ants, a newcomer first identified in Taiwan only last
October, are now directly affecting people, animals, plants and
crops.</P>
      <P>Among many others, those pests and species have not only caused
great damage to local crops, they have also hampered normal
development of the entire ecology of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ying, BAPHIQ deputy director, attributed the increasing
intrusion of imported pest species into Taiwan's environment and
agriculture mainly to increasing globalization, closer exchanges
between Taiwan and mainland China, and the fact that people in Taiwan
have been active travelers overseas.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday
Taiwan has consistently attached great importance to its relations
with the United States and that he will work even harder during his
second four-year term to further boost bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Montana Governor Judy
Martz who is heading a delegation of Montana State officials on a
trade promotion visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We treasure our relations with the United States. In the next
four years, we'll make continued efforts to further upgrade
Taiwan-U.S. relations," Chen told his guest.</P>
      <P>He further said his administration will make its communications
channels with U.S. authorities even smoother than before.</P>
      <P>"In the coming four years, I'll focus on promoting economic
development and political reforms. In any event, we hope that
Taiwan's success story will be an asset, rather than a liability, for
the United States," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>For her part, Martz congratulated Chen on his re-election and
invited Chen to visit Montana in the near future.</P>
      <P>Martz, an accomplished ice skater, was previously Montana's first
female lieutenant governor. She was finally elected as the state's
first female governor. Chen lauded Martz for her achievements in
creating jobs, promoting educational reforms and controlling budget
deficits during her tenure.</P>
      <P>Chen said Montana has maintained cordial relations with Taiwan.
He expressed his gratitude for the passage of resolutions by the
Montana State Senate and State House of Representatives last year in
support of Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Montana's fifth-largest trading partner. Montana has
maintained a representative office in Taipei since the early 1980s. A
Taiwan trade delegation signed a preliminary agreement on procurement
of wheat from Montana during its visit to the U.S. state last year.</P>
      <P>"All these point to close trade ties between Taiwan and Montana,"
Chen said, adding he believes that Martz's current visit will
contribute to further growth in Taiwan-Montana trade and economic
cooperation.</P>
      <P>New Minister of Foreign Affairs Mark Chen was also present at the
meeting. It marked the first time that Mark Chen has accompanied a
foreign dignitary to see President Chen since Mark Chen assumed
office last Friday.</P>
      <P>Mark Chen, a U.S.-trained physicist-turned-politician, had worked
at the U.S. federal government for many years before he returned to
Taiwan in the early 1990s. President Chen said Mark Chen's
appointment shows Taiwan's determination to further upgrade its
relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>Mark Chen succeeded Eugene Chien, who resigned over fallout
surrounding the recent resignation of the top U.S. liaison officer
with Taiwan in the absence of official diplomatic ties -- American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairwoman Therese Shaheen.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, director of the AIT Taipei office or the de facto
U.S. ambassador to Taiwan, was also present at President Chen's
meeting with Martz.</P>

(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian instructed law
enforcement agencies Tuesday to do their best to curb crime,
especially fraud and false kidnappings.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly meeting of the Central Standing Committee of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in his capacity as DPP
chairman, Chen said that the recent widespread cases of fraud and
hoax kidnappings using telephone networks have caused panic among the
general public and have seriously affected people's daily lives.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement agencies, including the police and the
prosecutors' offices, should make concerted efforts to fight these
forms of crime and bring the perpetrators to justice without mercy,
Chen directed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rioting in the aftermath of the March 20
presidential election, Chen urged law enforcement authorities to
investigate the cases and bring swiftly to justice those who tried to
create chaos in society under the guise of democracy.</P>
      <P>Along with the approaching legislative elections to be held in
December, the law enforcement authorities should also increase their
efforts to eliminate vote-buying in order to create a sound
environment for clean elections.</P>
      <P>The rule of law is the foundation of a democratic society, the
president stressed, adding that the basic rights of the people must
be protected.</P>
      <P>He also called on supporters of the opposition "pan blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) to
allow the election disputes to be settled by the judicial
authorities.</P>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance" supporters have staged a series of
sometimes violent protest rallies in the wake of the presidential
poll, which they describe as "unfair" after their candidate,
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, lost to Chen by a slim margin of 0.22
percent or 29,518 votes out of more than 13 million cast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER NAVY CHIEF ACQUITTED OF SHIELDING CORRUPT SUBORDINATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The former commander-in-chief of the navy,
retired Adm. Yeh Chang-tung, who was indicted for smothering a case
of corruption on the part of two junior officers during his term as
navy chief, was acquitted Tuesday of the charge of shielding corrupt
subordinates.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled that Yeh did not bring the two
junior officers to justice because their trial, even in a military
court at that time, would have exposed the navy's secret purchase of
four minesweepers from Germany and might have spoiled the whole deal
to the detriment of the country.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the judgment said, a military prosecutors'
investigation at that time concluded that the behavior of the two
junior officers did not constitute a crime and therefore, the
admiral's decision to discipline the two and force them to retire was
not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>The charge against one of the two junior officers in the case,
retired Commander Yuan Yu-fan, was thrown out because he was still a
naval officer when he committed the alleged crime and was under
investigation by the navy. Therefore, he is beyond the jurisdiction
of the civilian courts, according to the judgment of the Taipei
District Court.</P>
      <P>The other officer, retired Lieutenant Commander Peng Chi-kang,
was acquitted on a charge of corruption on the grounds that he had
"no idea" that 2,600 German marks he shared with Yuan were illegal
gains.</P>
      <P>The case arose from the navy's purchase of four minesweepers from
Germany in 1986.</P>
      <P>As an officer involved in the deal, Yuan embezzled some 7,000
marks between 1991 and 1992 and gave 1,300 marks to Peng, who helped
him withdraw the money from a British bank.</P>
      <P>Yeh was indicted in 2001 for covering up for Yuan and Peng.</P>
      <P>However, the case was only a sideshow in prosecutors' search for
alleged kickbacks involved in the country's purchase of six
Lafayette-class frigates from France in 1991.</P>
      <P>In that case, the alleged kickbacks have remained elusive,
despite a four-year investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CITIZEN SEEKS HELP TO STAY IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American citizen who has
overstayed his resident certificate in Taiwan for eight years and
faces the threat of deportation sought the assistance of a Taichung
county councilor Tuesday to help him obtain permanent residency or
citizenship in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>George Laverne Jennings Jr., 28, said he is willing to give up
his American citizenship so long as he can legally stay in Taiwan to
care for his Taiwanese mother.</P>
      <P>Jennings, who has lived in Taichung County's Tantzu township in
central Taiwan with his mother for many years, visited Taichung
County Councilor Lin Chu-wang Tuesday to ask for his help in
resolving the residency problem.</P>
      <P>Jennings was born in Colorado in 1976 to an American father and a
Taiwanese mother. His father, a soldier stationed at Chingchuankang
airbase in central Taiwan, married his mother in Taichung in 1971 and
the couple returned to the United States in 1975.</P>
      <P>Jennings' mother took him back to Taiwan after his father died in
1984. He has since lived in Tantzu and has completed elementary,
junior high and senior high school education.</P>
      <P>His residence certificate expired eight years ago, but he never
paid any attention to the matter and the residency issue surfaced
only after he went to see a doctor recently and came to learn that he
was not covered by the national health insurance program.</P>
      <P>Some people have suggested that Jennings, who is nicknamed "Hsiao
Hai," should apply for ROC citizenship, but he must first resolve his
overstay issue. According to the nation's newly revised
naturalization law, Jennings has to leave Taiwan for eight years
before he can come to Taiwan again to apply for ROC citizenship.</P>
      <P>Lin said Jennings is a very filial son and has assisted his
mother, now in her 60s, in managing a barber's shop. Lin said he
hopes the relevant government agencies can help Jennings resolve his
residency and identification problems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG PEOPLE LOSING CONFIDENCE IN BEIJING: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Mandy Wong and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Hong Kong have lost
confidence in Beijing following a ruling by its National People's
Congress (NPC) on their demand for electoral reform in the special
administrative region, according to the results of a survey released
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results made public by the University of
Hong Kong, a set of confidence indexes toward the central government
in Beijing among the people of Hong Kong have all dropped since the
NPC ruled that any political reforms in the former British colony
must be approved in advance by Beijing, including their demand to
directly elect their chief executive and all lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The poll finds that 29 percent of the people surveyed -- a rise
of 6 percent compared to a similar survey carried out in February --
claim they have no confidence in the future of Hong Kong, a contrast
to 58 percent who hold the opposite view.</P>
      <P>About 28 percent of the respondents said they have confidence in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government -- a fall of 6
percent from the February survey.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 38 percent of the respondents said that they
believe in the central government in Beijing, a 5 percent decline
from the February level, while 25 percent said that they do not
believe in the Beijing regime, an increase of 3 percent, the survey
shows.</P>
      <P>In addition, some 37 percent -- a rise of 10 percent -- said they
do not have confidence in the "one country, two systems" formula put
into practice for Beijing's rule of Hong Kong, while 50 percent
expressed confidence in the system.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted in the middle of this month and surveyed a
total of 1,022 local residents.</P>
      <P>The ruling passed by the NPC prompted about 20,000 people to take
to the streets April 11 in Hong Kong to protest Beijing's refusal to
hear their clamor for electoral reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPTOELECTRONICS TO REACH NT$1 TRILLION PRODUCTION VALUE THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>the production value of the domestic
optoelectronics industry in 2004 will be over one trillion new Taiwan
dollars (US$30.3 billion) , according to a report by the Industrial
Technology Information Services (ITIS) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Production value in the first quarter of 2004 will reach
NT$234.16 billion, an increase of 19.1 percent year-on-year, with the
whole year's value to account for NT$1 trillion, a rise of 33.4
percent from the previous year, according to the ITIS.</P>
      <P>Based on the ITIS forecast, flat panel displays will have the
biggest operation value and the highest growth due to the global
economic recovery and fifth-generation TFT-LCD (thin film transistor
liquid crystal display) and STN-LCD (super twisted numeric liquid
crystal display) production lines. The production value in the first
quarter of this year stood at NT$132.33 billion, an increase of 27
percent year-on-year, with estimated annual value up to NT$551.87
billion, a surge of 63.6 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>In the optoelectronics components field, the production value in
the first quarter of 2004 amounted to NT$9.69 billion, a rise of 15.9
percent year-on-year, with estimated yearly value of NT$52.8 billion,
an increase of 34.7 percent from 2003, attributable to expanded
production of white and blue LEDs (light emitting diodes) and the
increasing popularity of digital imaging.</P>
      <P>The optical storage sector is also performing well, as Japanese
competitors in DVDs and DVD drives have ceased production and
subcontracted Taiwan manufacturers. The annual production value will
be up to NT$276.19 billion, a rise of 12.7 percent from a year
earlier.</P>
      <P>The optical input field is also performing optimistically thanks
to high demand for digital cameras and steady consumption of scanners
and PC cameras. The first quarter of 2004 accounted for NT$30.89
billion, an increase of 12 percent, with estimated yearly value
standing at NT$124.07 billion, an increase of 9.4 percent from the
previous year.</P>
      <P>The optical output field, however, might not do so well, as the
fax machine business is declining, although ink printers are still
popular. The first quarter of 2004 saw NT$5.69 billion in production
value, a decrease of 3.2 percent year-on-year, with estimated value
this year at NT$24.07 billion, a drop of 9.4 percent from a year
earlier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO FLESH OUT NEW CONSTITUTION PLAN IN INAUGURAL SPEECH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will expound on
his plan to write a new constitution for Taiwan in 2006 in his
inaugural speech to be delivered May 20, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Mark Chen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with lawmakers of the
opposition People First Party (PFP) . The meeting marked the first
time the new foreign minister had visited the PFP legislative caucus
since he assumed office last Friday.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, PFP legislators expressed concern about the
president's insistence on formulating a new constitution.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Chen said, the president's new
constitution initiative will be carried out under the cardinal
principle of safeguarding the Republic of China's sovereign status
with no fundamental change to Taiwan's present status quo.</P>
      <P>"Writing a new constitution is basically aimed at making the
existing Constitution more reasonable and complete, " Chen said,
adding that the president is expected to flesh out his new
constitution plan when he takes the oath May 20 for his second
four-year term.</P>
      <P>President Chen has said on many occasions before and after the
March 20 presidential election that he wants to rewrite the
Constitution to restructure the government and make it more
streamlined and efficient. According to the president's plan, the new
constitution would go into effect May 20, 2008, when the next
president takes office.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmakers said they are concerned about the plan because
Beijing regards a new constitution as a step toward de jure Taiwan
independence -- a move that could provoke a Beijing attack on the
island.</P>
      <P>Touching on the ROC's foreign policy, Chen said continuity and
predictability are critical features of a country's foreign policy.
Therefore, he said, the nation's foreign policy will not change
significantly in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The minister assured the PFP lawmakers that he will promote the
nation's external relations in line with the principles of
safeguarding the ROC's sovereign status, maintaining peace in the
Taiwan Strait and participating in major international organizations
and activities.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political negotiations among various
parties at the Legislative Yuan over the downsizing of the
legislature did not begin Tuesday because of the absence of lawmakers
from two leading opposition parties, the Kuomitnang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Representatives of the two parties didn't show up at all,
although they had agreed in principle to cut the number of the seats
in the legislature by a half.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yu Ching, one of the two Democratic Progressive Party
representatives to the negotiations said unless the negotiations were
completed before April 23, the chance of passing a constitutional
amendment proposal to halve the number of lawmakers in this
legislative session would be slim, so is the likelihood of having an
election of a National Assembly along with the year-end legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Only the National Assembly has the power to vote on
constitutional amendment proposals.</P>
      <P>Other negotiations over a proposal by the KMT and PFP to set up
a committee at the Legislative Yuan to examine the government's
response to the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian was
stalled too because of the opposition of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU).</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Chen Chien-ming said his party would back the two
opposition parties' idea only if they would support the formation of
a committee to examine the KMT's ill-gotten assets.</P>
      <P>However, these parties did agree to set up a committee to review
the government's decision in choosing a company to operate an
electronic toll-charge system on the country's two freeways, and
another committee to review decisions by the Ministry of Finance to
take over eight failed credit cooperatives.</P>
      <P>The two committees will be composed of lawmakers from different
parties in proportion to their seats in the legislature.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen will continue minesweeping
operation along the seashore of the outlying islets of Kinmen to help
the development of its tourism industry, Kinmen County Government
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that mines were deployed to defend mainland
China's attack on Kinmen, but with the easing of cross-strait
relations after the opening of direct trade and transportation links
between Kinmen and Fujian province in 2001, the mines have become
obstacles to develop local tourism.</P>
      <P>At the requests of the Kinmen county council, the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) has since 1998 cleared 16 mined areas covering
65,000 square meters, and will again review mine clearing in the
offshore areas of the islets.</P>
      <P>According to the MND plan, it will appropriate NT$468 million
(US$14.1 million) between 2006 and 2008 to clear 15 mine areas,
including 12 in Kinmen and three others in the outlying island of
Matsu.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Kinmen County Government and Garrison Command
on Tuesday began an inspection tour of the outlying islets of Kinmen,
hoping to set a priority for mine cleaning so that the operation will
coordinate with the local development.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen Garrison Command said that the next wave of mine
clearing will cover around 317,000 square meters, and that the
tourism development and safety of residents will be the top
consideration in deciding which areas will be cleared first.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense will act
in line with the government's policy regarding the Vietnamese
government's sending tourists to the disputed Spratly Islands in the
South China Sea, an defense ministry spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng made the remarks in
the wake of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement Monday to
convey the government's serious concern about the tourist ship
carrying 60 tourists and 40 invited officials to Hanoi's military
outposts on the Spratly Islands after leaving port from Ho Chi Minh
City.</P>
      <P>Foreign ministry officials said that the ministry has called
Hoang Nhu Ly, Vietnam's representative in Taipei, twice to urge him
to convey to the Vietnamese government the message that it should
exercise self-restraint so as not to trigger regional tensions.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the foreign ministry has expressed its stance to
Vietnam and that the defense ministry will act according to
government policy.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ministry has a contingency plan "to protect
our territorial claims."</P>
      <P>On the complaints by the Coast Guard Administration, which is in
charge of the defense of the Spratly Islands, that the air defense
equipment and ammunitions left by the Republic of China military are
old and dilapidated, he said the ministry will address the issue.</P>
      <P>Wire reports said the Vietnamese government's announcement in late
March that it had decided to open the disputed archipelago to tour
groups, has drawn concern from Taiwan, mainland China, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Brunei, all of which claim all or part of the island
group.</P>
      <P>Former Minister of the Interior Yu Chen-hsien traveled to the
uninhabited Chungchou Reef in August 2003 to raise a national flag of
the Republic of China in a show of Taiwan's territorial claim over
the Spratly Islands, which straddle vital shipping lanes and fishing
grounds and are believed to contain vast oil and gas reserves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH MINISTER TO LEAD LOBBY GROUP TO WHA ANNUAL MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen
Chien-jen is scheduled to lead a mission for Geneva next month to
lobby for international support for Taiwan's bid to become an
observer of the World Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>Chen's official delegation, as well as several Taiwan groups,
will be in Geneva to enhance the lobby drive during the 57th annual
conference of the WHA, marking the eighth time in a row that Taiwan
will try to become a WHA observer.</P>
      <P>Government sources declined to disclose Chen's exact itinerary in
Geneva on the grounds that Beijing is expected to continue this year
to obstruct Taiwan's bid to join the WHA -- the highest
decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO) -- as an
observer.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Shu-min, chairman of the private Foundation of
Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan, more than 100 people from
Taiwan, including officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are
expected to go to Geneva this year to amplify Taiwan's bid to obtain
observer status at the WHA.</P>
      <P>American Congressman Steve Chabot, a Republican from the state of
Ohio, submitted a draft bill to the House of Representatives March
24, saying it is absolutely imperative that Taiwan joins WHO
activities after the island was hard hit by outbreaks of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird flu, and advocated that Taiwan
be admitted into the WHO family at least as an observer.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said that at
least five of the Republic of China's diplomatic allies will publicly
support Taiwan's WHA bid during the annual conference to be held in
Geneva May 17-22.</P>
      <P>Health representatives of the Gambia, Burkina Faso, Malawi,
Senegal and Chad will speak during the assembly meeting in support of
Taiwan, said Chang Pei-chi, director of MOFA's Department of African
Affairs.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Richard Shih also said Tuesday that the Republic
of China is a sovereign state and the notion of taking part in the
WHO or WHA activities as a member or an observer is a consensus
reached by all political parties and all walks of life in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih added that Taiwan's WHA bid is a humanitarian issue which
should not be politicized by any group of people in the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's WHA bid failed for the seventh time in May 2003 when the
56th annual conference of the WHA opened in Geneva and the WHA
Steering Committee refused to put the issue of Taiwan's WHA status on
its agenda.</P>

that one of the key priorities of the government will be to
strengthen bilateral relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when she met with Washington State Lieutenant
Governor Brad Owen and other leaders of the state legislature.</P>
      <P>Asked about priority tasks of the government after the March 20
presidential election, which saw President Chen Shu-bian and Lu win
another four-year term, the vice president spoke of the strengthening
of relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>She also spoke of the quick return to peace and normality on
Taiwan's political scene.</P>
      <P>Post-election rows have persisted because Lien Chan of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" has yet to concede defeat in what he
claimed was a "unfair election" marred by voting irregularities and
an election-eve shooting of the president and the vice president that
he said swayed the bitterly contested election in Chen's favor. Chen
won by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes out of more than 13
million cast.</P>
      <P>Taipei also hopes to work with Beijing toward promoting
cross-strait peace and stability, the vice president said.</P>
      <P>She also took the chance to thank the treatment given to her and
her entourage last year when she passed through Washington State, and
said that she was especially touched to see Seattle Port Authorities
raise the national flag of the Republic of China.</P>

understanding and support of Taiwan, and further substantial
exchanges between Taiwan and the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLAN TO LIFT BAN ON MAINLAND CAPITAL STILL UNDER SCRUTINY: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) is still weighing the possibility of opening the door to
mainland Chinese investment capital, Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to a newspaper report that the ROC government
has decided to open the door to inbound mainland Chinese investments
in three stages and that the first stage, including allowing mainland
banks to open liaison offices in Taiwan, will begin shortly after
President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration for a second four-year term
on May 20.</P>
      <P>"The MAC has yet to finalize the new 'open door' policy
initiative, " Lin said, adding that the Ministry of Finance is
expected to call an interministerial meeting in the near future to
further discuss relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said the
issue regarding whether to allow mainland Chinese banks to open
liaison offices in Taiwan cannot be addressed until after a statute
governing inbound mainland Chinese investments is enacted.</P>
      <P>"Without such a statute, we have no legal basis to screen
applications by mainland banks for opening liaison offices in
Taiwan," said Tsai.</P>
      <P>She also said it is the MAC's established policy to start to deal
with issues regarding whether to allow mainland Chinese financial
institutions to set up footholds or liaison offices in Taiwan only
after a comprehensive legal framework for inbound mainland
investments is formulated.</P>
      <P>As to when such a statute or legal framework can be ready for
implementation, Tsai said relevant government departments are still
working on various technical details.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, hopes that the package of rules can be finalized and
promulgated as early as possible.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Africa's 90-day, visa-free treatment
to Taiwan residents will stand, an official of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Pei-chi, director-general of the foreign ministry's
Department of African Affairs, noted that the Pretoria government had
originally granted the preferential treatment to Taiwan residents who
hold the Republic of China passports, but after heavy pressure from
mainland China -- whose citizens do not enjoy the same treatment,
although the mainland has formal diplomatic relations with South
Africa -- South Africa was forced to cancel the favorable visa
situation for ROC nationals.</P>
      <P>Another factor in the decision was that some illegal mainland
Chinese immigrants had traveled to South Africa with forged ROC
passports. Pretoria therefore decided to scrap the 90-day, visa-free
treatment to Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>But the change was met with steep opposition, and the South
African high court ruled on April 6 that the revocation of the visa
privileges for ROC nationals must be rescinded, leaving the 90-day,
visa-free treatment intact.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry will continue to follow the situation very
closely, Chang said.</P>

After days of talks and threats of a militar y showdown, American

turn in their heavy weapons.

The agreement was the first firm sign that at least one of two

the capital, and in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, to the south -- 
might be resolved peacefully. But the possibility of renewed fighting

    <TEXT>
      <P>Authorities from the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) on Tuesday reported fresh cases of dysentery among
Taiwan tourists who recently returned from trips to the Indonesian
resort island of Bali.</P>
      <P>Three Taiwan citizens, who visited Bali between March 25 and
April 1, were confirmed by CDC laboratories to have contracted
bacillary dysentery, said Lai Ming-ho, chief of the CDC's quarantine
and disease prevention division.</P>
      <P>The three tourists -- belonging to two Taiwan tourist groups with
a total of 39 people -- have been given treatment and placed under
observation.</P>
      <P>Twenty-six other of the tour group members have been tracked down
and have tested negative for dysentry, while the remaining 10 have

attracts about 400,000 Taiwanese visitors per year. It remained
popular even during the height of the severe acute respiratory

    <HEADLINE>KMT SEES INTRAPARTY UNITY AS MOST IMPORTANT: WANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The most important thing for the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) for the moment is to maintain intraparty
unity, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang, who concurrently serves as a KMT vice chairman, was
commenting on appeals by some senior KMT members for an intraparty
personnel reshuffle in the wake of the March 20 presidential
election, in which KMT Chairman Lien Chan narrowly lost to incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>As Lien has contested the election result with two lawsuits, Wang
said the presidential election has not yet truly ended. Therefore,
Wang said, he supports Lien's insistence on no intraparty personnel
reshuffle until after the election vote recount and the completion of
the election-eve shooting investigations.</P>
      <P>Lien has filed lawsuits in an attempt to nullify the election
result and the entire election so that a new one can be held. The
Taiwan High Court is handling the election result nullification
lawsuit, and it has yet to decide how the ballots cast in the
election should be recounted.</P>
      <P>Lien is also pushing for a referendum on whether a special
committee should be formed to investigate the shooting of President
Chen and Vice President Annette Lu on the eve of the election. Lien
claimed that the shooting, which slightly wounded Chen and Lu,
unfairly swayed sympathy votes in Chen's favor. No suspect in the
mysterious case has so far been arrested.</P>
      <P>Wang said the vote recount issue and the investigation of the
mysterious March 19 shooting have involved onerous tasks. If the KMT
reshuffles its senior cadres right now, Wang said, newcomers may not
be familiar with relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>Even though the KMT will not change its senior party officials,
Wang said, the party will still make adjustments regarding the duties
of some of its senior cadres so that the party can handle both
election-related disputes and intraparty reforms more efficiently and
step up preparations for the year-end legislative elections.</P>

(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Japan and mainland China
have been worsening in light of the fact that Tokyo has decided to
reduce economic assistance to Beijing, according to a monthly report
compiled by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Given that mainland China has been enjoying rapid economic
growth, the report says, Japan has decided to reduce its assistance
to Beijing by 20 percent a year based on this year's aid of 96.7
billion yen (US$896 million) . The difference will be transferred to
mainland China's neighboring countries, such as India, Vietnam and
Central Asian nations, it adds.</P>
      <P>In reality, it says, Japan made the decision due to its concern
over mainland China's growing national strength, which has cast a
shadow of threat over the Japanese people.</P>
      <P>Beijing won sympathy from the Japanese people in the early 1980s
when it started open and reformation programs, the report notes.</P>
      <P>However, it goes on, along with an increasing consciousness of
constructing a rich country and strong military power among mainland
China's official and private sectors since the beginning of this
century, the Japanese people worry that the mainland Chinese threat
has been intensifying.</P>
      <P>Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi said in a March 30
Cabinet meeting that Japan's foreign aid should serve its national
interests and diplomatic purposes. Therefore, she said, the Japanese
government will pay more attention to the strategic value of its
foreign aid.</P>
      <P>Facing new developments in Tokyo-Beijing ties, the report states
that mainland Chinese authorities have started seeking more
assistance from European nations to offset the difference in Japanese
aid cuts by Tokyo.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, it says, Beijing will eventually grant more
business opportunities to European nations at the expense of Japan.</P>
      <P>The indications show that Tokyo-Beijing ties have been slowly
unraveling and will not be improved in the near future, the report
says, adding that the rivalry of their strategic interests is
expected to be heightened.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRENCH SUPERMARKET GROUP TO INCREASE PURCHASE IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The French supermarket group Nature et
Decouvertes plans to increase its purchases in Taiwan, the company's
purchasing manager, Jean-Jacques Martin, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nature et Decouvertes, which has 64 branches around France,
boasts of an annual trade volume worth US$150 million, with its
products ranging from gifts and gardening equipment to bath
accessories and kitchen utensils.</P>
      <P>Being one of the biggest supermarket group in France, Nature et
Decouvertes purchased 30 percents of its merchandise from Asia each
year.</P>
      <P>Martin noted that although the group bought less from Taiwan in
comparison to mainland China, it reaped more from its purchases from
Taiwan due to the high-quality and superior design of Taiwan-made
products.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing the group's hope to increase its
purchases in Taiwan, Martin also suggested Taiwan trade promotion
agencies try to attract European purchasers to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"When they come here, Shanghai and Hong Kong will no longer be
their only option," Martin said.</P>
      <P>Huang Wen-jung, a department chief of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) , admitted that it has been hard for
Taiwanese enterprises to explore European markets due to the large
geographic distance between both sides.</P>
      <P>With the efforts of TAITRA's office in Paris, Martin came to
Taiwan on a fact-finding mission and decided to increase the group's
purchases of Taiwan-made products, including bath ware, kitchen
utensils and travel items.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Martin will attend the 2004 Taipei
International Gift and Stationery Spring Show that starts Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the unreliable quality of mainland Chinese gift
items has forced many purchasers to shift their orders from the
mainland to Taiwan, and he urged local companies to present their
high-quality and best-designed products to secure the gift market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HIGH COURT SAYS VOTE RECOUNT TO START BEFORE MAY 10</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court on Wednesday ruled
that the vote recount of the March 20 presidential election will be
started before May 10, and will hopefully be completed within 10
days.</P>
      <P>This means that the vote recount demanded by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) could be completed by May 20, or the inauguration day of
President-elect Chen Shui-bian, who won the election by a small margin
of 29,518 votes out of more than 13 million cast.</P>
      <P>Because of the continued bickering between the two election teams
over the procedures in conducting the vote recount, some have said
that the recount could drag on beyond inauguration day.</P>
      <P>The court ruling came after the second hearing on a lawsuit
brought by the KMT-PFP ticket, in which the election teams were
invited to voice their views on the vote recount.</P>
      <P>The court also coordinated on such matters as the criteria for
determining the validity of the ballots, the teams available to
monitor the recount, the details of the recount proceedings, as well
as the estimated expenditure calculated by the Central Election
Commission (CEC) for the recount.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Tsai Yu-ling, who represents the "pan-blue alliance," said
after emerging from the meeting that the judges ruled that the
recount could begin before May 10, and added that the entire
procedure should be able to be completed within 10 days.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the court hopes that the plaintiff, or the KMT-PFP
ticket, would first tender a deposit of NT$60 million (US$1.83
million) . The money should be pay by May 5. The figure is not an
actual indication of the expenses to be incurred, and any surfeit
will be returned, while a shortfall will have to be covered should
such a contingency arise.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chih-chun, another lawyer from the KMT-PFP ticket, pointed
out at the meeting that three stamped ballots that the CEC believes
are invalid would have been considered valid were they counted under
the previous President and the Vice President Election and Recall
Law.</P>
      <P>These ballots, Chiang went on, should be views as disputed, and
left for the court to decide on their validity, although lawyers
representing President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu disagreed.</P>
      <P>The CEC has listed seven examples of stamped ballots as valid,
while displaying 26 examples of stamped ballots it says are spoiled.</P>
      <P>On the differences, the court ruled that two out the three
stamped ballots will be listed as disputed votes and left for a judge
to decide their validity, while it will ask for the CEC to send
officials to the court to explain why it listed the third one as
invalid in the first place.</P>
      <P>The court also ruled that it would convene the last hearings on
the lawsuit April 28 to make sure that both teams agree with the
recount procedure and criteria for determining valid votes.</P>
      <P>The CEC officials will attend the last hearing to help certify
the criteria in determining valid votes, the court said.</P>
      <P>The court will also ask the two parties in the lawsuit to provide
their final lists of lawyers that can be sent to the district courts
around the island to help with the recount, while the venue of the
vote recount will be in the hands of various district courts,
according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>The recount team, each of which will be comprised of one
representative from each rival team and officials from the court and
the CEC, will be in charge of the daunting task of recounting the
more than 13 million votes cast.</P>
      <P>The lawsuit was brought by defeated presidential candidate Lien
Chan of the KMT and vice presidential candidate James Soong of the
PFP after they lost to President Chen and his running mate.</P>
      <P>More than 330,000 invalid votes, or more than 11 times the margin
separating the winner from the loser, were found in the election,
with some attributing the phenomenon to stricter CEC criteria in
determining the validity of the ballots and some attributing it to a
group's exhortation before the election for voters to protest the
poor quality of the two candidates by intentionally casting invalid
ballots.</P>
      <P>Lien sand Soong, citing what they claimed to be voting
irregularities, challenged the fairness of the election and demanded
a recount in the lawsuit. All votes in the ballot boxes have been
sealed by the court pending a recount.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun called Wednesday for
quick passage of bills and extra budgets for the Cabinet's "10 New
Construction Plans" program at the legislature for the sake of the
country's progress and development.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks after hearing a report on the program at a
weekly Cabinet meeting, according to spokesman Lin Chia-lung.</P>
      <P>Urging unity from the various political parties to take concrete
measures to help promote the country's major development plans, Yu
was quoted by Lin as stressing that the "10 New Construction
Projects" program will not only give a new lease on life to the
domestic economy and to the development of less developed regions of
Taiwan, but will also lay a solid foundation for its sustainable
development.</P>
      <P>As the projects are designed to be scattered around the northern,
central and southern regions, infrastructure development across the
country will thus be better balanced and create fresh demand for
local development, Yu was quoted as explaining.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the premier described the projects as a race
against time and appealed for quick legislative cooperation to secure
Taiwan's competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Should the budgets for the projects fail to pass the Legislative
Yuan, it will have a negative impact on the building and extending of
the mass rapid transit systems in Taipei and Kaohsiung, the
development of a traffic network surrounding the Taipei Port and a
planned Guggenheim museum in Taichung, Lin quoted Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Director-General Liu San-chi as
saying.</P>

      <P>Yu issued the directive after listening to a report on

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwan fishermen who were detained
in the Philippines for nearly a year finally returned home Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Hsing-shan, skipper of the Chinshengta fishing boat based
out of Liuchiu, in Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung, and Peng
Fei-lung, the first engineer aboard the ship, broke down in tears
when they met with their families at Kaohsiung International Airport
in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They were the last two Taiwan fishermen to be released by the
Philippine authorities. A total of eight Taiwan fishing boats were
detained by the Philippine coast guard last spring for alleged
poaching in its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. Six of the ships
managed to flee last April when a typhoon hit the northern Philippine
island of Luzon.</P>
      <P>Huang Chi-huang, skipper of the seventh boat, the Manchitsai, was
released by the Philippine authorities last October with the
assistance of the Republic of China's representative office in
Manila.</P>
      <P>The Chingshengta sank after Hung, Peng and the seven Indonesian
crewmen were detained in a Philippine prison. Philippine judicial
authorities finished a probes of the case earlier this month and
agreed to release them Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hung and Peng said they appreciate all the assistance the ROC
representative office in Manila has given to them over the past year.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's 200-mile economic zone overlaps with that of the

    <HEADLINE>RIVAL TICKETS DIFFER ON CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING VALID VOTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court held a second
hearing Wednesday concerning a lawsuit brought by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" over the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The court invited the rival election teams to air their views on
the vote recount, including the coordination on the criteria for
determining the validity of ballots, the teams that will monitor the
recount and details of the recount proceedings, as well as the
estimated expenditure calculated by the CEC for the recount.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chi-chun, a lawyer representing the "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang and the People First Party, said after the closed-door
meeting that the criteria for the recount should be in line with the
provisions listed in the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election
and Recall Law and that disputed ballots should be left for judges to
decide if they are valid.</P>
      <P>But Ku Li-hsiung, a lawyer representing President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu, did not agree.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that Article 60 of the President and Vice President
Election and Recall Law stipulates clearly that ballots should be
smeared beyond recognition to be counted as spoiled votes.
If they are only partially smeared and can still be read, they should
be counted as valid.</P>
      <P>Also, a judge should determine if ballots are valid or invalid,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He said that the recount should take place in court, as there is
video equipment and bailiffs there to maintain order, which he
claimed would make it safer and more convenient than other places.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" also claims three stamped ballots that
the Central Election Commission (CEC) believes are invalid should be
counted as valid under the President and Vice President Election
and Recall Law, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Those ballots, he went on, should be counted as disputed and left
for the court to decide on their validity.</P>
      <P>"The KMT-PFP is willing to comply with the CEC's regulations on
the determination of other ballots," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The CEC has listed seven examples of stamped ballots as valid,
while displaying 26 examples of stamped ballots it says are spoiled.</P>
      <P>However, Ku pointed out that the rules were set before the start
of the race, which would apply equally to both sides. If the KMT-PFP
ticket has any misgivings about the criteria for determination set by
the CEC, it should have raised them prior to the election, he noted.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT-PPF still wants to discuss the criteria for
determination now, the start of the recount will be pushed even
further back, and we can't accept that," Ku said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he noted that his clients have provided a list of
486 names of lawyers or probation lawyers to the court as part of the
recount team, while the "pan-blue alliance" has made a list of more
than 300.</P>
      <P>He suggested that those who take part in the recount representing
rival teams be expanded from lawyers to other professionals,
including accountants, in order to speed up the recount.</P>
      <P>The recount team, each of which will be comprised of one
representative from each rival team and officials from the court and
the CEC, will be in charge of the daunting task of recounting the
more than 13 million ballots cast.</P>
      <P>The lawsuit was brought by defeated presidential candidate Lien
Chan of the KMT and vice presidential candidate James Soong of the
PFP after they lost by a narrow margin of 29,518 votes to President
Chen Shui-bian and his running mate, Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>More than 330,000 invalid votes, or more than 11 times the losing
margin, were registered during the original count, with some
attributing the phenomenon to stricter CEC criteria in determining
the validity of votes and some attributing it to a group's
exhortation before the election to cast spoiled votes to show their
discontent with both camps.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong, cited what they claim to be voting irregularities
in the election, challenged the fairness of the election and demanded

    <HEADLINE>KMT FORMS SPECIAL POLICY COMMITTEE TO FACE FUTURE CHALLENGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) announced
Wednesday that it will establish a special policy committee to handle
party reforms and its own investigation into the March 19 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan made the announcement during a party
Central Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lien said he will supervise the committee, which will be divided
into four subgroups responsible for policy making, an investigation
into the election-eve assassination attempt on Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu, the campaign for the year-end legislative
elections, as well as party reforms.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Lien and People First Party
Chairman James Soong was defeated by Chen and Lu in the March 20
election by a slim margin of under 30,000 of the more than 13 million
votes cast. The opposition believes the shooting won many sympathy
votes for Chen, while the security mechanism triggered by the
shooting deprived many military service members and police officers
of their right to vote, although they have consistently been unable
to provide evidence to support their claims.</P>
      <P>At a time when the "pan-blue alliance" is seeking an annulment of
the election through judicial process and its supporters have
launched several massive, sometimes violent rallies to demand a vote
recount and the "truth" about the shooting, some voices from the KMT
have called for a reshuffle of the party's leadership.</P>
      <P>However, Lien stressed that unity is now the only hope for the
party and he urged high-ranking party officials to stay and face the
challenges instead of resigning.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT does not care about victory or failure in
the election, but about sound democratic development, Lien said
Taiwan cannot afford to lose its hard-won democracy, peace and
prosperity and expressed optimism that there will be justice in
society.</P>
      <P>He promised to introduce new blood to the party, reconstruct the

    <HEADLINE>LIFTING OF IMPORT BAN ON INDONESIAN WORKERS POSTPONED: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The lifting of an import ban on Indonesian
workers will be postponed indefinitely because the Indonesian
government has yet to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with
Taiwan on relevant affairs, a labor official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Fang-yu, director of the Employment and Vocational Training
Administration under the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , said the
council originally expected to sign the MOU with the Indonesian labor
department within three months of a visit to Indonesia by CLA
Chairwoman Chen Chu in late January.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo said, the Indonesian government has so far not sent
any official to discuss the new labor agreement issue with the CLA.
As Indonesia is busy with parliamentary and presidential elections,
Kuo said, it is not expected to finalize the MOU signing issue by the
end of this month.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Kuo said, the CLA cannot lift the
Indonesian labor import ban at the end of April as originally
scheduled.</P>
      <P>After Chen's Indonesia visit, the CLA announced that Indonesian
workers whose maximum three-year work permits would expire between
Feb. 2 and May 1 could apply to the CLA for a temporary three-month
extension.</P>
      <P>"Now that the Indonesian labor import ban cannot be lifted as
scheduled, those Indonesian workers must leave Taiwan before May 1,"
Kuo said.</P>
      <P>According to a CLA estimate, Kuo said, more than 700 Indonesian
citizens now working in Taiwan will now have to leave the island
before May, despite being told earlier that they could stay, due to
the delay in the MOU signing.</P>
      <P>Kuo said only a few points in the agreement still need further
negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Whether the ban can be lifted will depend on whether the
Indonesian government will send representatives to discuss the issue
with us, " Kuo said, adding that the timing for resolving the issue
will become clearer after Indonesia's parliamentary and presidential
elections this summer.</P>
      <P>The CLA suspended labor imports from Indonesia in August 2002 for
a host of reasons, including the high absconding rate of Indonesian
workers, Indonesia's demand that local manpower agencies deduct
"guarantee" money from Indonesian workers' salaries on its behalf,
and Indonesia's failure to abide by the CLA's demand to lower foreign
labor brokerage fees.</P>
      <P>In 2002, more than 90,000 Indonesian citizens legally worked in
Taiwan, but the number had declined to about 49,000 as of the end of
March as a result of the import freeze.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Indonesian labor department, CLA
Chairwoman Chen visited Indonesia to look into improvements in
Indonesia's labor export administration. She told a news conference
after her return that she was satisfied with Indonesia's progress in
labor export administration and that she planned to sign a new labor
agreement with her Indonesian counterpart in three months to pave the
way for the lifting of the import ban.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ZEN MASTER TO TEACH IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Sydney,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Liu Yu-min and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World renowned Taipei-based Zen master
Sheng Yen is scheduled to give four teaching sessions in Australia
beginning Thursday in Sydney, religious sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Invited by the University of Sydney's School of Buddhism Studies
and other academic and religious organizations in Australia, Sheng
Yen will give three speeches in Sydney and one in Melbourne on his
first "tour of enlightenment" in Australia.</P>
      <P>In addition to the teachings, Sheng Yen will also preside over a
ceremony to proclaim several followers Buddhists and illuminate them
with his enlightenment.</P>
      <P>In his first speech to be held on the campus of the University of
Sydney Thursday, Sheng Yen will analyse the relationship between
"mental freedom and intelligent freedom," while in the second speech,
to be held later that day at the university, he will speak on "inner
and outer peace -- my spiritual journey."</P>
      <P>At the same venue, Sheng Yen is expected to speak on "Zen and
inner environmental protection" on Friday.</P>
      <P>His fourth speech, entitled "Zen and a pure land for humans, "
will be held in Melbourne Sunday.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, a member of the 2003 World Council of Religious and
Spiritual Leaders, is also an academic and educator who holds a
doctorate and has written more than 140 books on religion.</P>
      <P>Answering questions about Taiwan's just concluded presidential
election upon his arrival in Sydney, Sheng Yen said all political
figures should bear mercy in their hearts and minds like a Buddhist
or any other religious follower.</P>
      <P>A politician, particularly a head of state, should treat
everybody, including those who did not vote for him, equally without
any element of partiality, Sheng Yen added.</P>
      <P>Prior to coming to Australia, Sheng Yen has been in Singapore,
where he offered his enlightenment and illumination to Buddhism
followers there.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, founder of the Taiwan Buddhist group Dharma Drum
Mountain (DDM) Social Welfare and Charity Foundation, is set to
arrive in Switzerland at the end of April to preside over a Zen study
session.</P>
      <P>He will give public teachings on April 30 and May 1 before
presiding over a seven-day Zen meditation session to be held at the
Beatenberg Zen Center in Bern beginning May 2.</P>
      <P>According to Beatenberg authorities, all 70 spots for the Zen
meditation session were booked long ago, with some being reserved by
Buddhist followers from as far away as Spain and the United States.</P>
      <P>Traveling with some 20 world religious leaders to Israel and
Palestine last December, Sheng Yen tried to use the power of religion
to bridge the differences among people living in regions with ethnic
conflict.</P>
      <P>Presenting two words -- mercy and wisdom -- Sheng Yen called for
the leaderships of both Israel and Palestine to use wisdom to work
out solutions to their differences while practicing mercy on all the
people in the region regardless of their political affiliation or
religion, so as to not let down the people living in the Holy Land.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen and his party met with Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed
Qureia during a symposium held in Jerusalem Dec. 11. After hearing
Sheng Yen's teaching, Qureia reportedly applauded enthusiastically
and said to his aides that he looks forward to seeing Sheng Yen's
suggestions put into practice.</P>
      <P>At a colloquium held at the Israeli prime minister's office Dec.
14, Sheng Yen delivered a speech to ranking Israeli officials,
including Cabinet officials, parliamentary advisers and government
consultants in news and religious affairs.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Sheng Yen interpreted Islamic doctrine as
stipulating that Jihad -- or holy war -- does not mean striving to
defeat others, but instead to defeat one's own evil thoughts. "This
is an idea almost the same as the Buddhist concept of conquering the
evil in one's mind," Sheng Yen noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSES MAY SCALE DOWN INVESTMENT IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan's investment
in mainland China rose markedly in March on a year-to-year basis, a
government agency has forecast that domestic businesses will slow
their pace of investment in the mainland for various reasons.</P>
      <P>Citing a monetary tightening move expected to be adopted soon by
the mainland authorities to cool off its overheated investment and
economy, a spokesman for the Investment Commission under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs said that increasing power shortages might also
give Taiwan investors who are mulling new investment plans in the
mainland cause for concern.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies should pay special heed to the two issues when
considering whether to launch new investment or funnel additional
capital into the mainland, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Mainland-bound investment worth US$596.6 million by Taiwan
businesses was approved by the commission last month, up by 29.51
percent compared to the previous year's level, according to
statistics compiled by the commission. The figure brought the
combined value for the first quarter of this year to US$1.292
billion, an increase of 16.09 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>At the same time, direct investment by overseas Chinese in Taiwan
last month reached US$414.36 million, an expansion of 34.41 percent
over the year-earlier level. Q1 investment by overseas Chinese in the
domestic market totaled US$768.86 million, up by 28.11 percent on an
annual basis.</P>

      <P>Ten female illegal mainland Chinese

were arrested off central Taiwan early Wednesday morning, according
to a report by the Coast Guard Administration (CGA).</P>
      <P>CGA officials said that they were tipped off recently that the
Tainan-registered fishing boat Sheng Hsin would be picking up female
illegal immigrants offshore.</P>
      <P>Two CGA cutters spotted the Sheng Hsin at around 4: 30 a.m. four
nautical miles off Lukang in Changhua County. After a chase, coast
guard officials intercepted the boat and both Lee Ming-lang, captain
of the ship, and crewmember Wang Cheng-feng admitted that they were

      <P>CGA officers found the 10 women -- four of whom are minors --
hiding in the cramped cabin of the ship.</P>
      <P>The women come mainly from the mainland hinterland, including

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun has ordered the
formation of a supraministerial mechanism to crack down on fraud
rings, Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu issued the directive after listening to a report on the
domestic crime situation, particularly the increasing number of fraud
cases, at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan said at the
meeting that as the reported fraud cases involve complicated
operations ranging from figurehead bank accounts and
false phone calls to cross-Taiwan Strait coordination, the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) and the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) alone cannot
be relied upon to solve such cases.</P>
      <P>Su suggested that a supraministerial task force be formed to take
charge of the anti-fraud campaign.</P>
      <P>"Responding to Su's recommendation, Premier Yu ordered the
formation of a supraministerial task force to facilitate policy
coordination and formulation of effective fraud-fighting measures, "
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The new task force will be headed by Minister-without-Portfolio
Hsu Chih-hsiung, Lin said, adding that the team will be made up of
officials from the MOJ, the MOI, the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the Government
Information Office.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the premier expressed his hope that the existing
special task force headed by State Public Prosecutor-General Lu
Ren-fa can step up investigations into major fraud cases in order to
maintain law and order and allay public anxiety over mounting reports
of such criminal cases," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Many local people, including Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan, have
fallen victim to fraud crime, which includes rampant use of
counterfeit credit cards and elaborate ATM card scams.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen declared an all-out war on local fraud
rings last week and on Chen's instructions, Lu formed a special task
force to guide fraud-fighting operations. The panel is composed of
top officials from police, investigation and prosecution authorities.</P>

(By N.K. Han and  Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China representative to
Britain Tien Hung-mao has urged British manufacturers to cooperate
with Taiwan manufacturers to tap the business opportunities in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tien made the remarks when he addressed the sixth joint meeting
of the Taiwan-Britain business council and the Britain-Taiwan
business council which opened its two-day meeting in London Tuesday.
More than 100 delegates from Taiwan and Britain are attending the
meeting, including a Taiwan delegation of some 30 members led by
Leslie Koo, chairman of China Synthetic Rubber Corp.</P>
      <P>Noting the closer interdependence between Taiwan and mainland
China, Tien said that there are more than 700,000 Taiwan
businesspeople operating on the mainland and that they have invested
between US$100 billion and US$120 billion there. Cross-strait trade
has also grown to US$50 billion per year, he added.</P>
      <P>The large number of Taiwan businesspeople have accumulated rich
experience and knowledge in dealing with mainland Chinese officials
over the years, Tien said. He added that they also enjoy the
convenience and advantage of sharing the same language and culture
with China.</P>
      <P>For this reason, if British manufacturers make Taiwan a
springboard or join hands with Taiwan businesspeople, they will be
able to better tap the business opportunities on the mainland, Tien
said.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that the trade relations between Taiwan and
Britain will become ever closer, noting that more and more Taiwan
students studying in Britain have returned to Taiwan and that they
are expected to play the role of a bridge between the two countries.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the number of Taiwan students studying in
Britain has exceeded 13,000.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Economics Minister Yin Chii-ming, who is currently
visiting Britain, said on the same occasion that because of the
bilateral cooperation between private enterprises in the two
countries and the government's encouragement over the past decade,
Taiwan-Britain economic relations have grown rapidly, making Britain
the third largest trade partner of Taiwan in Europe.</P>
      <P>He cited statistics showing that two-way trade between Taiwan and
Britain reached US$4.3 billion last year, up 0.8 percent from the
figure in 2002. Although bilateral trade growth slowed over the past
two years because of the global economic slump, bilateral trade began
to register double digit growth in the first two months of this year,
with both imports and exports recording a strong rebound.</P>
      <P>Yin also said that Taiwan has invested US$400 million in
Britain, while Britain has invested US$2.3 billion in Taiwan,
including in the chemical, pharmaceutical, financial, insurance and
large supermarket sectors.</P>
      <P>Yin will attend the 11th Taiwan-U.K. trade talks Wednesday,
during which the Taiwan delegation is expected to discuss with their
British counterparts no-visa treatment for Taiwan manufacturers and
Taiwan businesspeople operating in Britain, as well as simplification
of work permit procedures for Taiwan businesspeople in Britain.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CSBC POSTS PROFITS OF NT$160 M FOR Q1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   April  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC)
continued to post profits in the first quarter of this year, with the
figure for the quarter estimated to hit NT$160 million (US$4.85
million), corporate sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a preliminary estimate, CSBC management said, the
just-privatized shipbuilder registered business turnover of NT$3.77
billion for the first three months of this year, reaching about 90
percent of the company's target for the period. However, the
estimated profit of NT$160 million is 172.7 percent of the company's
target, it added.</P>
      <P>The figure is encouraging given the fact that the former
state-run shipbuilder had been running in the red for decades.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of a "rejuvenation program" in 2001 to cut
the payroll and increase productivity, the debt-ridden company began
turning a profit in the latter months of the following year.</P>
      <P>Under the "rejuvenation program, " one first-grade department and
50 second-grade units were phased out, and 2,280 staff members were
cut, while those who stayed experienced a 35-percent pay cut.</P>
      <P>To cope with cut-throat competition in the sluggish global
shipbuilding market, the CSBC has also streamlined personnel
management and tightened quality control to ensure stable production
and punctual delivery.</P>
      <P>The CSBC was fully privatized at the end of 2003. Benefiting from
market-oriented principles and as a result of continuously
streamlining personnel structure and upgrading research and
development capabilities, the company registered net annual profits
of NT$500 million in 2003, well above its target of NT$280 million
for the year.</P>
      <P>In the face of rising steel prices, the only way to continue to
ensure competitiveness in the world market and sustainable growth is
for the company to strictly follow the "lean and mean" policy, the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelves foreign heads of state will come
to Taipei to attend the May 20 inauguration of President Chen
Shui-bian, besides three foreign premiers, one governor and five
envoys, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a tea party thrown for local journalists, the minister listed
the reception of foreign guests for the May 20 inauguration as one of
his major jobs at the moment, adding that his office has invited all
former chairmen of the American Institute in Taiwan, including
Therese Shaheen, who resigned early this month, to attend the
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Many countries which do not have diplomatic ties with Taiwan will
also have delegations present at the inauguration and will therefore
give Taiwan a good chance to cement its unofficial ties with these
countries, Chen said.</P>
      <P>His other major task at present is Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization, which is scheduled to hold its annual conference
in Geneva May 17, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Australia and the United States have voiced
their support for Taiwan's participation in the WHO as an observer,
the minister said the chances for Taiwan's success in its bid are
better than ever, but the public should not feel depressed "even if
we fail again," as persistent efforts are needed, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES U.S. OFFICIALS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged U.S. officials Thursday to
visit Taiwan and gain a better understanding of the country's policy
toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, a DPP caucus leader at the Legislative Yuan,
made the remarks after James Kelly, U.S. assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, issued a warning toward President
Chen Shui-bian Wednesday at a hearing held at the International
Relations Committee under the House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Kelly called on Chen to exercise "restrained leadership" and not
to treat the mainland's military threats as empty words.</P>
      <P>"Pushing for independence carries the potential for a response
from (mainland China) , a dangerous, objectionable and foolish
response that could destroy much of what Taiwan has built and crush
its hopes for the future," Kelly said.</P>
      <P>In the face of the stern warning from Washington following Chen's
March 20 re-election, Tsai said that Kelly apparently does not
understand Chen's basic stance toward the mainland and he suggested
that U.S. officials pay more visits to Taiwan to forge better mutual
understanding and communication on the island's policy toward the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The president has said repeatedly that his plan for a new
constitution in 2006 is not equal to a timetable for de jure Taiwan
independence, that he does not intend to change Taiwan's status-quo
and that he will not violate the "four noes plus one" pledge outlined
in his inaugural speech of May 20, 2000, Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hwang Yih-jiau, a spokesman for the opposition
People First Party, said Kelly's statement reflects the deep U. S.
worries about the danger of what he claimed is the DPP's
pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>Hwang urged the DPP not to mislead the Taiwan people in terms of
Washington's remarks and compromise Taiwan's security by engaging in
word games. He called on Chen to pay heed to the U.S. concern over
what he said is Chen's "covert seeking of Taiwan independence through
a new constitution" so as to avoid conflict in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CONSTITUTION PLAN NOT INDEPENDENCE TIMETABLE: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's plan to write a
new constitution for Taiwan in 2006 is part of his efforts to deepen
and consolidate Taiwan's young democracy, Presidential Office
spokesman James Huang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks after James Kelly, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, warned against
Taiwan pursuing formal independence at a hearing of the House
International Relations Committee in Washington, D.C. a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Presidential Office would not comment on Kelly's
testimony. "But we are willing to further explain our stance on our
constitutional reform plan," he added.</P>
      <P>Quoting Chen, Huang said the plan to formulate a new constitution
will be carried out in line with the principle of no change to
Taiwan's political status quo and is by no means a timetable for
pursuing de jure Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, Huang said, Chen has faithfully abided
by his "four noes plus one" pledge outlined in his 2000 inaugural
speech. "The president has never backed off from his promise during
his four-year term," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The "four noes plus one" pledge refers to no change to the
Republic of China's national title and flag, no holding of a
referendum on Taiwan independence or unification with mainland China,
no enshrinement of the "two states theory" in the ROC Constitution
and no abolishment of the National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>After Chen was re-elected in the March 20 presidential election,
Huang said, he has said on numerous public occasions that his top
priority for his second four-year term is to unify Taiwan, stabilize
cross-Taiwan Strait relations and boost economic development.</P>
      <P>Although Chen has said Taiwan needs a new constitution to resolve
legislative gridlock and make its political system more efficient,
Beijing views it as a step toward independence -- a move that could
provoke a military attack by the mainland.</P>
      <P>Huang said the government will step up publicity and continue
communications with the ROC's allies and the international community
so that they can come to a better understanding of the gist of
Taiwan's new constitution plan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Class sizes for first graders at Taiwan's
elementary schools will be gradually trimmed to 30 students from the
current level of 35, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The decision to cut class sizes was made during a meeting with
education officials from local city and county governments, according
to Wu Tsai-shun, director of the ministry's Elementary Education
Department.</P>
      <P>Wu said the planned measure will be included in a five-year
education promotion program and will kick off in the 2005 academic
year should various conditions be met -- no reduction in the total
class number, no slashing of teacher numbers and no extra financial
burden on local governments.</P>
      <P>The policy adjustment is mainly the result of a decrease in first
grade enrollment at elementary school due to a declining birthrate.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the ministry show that about 284,000 first
graders will be enrolled at nationwide elementary schools this
autumn, a fall of 37,000 from the previous year's level. It will be
the first time that the number of new first graders has dropped below
the 300,000 mark.</P>
      <P>A continued decline in student numbers is also set to have a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Su Jia-cheyuan said
Thursday he is confident of getting to the bottom of the March 19
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Su, a former Pingtung county magistrate who assumed his current
post about two weeks ago, made the remarks in an exclusive interview
with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Noting that the shooting marked the first time that the Republic
of China's head of state has ever been shot, Su said the government
will do its utmost to bring to justice the assailant or assailants.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Lu were slightly injured in the shooting, which
defeated opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate,
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, claims unfairly swayed sympathy votes
in Chen's favor in the March 20 presidential election. No suspect has
been arrested and criminal investigators have been unable to collect
any solid leads.</P>
      <P>However, Su said the National Police Administration (NPA) under
the Ministry of the Interior has been working hard on the case. "I'm
confident that we'll be able to solve the case, " he said
optimistically, although he would not set a timetable for solving the
case.</P>
      <P>Su also defended the NPA's ongoing campaign against organized
crime, saying it is routine work and not politically motivated.</P>
      <P>Police began a new crackdown on organized crime after a "pan-blue
alliance" April 10 protest rally on Ketegalan Boulvard in front of
the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei ended in violence, with
many police officers and "pan-blue" supporters sustaining injuries.</P>
      <P>Su said the campaign is aimed at maintaining law and order. "We
hope the new crackdown will discourage gangsters from sabotaging
public order and disturbing social stability."</P>
      <P>After the election, the "pan-blue alliance" has organized several
sometimes violent protest rallies to contest President Chen's narrow
re-election victory. In addition, the alliance has filed two lawsuits
to nullify the election result and the entire election so that a new
one can be held.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ENCOURAGES CROSS-STRAIT TRADE, TRANSPORT LINKS: U.S.  OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 22 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States encourages both
sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in direct trade, postal and
transportation links, as it will be a win-win situation for the two
sides to step up economic exchanges, a United States official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and
Pacific Affairs, made the remarks at a hearing on the 25th
anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act at the House International
Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>Kelly said the reasons Taiwan hesitates to implement cross-strait
direct links may include worries that overreliance on the mainland
could potentially produce a crisis. In addition, Taiwan also worries
that direct links could speed up the outflow of Taiwan industry,
worsening its unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>Though it is not completely unfounded that Taiwan worries about
the hollowing out of its industry, Kelly said Taiwan should also see
the issue in a broader perspective. Cross-strait trade is not
conducted in a vacuum, but is part of global trade, and the world
economy is in nature interdependent, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that 25 percent of Taiwan's exported products go
to the mainland, and a great majority of those products then go from
the mainland to the world after assembly.</P>
      <P>Kelly said that the reason that Beijing authorities dare not
impose economic sanctions on Taiwan is because if a crisis develops
across the Taiwan Strait, the damage to the mainland may be as bad as
to Taiwan, and this is why mainland China fired missiles in waters
off Taiwan between 1995 and 1996, but dared not impose economic
sanction on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a sound economic structure, trade policies, solid
economic basis, good educational system, a dynamic industrial
structure based mainly on small- and medium-sized enterprises. and it
is currently moving toward the areas of biotechnology,
optoelectronics and nanotechnlogy, he added.</P>
      <P>But Kelly also urged Taiwan to conduct financial reforms, improve
the investment environment, and implement its pledges made before
entering the World Trade Organization, saying that Taiwan has much
room for improvement in the area of the protection of intellectual
property rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO MAKE TAIWAN NUCLEAR-FREE ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
commitment Thursday to building Taiwan into a "nuclear-free,
green-silicon island."</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation at an national environmental
protection meeting jointly organized by scores of local
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) dedicated to protecting the
ecology and wildlife.</P>
      <P>Due to insufficient knowledge about nature, Chen said, Taiwan's
ecology was seriously damaged during the previous Kuomintang
administration.</P>
      <P>Since taking office in 2000, Chen said his administration has
adopted a different way of thinking and different strategies to
achieve a balance between environmental protection and economic
development.</P>
      <P>In 2002, Chen said, the Legislative Yuan passed an environmental
protection basic law, which sets an ultimate goal of making Taiwan a
nuclear-free, high-tech island.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is the first Asian country to declare a
determination to scrap the use of nuclear energy, Chen said his
administration will push for early decommissioning of the island's
three existing nuclear power plants and the half-built Fourth Nuclear
Power Plant.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, his administration plans to hold a national
conference in the near future to discuss policies on sustainable
national development and exploration of new energy resources.</P>
      <P>Chen further said his administration will refer to major
conclusions reached at the ongoing NGO environmental protection
meeting in formulating future national development guidelines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. HOPES EARLY RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE: U.S. OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States hopes that both
sides of the Taiwan Strait begin formal talks again soon, although it
will not force Taiwan to go to the negotiating table, a U.S. official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, made the remarks when he testified at a hearing
marking the 25th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act at the House
International Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>Kelly said that the United States is not a direct participant in
cross-strait disputes, but is keenly interested in creating an
environment conducive to a peaceful resolution of cross-strait
issues. For this reason, the United States has maintained strong
relations with both Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to the "six assurances" made to Taiwan during the
Reagan administration, the United States will continue to sell
defensive weapons and provide services to Taiwan, as a safe and
confident Taiwan will be encouraged to engage in political exchanges
and dialogues with mainland China.</P>
      <P>But the United States hopes that Taiwan will not mistake such
supports as giving it a blank check to boycott dialogues with
Beijing, he said.</P>
      <P>Kelly also said that in President Chen Shui-bian's May 20, 2000
inaugural speech, he expressed his desire to resume stalled
cross-strait dialogue without preconditions and laid out the "four
noes plus one" pledge, which includes no referendum on the status of
the nation.</P>
      <P>Kelly noted that President Chen will face many challenges over
the next few years, and the best way to deal with the crisis arising
from mainland China will be to promote democracy, ensure economic
growth, upgrade the wellbeing of the people, as well strengthen
Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Similarity, Beijing will face tough challenges, he said, in terms
of overcoming poverty and backwardness, establishing the rule of law,
starting the process of political reforms, and encouraging openness.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if there is a clash, the result of reforms over the
past years, and the international respect that goes with them will
all go down the drain, he said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that if war erupts in the Taiwan Strait, both sides
will retrogress for scores of years.</P>
      <P>For the sake of bilateral interests, Taipei and Beijing should
resume dialogue without preconditions.</P>
      <P>He suggested that in the absence of political dialogue, both
sides can start by strengthening financial exchanges, allowing direct
sea and air transportation links, increasing private contacts,
establishing a confidence-building mechanism between the two sides,
and upgrading the quality of communications on both sides to
reduce the chances of misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>The "six assurance" in 1982 say that the United States will not
agree to set a time for ending arms sales to Taiwan, will not agree
to hold prior consultations with the Chinese Communists on arms sales
to Taiwan, will not play a mediation role between Taipei and Beijing,
will not revise the Taiwan Relations Act, has not altered its
position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan, and will not exert
pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGES PRESIDENT CHEN TO HEED U.S. WARNING ON INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) urged President Chen Shui-bian Thursday to heed the
latest U.S. warning against Taiwan pursuing de jure independence.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Liao Feng-teh made the call after James
Kelly, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs, said at a hearing of the House International Relations
Committee in Washington, D.C. Wednesday that President Chen should
exercise "responsible, democratic and restrained leadership" and take
Beijing's military threat seriously.</P>
      <P>Kelly pointed out in his testimony that pursuing formal Taiwan
independence carries "the potential for a response from [China] -- a
dangerous, objectionable and foolish response -- that could destroy
much of what Taiwan has built and crush its hopes for the future."</P>
      <P>Liao said Kelly's testimony indicates that even though President
Chen has repeatedly denied that he's pursuing formal independence or
seeking to change Taiwan's political status quo, the international
community has a different perception of his words.</P>
      <P>In his view, Liao said Taiwan's current crisis lies in
inconsistency between PresidentChen's words and deeds.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's largest opposition party, Liao said, the KMT hopes
that President Chen can refrain from playing "word games" and can
instead seriously consider Taiwan's security in formulating his work
agenda and policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>Noting that actions speak louder than words, Liao said President
Chen should honestly speak his mind and fulfill his duty of
safeguarding Taiwan's security and promoting its prosperity.</P>
      <P>Liao further said President Chen should take concrete steps to
defuse international concerns about his future policies, particularly
his plan to write a new constitution for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since his re-election on March 20, President Chen has reiterated
his plan to push for a new constitution by 2006. Chen says Taiwan
needs a new constitution to resolve legislative gridlock and make its
political system more efficient, but Beijing views it as a step
toward independence -- a move that could provoke an attack from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>In his Wednesday testimony, Kelly also said Washington doesn't
agree with a military approach because it would be "counterproductive
to China's stated intent to seek a peaceful outcome" over the Taiwan
issue.</P>

School Student Sports Games in Hualian, eastern Taiwan, Chen said
that sportsmanship is more valuable and more precious than winning,
although it is important for an athlete to have the intention,
determination and preparedness to win in competitions.</P>
      <P>Chen exhorted all participants of the games to follow the rules
and to respect the judgment of officials of the games.</P>
      <P>The games provide a venue for student athletes to demonstrate
their physical strength and sports skills, Chen stressed, adding that
success cannot be achieved simply, but only through persistent
efforts, accumulated experiences and lessons learned from failures.</P>
      <P>More than 8,500 middle school student athletes from across the
country are attending the annual games, which will run through April
29. They will vie for 800 gold medals in 16 events.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPORT ORDERS IN MARCH  HIGHEST SINCE LAST DECEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The value of export orders received by
Taiwan manufacturers reached US$17.24 billion in March, a record high
since last December, according to statistics released by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Friday.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials attributed the growth mainly to the economic
recovery in Europe, the United States and several Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The value of export orders for Taiwan represented an increase of
US$3.75 billion over the same period last year, or an annual growth
of 27.81 percent.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, the value of export orders received by Taiwan
manufacturers in the first quarter totalled US$46.21 billion, an
increase of US$8.54 billion over the same period last year,
representing an annual growth of 22.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Export orders for Taiwan registered new records in products
related to electrical goods and electronics, basic metals, machinery,
and plastic and chemical goods. The electrical and electronic
industry received extra export orders worth US$630 million over the
same month of last year, an annual increase of 163.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The United States, Hong Kong, Japan and European countries
continued to be the major outlets for Taiwan's exports, demanding
more of the island's electronic and telecommunications products.</P>
      <P>Chang Yaw-tzong, director-general of MOEA's Statistics
Department, noted that due to the continued economic recovery around
the world, the IMF has recently readjusted global economic growth
from 4.1 percent to 4.6 percent, which is expected to bring more
export orders for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Expecting stronger investment and consumption on the island,
Chang also predicted a double-digit growth for export orders for
Taiwan in the second quarter, if the domestic economy is not affected
by non-economic factors.</P>

      <P>Sri Lanka is willing to develop

minister Kingsley T. Wickramaratne Friday.</P>
      <P>Wickramaratne who was on Hainan Island, mainland China for the
Boao Forum of Asia between Saturday and Sunday said that bilateral
trade between Sri Lanka and Taiwan is growing despite the absence of
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>As a long-standing friend of mainland China, Wickramaratne said
his country sticks to the "one-China" policy and is, therefore,
unable to have official ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipei and Colombo have non-official trade offices in
each other's capital, Wickramaratne said the offices should expand
their roles by promoting bilateral exchanges beyond trade.</P>
      <P>Wickramaratne said mainland China's significant investment in Sri
Lanka gives Beijing a presence there much greater than that of
Taiwan, which only trades with Sri Lanka.</P>

      <P>The government doesn't have any plan to
open the local bourse to mainland Chinese capital at the moment,
Securities and Futures Commission Chairman Ting Ke-hua said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ting made the remarks at a breakfast meeting with legislators of
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>During the meeting, TSU legislators asked whether the government
is planning to open the door to mainland Chinese investment capital
in order to forge a friendly atmosphere ahead of President Chen
Shui-bian's inauguration for a second four-year term on May 20.</P>
      <P>In response, Ting said the government has no intention of opening
the local stock market to mainland Chinese investors any time soon.
At the moment, he said, foreign institutional investors are required
to sign a note ensuring that they would not use mainland capital in
their investments in the Taiwan stock market.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Liu Teh-hsun, vice chairman of the
Mainland Affairs Council, said the government's approval of Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.'s application to built a wafer
plant in mainland China has been processed in line with the
law. He also said the government has yet to work out a timeframe
for opening even more sophisticated electronics industries, such as
memory chip testing and packaging, to invest in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Finance Minister Chang Hsiu-lien said nine Taiwan
life insurance and property insurance firms have been permitted
to open a total of 11 representative offices and three
subsidiaries in mainland China.</P>
      <P>With a view to helping local insurers tapping into the mainland
insurance market, Chang said the government is planning to allow
local insurance companies to buy into mainland Chinese insurance
companies.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, Chang said, local insurers' total
investment in the mainland insurance market should not exceed NT$2

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged local people
Friday to adopt all the government-suggested preventive measures
against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to keep the
contagious disease out of the country.</P>
      <P>Yu's remarks were made during a ceremony to bestow awards to
excellent medical personnel, following the report on Thursday of two
SARS cases in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that in view of the two reported SARS cases -- one in
Beijing and the other in Anhui province -- the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) convened an emergency SARS prevention
meeting Friday and announced that it will upgrade from Saturday the
alert level against SARS to Level A, in which all inbound and
outbound passengers are required to have their temperatures taken and
to fill out SARS questionnaires, and those passengers arriving from
SARS-affected areas should exercise health-management, including
regular hand-washing and temperature-taking.</P>
      <P>The DOH has designated four levels of alerts against SARS --
namely, Zero, A, B, and C -- with C representing the highest level of
alert.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the DOH has made all available
preparations against SARS, and urged the public not to panic but
follow the prevention measures suggested by the government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng Wen-tsan, a deputy director of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's communications department, said the
DPP hopes that mainland China-originated SARS cases will not affect
the travel plans people wishing to attend Taiwan's May 20
presidential inauguration.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that although the party does not hope that the
epidemic will lead to a limitation or cancellation of large-scale
gatherings, the party will respect all the decisions made by the
Center for Disease Control (CDC) of the DOH.</P>
      <P>Cheng added that Taiwan already has much SARS prevention
experience since the SARS outbreaks on the island last spring, and he

    <HEADLINE>ABORIGINAL PEOPLE APPEAL TO LEGISLATURE FOR LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of representatives of aboriginal
communities around the island took to the streets Friday to express
their concern that their traditional lands -- which have been handed
down from generation to generation -- might be taken away as a result
of a change in government regulations.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by independent Legislator May Kao-Chin, the
aboriginal representatives -- who came from Wulai rural township and
Hsinchu County in northern Taiwan and Hualien County in the east --
lodged an appeal at the Legislative Yuan, asking that the legislature
do something to stop the Ministry of the Interior from approving an
amendment to the regulations governing reservation lands.</P>
      <P>Should the amendment be approved, non-aboriginal people who have
been illegally using land originally reserved for the aboriginal
people, will be allowed to use or own the land they have taken,
according to Kao-Chin.</P>
      <P>If the amendment is approved, Kao-Chin said, some 11,000 hectares
of reserved land will be taken from the aboriginal people who rely
solely upon it as their only means of making a living. "The
aboriginal people are becoming the people of no land," she warned.</P>
      <P>The amendment is an explicit violation against the Statute of
Mountainous Lands Conservation and Utility, aimed at protecting
virgin or underdeveloped lands, she said.</P>
      <P>She added that the amendment is also poised to renege the
"partnership relations pact" that President Chen Shui-bian has forged
with the country's aboriginal citizens.</P>
      <P>The aboriginal group then proceeded to the Executive Yuan to
voice their opposition to the amendment plans.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Ministry of the Interior published its
latest aboriginal census Friday, noting that as of the end of March,
the number of aboriginal people totaled 447,000 in the Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu Area, constituting 2 percent of the entire
population of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the aboriginal population has increased by 22.6
percent over the past 10 years, far greater than the average of 6.8
percent posted by the non-aboriginal population.</P>
      <P>According to the census results, nearly half of the country's
aboriginal people now call Hualien, Taitung and Pingtung counties
their home. Of the total, some 88,000, or about 19.6 percent, live in
Hualien County; 79,000, or about 17.6 percent, are in Taitung County;
and 54,000, or roughly 12.1 percent, live in Pingtung.</P>
      <P>The government currently divides Taiwan's aboriginal people into
10 major mountain tribes and 10 "Pingpu" groups. While elements of
the languages and cultures of the 10 mountainous races have been
maintained, most of the native languages of the "Pingpu" people have
died out, with no traces remaining.</P>
      <P>Anthropologists have said that at least one-third of Taiwan's
population have the blood of "Pingpu" groups -- aboriginal people who
lived in low-lying areas around the island, many of whom intermarried
with Han Chinese.</P>
      <P>The mountainous races include the Atayal, Amis, Bunun, Saisiat,
Tsou, Puyuma, Rukai, Paiwan and Dawu tribes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people could either have originally come from
the southern part of China or from the vast region called the
Austronesian-language area, which spans Madagascar in the east,
across the Indian and Pacific oceans to Easter Island, and from
Taiwan southward to New Zealand.</P>
      <P>In a new theory developed in Australia and New Zealand in recent
years, anthropologists believe that Taiwan is the place where the
Austronesian-language people originated.

    <HEADLINE>YOUNG DPP LAWMAKERS MULLING WAY TO DEFUSE ETHNIC DIVISIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of young lawmakers from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suggested Friday that the party
explicitly recognize Chinese culture as an important part of
Taiwanese culture to help boost ethnic harmony.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers, including Tsai Huang-lang, Chen Chi-mai, Lee
Wen-chung, Kuo Cheng-liang, Chuo Jung-tai and Lo Wen-chia, also
suggested that the DPP define itself as the "ruling party of the
Republic of China" to enhance public recognition of the DPP's role in
today's Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The six legislators, all in their 30s, met Thursday to discuss
measures to defuse mounting political and ethnic divisions in the
wake of the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>During the presidential campaign, President Chen Shui-bian often
assured voters that he wouldn't cave in to Beijing, and he often
questioned his sole challenger Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's
willingness to stand up to Beijing. Some observers feel that
political and ethnic divisions have become more serious after
Taiwan-born Chen narrowly defeated mainland China-born Lien.</P>
      <P>Except for a small group of aboriginal tribes, most of Taiwan's
23 million people are ethnic Chinese. But the population can be
divided into two sub-ethnic groups: the "mainlanders" whose families
fled to Taiwan when the Chinese Communists took over the mainland in
1949, and the "native Taiwanese" whose ancestors began arriving on
the island in the 17th century or earlier.</P>
      <P>The mainlanders, about 15 percent of the population, have largely
supported the opposition KMT and its ally, the People First Party,
and their support base is in northern Taiwan. The native Taiwanese
control the south, and they tend to favor Chen's DPP and the smaller
Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>The mainlanders have traditionally supported eventual unification
with mainland China, while the native Taiwanese lean more toward
formal independence.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lo said they have reached consensus on some major
divisive issues and will present their common views to the
Presidential Office, the Cabinet and DPP headquarters to serve as
reference in future policy formulation.</P>
      <P>The DPP was founded in Taiwan as opposed to the opposition KMT
which moved from mainland China to Taiwan in 1949 and had ruled
Taiwan for more than five decades until May 2000. The DPP used to
promote de jure Taiwan independence. With a view to expanding its
support base, the DPP passed a "Resolution on Taiwan's Future" in
1999, which defines Taiwan as an independent sovereign state with an
official title of the "Republic of China." At the time, the DPP had
not yet come to power.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP won the presidency in 2000, many people,
particularly those from the opposition camp, still perceive it as a
pro-independence party intending to build a "Republic of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lo said that since President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu
were re-elected in the March 20 election strictly in line with ROC
law, the DPP should clearly define itself as the ruling party of the
ROC.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has been in power for four years and will remain in
power for the coming four years, we should step up publicity to win
wide public recognition as the ROC's ruling party," Lo said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lo said the DPP should separate culture from politics
in defining relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"From the viewpoint of politics, Taiwan is not part of the
People's Republic of China. But from the viewpoint of culture,
Chinese culture is an integral and essential part of Taiwanese
culture. Our language, Chinese script and Buddhist culture all come
from China. This an undeniable fact. By recognizing the role of
Chinese culture, the DPP will become more inclusive and may be able
to attract more supporters," Lo said.</P>
      <P>Worried about ethnic divisions, DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung
also urged President Chen last Firday to ban DPP politicians from
kaing "love Taiwan" a campaign theme in the year-end legislative
election.</P>
      <P>Shen, a physician-turned-lawmaker, said he is convinced
that an overwhelming majority of local residents love Taiwan.
Therefore, he said, the ruling DPP should not make "love Taiwan" its
campaign theme or platform any longer.</P>
      <P>"All politicians, particularly DPP members, should refrain from
taking advantage of this topic," Shen urged.</P>
      <P>As a ruling party, Shen went on, the DPP should not use
differences over policy toward mainland China, feelings toward
mainland China and the time of immigration from mainland China as
standards to measure whether an individual person loves Taiwan or
not.</P>
      <P>Since there is not an objective and scientific method to gauge
the magnitude of a "love for Taiwan," Shen said, the DPP should
not bring up this topic in its campaign literature or rallies in the
run-up to the December legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"As the DPP chairman, President Chen is also obligated to 'do
something' to mend ethnic divisions which have become very serious
after the presidential election, " Shen said, adding that Chen should
order all party members intending to run in the year-end legislative
elections to refrain from campaigning on a "love Taiwan" platform and
from bringing up ethnic issues.</P>

Insurance Cuts for Retired Employees.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission voted Thursday to
allow employers to reduce or eliminate health benefits for retirees
when they become eligible for Medicare at age 65.

Employers and some labor unions supported the change, saying it
would help preserve coverage for early retirees. But AARP, which
represents millions of Americans age 50 and older, strenuously
objected.

The new rule creates a potentially explosive political issue,
because it will create anxiety for many of the 12 million Medicare
beneficiaries who also receive health benefits from their former
employers.

Wall Street Journal: Google Is Expected to Announce Plans for
Initial Public Offering.

Internet-search pioneer Google Inc. plans to announce within days
that it will push forward with an initial public offering, according
to people familiar with the matter.

The announcement is linked to the fact that Google will soon be
required to disclose publicly more information about its business,
under a Securities and Exchange Commission rule triggered after
closely held companies surpass a certain size. Google is expected to
have to make such disclosures as early as next week. Lawyers have
said that the disclosure requirements can be a trigger for companies
to list their shares.

Any IPO would likely come as the technology market has rebounded
from its lows, Internet companies have seen their shares rise, and
revenue, particularly from advertising, has returned. Google couldn't
be filing for an IPO at a more opportune time: the company is the No.

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS URGES PUBLIC TO AVOID MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the public Friday to refrain
from traveling to mainland China after reports of two suspected cases
of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) there.</P>
      <P>The SARS cases were the first to be reported on the mainland
following the outbreaks that lasted from early last year until the
summer.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-yi, DPP legislative whip, expressed concern about the
two infected mainland residents, but at the same time expressed
regret that the mainland authorities failed to immediately inform
Taiwan of the cases.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the atypical pneumonia caused heavy losses in
Taiwan last year, including 37 deaths, and claimed this was because
of Beijing's deliberate hiding of the SARS outbreaks on its
territory.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health has announced a heightening of its SARS
alert level from Zero to A from Saturday, which will include
mandatory daily temperature-taking in schools and kindergartens,
while passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau
will be instructed to exercise health-management measures.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang also suggested that Taiwan
residents should refrain from traveling to the mainland to avoid
being infected.</P>
      <P>Lee also said he would suggest to the Presidential Office that
mass rallies should be scaled down to minimize the chances of
transmission during such rallies.</P>
      <P>As for a planned cerebration rally of 500,000 people on the May
20 inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian, there are no plans for
any changes, although the caucus will ask the Presidential Office to
give it second thoughts.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and People First Party not to become "addicted to mass
rallies." He was referring to the several mass protest rallies staged
by the alliance in the wake of the March 20 presidential election,
which the defeated opposition claims was "unfair."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MONUMENT TO LABOR TO BE ERECTED AT TAIPEI 101</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A monument commemorating the value of work
will be erected at the Taipei 101 complex, also known as the Taipei
Financial Center, in Taipei's Hsinyi district, labor rights activists
said Friday.</P>
      <P>It will be Taiwan's first monument to be commissioned and erected
by major local labor organizations and business corporations to
promote safety and health at work, said Huang Hsiao-ling,
secretary-general of the Taiwan Association for Victims of
Occupational Injury (TAVOI).</P>
      <P>Construction of the monument, to be named "Partners, " will get
underway April 28, which is also World Day for Safety and Health at
Work, Huang said.</P>
      <P>She further said the monument will also be dedicated to the
memory of the six workers who died in an accident during construction
of the 101-storey Taipei Financial Center, the world's tallest
building.</P>
      <P>"We hope the monument construction project will help arouse
public awareness of the importance of promoting workplace safety and
health," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Huang said more than 60,000 local
workers died in occupational accidents between 1957 and 2002, while
nearly 300,000 workers became disabled due to occupational injuries
during the same period.</P>
      <P>Huang said 168 countries around the world stage memorial services
annually on World Day for Safety and Health at Work in remembrance of
those who died in occupational accidents.</P>
      <P>To push the government and corporate managers to pay more heed to
workplace safety and health, Huang said the TAVOI and several other
labor rights groups will jointly organize a series of activities,
including an exhibition of paintings created by occupational injury
victims, a musical featuring the plight of occupational injury
victims and a seminar on overwork issues in the run-up to April 28.</P>
      <P>Huang said the TAVOI will also press the government to amend the
existing occupational injury protection law to offer victims better
benefits and assistance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN MAINTAINING GUARD AGAINST SARS: HEALTH OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen has never let down its guard
against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) , with passengers
arriving at Kinmen airport and harbor having their temperatures taken
since last year, health officials of the outlying island said Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after the Department of Health
announced Friday a heightening of the alert level from Zero to A in
the wake of two reported suspected SARS in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The DOH has designated four levels of SARS precaution -- Zero, A,
B, and C -- with C representing the highest level of alert.</P>
      <P>Level A means that all inbound and outbound passengers are
required to have their temperatures taken and to fill out forms
stating that they have not been in contact with suspected cases. All
passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau have
additionally to exercise health-management, including regular
hand-washing and temperature taking, while all government agencies
and institutions are advised to conduct temperature taking measures.</P>
      <P>Also under Level A, all elementary and high schools,
kindergartens and nurseries around the island should take their
students' temperatures every day. Moreover, hospitals and SARS
monitoring stations around Taiwan are required to report their SARS
prevention situation every week to the DOH.</P>
      <P>Kinmen is one of the two outlying islands that have close
exchanges with mainland China after direct trade, postal and
transport links, or the "mini three links" with Fujian province were
established in 2001. The other is Matsu.</P>
      <P>Kinmen health official Chen Tien-shun said that
temperature-taking measures for inbound and outbound tourists have
never stopped since the outbreaks of SARS in Taiwan early last year.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Kinmen has maintained a level A alert because of
its proximity to the mainland, adding that since March this year, all
Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland, not just Taiwan
businessmen in Fujian Province, have been able to travel between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait via the "mini three links" channel, so
that the officials have to be more cautious.</P>
      <P>Yen Chi-heng, an official of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control, said that infrared thermal imaging machines were installed
at the harbor and airport to measure temperatures, and arriving
passengers have to fill out health forms. If an arriving passenger is
detected to have a temperature of over 38 degrees, he or she will be
sent to Kinmen county hospital for further checkups.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was hit hard by SARS between March and June last year,
resulting in incalculable trade and economic losses, as well as 37
fatalities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGES MAINLAND CHINA TO REFRAIN FROM CONCEALING SARS CASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged
the mainland Chinese authorities Friday to refrain from concealing
cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) now that the
potentially fatal flu-like disease is showing signs of resurgence.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tong, vice chairman of the MAC, Taiwan's top mainland
China policy planning agency, said the latest two suspected SARS
cases -- one in Beijing and one in the west-central province of Anhui
-- were only made known several days after they came to light,
underlining once again the mainland authorities' habit of withholding
information on SARS and other epidemic diseases.</P>
      <P>Chen said such concealment, presumably aimed at protecting the
mainland's international image, is putting people's lives at stake
and risks harming the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The latest two reported cases -- one involving a nurse working in
a Beijing hospital and the other involving an unidentified resident
of Anhui Province -- are the first to be reported since the initial
outbreak of the disease there subsided last summer.</P>
      <P>To cope with policies adopted by the Department of Health, which
has upgraded Taiwan's epidemic prevention mobilization level against
SARS from level Zero to level A, the MAC has also activated a series
of SARS-prevention measures that will begin Saturday.</P>
      <P>The measures include that people entering Taiwan from mainland
China, Hong Kong and Macau will be required to conduct self-health
control; that all inbound and outbound passengers will be required to
have their temperatures taken; and that the MAC will try to obtain
quick and first-hand information about the SARS situation in mainland
China via the MAC-authorized office in Hong Kong and the intermediary
Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>The MAC also appealed to Taiwan citizens who have traveled to the
mainland to tell their doctor about their travel history if they
develop fever so as to facilitate the control and treatment of the
communicable disease.</P>
      <P>The MAC is also hastening to have more copies of an anti-SARS
handbook printed so that mainland-bound visitors can use them to
ensure a safer trip to the mainland, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The recurrence of SARS underlines once again the imperative of
cross-strait cooperation in battling epidemic diseases, given that
people from the two sides of the strait have increased their
interactions by leaps and bounds, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He added that it is the mainland authorities' responsibility to
quickly notify Taiwan whenever a SARS case is reported on the
mainland, given that the two sides are now inextricably close, both
economically and socially.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that SARS is communicable in closed
transportation vehicles such as planes and ferries, authorities from
the two sides should communicate further between themselves about
details of cross-strait transportation links, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted, however, that an outbreak of SARS should not be an
obstacle preventing both sides from beginning talks on direct
cross-strait transportation links.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that direct cross-strait transportation links talks
hinged upon the willingness of Beijing, Chen said Taipei has long
been ready and that the talks can start at any time, so long as
Beijing is willing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Friday it has ordered military units to take the temperature of
every service member during morning and evening roll calls every day
as part of its efforts to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) outbreaks.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Lu Li-chun, director of the MND's Medical Affairs
Bureau, made the remarks after attending a supraministerial SARS
prevention meeting organized by the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The meeting came after two suspected cases of the potentially
deadly disease were reported in mainland China. It was decided at the
meeting that Taiwan's epidemic prevention mobilization level against
SARS will be upgraded from Level Zero to Level A from Saturday.</P>
      <P>In fact, Lu said, the military has continued to implement
temperature-taking and self-health management measures since early
January with a view to preventing a SARS comeback.</P>
      <P>"Now that the DOH has decided to launch the level A SARS
prevention campaign, the MND will continue its twice-daily
temperature-taking and self-health management measures to stem any
possible SARS outbreak in military barracks, " Lu said, adding that
his bureau will also strengthen its monitoring of relevant epidemic
developments.</P>
      <P>The health authorities have a four-level SARS alert system --
Zero, A, B, and C -- with level C being the highest level of alert.</P>
      <P>Level A means all inbound and outbound passengers are required to
have their temperatures taken and to fill out SARS questionnaires.
All passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau have
to exercise health-management, including regular hand-washing and
temperature-taking, while all government agencies and institutions
are advised to conduct temperature taking.</P>
      <P>Also under level A, all junior high and elementary schools,
kindergartens and nurseries around the nation should take their
students' temperatures every day. Moreover, hospitals and SARS
monitoring stations around Taiwan are required to report their SARS
situation every week to the DOH.</P>
      <P>Two new suspected SARS cases were reported in mainland China
Thursday -- a 20-year-old nurse in Beijing and a 26-year-old woman
in the eastern province of Anhui. Mainland Chinese health officials
said they have isolated at least five others who reported suffering
fevers -- a key SARS symptom -- and are monitoring scores more.</P>

    <TEXT>The Straits Times: Search called off

More than three days after the cave-in at Singapore Nicoll
Highway, rescuers were forced to call off the search for the last
victim yesterday, because it had become simply too dangerous to carry
on. A slight movement could unsettle the unstable matrix of concrete
slabs, steel beams, rubble and mud and bury rescue workers alive. If
that happened, it would also endanger the surrounding area.

    <HEADLINE>CLA CHAIRWOMAN RULES OUT IMPORT OF WORKERS FROM MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
Chairwoman Chen Chu said Saturday that she will not lift a ban on
imports of mainland Chinese blue-collar workers during her stint as
the nation's top labor administrator.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge in a speech delivered at a special class for
graduate students at National Sun Yat-sen University in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>With a view to protecting the employment rights of Taiwanese
workers, Chen said Taiwan's job market will not be opened to mainland
blue-collar workers so long as she is in her current post.</P>
      <P>Chen's promise came after the county government of the offshore
defense outpost of Kinmen, which lies closer to mainland China's
Fujian Province than to Taiwan, began pushing the CLA to permit the
import of mainland laborers to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>In her speech, Chen also said the CLA is working ahrd to realize
its goal of setting up a vocational training and job placement center
in each township around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The one-township-one-footfold plan is aimed at letting every
unemployed worker receive unemployment subsidy and suitable vocational
training so that they can return to the job market again," Chen
said, adding that the CLA will further integrate job training
resources and commission professional institutes to assist in
manpower training.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CLA will also streampline job placement services
to ensure that disadvantaged groups, including indigenous people,
divorced women with young children and middle-age unemployed
workers, receive suitable job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Noting that reducing the number of foreign workers has been one
of the toughest tasks for the CLA, Chen said the number of foreign
workers in the construction and manufacturing industries has
declined, but the number of foreign caregivers has continued to
increase due to humanitarian considerations.</P>
      <P>"If we cut the number of foreign caregivers, more than 110,000
local families with disabled family members will face even more
hardships and difficulties," Chen said, adding that the CLA is
still figuring feasible measures to resolve relevant
issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PITCHES FOR TRUST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" Saturday to heed the legality and
legitimacy of its methods while contesting the result of the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen won re-election by a slim margin of 29,518 votes out of the
more than 13 million ballots cast in the poll -- a result that
defeated "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan has contested by bringing two lawsuits, while his
supporters have engaged in sometimes violent street protests.</P>
      <P>Addressing a joint opening ceremony for classes at the Ketagalan
Academy, Chen said that in democratic society, people are eligible to
express their opinions.</P>
      <P>"What I'm worried about is the reasons for and methods of the
protests. I'm convinced that the majority of our people disagree with
the use of the national flag to attack police officers. Nor would
they agree to protesters storming the Central Election Commission and
police offices under the shield of the national flag," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Pan-blue alliance" supporters have staged a string of protests
over the past month, several of which have turned violent. In the
worst case two weeks ago, protesters targeted police with gas bombs
and slingshots, leading to clashes with police that left more than
140 people injured.</P>
      <P>Stressing that patriotism cannot justify violent acts, Chen said
social stability and national progress are extremely important in a
democratic society like Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he firmly supports a legal settlement to
election disputes, but he added that he is very worried about how
government authority can be enforced if there is no trust in the
judiciary, investigators, physicians or even internationally renowned
forensic experts.</P>
      <P>The KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" has filed two lawsuits seeking to
nullify the election results and even the entire election so that a
new one can be held. Chen has agreed to a full-scale vote recount
even though the "pan-blue alliance" has provided little evidence of
any voting irregularities. The Taiwan High Court has tentatively
decided to start the vote recount by May 10 so that the work can be
completed by May 20, when Chen will be sworn in for a second
four-year term.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear how the "pan-blue alliance" will respond if
the recount fails to reverse the result.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the alliance has been pushing the government to form
an investigative committee under the Legislative Yuan to probe the
unsolved election-eve 19 shooting that slightly injured Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu. The alliance argues that the shooting unfairly
swayed sympathy votes in Chen's favor and has even insinuated that
the shooting was staged, again, without any supporting evidence.</P>
      <P>In fact, law enforcement authorities have already formed a
special task fore to investigate the shooting, with State Public
Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa as its convener. The task force has
invited renowned U.S. experts, including renowned Chinese-American
forensic scientist Dr. Henry Lee, to assist in examining the physical
evidence gathered from the scene of the shooting.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" is still reluctant to drop its
allegations against the shooting, even though the U.S. forensics
experts have largely ruled out any possibility that the shooting was
staged.</P>
      <P>Chen said all these disputes indicate that there is still ample
room for improvement in Taiwan's young democracy. "Trust is the
bedrock of democratic development. We'll pursue not only a tangible
democratic system but also intangible democratic culture, quality and
way of life," he added.</P>
      <P>The Ketagalan Academy was founded by Chen last year to nurture a
new generation of leaders in various fields. Chen said at Saturday's
ceremony that the school is aimed at cultivating leadership talent
that can contribute to Taiwan's democratic development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) are expected to join the administration
during President Chen Shui-bian's second term, a senior DPP official
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The official, who asked not to be named, confirmed a local
newspaper report Saturday that DPP Legislator Luo Wen-chia will fill
the vacancy left by Yeh Chu-lan as chairman of the Council for Hakka
Affairs after Yeh is promoted to the post of deputy premier.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Cho Jung-tai will replace Chen Che-nan as
deputy general-secretary of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chi-mai, who served as spokesman for the DPP
legislative caucus and was said to replace Lin Chia-lung as spokesman
for the Executive Yuan in the same report, confirmed that he has been
approached for a possible job in the administration, but said that no
specific offer had been made to him thus far.</P>
      <P>The anonymous DPP official said there is a consensus among the
DPP leadership that more capable party lawmakers need to be groomed
into future party leaders by broadening their horizons with
experience of service in the government.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Yeh Yi-jin denied a report that she will be
recruited into the new Cabinet as head of the National Youth
Commission, saying it is not her plan and that she has commitments to
her constituents in Tainan.</P>
      <P>Instead, Yeh said, she will enter the year-end race for another
term in the Legislative Yuan. She denounced the report as a plot to
ruin her re-election campaign.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Chen Chi-nan, who was said to take
over the Council for Cultural Affairs in the report, said he has not
yet been consulted.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, "as a member of the ruling team, I will do
whatever job is assigned to me."</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung denied that he was tapped
to be president of the Control Yuan, pointing out that the term of
the incumbent chief of the Control Yuan has not yet ended and that

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ON  ALERT AGAINST SARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan raised its alert against severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Saturday after Beijing confirmed
two cases a day earlier in mainland China, in addition to two already
reported suspected cases and one possible fatality.</P>
      <P>Health officials began taking the temperatures of inbound
passengers at the country's international airports. Those who show an
abnormally high temperature on a thermal imaging system will be asked
to undergo temperature-checking with an ear thermometer, according to
the Department of Heath.</P>
      <P>Passengers arriving from Beijing and Anhui -- the two regions
where the latest SARS cases were found -- will be required to
complete an investigation form at the airport and will be subject to
daily checks by medical workers via telephone for at least 10 days to
ensure that they have not developed SARS symptoms.</P>
      <P>As no cases have yet been reported in Taiwan so far, outbound
passengers are not required to have their temperatures taken, the
health officials said.</P>
      <P>Similar precautionary measures are being taken at local
hospitals, with thermal imaging equipment set up at entrances.</P>
      <P>Medical staff are required to wear surgical masks in hospitals
and those who have visited Beijing or Anhui recently have been asked
to take their own temperature twice a day and alert medical staff if
they develop fever that is typical of SARS.</P>
      <P>Health authorities also suggested that the public wash their
hands frequently, which is an easy and effective way to destroy the
coronavirus that causes the disease.</P>
      <P>Department of Health Minister Chen Chien-jen said there are
plenty of surgical masks and gowns to meet one month's-worth of heavy
demand should the disease develop into an epidemic, or between six
month's- and a year's-worth in the preliminary stages.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the number of SARS cases on the mainland will
surge to between 30 and 300, given that a virus-carrier traveled
between Beijing and Hefei in Anhui Province before being admitted to
a hospital in Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMISTS ESTIMATE LITTLE IMPACT ON ECONOMY FROM SARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although a resurgence of suspected cases
of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mainland China has
prompted Taiwan to upgrade its alert level against the disease,
several economists forecast Saturday that it is not expected to cause
a major impact on the local economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan activated a level A alert against SARS Saturday in the
wake of a report of two suspected SARS cases on the mainland -- one
in Beijing and the other in Anhui Province. It was the first such
case so far this year after SARS outbreaks last spring.</P>
      <P>Kung Ming-hsing, a section director of the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research, noted that as Taiwan already has mechanisms and
preparations for the fight against the flu-like disease, he predicted
that this time, Taiwan's economy will suffer much less than it did
last year.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Kung said, the areas where the new SARS cases
appeared are not traditionally the main areas where Taiwan companies
set up their mainland operations.</P>
      <P>However, Kung added that if the mainland government makes the
SARS situation there more transparent, the impact on Taiwan will be
much smaller.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chou Chi, a department director of the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research, said it remains to be seen whether
the SARS situation will worsen on the mainland.</P>
      <P>If the mainland authorities cancel a traditional long vacation
for laborers in early May due to the epidemic, it will affect
Taiwan's exports of certain items there, as many people use the
holiday period to buy "hot" consumer goods such as mobile phones.</P>
      <P>Last May, when SARS cases were rampant on the mainland, the
government canceled the holiday in order not to further propagate the
epidemic, resulting indirectly in the decrease of sales of some
Taiwan-made products.</P>
      <P>However, Chou said that in comparison with the worldwide SARS
panic last year, this time both the government and the public in
Taiwan are more prepared for a possible resurgence of the disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES PASSAGE OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS BEFORE CABINET RESIGNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, April 25 (CAN) The Legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday that the Cabinet
should only resign en masse after the passage of the 10 major
construction projects in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, DPP whip in the legislature, said that if the
ruling and opposition parties, after four months of consultations
which will end April 30, still cannot reach an agreement on the
expansion of the public construction investment bill, which will
provide the legal basis for the five-year, NT$500 billion (US$15.15
billion) construction projects, then it will have to put the bill to
a vote.</P>
      <P>He said that only after the bill is passed can the legislature
start to review the special budgets for the construction projects.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Executive Yuan was to resign en masse May 5,
and that the line-up of the next Cabinet will assume office May 20
when President Chen Shui-bian is sworn in for a second term in
office.</P>
      <P>But he said that Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who
concurrently serves as the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vice chairman,
and other KMT legislators have questioned the necessity of passing
the bill because Premier Yu Shyi-kun's Cabinet will be a "guardian
Cabinet" during the transition period.</P>
      <P>Believing that the public construction projects have to be
carried out continuously and that they should not be affected by the
Cabinet change, Ker said that if the Cabinet resigns en masse too
early, it will give opposition parties excuses to challenge the
legality of passing the bill.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chia-lung, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan
echoed Ker's view that the construction projects should be passed
soon.</P>
      <P>Responding to reports that the KMT legislative caucus is not
ruling out the possibility of reviewing the special budget for the
construction projects only after the inauguration of President Chen
May 20, Lin urged the opposition to set a timetable.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed that although the Cabinet will resign en masse,
which is a formality under the Constitution, administration work will
not be interrupted.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the projects will provide a chance for
reconciliation between the ruling and the opposition parties after
the bitterly contested March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun hopes to call on Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang, and hopes that Wang can coordinate a meeting between the ruling
and opposition parties for a speedy review of the 10 construction
projects, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin urged the opposition Legislative Yuan caucus to set a
timetable for approving the projects this session, which ends in
May, and "we will respect it." If the timetable is not adhered to,
the opposition parties "will have to take responsibility," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CONSCIOUSNESS AT CORE OF NEW POLITICAL LANDSCAPE: CNA CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Frankfurt,  April  24 (CNA)
(By Liao Yi-jun &amp; Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rise of people's identification
with Taiwan has been a decisive factor in the shift of Taiwan's
political landscape, Su Tzen-ping, chairman of the Central News
Agency, said Saturday in Frankfurt.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of the German Chapter of the Global Alliance
for Democracy and Peace, Su said many opinion polls in Taiwan have
shown that the number of Taiwan residents who identify themselves as
Taiwanese has been increasing, while the number of those who identify
themselves as Chinese has been decreasing.</P>
      <P>The trend was borne out in the result of Taiwan's March 20
presidential election that saw President Chen Shui-bian, an advocate
of a Taiwan-centric consciousness, win re-election with more than
6.47 million votes, up nearly 1.5 million votes over the figure he
obtained four years ago, Su noted.</P>
      <P>Basically, Su went on, there exists no conspicuous difference
between the public policies of the "pan green camp, " who support
Chen, and the opposition "pan blue alliance" of Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he added, given Beijing's insistence in its
"one-China" principle and intervention by the United States in
cross-Taiwan Strait issues, the policies related to Taiwan's
independence or its unification with mainland China by both the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the KMT have few differences.</P>
      <P>What does make them different is that political evolution in
Taiwan has been moving toward the "pan green camp" since the lifting
of martial law in 1987, due to the emergence of a consciousness of
Taiwan identity, Su told the nearly 100 participants at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Any division of ethnic groups in Taiwan derives from the rivalry
of national identity, Su said, suggesting that how to deal with this
problem will be an important issue for the future of Taiwan's
democratic development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTEGRATING MAINLAND, TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRIES KEY: TSMC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Boao,   Hainan,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China's
semiconductor industries, if efficiently integrated in technology and
production, will become global industry leaders in 10 years, Taiwan's
semiconductor industry patriarch Morris Chang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang, chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
(TSMC) , made the remarks while speaking at an entrepreneurs summit
meeting Sunday morning. The summit is part of the 2004 annual
conference of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), which is currently being
convened at the scenic southern Chinese resort island of Hainan.</P>
      <P>Speaking about business cooperation, corporate brand names and
economic globalization, Chang said that 19 years ago, when he first
arrived in Taiwan from the United States, he saw Taiwan's advantage
in developing intelligence-driven high technology, such as
semiconductor manufacture.</P>
      <P>A large pool of hard-working and highly skilled workers -- many
of them holding master's or doctoral degrees in sciences or
technologies, was Taiwan's advantage in developing
high-technology-based industries nearly two decades ago, and today, a
similar competitive edge is being found in mainland China, Chang
noted.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, he said, Taiwan's semiconductor industry
has been developing dynamically in terms of silicon wafer processing,
the building of systems frameworks, testing and marketing.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out, however, that the industry soon faced its
market boundaries as the domestic market in Taiwan is too small.
Comparatively, he added, the domestic market in mainland China is
much bigger, helping push back market boundaries for the development
of the semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's semiconductor industry is tied with its mainland
Chinese counterpart, the industry's competitiveness will double,
making it an invincible competitor in the world's semiconductor
market, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang, who himself has invested a semiconductor processing plant
in mainland China, said the mainland Chinese semiconductor industry
is now a rival as well as a partner to TSMC, which he said is not at
all lacking competitors from the United States and South Korea.</P>
      <P>TSMC has posted an average of 30 percent growth in annual
business turnover over the past 10 years and similar growth is likely
to average about 20 percent in the following years, Chang forecast.</P>
      <P>Some 1,000 political, business and industrial leaders from around
the world are attending the 2004 annual conference of the Boao Forum
for Asia. Prominent figures include mainland Chinese President Hu
Jintao, former Philippines President Fidel V. Ramos, Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa, Macau Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau-wah,
Czech Republic President Vaclav Klaus, former U.S. President George
Bush and former Australia Prime Minister Robert Hawke.</P>
      <P>Delegates from Taiwan to the conference include former Republic
of China Premier Vincent Siew and Kao Chin-yen, founder and CEO of
the Uni-President Group.</P>
      <P>Founded in 2001, the BFA is a non-governmental, non-profit,
regular and open international forum with a fixed venue. Promoting
high-level dialogue on regional issues such as economic development,
population and the environment, the BFA is aimed at helping deepen
mutual understanding and cooperation among Asian countries, and
strengthen ties between Asia and the rest of the world.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will seek to revise the Referendum Law first and then hold a
referendum to reduce the size of the legislature at the end of this
year, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, DPP whip in the legislature, said that it
appears that the opposition Kuomintang is not opposed to revising the
law, so the chances are good that the legislation can be passed
before the end of the current legislative session, which ends on the
last day of May.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior recently asked that the Referendum
law, which was passed in late November, be amended to include the
right of the people to initiate constitutional amendment proposals.</P>
      <P>Currently, only the legislature can propose constitutional
amendments. They are then turned over to the National Assembly, which
would subsequently meet to vote on the issue.</P>
      <P>The DPP hopes to hold a referendum along with the December
legislative elections on halving the 225-seat Legislature using a
revised referendum law, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the DPP,
said that as long as the Referendum Law is revised and stipulates
clearly that the people have the right to initiate constitutional
amendment proposals, the party will immediately submit several
amendment proposals.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsien-jen, a TSU official, said that the revisions mulled by
the Ministry of the Interior are largely the same as those of his
party. Both advocate that the public should have the right to
initiate constitutional amendment proposals and that there is no need
for a referendum review committee, but they disagree on the
percentage of people that must endorse a proposal and establish a
referendum.</P>
      <P>He said that if the thresholds are lowered, the right to call for
a referendum could be abused; therefore, more discussion on the issue
is needed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAN BEING MONITORED FOR SARS AFTER RETURNING FROM BEIJING WITH FEVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan man returning from Beijing with
a fever has been quarantined and is under observation, although lab
tests indicate that he is not infected with severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and his fever has subsided, Su Ih-jen,
director-general of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health (DOH), said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The man, surnamed Hung, was found to have a temperature of over
38 degrees Celsius upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport Saturday and is currently under medical observation at a
Taoyuan hospital.</P>
      <P>Su said although the temperature of the researcher of a private
biotechnology company has dropped to a normal level, the hospital
will continue to monitor him until 11 p.m. Sunday to make sure that
he has not contracted SARS.</P>
      <P>If Hung, who was in Beijing between April 19-24 and had visited a
lab where one of the latest SARS cases was reported, does not have a
fever or any other symptoms in the 24 hours after his return to
Taiwan, he will be allowed to leave the hospital and go home, Su
said.</P>
      <P>Lab results were negative for SARS, showing that Hung was
probably not infected, Su said.</P>
      <P>The DOH and the CDC jointly sponsored an emergency news
conference at 11: 20 p.m. Saturday to notify the public and the world
medical community on how Taiwan's health care personnel will deal
with the situation.</P>
      <P>This is the first case of an individual being monitored for
possible SARS infection since the outbreaks of the potentially-fatal
flu-like disease in mainland China subsided last summer.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) upgraded Taiwan's epidemic
prevention mobilization level against SARS from Level Zero to Level A
from Saturday after Beijing confirmed two SARS cases a day earlier in
mainland China, in addition to two already reported suspected cases
and one possible fatality.</P>
      <P>Under the activated Level A SARS alert mechanism, all inbound and
outbound passengers are required to have their temperatures taken and
to fill out SARS questionnaires. All passengers arriving from
mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau have to exercise self-health
management, including regular hand-washing and temperature-taking,
while all government agencies and institutions are advised to conduct
temperature-taking.</P>
      <P>The CDC sponsored a follow-up news conference Sunday morning to
further keep Taiwan society and the world medical community abreast
of the condition of Taiwan's latest suspected SARS case.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director-general of the CDC, said the
center has contacted Hung's six corporate colleagues who were
traveling with him to Beijing for meetings with their counterparts in
mainland China on biotechnology business and told them to begin
self-health management against possible SARS infection.</P>
      <P>The CDC has also informed the Taipei office of the Hong
Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways to have passengers who were seated
six rows nearest to Hung's seat on flight CX 402 from Hong Kong to
Taipei to start self-health management as well, Chou added.</P>
      <P>The DOH has a four-level SARS alert system -- Zero, A, B, and C
-- with level C being the highest level of alert.</P>
      <P>Also under Level A, all junior high and elementary schools,
kindergartens and nursery schools around the nation should take their
students' temperatures every day. Moreover, hospitals and SARS
monitoring stations around Taiwan are required to report their
SARS-related health situations every week to the DOH.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate fell to 4.45
percent in March, the lowest monthly level since June 2001, according
to the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>There were about 452,000 unemployed people across Taiwan in
March, down 0.16 percent, or 16,000 people, and down 0.63 percent
from the previous month's level and from the year-earlier level,
respectively, a census carried out and made public over the weekend
by the DGBAS showed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Q1 unemployment averaged 4.53 percent, down 0.56 percent
from the level posted for the same three-month period last year, the
report showed.</P>
      <P>At the same time, around 971,500 workers were hired across the
country last month, an increase of 29,000 people over the February
level and a large jump of 201,000 people year-on-year.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the improved March unemployment rate
-- the lowest level in nearly 34 months -- to a steadily recovering
economy across the globe, which has spurred strong demand for both
inbound and outbound shipments.</P>
      <P>The officials claimed that employment in the domestic market will
continue to improve in the months ahead, despite the fact that a
large number of college and university students in summer will seek
to enter the workplace and push up the country's unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate for the whole of this year will be lower
than 5 percent at around 4.7 percent to 4.8 percent, they estimated,
adding that the figure is expected to further drop by 0.1 percent
should a government initiated "public service employment program" be
extended when its year-long implementation period expires on June
18.</P>
      <P>Compared with neighboring countries in Asia, Taiwan's joblessness
is about the same level of Singapore's 4.5 percent and better than
Hong Kong's 7.2 percent. South Korea has an unemployment rate of
about 3.4 percent, while Japan posts a 5 percent jobless rate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SARS SUPPLIES SUFFICIENT: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are sufficient supplies of medical
materials nationwide in Taiwan's efforts to prevent or battle an
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an official of
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health
(DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Current stocks of N95 surgical masks, protective gear and other
SARS-prevention supplies nationwide are sufficient for use by medical
institutions around the country and for the general public for a
period of 30-45 days, said Shih Wen-yi, a CDC deputy
director-general.</P>
      <P>More precisely, Shih said, the country now has a stock of 4.12
million N95 masks -- sufficient for use for 30 days islandwide in the
event of activation of "Level C" in the DOH's SARS mobilization
mechanism. "Level C" represents the highest level of alert.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shih said, Taiwan now has a stock of 3.11 million
protective outfits and gear, 13.46 million ordinary surgical masks,
and 11.44 million general flat masks. These supplies are sufficient
for use for a period of 30-45 days in the event of "Level C" being
activiated.</P>
      <P>The preparedness of SARS quarantine wards, including hospital
negative-pressure ward beds, is also under constant monitoring, Shih
added.</P>
      <P>The CDC began to take full inventory of the country's
SARS-fighting medical supplies again over the weekend after fresh
cases of SARS were reported in mainland China, with which Taiwan
citizens have maintained close and frequent exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was hit hard by SARS between March and June last year,

    <HEADLINE>THIRD SARS TEST CONDUCTED ON MAN RETURNING FROM BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Health authorities decided Monday to take
yet another throat secretion sample from a man who visited Beijing
last week and developed a fever upon returning to Taiwan to confirm
that he has not been infected with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) virus.</P>
      <P>This is the third time that a throat secretion sample from the
researcher who works at a private Taiwan biotechnology company is
tested for SARS since his return Saturday evening. The first two
tests were negative.</P>
      <P>The researcher, surnamed Hung, has been quarantined and put under
observation at a Taoyuan hospital since he was discovered to have a
temperature higher than 38 degrees Celsius Saturday evening upon
returning from his week-long visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) under the Department of Health (DOH), said Monday that
the researcher will be allowed to leave the hospital and go home if
his temperature remains normal, he shows no other SARS-related
symptoms, and he tests negative for the SARS virus. The results of
the third test are expected to come out after 4 p.m., according to
Shih.</P>
      <P>The reason Hung is being tested three times is that previous
cases have shown that SARS symptoms sometimes resurface after a
person's temperature returns to normal and the person is declared
SARS free, said CDC Director-General Su Ih-jen during a press
conference held Sunday.</P>
      <P>While in Beijing between April 19-24, Hung visited a lab where
one of the latest SARS cases in mainland China had been reported. His
case has drawn much attention from Taiwan's health authorities as it
has occurred at a time when the potentially fatal flu-like disease
has been showing signs of resurgence on the Chinese mainland,
particularly in Beijing, since last week.</P>
      <P>The DOH and the CDC jointly sponsored an emergency news
conference at 11: 20 p.m. Saturday to notify the public and the world
medical community on how Taiwan's health care personnel will deal
with the situation.</P>
      <P>This is the first case in Taiwan of an individual being monitored
for possible SARS infection since the outbreaks of the atypical
pneumonia in mainland China subsided last summer.</P>
      <P>The DOH upgraded Taiwan's epidemic prevention mobilization level
against SARS from "Level Zero" to "Level A" from Saturday after
Beijing confirmed two SARS cases a day earlier in mainland China, in
addition to two already reported suspected cases and one possible
fatality from the disease.</P>
      <P>Under the activated "Level A" SARS alert mechanism, all inbound
and outbound passengers are required to have their temperatures taken
and to fill out SARS questionnaires. All passengers arriving from
mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau have to exercise self-health
management, including regular hand-washing and temperature-taking,
while all government agencies and institutions are advised to conduct
temperature-taking.</P>
      <P>The CDC sponsored a follow-up news conference on Sunday to
further keep the Taiwan public and the world medical community
abreast of the situation regarding Taiwan's latest suspected SARS
case.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director-general of the CDC, said the
center has contacted Hung's six corporate colleagues who had been
traveling with Hung to Beijing for meetings with their counterparts
in mainland China on biotechnology business, and has told them to
begin self-health management against possible SARS infection.</P>
      <P>The CDC has also informed the Taipei office of Hong Kong-based
Cathay Pacific Airways to have passengers who were seated within six
rows of Hung's seat on flight CX-402 from Hong Kong to Taipei to
start self-health management as well, Chou added.</P>
      <P>The DOH has a four-level SARS alert system -- Zero, A, B, and C
-- with level C being the highest level of alert.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was hit hard by SARS between March and June last year,
resulting in 37 deaths and heavy economic losses.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
sued President Chen Shui-bian and former President Lee Teng-hui
Monday for slander, claiming compensation of NT$60 million (US$1.51
million).</P>
      <P>PFP official Chang Hsien-yao said Chen and Lee defamed the PFP by
branding protests called by the PFP and Kuomintang (KMT) against what
they call an "unfair" presidential election between March 20 and
March 27 as "unsuccessful coup d'etat."</P>
      <P>Chang said his party asked the two to apologize before 3 p.m.
Monday but the request was brushed aside by both men.</P>
      <P>A lawyer for the party noted at a press conference called to
announce the action that the incumbent president is exempt from
criminal lawsuits but will have to answer the charge after his term
falls due in 2008 and will "not be free from his civic responsibility
now" if he is found guilty of slander.</P>
      <P>Lee was named in the suit as a defendant for making similar
accusation separately.</P>
      <P>The lawyer challenged Chen and Lee to come up with evidence to
verify their accusations or plead guilty to slander.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-fang, director of the Department for Public Affairs
under the Presidential Office, was also named as a defendant in the
lawsuit because he defended Chen's accusation by arguing that the
president was only describing the situation during the protests.</P>
      <P>The KMT did not participate in the lawsuit but its officials and
lawmakers launched a broadside at the president.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan was quoted by KMT spokeswoman Kuo
Shui-chun as dismissing the coup d'etat claim as "absolute
nonsense."</P>
      <P>By describing the legal protests as a military coup d'etat, Kuo
said, "the president is insulting the country's armed forces and
negating the country's democracy, which guarantees to the people the
right to express their opinions through demonstrations."</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a vice
chairman of the KMT, said the accusation of military coup d'etat is a
serious one and that the president is undermining his credibility by
trying to debase the opposition with inflated accusations.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the mayor of Taipei and also a KMT vice chairman,
said the president should support his accusation with evidence or
acknowledge that it was a slip of tongue and withdraw it.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Liao Feng-teh, the KMT caucus legislative whip, said
Chen and Lee were exaggerating to scare the people.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Huang Teh-fu said the president is trying to
debase the opposition and should be called to account for this.
However, he said his party has no plans to join the PFP in
the suit against Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen's Democratic Progressive Party took the lawsuit in its
stride. Cheng Wen-tsan, a DPP official, said his party welcomes the
PFP's legal action as it will give the court a chance to uncover the
truth.</P>
      <P>Claiming that PFP Chairman James Soong said during the protest
that he would lead his supporters to storm the Presidential Office,
and the Lien has accused Chen of "stealing the government, " Cheng
said that whether these extreme remarks give any clues as to their
attempts to stage a coup d'etat should be determined by the judicial
system.</P>
      <P>Huang Chu-wen, chairman of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union, which is made up of followers of Lee, said Lien and Soong
should subject themselves to judicial investigation to see if they
were attempting a coup d'etat.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 10 passengers per day arriving in
Taiwan from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau over the past few
days have been found to have been running fevers, but there is no
need for the public to panic, an official from the Department of
Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su Ih-jen, director of the DOH Center for Disease Control, made
the remarks after Taiwan activated a heightened alert system against
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the wake of reports of
atypical pneumonia cases on the mainland, with one suspected
fatality.</P>
      <P>Taiwan upgraded its SARS alert lever from Zero to A last
Saturday. Among the precautionary measures included in the level A
alert are temperature-taking for all inbound and outbound passengers
and the distribution of health forms to passengers arriving from the
mainland, Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>"Each day, around 10 passengers arriving from mainland China,
Hong Kong and Macau have fever, and one or two of them, after
examination by doctors at the airport, will be sent to a nearby
Taoyuan hospital for further checkups," Su said.</P>
      <P>He noted that according to standard procedure at the airport,
doctors advise those with fever to don a surgical mask and go home to
rest, or else they send them to the hospital for further examination.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Su pointed out, not only SARS patients have fever, with
those who suffer from influenza, dengue fever or malaria also
displaying similar symptoms. He added that during outbreaks of
influenza, 30 to 50 people with fever can be expected to pass through
the airport a day.</P>
      <P>The health official also said that a researcher surnamed Hung who
returned from mainland China and was sent to a hospital for further
observation was a special case because he had visited a lab in
Beijing that had been sealed because of a SARS scare. Hung was
released from hospital Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 36-year-old man surnamed Peng was sent to a Taoyuan
hospital for observation after he returned from the mainland via
Zhuhai, in Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>The man was tested three times and was found to have a
temperature of more than 38 degrees Celsius each time. However, he
was later determined to be suffering from tonsillitis rather than

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco
Hwang hailed Monday the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) as the major
stabilizer to security across the Taiwan Strait over the past 25
years.</P>
      <P>Hwang made the remarks at a tea party held at the Ministry of

Taipei Office under the Washington-based American Institute in Taiwan

      <P>The TRA has served as the framework for the United States in its
dealings with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between
the two countries after Washington switched recognition from Taipei
to Beijing in early 1979. The TRA was signed into law April 10 that
same year by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.</P>
      <P>Praising the TRA as having made a great contribution to
maintaining cross-strait peace and security, Hwang also expressed his
admiration for the vision, insight and wisdom of its drafters in
today's fast-changing world.</P>
      <P>Despite the many changes in the global situation that have taken
place over the past 25 years, the TRA still provides an adequate and
flexible legal basis for two-way contact and exchanges, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Keegan reiterated the United States' "one China"
policy and claimed that the TAR, together with the three joint
communiques inked by Beijing and Washington, have built the core
principles for Washington in its dealings with the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Over the past 25 years, the TRA has helped create a stable and
secure environment in the West Pacific, contributing tremendously to
security and stability in the region, Keegan said and voiced his hope
that it will also be able to offer access for settlement to the
disputes between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>He also pledged that the United States will continue to govern
its arms sales to Taiwan and help the island safeguard itself in
conjunction with the TRA, while seeking to push for the rekindling of
Taipei-Beijing dialogue.</P>
      <P>AIT is responsible for Washington's dealings with Taipei in the
absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INCOSE OPENS FIRST ASIAN BRANCH IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Council on Systems
Engineering (INCOSE) set up Monday its first Asian branch in Taiwan
at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in northern
Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>Elmer Hsu, general director of the ITRI's Center for Aerospace
and System Technology (CAST) , presided over the opening ceremony,
with INCOSE representative Dr. Joseph Kasser and Boeing Corp.
executive Eugene L. Beckles witnessing the event.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, systems engineering serves as a critical
indicator in gauging a country's scientific progress.</P>
      <P>Although some domestic industries have earned listings in the
world's top ranks, Hsu said that the country's large-scale systems
engineering projects, such as the north-south high speed rail
network, the mass rapid transit systems in Taipei and Kaohsiung,
nuclear power plants and aerospace projects, all fall short of
world-class levels.</P>
      <P>In a bid to lay a sound foundation for scientific exploration
through technology transfer and international cooperation, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs thus persuaded INCOSE to set up a branch
at the government-funded ITRI as a platform for training talent in
this field for Taiwan, which is a key segment of the government's
ambitious plan to build the country into a "green silicon island, "
Hsu explained.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he is optimistic about closer exchanges between Taiwan
companies and their foreign counterparts in the field of systems
engineering, which will help upgrade the domestic sector's
international competitive edge and help slash operational costs and
promote added value for many knowledge-based businesses.</P>
      <P>INCOSE is the sole global authoritative organization promoting
the application of an interdisciplinary approach and the means to
enable the realization of successful systems.</P>
      <P>INCOSE members include many heavyweight government bodies and
companies from countries across the globe, including the United
States' NASA and Boeing Corp., as well as Japan's Mitsubishi
Engineering Corp. and France's European Aeronautic Defense and Space
Co.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUR LAWMAKERS SUMMONED IN CONNECTION WITH MARCH 26 RIOTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office summoned
four legislators from the opposition People First Party (PFP) Monday
in connection with the rioting that took place in front of and inside
the Central Election Commission (CEC) March 26.</P>
      <P>All four legislators -- Chiu Yi, Lee Ching-hua, Lin Huei-kuang
and Feng Ting-kuo -- denied that they incited the rioting and
subsequent clashes between police and protesters that led to several
injuries.</P>
      <P>The four were present among the protesters who gathered outside
the CEC building as the commission was about to formally announce the
results of the March 20 presidential election in which President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu won re-election against their
rival "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Lien Chan of the Kuomintang and
James Soong of the PFP.</P>
      <P>Based on evidence collected on that day, along with video clips
provided by several TV stations, police believe that the legislators
violated articles 135 and 136 of the Criminal Code concerning
interference in the implementation of official duty (stopping the CEC
from posting the election results) and the mobilizing of a mass rally
to interfere with official duty.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he had "no regrets" about a series of actions,
including sits-in and rallies, between March 20 and 26, but claimed
he never led or incited people to break into the CEC.</P>
      <P>"My appeal was that the election result was too close and would
require a vote recount, as well as the suspension of the promulgation
of the election results," he said.</P>
      <P>By law, the CEC had to announce the official election results one
week after the election, or March 26.</P>
      <P>Feng claimed that he asked the public not to destroy anything
when he saw people smashing the doors and windows of the CEC.</P>
      <P>"The law authorities, instead of looking into the shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, are looking
into us," he said, adding that "this is stark political persecution."</P>
      <P>Lin also claimed that he did not incite the crowd and challenged
the police to produce evidence or stop fitting him up.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that he only went to the CEC to request that it not
publish the election results, as the ballot boxes had been sealed for
a recount and the "pan-blue alliance" had filed lawsuits to nullify
the election and the election results, citing voting irregularities
and the election-eve shooting that it believes swayed the results in
Chen's favor in the bitterly contested election.</P>
      <P>Chen won by a narrow margin of 29,518 votes against Lien Chan out
of more than 13 million votes cast.</P>

      <P>The Council of Cultural Affairs (CCA)
introduced its Web site on Confucian temples Monday as part of its
efforts to introduce traditional culture using new technology.</P>
      <P>CCA Chairwoman Tchen Yu-chiou said at a press conference that the
Taiwan Confucian Temple Web site was completed in March this year,
compiling tens of thousands of pieces of digital information,
including video and audio information. It will also include 3D
displays, animations and a database.</P>
      <P>Tchen said that in order to improve understanding of history and
national historical sites, the council has appropriated NT$5 million
(US$151,515) for the site.</P>
      <P>The council is hoping that through the creative use of the
collected information on Confucius -- China's most esteemed and
revered sage for his teachings -- and the historic documents of
Confucian temples in Taiwan, the Web site will display the life of
Confucius and the history of Taiwan's Confucian temples.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first Confucian temple was built in Tainan in 1665.</P>
      <P>Tchen said that the site will not only introduce 16 Confucian
temples in Taiwan but will also feature Confucian temples in mainland

    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming Cabinet reshuffle may take
place between May 5 and May 12 and the current Cabinet is expected to
resign en masse during that period, Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The current Cabinet will resign en masse sometime between May
5-12 in line with the announcement of the new Cabinet and pending a
resolution as to whether the 10 New Construction Projects put forward
by the Executive Yuan will clear the Legislative Yuan by the end of
May, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will remain flexible on the exact date as to
when to resign en masse, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In response to the rhetoric by the opposition camp that they may
put off the budget screening for the construction projects beyond the
end of May, Lin appealed for collaboration from the opposition
parties to complete the task as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet spokesman, Premier Yu Shyi-kun has
started contacting and meeting several hopefuls for Cabinet-level
posts in recent days as the May 20 presidential inauguration
approaches.</P>
      <P>The premier will pay equal importance to the issues related to
gender, ethnicity, power transfer and talent recruitment and
exchanges when trying to build a new line-up in the administration
that he will continue to lead, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>In addition to efforts to recruit more capable women leaders for
key government posts, talent individuals of Hakka and other
aboriginal groups as well as younger political elite will also be
targeted, he pointed out, adding that the premier will do his best to
create a new and efficient Cabinet, focusing on smooth administrative
operations and interactions among all government agencies.</P>
      <P>He said that functions and capabilities of the broadly defined
financial and economic agencies, such as the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Ministry of Finance, the Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications will be largely enhanced and
upgraded.</P>
      <P>At the same time, promotion in the fields of education, culture,
technologies and human resources and the forging of public consensus
will be focal points high of the agenda of President Chen Shui-bian
during his second four-year term, he said, adding that the government
will also pay a greater heed to bettering social welfare programs and
improving law and order.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SARS REPORTS CAUSE CONCERN FROM TAIWAN TOURISM INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The reappearance of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mainland China has poured cold water
on Taiwan's tourism industry. Tour operators are holding their breath
to see if the situation worsens and adversely affects their business,
according to an industry source.</P>
      <P>Since three suspected SARS cases were reported over the weekend
in Beijing and Anhui province, domestic tourism agencies are praying
that the situation there does not deteriorate and cause an adverse
impact on Taiwan's outbound and inbound travel at a time when the
domestic industry is trying hard to get on its feet after being dealt
a heavy blow by the disease a year ago, the source said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based tourism agencies specializing in mainland-bound
travel are particularly concerned, as now is a peak time for their
business, the source noted.</P>
      <P>He added that nearly 30 percent of the mainland-bound Taiwan
tourists have canceled their trips upon learning of the SARS reports,
and it forecast that the ratio will increase above 50 percent should
the situation both in the mainland and Taiwan change noticeably.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he pointed out that the SARS impact on Taiwan's
mainland-bound travel this time is unlikely to be so serious as it
was last year, except for trips to Beijing.</P>
      <P>If the mainland's SARS situation gets worse, domestic tourism
agencies may first consider stoping organizing trips to Beijing,
according to the source.</P>
      <P>The spread of SARS would also affect inbound travel to Taiwan, he
said, reminding the public of the fact that many tourism-related
businesses have not yet regained their vigor in the wake of the SARS
outbreaks last year as a result of a large drop in inbound travelers
to Taiwan, in particular those from Japan.</P>
      <P>At a time when many factors remain unclear in the international
and the domestic market, such as the possibility of terrorist
attacks, domestic travel will become increasingly popular among the
people of Taiwan, the source said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COAST GUARD FRIGATE CARRIES OUT RESCUE IN PHILIPPINE WATERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
patrol frigate on Monday rescued six crew members of a Taiwan fishing
boat which ran aground on an isle in Philippine territorial waters
three days ago, CGA sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 600-ton patrol frigate "Hualien" received instructions from
the CGA's southern Taiwan operations center Monday morning to go to
the rescue of the Pingtung-based fishing boat "Hsingyifu" which ran
aground Sunday on an isle near the Batan Islands -- the Philippines'
northernmost island group.</P>
      <P>After obtaining permission from the Philippine authorities, the
"Hualien" entered Philippine waters and rushed to the Batan Islands,
rescuing all six crew members of the "Hsingyifu," including Taiwanese
skipper Chen Tai-long, a Taiwanese engineer, as well as one
Indonesian and three mainland Chinese fishermen, at around 3 p.m.
Monday.</P>
      <P>After the boat ran aground, the skipper radioed the Tongkang
Fishermen's Radio Station for help, which in turn informed the
National Rescue and Relief Command Center about the emergency. The
center notified the CGA southern Taiwan operations center to carry
out rescue operations.</P>
      <P>Chen said that while they were awaiting help in fear because they
were in Philippine territorial waters, they were attacked by
stone-throwing Philippine locals and robbed. Chen said he was even
ordered at gun-point to leave his boat at one point.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the CGA patrol frigate came to their rescue and
brought all of the crew members back to Kaohsiung Harbor. The crew
arrived in Kaohsiung Tuesday morning.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made a pitch for
a new constitution to a group of Scandinavian parliamentarians
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered via teleconference to the Nordic Conference
on Taiwan held Tuesday in Copenhagen, Denmark, Chen said the new
constitution, expected to be ready in 2006, should be worked out
through the consensus of the various political parties, should embody
the people's opinion, and should be approved by the people through a
referendum.</P>
      <P>The president called for the Scandinavian states -- Denmark,
Norway, Finland, Iceland and Sweden, to press the European Union not
to lift a ban on arms sales to mainland China before Beijing
withdraws its missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also urged the five states to support Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Organization, because participation in the international
community should be a basic human right.</P>
      <P>Taiwan shares Scandinavia's belief in democracy, human rights and
peace, and deserves its support, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Nordic Conference on Taiwan brought 30 parliamentarians from
the five Scandinavian states, including Jens Hald Madsen, chairman of

      <P>A U.S. State Department spokesman
confirmed Monday that a high-level envoy sent by President Chen

Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-Jen will meet with and
what issues will be discussed during the meetings.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
insisted Tuesday that the military remained politically neutral
throughout the election period and that the so-called "coup" issue is
non-existent in the military.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng made the remarks a day
after the opposition People First Party (PFP) filed a slander suit
against President Chen Shui-bian, who claimed over the weekend the
the opposition camp planned a coup after his re-election victory in
the March 20 election.</P>
      <P>"Some say the opposition's protests from March 21 through 27 was
an aborted coup d'etat, " Chen said while addressing an anniversary
celebration ceremony at Chiayi Senior High School in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular MND news conference, however, Huang said
the military has consistently remained loyal to the government.</P>
      <P>"It is a consistent position of the military to maintain neutral
and not to involve itself in politics, " Huang said. "The military
belongs to the country rather than to any particular political party
or individual politician. This will remain unchanged no matter which
party comes to power."</P>
      <P>Huang also dismissed as "an unfounded, subjective judgment" a
Jane's report that mainland China can take Taiwan within seven days.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that the writer of the article did not have a
full understanding of the cross-Taiwan Strait situation and the
current state of our combat preparedness, " Huang said, adding that
the military can safeguard national security.</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of supporters of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP staged sometimes
violent protests after Chen defeated the "pan-blue alliance"
presidential candidate, KMT Chairman Lien Chan, by a slim margin.</P>
      <P>The opposition argues that an election-eve shooting that left
Chen and Vice President Annette Lu slightly injured unfairly swayed
sympathy votes in Chen's favor. The opposition has filed two lawsuits
demanding a recount and nullification of the entire election.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court has ruled that a full-scale recount should
begin May 10 at the latest, in order to be finished before Chen's
scheduled May 20 inauguration for a second four-year term.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) decided Tuesday to name 91-93 candidates for the year-end
legislative elections, including 88 candidates selected through
primaries, and three to five candidates drafted by the party
authorities.</P>
      <P>In a meeting of the DPP's Central Executive Committee, the party
decided to put up 31 candidates as potential
legislators-at-large, which are appointed by political parties in
proportion to the number of votes the parties garner in the
elections.</P>
      <P>The committee also decided that DPP candidates who are elected as
lawmakers will have to promise not to compete for chances to run on
DPP tickets for chiefs of cities and counties in 2005.</P>
      <P>The ruling party, which commands 87 seats in the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan, has the largest legislative presence, although it
is still 26 seats shy of a simple majority.</P>
      <P>However, since President Chen Shui-bian won the March 20
presidential election with more than 50 percent of the vote, the
party is looking forward to also boosting its presence in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen, who doubles as DPP chairman, told Tuesday's meeting that
the number of candidates in the legislative elections should be
increased to reflect the party's ambition of controlling the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as Kaohsiung City is set to select 17 councillors in a
by-election, the DPP's Central Executive Committee decided to enter
10 candidates in that race.</P>

      <P>In a bid to improve the marketing of
Taiwan produce around the world, the Council of Agriculture (COA)
will allocate NT$2.2 billion (US$66.67 million) for a three-year
global promotion campaign starting this year, COA Chairman Lee

      <P>Lee made the remarks during a visit to central Yunlin County,
where he inspected fruit and vegetable cooperative farms and a flower
cultivation and study center. The COA head praised the fine quality
of the many locally produced farm products on display.</P>
      <P>Saying that the money will be used over the coming three years to
step up the marketing and distribution of Taiwan vegetables and fruit
in the world market, Lee added that the COA's first-phase efforts

      <P>The COA plans to promote up-scale Taiwan produce such as Oolong

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should do its best to assuage U.S.
concern over its plan to craft a new constitution in 2006, and try
hard to address both national and U.S. interests while engaging in
the issue, Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks to local media during a visit to the Asian
Vegetable Research and Development Center in southern Tainan County.</P>
      <P>In the face of deep U.S. concern over possible complications that
Washington thinks may arise from a new Taiwan constitution in 2006
that President Chen Shui-bian has repeatedly pledged since his March
20 re-election, the foreign minister said that Taiwan must fully
explain its stance as an independent sovereignty to the United States
while seeking not to damage the interests of a long-term ally.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should do what it has to do and take into account its own
interests, as well as those of its ally," Chen said.</P>
      <P>David J. Keegan, deputy director of the Taipei office of the
Washington-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , said a day
earlier at a tea party held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that
"there are limitations to the U.S. support" for Taiwan's plan to
hammer out a new constitution in 2006.</P>
      <P>AIT is responsible for U. S. dealings with Taiwan in the absence
of formal diplomatic relations after the two nations suspended ties
in 1979.</P>
      <P>Keegan's statement came after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs James Kelly testified before
Congress last week that "pushing for independence carries the
potential for a response from mainland China... that could destroy
much of what Taiwan has built and crush its hopes for the future."
Kelly also urged President Chen to exercise" restrained leadership."</P>
      <P>Commenting that Keegan's words do not represent any fresh
thinking but are only a reiteration of Kelly's remarks, the foreign
minister suggested, however, that the Taiwan authorities, including
himself, do their utmost to clarify the misunderstanding between the
two countries on the issue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should pay adequate heed to
issues related to safety at work and should include work safety
measures in the new constitution that President Chen Shui-bian wants
to write in 2006, officials of a group promoting safety at work
appealed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a petition presented to the Presidential Office, the Taiwan
Association for Victims of Occupational Injuries asked President Chen
to display his willingness to do so in his May 20 inaugural speech as
a means of responding to the minimum demands from the country's
grassroots workers, who have over the past century sacrificed their
lives and health for national development and progress.</P>
      <P>Saying that laborers' safety must be guaranteed in the
constitution as a basic national policy to better take care of the
country's workers, they claimed that the government still presents a
cold shoulder to their interests and well-being, despite the fact
that power has been held by different political parties.</P>
      <P>During the past five decades, more than 80,000 grassroots workers
have been killed in the workplace and nearly 400,000 have sustained
crippling injuries or illnesses, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although government power has been transferred from one party to
another, they claimed that workers are just as unfairly treated as
they have been in the past and that no changes or improvements have
been made by the government.</P>
      <P>Pointing to an example to underline their claim, they said that
the ratio of workplace security checks remains extremely low -- below
5 percent -- despite the fact that the Labor Safety and Health Law
was implemented more than 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>This seriously inadequate handling by the government has made the
prevention of occupational injuries for workers "impossible, " they
claimed.</P>
      <P>Stating that Taiwan's grassroots workers have contributed
enormously to the country's economic development by sacrificing their
own interests, they contended that the nation's leaders now should
build a perception that "workers' safety should take precedence over
economic progress."</P>
      <P>As Chen has repeatedly pledged that he is poised to craft a new
constitution by 2006, the officials made clear their feeling that a
new constitution will only be effective if it meets public
expectations and needs. "Political and empty slogans serve nothing in
writing a new and good constitution," they added.</P>
      <P>On the eve of April 28 -- International Day of Mourning for
Workers -- the country's more than 8 million workers and their
families only pray for the humble wish that they can get to work
happily, return home safely and be taken care of by the government,
they said.</P>

      <P>Commuters on Taipei's mass rapid transit
(MRT) lines will from now on be banned from chewing gum or betel nuts
on the trains and in the MRT stations, according to a package of
revisions to the existing MRT law passed by the Legislative Yuan
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the revised law, gum- or betel nut-chewing MRT commuters
can be fined between NT$1,500 and NT$7,500.</P>
      <P>Previously, only those who spat gum or betel nut juice on MRT
carriages or at MRT stations could be fined.</P>
      <P>The newly revised MRT law also stipulates that those who post
handbills or distribute publicity brochures on MRT carriages or in
MRT stations without prior permission will also be fined between
NT$1,500 and NT$7,500.</P>
      <P>According to MRT Co. tallies, the company has issued 11,717
tickets since it began to fine rule-breaking commuters in 1999. The
fine for each case ranged between NT$1,500 and NT$5,000, and the
company has so far collected more than NT$20 million in fines.</P>
      <P>More than 90 percent of the cases involved smoking, eating or

      <P>New York Times: Fierce Battles in Najaf
and Falluja Dim Hopes for Accord.</P>
      <P>A protracted firefight between marines and insurgents in a
Falluja suburb on Monday culminated in American helicopter gunships
and tanks firing at a mosque and toppling its minaret, further
dimming hopes for a peaceful resolution to the three-week-old siege.</P>
      <P>With Iraq's prospects of resuming progress toward a peaceful
transfer of sovereignty on June 30 hanging uneasily in the balance,
developments in Falluja were echoed by new tensions at Najaf, 100

      <P>Boeing Co., which had begun putting the fallout from its ethical

expanded into whether it used a rival company's documents to compete
for NASA contracts, according to government and industry officials
close to the probe.</P>
      <P>Investigators are trying to determine whether a former employee
of Lockheed Martin Corp. hired by Boeing in 2001 gave his new
employer access to documents containing sensitive pricing data.
Government officials are increasingly focusing on whether the
Lockheed Martin documents affected Boeing's pricing decisions
concerning rocket- launch contracts for the National Aeronautics and

    <HEADLINE>BRITAIN CONCERNED ABOUT HONG KONG BEING DENIED  UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, April 26 (CNA)
(By N. K. Han and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>British Foreign Office Minister Bill
Rammell on Monday expressed concern that mainland China had denied
Hong Kong people of their right of universal suffrage to choose
their leader and legislators.</P>
      <P>Rammell was responding to a decision by mainland China's National
People's Congress (NPC) Monday which bars Hong Kong people from
directly choosing their leader in 2007 and all their legislators in
2008.</P>
      <P>The decision is inconsistent with the "high degree of autonomy,"
which Hong Kong is guaranteed under the Joint Declaration which
cleared the way for Britain to hand over the former colony to
mainland China in 1997, Rammell said.</P>
      <P>Rammell said in a statement that he would meet mainland China's
ambassador to Britain soon to express concern over the decision.</P>
      <P>He also said that he was disappointed that "the NPC has set
limits to constitutional development in Hong Kong that are not required
by the Basic Law, especially before the Hong Kong government has
completed its consultation and put forward proposals for development."
The British government continues to hope that early progress can be
made towards the Basic Law's ultimate aims of the election of the
Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council by
universal suffrage, at a pace in line with the wishes of the Hong Kong
people, he added.</P>
      <P>Rammell also said that Britain will continue to follow events
closely. "We believe in the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,
which is of great benefit to both China and the UK," he said.</P>

Tony Blair faced an unprecedented attack on foreign policy in the
Middle East and Iraq yesterday, when dozens of eminent former British
envoys jointly wrote a damning letter to Downing Street.

Already under pressure from growing violence in Iraq, where more
British troops may be deployed, the Prime Minister is accused of
"abandoning" peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians and of
persuing a policy in Iraq "doomed to failure."

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE GROUPS CALL FOR TWO-VOTE LEGISLATIVE ELECTION SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A private legislative reform promotional
group said Tuesday that the current Public Functionaries Election and
Recall Law should be revised to accommodate a two-ballot legislative
election system.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Reform Action Alliance said the proposed
two-ballot system will allow voters to cast two ballots in
legislative elections, with one ballot to elect individual
legislators and the other to vote for a political party.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's current legislative election system, voters can
only cast one ballot to elect individual legislators and each
constituency usually has several regional seats up for grabs.
At-large seats are allotted among major political parties in
proportion to the ratios of ballots they garner in regional seat
elections.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, the alliance's convener, said this mixed system is
candidate-oriented and has many flaws, including a low threshold for
an individual candidate to win a regional seat and at-large seat
candidates not subject to voter scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Although both ruling and opposition parties have come up with
legislative reform bills, they are still pending deliberation.
Moreover, some of the proposed changes, such as halving the number of
legislative seats, require constitutional amendments which involve
complicated procedures, including the election of a "functional
National Assembly" to endorse the Legislative Yuan-approved
amendments.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Ku said the alliance hopes the two-ballot
election system can be implemented first. The election method change
only needs amendments to the election and recall law.</P>
      <P>Ku said the alliance has drafted preferred revisions to the
election and recall law with four ultimate goals -- fair competition
among political parties, strengthening party politics development,
expanding underprivileged groups' political participation, and
eradication of vote-buying, mud-slinging and other negative campaign
tactics.</P>
      <P>"We'll visit legislative caucuses of major political parties in
the coming days to express our opinions and seek their support, " Ku
said, adding that the alliance hopes the proposed two-ballot voting
system can be adopted as early as possible to accelerate the
much-anticipated legislative reforms.</P>
      <P>The alliance groups several reform-oriented associations,
including the Taipei Society and the "pan-purple alliance."</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Coast guard officials announced Tuesday
that they have cracked the largest ring smuggling mainland Chinese
women into Taiwan and have arrested the ring leader and his
accomplices.</P>
      <P>Hualien coast guard officers, in collaboration with police,
conducted six simultaneous raids in Taipei City and Taipei County
Monday night, arresting four ring members, two fishing boat skippers
and 25 mainland Chinese women.</P>
      <P>The six men, including ring leader Tsai Ching-chi, have been
turned over to the Hualien Prosecutors' Office for interrogation,
while the mainland Chinese women have been sent to detention centers
in Ilan County, eastern Taiwan, and Hsinchu County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the coast guard officers, Tsai and his smuggling
ring, nicknamed the "Liangke Snakehead Ring" by police, had sent
scouts to mainland China every month to work with human smuggling
rings there to lure young women into prostitution in Taiwan with the
false promise of normal jobs.</P>
      <P>At least 200 mainland Chinese women have been smuggled by the
"Liangke Snakehead Ring" into Taiwan's sex trade over the past
several years, coast guard officers said.</P>
      <P>Ring members are also known to have performed "trial runs" on the
mainland Chinese women before pushing them into underground brothels,
resulting in most of the men being infected with sexually transmitted
diseases.</P>
      <P>Tsai and his accomplices are facing trial for violating organized
crime laws, the statue governing the relations between people of the
Taiwan area and the mainland area, and the sexual transaction
prevention regulations regarding children and teenagers, as well as
violations regarding decency, the obstruction of freedmen of
movement, the hiding criminals, and document forgery.</P>
      <P>In January of this year, Hualien coast guard officials broke the
largest human smuggling ring in eastern Taiwan, arresting Chang
Yu-chang, leader of the ring nicknamed the "Shuike Snakehead and
Human Brokerage Ring, " as well as eight of his accomplices and 12
mainland Chinese women.</P>
      <P>The police found that Chang used to be one of the three major
brothel operators in northern Taiwan. Because of the rigorous
crackdown by police, Chang had turned to Hualien and Taitung to
continue his illicit trade last year.</P>
      <P>It is also known that the "Liangke Snakehead Ring" has been a
major "importer" and "wholesaler" of mainland Chinese prostitutes and
has regularly supplied mainland Chinese women to local brothel
operators around the island, including the "Shuike Ring."</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "When you meet the proper person to

you meet one who is not a proper person to speak to and you speak to
him, you waste your words. A man of intelligence never loses his
opportunity, neither does he waste his words."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-born golfer Henry Liaw met
former U.S. President Bill Clinton during a recent charity golf match
in Los Angles in which they both competed.</P>
      <P>Clinton was full of praise for the 18-year-old golfer, offering
his best wishes for Liaw in his golf career.</P>
      <P>Matthew S. M. Lee, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in San Francisco, was also invited to the charity golf event
and met with Clinton.</P>
      <P>Clinton told Lee that he still has vivid memories of Taiwan from
his several visits to the island. He said he is impressed with
Taiwan's democratic development and hopes the island will not retreat
in the face of any setbacks amid the global trend of freedom and
democratization.</P>
      <P>Liaw first drew the attention of Clinton when he hit an amazing
12-under-par 58 at Alhambra Municipal Golf Course at the age of 12 in
1998.</P>
      <P>An avid golfer since childhood, Liaw has played at least five
hours a day since the age of nine. Liaw's record includes winning the
2001 United States Junior Amateur Championship as well as four junior
world championships -- in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>Liaw's parents emigrated to the United States when he was very
young. He is now studying at Arizona State University under a full
scholarship. The university is famous for nurturing golf talent and
boasts such famous graduates as Phil Mickelson, champion of the 2004
Masters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UMC HAS NO PLANS TO SET UP 8-INCH WAFER PLANT IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp., one of
Taiwan's leading chipmakers, has no plans to set up eight-inch wafer
plant in mainland China at the moment, a UMC executive said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>UMC's Chief Executive Officer Jackson Hu made the remarks after
it was announced that Taiwan's other leading chipmaker, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC), had passed the government's
second-stage screening for locating an eight-inch wafer plant in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Experts at a recent meeting organized by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs agreed that TSMC has met the government's requirement that
local semiconductor manufacturers who want to invest in eight-inch
chip plants in mainland China must first have their domestically made
12-inch wafers reaching the level of "mass production."</P>
      <P>According to TSMC, the average monthly 12-inch wafer production
of the company has reached more than 10,000 units in six consecutive
months, with the monthly production even reaching 15,000 units
recently. Meanwhile, the yield rate of its 12-inch wafers also
reached more than 85 percent in a period of six consecutive months.</P>
      <P>The experts of the screening panel agreed that TSMC's 12-inch
wafer production has met the requirement of "economic mass
production."</P>
      <P>Economists now are wondering whether UMC, which also has the
monthly production capacity of 12-inch wafers of more than 10,000
units, will follow TSMC's step.</P>
      <P>However, Hu noted that according to government regulations,
domestic chipmakers interested in investing in mainland China are not
allowed to buy new equipment, but can only relocate their original
production facilities in Taiwan to the mainland.</P>
      <P>As UMC's production equipment is in full use now, it has no idle
facilities to relocate to mainland China, Hu added.</P>
      <P>Asked about the increasing threat from mainland China's OEM wafer
manufacturers, Hu stressed that first-class chipmakers should have
very large investments in developing advanced products, improving
yield rates, be dedicated to research and development, as well as
protecting their clients' intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Hu said his company is quite competitive in these areas,
expressing optimism on UMC's edge in the face of mainland Chinese
competition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIB TO SEEK MAINLAND ASSISTANCE IN ANTI-FRAUD CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
under the National Police Administration (NPA) said Wednesday it will
seek mainland Chinese law enforcement authorities' assistance in its
current campaign against fraud.</P>
      <P>Various forms of fraud have recently become rampant in local
society. In response to mounting public complaints, the NPA has
launched an all-out campaign against fraud.</P>
      <P>According to CIB intelligence, fraud rings on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait have colluded to swindle local people.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said masterminds of fraud rings tend to hide
themselves in mainland China's southeastern coastal cities, including
Xiamen, Shenzhen and Zhuhai. They have usually directed their
accomplices in Taiwan to engage in fraudulent operations through
complicated telephone transfers, and their local accomplices then
remit money they have stolen from victims' bank accounts using bogus
ATM cards or credit cards to mainland China via underground
cross-strait channels.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, CIB
Director Hou Yo-yi said there are 30 to 40 fraud rings on each side
of the Taiwan Strait. Each ring has at least 10 members. Based on
these figures, Hou said there are some 1,000 fraudsters targeting
local people.</P>
      <P>Hou said the NPA has been seeking cooperation with mainland
China's public security authorities to crack down on fraud.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hou said judicial authorities should mete out
harsher punishments for fraud. In the past, fraudsters usually
received lenient penalties.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hou said, a new law should be legislated to protect
private information or personal data. The new law should include
harsh penalties for those who illegally leak personal information.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, police arrested 20 people in the southern port city
of Kaohsiung for allegedly selling personal information to fraud
rings. The suspects allegedly had illegally obtained information
on more than 15 million individuals from local mobile phone companies
and financial institutions.</P>

(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is seeking greater international
support this year for its bid to join the World Health Organization,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Following Premier Yu Shyi-kun's instruction to work harder for
Taiwan's WHO bid, Chen said that his ministry has been going through
a number of different possible scenarios to deal with the upcoming
annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the WHO's
decision-making body, to be held May 17-22 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has also instructed its
outposts abroad to urge their respective host countries to support
Taiwan's bid, he added.</P>
      <P>What Taiwan is seeking is not only sympathy or a demonstration of
support, but also a vote from the WHO member nations when it is
necessary, particularly from heavyweight countries, such as the
United States, Japan and the European Union member nations, the
minister noted.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged foreign envoys stationed in Taipei to convey
Taiwan's request for support to their respective governments.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen Chien-jen is scheduled
to lead a mission for Geneva next month to lobby for international
support for Taiwan's bid to become a WHA observer, its eighth attempt
in a row since 1997.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's WHO bid should not be considered as
political issue, but one concerning health, medicine and
humanitarianism, MOFA officials said that Taiwan will appeal to the
international community not to use "health apartheid" against its 23
million people.</P>
      <P>It will be a challenge to both Taiwan and the international
community and a crusade to fight for Taiwan's WHO admission, they
emphasized.</P>

      <P>The recount of votes from the March 20
presidential election will begin on May 10, according to a ruling of
the Taiwan High Court Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A panel of three judges hearing the lawsuit calling for the
annulment of the March 20 election also ruled that the validity of
individual ballots should be judged according to illustrations
provided by the Central Election Committee.</P>
      <P>The judges partially granted the plaintiffs' request to photocopy
the list of voters, but "not all of them."</P>
      <P>The suit was brought by Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, who was
defeated in the election by incumbent President Chen Shui-bian by a
slim margin, and his running mate, People First Party Chairman James
Soong. The two asked the court to annul the election on the grounds
that it was unfair, and that a recount was the only way to determine
whether their request is well grounded.</P>
      <P>Chen's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opposed the plaintiffs'
request to photocopy the lists of all voters, saying it is prohibited
by law, and is an affront to all election workers because it implies
they were dishonest in conducting the election.</P>

      <P>New legislation will be introduced to
protect private information from being used by fraudsters, Minister
of Justice Chen Ding-nan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>One typical scheme in Taiwan is where a person is directed over

unsuspecting victim is given complicated instructions over the phone
at an ATM terminal such that the individual thinks he is setting up a
transfer of funds to his account. In fact, the perpetrator is
actually siphoning as much of the victim's money out of the account
as he can.</P>
      <P>Fraudsters have also been posing as representatives of the
National Health Insurance Bureau.</P>
      <P>Chen told the Legislative Yuan that the Ministry of Justice has
set up a task force to deal with cases such as these.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the ministry will follow the example of other
countries by setting up a special agency to protect personal
information from leaking to people to whom it does not belong who
might use the information to commit crimes.</P>
      <P>Because the perpetrators of these crimes generally already have
obtained personal information on people, the victims are less
suspicious and are more easily taken in, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YOUNG KMT LAWMAKERS PUSH FOR RELOCATION OF PARTY HEADQUARTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of young opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) lawmakers came up with a package of intraparty reform proposals
Wednesday, including relocating the party's headquarters to a more
modest building.</P>
      <P>The reform-minded legislators, including Jow Bo-yuan, Lo
Shih-hsiung, Huang Chien-ting and Kuo Tien-tsai, said the party
should move its head office out of its current magnificent building
near the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei to show its
determination to reinvent itself.</P>
      <P>"Our party headquarters is too heavy and too posh. It is
incompatible with our current status as an opposition party and our
financial situation. We should move out of this elegant building as
early as possible to show our resolve to reform, " Jow said at a
news conference held at the KMT's legislative caucus office.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Jow said, the KMT head office's water and power
bills reach NT$6 million a month. "It has become a heavy financial
burden for our party," he said.</P>
      <P>The young KMT lawmakers also called for streamlining the party
apparatus to save expenditures. They suggested that the party largely
cut the number of staff members at its headquarters from the current
1,700 to 700 or 800 and recruit young volunteers to work for the
party's cause.</P>
      <P>The party should also review its pension system, cancel its
monthly pension system and preferential interest rates for savings
deposits by retired party workers, the young lawmakers said.</P>
      <P>By so doing, Jow said, the party will be able to save NT$200
million in salaries and pension payments each month.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Jow said, the party should do something about its
assets, including its profit-making businesses, as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"We should not let our party assets become the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) 'campaign resources' any more, " Jow
said, referring to the DPP's repeated questioning of the KMT's
allegedly ill-gotten party assets in the run-ups to nearly all major
political elections, including the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Jow also suggested that the party's local chapters be streamlined
and transformed into election apparatus.</P>
      <P>"The staff members at city and county chapters should be trimmed
and the chiefs of local chapters be elected by party members or
nominated by party headquarters to be endorsed by party members in
the specific cities or counties," Jow said.</P>
      <P>Jow said the reform package has been drafted after careful and
comprehensive thought. "We'll present the proposals for discussion at
the party's new reform panel, " he said, adding that the KMT badly
needs sweeping intraparty reform to survive in the rapidly changing
Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the young KMT lawmakers' party reform proposals,
DPP legislative whip Lee Chun-yi said what the KMT has to do first is
to return the party's ill-gotten assets to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>"In view of promoting healthy party politics, we welcome the
KMT's intraparty reform plans. Senior KMT leaders should heed those
appeals. But we think the package proposed by Jow's group is not
enough to gain popular support," Lee said.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding Lee said, Jow's group proposes
to sell off the KMT's assets.</P>
      <P>"This is unacceptable to the general public. The KMT should
listen to the DPP's suggestions and return all its ill-gotten party
assets to the national coffers," Lee said, adding that it's the most
important thing that the KMT should do to improve its image and win
the hearts and minds of ordinary voters.</P>
      <P>The KMT ruled Taiwan for more than five decades until it lost the
2000 presidential election. KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who ended a
distant third in the 2000 election, was defeated again in the 2004
election. However, Lien has so far not conceded defeat and instead
has filed two lawsuits to challenge President Chen Shui-bian's narrow
re-election victory. The Taiwan High Court is scheduled to begin a
vote recount on May 10.</P>

will be sworn in May 20.</P>
      <P>Also decided upon was the new Cabinet spokesman, DPP Legislator
Chen Chi-mai, who has agreed to take over the post to be left vacant
by Lin Chia-lung.</P>
      <P>Chen said Yu asked him earlier in the day whether he is willing
to succeed Lin as Cabinet spokesman, to which he replied: "I accept
the offer without any hesitation."</P>
      <P>A three-term lawmaker, Chen said he will clearly and honestly
explain the government's work agenda, policy goals and stances on
major public issues.</P>
      <P>"I'll be articulate regarding what I can say while remaining
tightlipped on what should be withheld. I'll do my best to avoid
making any faux pas or slips of the tongue," Chen pledged.</P>
      <P>Asked whether his new post will be a boost to his plan to run for
the Kaohsiung mayorship in 2006, Chen said he is not planning to run
for that post and that his new job has nothing to do with the mayoral
election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT BRINGS  SLANDER SUIT AGAINST PRESIDENT, PREDECESOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) followed
the lead of its political partner the People First Party (PFP)
Wednesday in bringing a slander suit against President Chen Shui-bian
and former President Lee Teng-hui for branding their protests last
month as "an attempted coup d'etat."</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Policy
Coordination Committee, told a news conference Wednesday that the
lawsuit will be brought in the name of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and six
other KMT officials.</P>
      <P>Tseng said his party had asked the country's intelligence and law
enforcement officials to clarify the previous day that they had no
information on any alleged coup attempt and did not alert Chen that
the KMT and PFP were trying to engineer a coup when the two parties
called in supporters to protest what they claim was unfairness in the
March 20 presidential election and demanded a vote recount.</P>
      <P>Noting that all the sometimes violent protests between March 20
and March 27 were legally organized, Tseng claimed that Chen was
deliberately defaming the two opposition parties by cooking up the
accusation that they were trying to overthrow the government with a
military coup.</P>
      <P>A lawyer for the party went to the Prosecutor's Office at the
Taipei District Court soon afterward to file the complaint against
Chen.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, who has made similar claims, was
also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.</P>
      <P>The KMT's action was taken two days after the PFP filed a similar
complaint. In that case, the PFP also claimed NT$60 million (US$1.81
million) in damages from Chen and Lee because Chen, as head of state,
is sheltered from any criminal suit but can be held liable for
damages.</P>

Iraq Council by Close of May.

The special United Nations envoy for Iraq, offering a speeded-up
timetable for the selection of a caretaker government in Baghdad,
said Tuesday that the new government should be chosen a full month
before sovereignty is transferred on June 30 to give it time to
define its authority.

Addressing the Security Council, the envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi,
said the month would be necessary for the transitional leaders to
reach "crystal-clear understandings" of their relationship to the
occupation authority they would replace and to the American military
commanders who are to remain in charge of Iraqi security forces.

Wall Street Journal: Regulators Hit Fannie, Freddie With New
Assault.

The U.S. government is seeking to tighten regulation of mortgage
giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, fearing that the two companies
have grown so huge that any missteps could panic financial markets.

Because Fannie and Freddie are congressionally chartered
companies, many investors assume the government would bail them out
in a crisis. Asian central banks and other foreign investors hold
about one-third of their debt and have long considered it nearly as
safe as U.S. Treasury bonds. But the Bush administration is
determined to bury the notion that the U.S. government stands behind
Fannie and Freddie.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>KUOMINTANG MUST GROOM YOUNGER TALENT: TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday
that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should groom younger talent to
ensure the healthy development of the party.</P>
      <P>Ma, who concurrently serves as a KMT vice chairman, made the
remarks on the sidelines of an awards ceremony for model workers.</P>
      <P>Saying that the party has not done enough to cultivate new
blood, Ma, who is 54, noted that "the KMT should nurture more talent
that is 20 years his junior."</P>
      <P>He said he is in favor of speedier reforms but opposed to an
immediate concession of defeat in the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>With the "pan-blue alliance" still contesting the result of the
presidential election, "the time to concede defeat has yet to come, "
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the vote recount has yet to be completed and
that "the truth" about the election-eve shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu has yet to come to light,
adding that many are still working on these two issues and that
nothing can be decided until the work is finished.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) , claiming voting irregularities and that the
election-eve shooting swayed the bitterly contested election in
Chen's favor, has asked for a vote recount and an investigation into
the shooting, which police have so far made little progress on.</P>
      <P>The popular mayor was responding to remarks by a group of
reform-minded young KMT mavericks, including KMT Vice Chairman Wu
Poh-hsiung's son Wu Chih-yang, who has expressed his aspiration to
run in the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The young Turks, who said at a press conference a day earlier
that they are only trying to save a foundering party in disarray, are
all members of short-term school conceived by KMT Chairman Lien Chan
after his defeat in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>They called for the party to face the defeat squarely and engage
in immediate reforms, including the donation of party assets and the
direct election of local party chiefs, as well as embrace more
youngsters in the party.</P>
      <P>Su Chun-pin, an assistant to KMT Legislator Hsyu Jong-shyong,
said that no matter what is the result of the vote recount, "one
undeniable fact is that President Chen Shui-bian, despite his poor
performance over the past four years, took 1.5 million more votes
than he did in the last election."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said the KMT mavericks' call for reform should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, DPP deputy secretary-general, said that his party
respects the views of the KMT young Turks, even though it is not the
DPP's business.</P>
      <P>But since "political party should be of the public domain," it is
a good sign that the younger KMT generation is speaking out for
reforms, Lee added.</P>
      <P>"For the sake of the healthy development of party politics and
mutual competition, society should give them applause and
encouragement," he said.</P>
      <P>The cry for reform and generational change in the KMT is
widespread, but the voice of the young is especially valuable, Lee
said, because they pointed out that the "pan-blue alliance" lost 1.5
million ballots, instead of focusing on the margin of 29,518 votes
between Chen and his rival, Lien.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the leaders of the KMT and PFP to take stock of
themselves and accept responsibility for the election performance.</P>

      <P>The outlying island of Kinmen activated an
alert mechanism against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
Wednesday after a would-be airline passenger was discovered to be
running a fever.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen health and police authorities activated anti-SARS
measures Wednesday after the female passenger was found to have
developed a fever of 38 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>The island's SARS alert mechanism started with immediate effect
and will be continued, although the passenger was later discovered to
be SARS-free but suffering from a common cold, said Lin Ren-hsin,
president of the Kinmen County Hospital.</P>
      <P>Unexpectedly, the woman also became the target of a police
investigation as she was suspected of being an illegal stowaway from

    <HEADLINE>CDC TO OFFER SARS ALERT ADVICE FOR PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under
the Department of Health will continue to watch closely for any
resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan and
will offer SARS alert advice for the presidential inauguration slated
for May 20, CDC Director-General Su Ih-jen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su said the CDC will continue to monitor the SARS situation but
will not offer SARS alert advice to the government until May 10 with
regard to the presidential inauguration.</P>
      <P>The CDC will recommend which level the country should be on in
terms of its anti-SARS efforts after May 10, Su added.</P>
      <P>He called for the public to refrain from taking part in mass
public gatherings such as the presidential inauguration ceremony if
they have traveled to mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau over the
past two weeks or they have developed fever.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has a four-level SARS alert system
-- Zero, A, B, and C -- with level C being the highest level of
alert.</P>
      <P>The DOH upgraded Taiwan's epidemic prevention mobilization level
against SARS from level zero to level A from last Saturday after
Beijing confirmed two SARS cases a day earlier on the mainland, in
addition to two already reported suspected cases and one possible
fatality from the disease.</P>
      <P>Under the level A alert mechanism, all inbound and outbound
passengers are required to have their temperatures taken and to fill
out SARS questionnaires. All passengers arriving from the mainland,
Hong Kong and Macau have to exercise self-health management,
including regular hand-washing and temperature-taking, while all
government agencies and institutions are advised to conduct
temperature-taking.</P>
      <P>A researcher at a private Taiwan biotechnology company has caused
jitters over the past few days, particularly among the health-care
community, after he visited Beijing and developed a fever upon
returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After three rounds of lab examination of his throat swabs, the
researcher was confirmed Tuesday as not being infected with SARS.</P>
      <P>While in Beijing from April 19-24, the researcher visited a lab
where one of the latest SARS cases had been reported. His case drew
much attention from Taiwan's health authorities as it occurred at a
time when the potentially fatal flu-like disease has been showing
signs of resurgence on the mainland, particularly in Beijing.</P>
      <P>It was the second case in Taiwan of an individual being monitored
for possible SARS infection since the outbreaks of the atypical
pneumonia on the mainland subsided last summer. In December, a
researcher with the military Institute of Preventive Medicine
Research inadvertently infected himself while working with the SARS
viruses at his lab. He was cured later.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was hit hard by SARS between March and June last year,
resulting in 37 deaths and heavy economic losses.</P>

      <P>Su, who was one of the core five-member campaign team for

to new heights in his political career after Chen won a narrow
victory against his rival, Lien Chan of the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>On his visit to South Korea, Su said that in addition to

University, he also visited the Masan Free Trade Zone, a trip which
he described as worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Su also described a recent trip to Japan at the head of a

County as a"communication trip."</P>
      <P>Su said that while overseas trips might be a time of relaxation
for some, for him such trips are work focusing on communicating with
grassroots chiefs.</P>

chiefs during the trip and learned about the problems they face.

      <P>Council for Hakka Affairs (CHA) Chairwoman
Yeh Chu-lan has agreed to serve as vice premier in the new Cabinet to
be sworn in after President Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inauguration for
a second four-year term, Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, who will continue to head
the new Cabinet, first invited Yeh to succeed Lin Hsin-i as vice
premier in mid-April. "After extensive talks with Yu April 18, Yeh
accepted the offer," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks came after Yeh met with Yu and Lin Hsin-i earlier in
the day. Lin Hsin-i, an entrepreneur-turned-politician, insists on
leaving public service after President Chen's re-election.</P>
      <P>Lin quoted Yeh as having assured Yu that she will do her utmost
to fulfill her duty under Yu's leadership.</P>
      <P>Yeh had served as a legislator and minister of transportation and
communications before assuming her current post. The post to be left
vacant by Yeh will be filled by Legislator Lo Wen-chia of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said, DPP Legislator Chen Chi-mai has agreed to
serve as spokesman for the new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear what Lin's new job will be after Chen
Chi-mai takes over his post. One previous press report said Lin is
likely to serve as chairman of the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC), as incumbent RDEC Chairman Lin

    <DATELINE>Nantou,   April  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made an
inspection tour of an aboriginal village in central Taiwan Wednesday
to check out post-disaster reconstruction in one of the areas that
had been virtually reduced to rubble in the deadly earthquake of
Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Nantou County Magistrate Lin Tsung-nan and Kuo
Yao-chi, CEO of the Cabinet-level 921 Earthquake Post-Disaster
Recovery Commission, President Chen traveled to Hsinhsiang village in
the rural township of Hsinyi in Nantou County.</P>
      <P>President Chen was briefed by local officials about the progress
of a community development project that began in Hsinhsiang village
at the end of 1999. The village currently has about 160 households
with 800 residents. More than 90 percent of the residents are
aboriginal citizens.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although many aboriginal villages have been
recovering from the destruction caused by the 921 earthquake, the 921
Earthquake Post-Disaster Recovering Commission has still allocated
another NT$240 million this year to finance reconstruction and
development in aboriginal communities.</P>
      <P>Under the government's assistance, Chen said, Nantou County's
Hsinhsiang village, Hsinchu County's Chienshih rural township and
Kaohsiung County's Sanmin rural township have become model aboriginal
communities through integrated development programs that have been
carried out over the past four years.</P>
      <P>The integrated development programs include reconstruction and
development of infrastructure, as well as cultural and humanistic
development, Chen said.</P>
      <P>After listening to the briefing, Chen was entertained by a group
of elementary school students who performed traditional Bunun Tribe
dancing and singing.</P>
      <P>Following the Hsinhsiang village inspection tour, Chen and the
accompanying officials proceeded to Hsinglung village in Shuili rural
township in Nantou County to inspect the progress of a river
streamlining project along the Chung-keng-yeh-chi River.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA WELCOMES RESOLUTION PASSED BY NORDIC CONFAB ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Tuesday expressed appreciation and welcome to the resolution passed
by the Nordic Conference on Taiwan in Denmark in support of Taiwan's
bid for observer status in the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>The ministry also said that it will continue working to drum up
more support from the international community for the rights and
interests that Taiwan deserves to have as a normal country.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, the conference was held Tuesday at the
Danish Parliament in Copenhagen with the participation of more than
150 dignitaries from five Nordic countries -- namely Denmark,
Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that at the invitation of the conference,
President Chen delivered a speech via video link and responded to
questions raised by conference participants regarding the island's
important policies and administrative work.</P>
      <P>The conference was presided over by Jens Hald Madsen, chairman of
the Foreign Policy Committee of the Danish Parliament, and included
speeches by several dignitaries, including Klaus C. Pedersen,
secretary-general of the Danish Academic Association of Foreign
Policy; Jesper Poulsen, representative of the Nordic Medical
Association; Kerstin Engle, member of the Swedish Parliament; Linda
C. Hofstad, member of the Norwegian Parliament; Ole Andreansen,
member of the European Parliament; and Peng Ming-min, senior advisor
to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>During the conference, Madsen announced the official inauguration
of a "Taiwan Friendship Group" in the Danish Parliament to establish
a solid foundation between the two countries' parliaments, the
ministry said.</P>
      <P>Praising Taiwan's further democratic progress through the holding
of its third direct presidential election, the resolution said the
conference wants to see the international community's unjust
treatment toward Taiwan redressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan continues to be excluded from various
international organizations, including the WHO, the resolution said
that considering the interests of world health, the representatives
from the Nordic countries would take the same position as the United
States, Japan, the European Parliament and the World Health
Professions Alliance of supporting Taiwan's WHO bid.</P>
      <P>In the interests of world peace, the resolution also echoed the
stance of the European Parliament by calling for mainland China to
abandon the option of the use of force to resolve the Taiwan question
and to reduce or dismantle its missiles aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It also said Taiwan has the right to participate in the
international community, urging the governments and legislative
bodies of the Nordic countries to adopt concrete measures to extend
their political, economic, scientific and cultural relations with
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FO GUANG SHAN INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CARE CENTER IN MALAWI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Lilongwe, Malawi, April 27 (CNA)
(By Yang Hui-chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Fo Guang Shan (Buddha's
Light Mountain) International Organization is building a care center
which includes an orphanage in the southeastern African country of
Malawi.</P>
      <P>The Amito-Fo Care Center, being established by the Nan Hua Temple
in South Africa -- the headquarters of Fo Guang Shan in Africa and
the largest Buddhist temple in the southern hemisphere -- is
envisaged to also include a health care center exclusively for AIDS
patients, said Lin Rui-hsiang, a Fo Guang Shan volunteer worker.</P>
      <P>The first-stage development of the orphanage, located in Malawi's
capital city of Lilongwe, is scheduled to be completed in November of
this year at a cost of US$1.4 million. At that time, the institution
will be able to take in some 120 orphans aged below 10, Lin said. All
the funds used to build the orphanage are donations from Fo Guang
Shan followers from Taiwan and around the world, he added.</P>
      <P>The Nan Hua Temple -- founded by Ven. Hui Li in 1994 -- is aiming
not only to provide accommodations and education to the orphans, but
also to teach them about Buddhism to enable them to lead tranquil,
unselfish and productive lives, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the Amito-Fo Care Center has also been
preparing to build a health center, exclusively for the treatment of
AIDS patients and for HIV prevention.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Ambassador to Malawi H.T. Chen said that it is
a pity the ROC embassy could not render financial assistance toward
Nan Hua Temple's efforts in Malawi because of budget limitations.
Chen called for the private business sector and social organizations
in Taiwan to give concrete support to the Buddhist organization to
help facilitate its missions.</P>
      <P>The Nation, the largest circulation daily newspaper in Malawi,
ran a full-page report Tuesday on the Amito-Fo Care Center and its
operations under the headline: "With Kindness from Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Nan Hua Temple in South Africa, which already has branch
temples in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and New Castle, has also
been running the African Buddhist Seminary, which began recruiting
students in 1994. Currently, the seminary has several hundred student
monks from Brazil, Israel, Congo, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, New
Zealand, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>According to Ven. Hui Li, the goals of the Nan Hua Temple in
South Africa are teaching the Buddhist Dharma to help people leave
suffering behind and gain joy; educating locals to become monks so as
to plant the seeds of Buddhism; translating the Chinese-language
Buddhist scriptures into the local languages; and constructing
temples.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS COMPETITIVE IN TELE-HOME CARE MARKET: ITRI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the popularity of medical care
institutions and advanced information technology, Taiwan is quite
competitive in the tele-home care market, a section chief of the
Industrial Technology Research Institute said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ming, a laboratory director of ITRI who presides over the
tele-care project, noted that with the aging society and increasing
segment of the population crippled by chronic disease, the ITRI saw
the potential in the tele-home care market and began the research
project two years ago with the sponsorship of the government, which
considers it a promising industry for the future.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the domestic annual tele-home care market is estimated
to be worth NT$21.9 billion (US$633 million) , with some 5 million
patients needing the service, which links patients with hospitals via
telecommunication technology in order to transfer medical data for
diagnosis, therapy and care, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>The popularity of these medical care institutions, as well as the
sound national health insurance and highly developed information
technology industry, will help lower the cost of tele-home care and
thus lead to increased client numbers, Hsu predicted.</P>
      <P>In addition to integrating several laboratories within the ITRI
and telecommunications enterprises around the island, the institute
will also cooperate with well-known medical education hospitals to
develop best tele-health monitoring systems, Hsu said, adding that
Taiwan might become a world model in this area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT WINS LAWSUIT AGAINST WEEKLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu won a lawsuit
against the Journalist weekly Thursday after the Supreme Court threw
out an appeal by the magazine for a reversal of a lower court ruling
in Lu's favor.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Journalist will have to follow a judgment of the
Taiwan High Court by publishing the court ruling against it in
advertisements in newspapers, as well as apologizing to Lu.</P>
      <P>Judge Lee Chin-feng, who is the spokesman for the Supreme Court,
told a news conference that the Journalist failed to check its facts
when it published a story in 2000 claiming that Lu was circulating a
rumor that President Chen Shui-bian was having an affair with one of
his young aides.</P>
      <P>Lee said his court was charged with reviewing the rules applied
by the lower court in handing down its judgment, rather than
examining the case on its merits.</P>
      <P>Instead of questioning the facts determined by the Taiwan High
Court, Lee said the Supreme Court concerned itself with whether the
lower court's ruling violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by
an interpretation of the Constitution made by the Council of the
Grand Justices.</P>
      <P>Since the interpretation was aimed at defining the criteria for
the crimes of libel and slander, Lee said, it would not work for the
current case in which the vice president asked for a "restoration of
her reputation" damaged by the Journalist's story rather than
criminal punishment against the weekly.</P>
      <P>Lee said the panel of five judges hearing the case fully agreed
with the Council of Grand Justices' opinion that it would
unnecessarily limit the freedom of the press and jeopardize the mass
media's role as a monitor of society if they were required to report
only "accurate" stories, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>However, the court found, based on the Taiwan High Court's
investigation, that the appellants in the case failed to reasonably
verify the truth of its story and should be held responsible for
damaging Lu's reputation.</P>
      <P>The Journalist attributed its sources to its editor-in-chief Lee
Ming-chun, who goes by the pen name of Yang Chao, claiming that Yang
was told by Lu on the phone about the alleged affair at the
Presidential Office. However, neither the Journalist nor Lee were
able to prove their claim during the trial and the telephone
company's records did not show any such call as having been made by
Lu.</P>
      <P>After learning of the Supreme Court's decision, Journalist
President Wang Chien-chung complained that the ruling "went against
the Constitution" and dealt a heavy blow to the freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will ask the Council of Grand Justices to look into
the legality of the judgment while asking for a retrial of the case.</P>
      <P>Lu, who brought the lawsuit against the weekly as well as its
president, editor-in-chief, and writers of the story, called on the
public to push the Journalist and the other defendants to comply with
the judgment.</P>
      <P>In a statement issue by her office, the vice president said the
Journalist not only damaged her reputation but also cheated the
public with groundless accusations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the trial has lasted for four years, Lu said the
Journalist has squandered too many social resources through its lies.</P>

Prime Minister Tony Blair has attempted to stamp on speculation

Times: Ofcom squares up to BT.

Ofcom signalled a new more aggressive stance against BT Group on

costs it charges its rivals to access its local exchanges to offer
high speed "broadband" internet access.

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Su Jia Chyuan
vowed Thursday to set up an inter-ministerial firewall in an attempt
to prevent leaks of private individual data that can be used by
fraudsters for scams via telephone or the Internet.</P>
      <P>Su made the pledge during an inspection visit to the Kaohsiung
Municipal Police Department, where more than 15 million items of
personal and corporation data nabbed by Kaohsiung police in recent
days from a fraud ring were on display, including those of some
government officials and public opinion leaders, including Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of an initial Kaohsiung police investigation,
Su said that banks, cellphone companies, hospitals and clinics as
well as even state-run organizations and schools are allegedly
involved in the rampant scams illegally orchestrated by fraudsters,
many of who are based in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Su gave high praise for the clampdown efforts thus far by the
Kaohsiung police and stressed that the government will never back off
from the sweep against fraud rings that have made off with billions
of dollars by staging scams or threats via the Internet or
telephones.</P>
      <P>According to the interior minister, his ministry will take the
initiative to build an across-the-board firewall against information
leaks of private individuals or companies by collaborating with
relevant government agencies, such as the Ministry of Transport and
Communications and the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>Su said he strongly believes that the planned protection network
will be effectively stem personal data leaks from a wide range of
sources and he called for increased public awareness of fraud rings,
which he said is the most important countermeasure that can be taken.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, various lawmakers of the opposition People First Party

    <HEADLINE>SEF CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
resume constructive dialogue and use new thinking to create a new
environment for cross-strait interaction, Taiwan's top negotiator
with mainland China said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu made the
appeal in a written statement commemorating the 11th anniversary of a
historic meeting in Singapore in 1993 between he and his mainland
Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang signed four agreements on behalf of their respective
governments during their historic April 27-29, 1993 meeting to lay a
framework for institutionalized cross-strait consultations and
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Koo admitted in his commemorative statement that cross-strait
relations have not proceeded as smoothly as originally expected over
the past decade. The institutionalized SEF-ARATS communication and
consultation channel has repeatedly been disturbed and disrupted, he
lamented.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Koo said, cross-strait exchanges in various
non-political fields have continued to grow, but he said that many
problems have also arisen from these increased commercial, cultural
and civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Koo said that although the two sides differ on their political
stances, such differences should not hinder bilateral dialogue. In
his view, he said, the existence of political disputes signifies the
necessity of bilateral dialogue to forge mutual trust and seek common
ground to serve as foundations for resolving practical issues and
disputes.</P>
      <P>"I hope both sides can put aside their political disputes and
show goodwill and generosity, just as they did in 1992, so that
cross-strait dialogue can resume for the sake of the welfare of the
people on both sides of the strait, " Koo said, referring to the
so-called "1992 consensus" that paved the way for the 1993 Koo-Wang
meeting -- the first high-level cross-strait talks in decades.</P>
      <P>Beijing has unilaterally closed regular SEF-ARATS dialogue since
July 1999, when then-President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties
as "a special state-to-state relationship, " which Beijing saw as a
step to promote formal Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies set up
to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOFT LANDING FOR MAINLAND CHINA ECONOMY GOOD FOR TAIWAN: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A soft landing for the mainland Chinese
economy would be beneficial for the rest of the world, including
Taiwan, which relies heavily on mainland China for its exports, a
government official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, vice chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said that it would be good
for the entire world if the mainland adequately handles its
overheating economy. Taiwan's trade dependence on the mainland market
has surged to more than 30 percent and it has replaced the United
States as the country's leading export market.</P>
      <P>Should the mainland authorities succeed in cooling off an
investment boom that is creating price hikes and straining a fragile
financial system already troubled by bad debts, it is expected to
have a positive impact on the international economy in the long term,
despite short-term negative effects, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, she urged the public not to overreact
to temporary falls in the domestic stock market. As long as the
mainland has a soft landing, the present woes will soon be over, she
predicted.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the domestic bourse's key barometer, plunged
by 172.54 points to close at 6,402.21 points earlier in the day
following reports that the mainland is to make moves to curb its
overheating economy and that shares on Wall Street dropped noticeably
the previous night.</P>
      <P>Touching on widespread speculation that the renminbi -- the
mainland currency -- will appreciate in the near future, a financial
management consultant called on mainland-based Taiwan businesses to
pay heed to the mainland's economic and monetary policy adjustments
and take swift precautions.</P>
      <P>In addition to holding assets in strong currencies, Taiwan
companies with operations on the mainland still need to draw up
long-term market deployment strategies in response to a highly
volatile business environment on the mainland, the consultant
suggested.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs claimed that mainland China's planned
economic cooling will only have a limited impact on the Taiwan's
economy on the ground that hi-tech parts and components form the bulk
of Taiwan's exports bound for the mainland, while the mainland will
focus on traditional businesses such as steel, cement and real estate
companies to help stem its economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC PLANNER URGES REVISION OF FREE TRADE HARBOR ZONE REGULATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A top economic planner on Thursday urged
the speedy revision of the regulations governing the management of
the planned free trade harbor zone, saying that it will help upgrade
its competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, made the remarks after giving a speech on Taiwan's
planned free trade harbor zone over a luncheon hosted by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei and the European Chamber of Commerce
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ho said that not only Taiwan, but Hong Kong, Singapore and
mainland China are also working toward the goal of becoming the
logistic center of the Asian-Pacific region by setting up free trade
harbor zones to attract manufacturers with various tax incentives.</P>
      <P>But compared with free trade harbor zones in other countries,
Taiwan's would allow goods to come in for processing and retransport,
which will be attractive to foreign manufacturers because it would
save a lot of transportation costs and add value to the goods.</P>
      <P>Ho said that after Taiwan proposed its creative ideas in setting
up the free trade harbor zone, mainland China has responded speedily
by saying that it will follow the same model in its future free trade
harbor zones, posing a potential threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan cannot set up a free trade harbor zone soon, it will
lose its competitive edge," Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ho noted that the current regulations governing the establishment
of a free trade harbor zone demand that the zone hire out of its
total workforce 5 percent aboriginal workers, which she said was a
defect.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the legislature can revise related
regulations before the end of this session in May, so that after the
regulations provide the legal basis, the Keelung Free Trade Harbor
can open in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CALLS FOR SOLUTION TO MARCH 19 SHOOTING BEFORE MAY 20</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged police and prosecution
authorities Thursday to resolve the case of the March 19 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu before May 20.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the DPP legislative caucus has
formally set a timeframe for law enforcement authorities to solve the
mysterious shooting on the eve of the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Tsai Huang-lang said the shooting, which
slightly wounded Chen and Lu, has overshadowed the joy of the Chen-Lu
ticket's re-election victory.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that the shooting can be resolved before May
20 when Chen and Lu will be sworn-in for a second four-year term,"
Tsai said, adding that if this goal can be reached, it will be very
meaningful for Chen and the DPP.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) has declined to concede defeat
in the March 20 election on the ground that the election-eve shooting
unfairly swayed sympathy votes in Chen's favor. Chen won the election
by a slim margin of 29,518 votes out of 13 million ballots cast.</P>
      <P>In addition to organizing massive and sometimes violent street
protests in the wake of the election, the alliance's presidential
candidate, KMT Chairman Lien Chan, has filed two lawsuits to demand a
vote recount and even nullification of the entire election so that a
new one can be held. The Taiwan High Court is scheduled to begin the
recount May 10.</P>
      <P>The alliance is also pushing for the establishment of an
independent committee to investigate the shooting even though law
enforcement authorities have set up a special task force to probe the
case, with State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa as its convener.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou suggested
Thursday that Jodi Shelton, chief executive officer of Fabless
Semiconductor Association (FSA) , urge the ROC government to
accelerate the opening of cross-Taiwan Strait direct transport links.</P>
      <P>The FSA set up its Asia-Pacific headquarters at Taipei's Nankang

      <P>However, Taiwan entrepreneurs have encountered a major investment
barrier -- a vague relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait and the government's restriction on local enterprises'
investments in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that he had suggested to the government many times

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly half of Taiwan's business
executives are upbeat about Taiwan's post-election situation, while
more than half of them believe that ethnicity confrontations are
serious and call for adequate government handling of the issue, the
results of a poll show.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey carried out by an executive
research Web site under the commission of opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
lawmaker Wang Yu-ting, 47 percent of business executives polled have
confidence in Taiwan's political situation after the March 20
presidential election, ahead of 37 percent who expressed pessimism.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 44 percent are optimistic about Taiwan's
economic outlook, citing reasons such as an influx of foreign capital
and a rebounding world economy, while 28 percent said that they feel
upset because of the lack of direct three links across the Taiwan
Strait, an inefficient government and ethnic rifts, according to the
poll.</P>
      <P>Ethnic harmony, the opening of full trade, transport and postal
links between Taiwan and mainland China and government reforms are
the top three tasks that the respondents to the survey think that the
government should first grapple with after the election, the poll
finds.</P>
      <P>Some 34 percent of the business executives surveyed regard
Taiwan's ethnic confrontation as "serious, " slightly ahead of 31
percent who think is "very serious." Only 21 percent and 10 percent
believe that the situation is "OK, " and "not seriously at all, "
respectively.</P>
      <P>By and large, 34 percent of them see Taiwan society as lacking
mutual trust as a result of the rift over different political
stances, while 37 percent admit that they are considering moving out
of Taiwan. The United States, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand
are their top three options, while Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou
are listed as the leading destinations in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Some 41 percent said that they have no plans to settle in other
countries, while 21 percent said that they will take a wait-and-see

sovereign state, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while delivering a report on the nation's
diplomatic work at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign
Affairs Committee. It marked the first time that Chen has spoken at
the legislature since he assumed his current post 13 days ago.</P>
      <P>Noting that diplomatic work involves delicate and complicated
operations, Chen said he doesn't have a definite timeframe for his
work. Nevertheless, he said, pragmatism, flexibility and innovation
will be his top working guidelines.</P>
      <P>As the so-called "one China" policy prevalent in the
international community has substantially diminished Taiwan's
international presence, Chen said the foreign ministry must pool all
available wisdom and resources to cement relations with the ROC's
diplomatic allies while seeking to make friends with as many other
countries as possible.</P>
      <P>In addition to fulfilling its duty as a trustworthy friend in the
world community, Chen said Taiwan must also use innovative thinking
to get through the bottlenecks created by Beijing's diplomatic
embargo to expand its diplomatic frontiers.</P>
      <P>Touching on the ministry's work agenda, Chen said that in the
short term, the most important is to promote Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Organization (WHO) . Besides seeking the support of the
ROC's diplomatic tallies, Chen said his ministry has also stepped up
lobbying other major countries, including the United States, Japan
and European countries, to help with Taiwan's WHO bid.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, some lawmakers asked Chen about his view on
recent statements made by David Keegan, deputy director of the Taipei
Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , that the United
States is against changing the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and
that Taiwan should heed mainland China's threats.</P>
      <P>Addressing a foreign ministry-sponsored seminar earlier this week
on the 25th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act and the prospects
of U.S.-Taiwan relations, Keegan said that while President Chen
Shui-bian's plan for writing a new constitution for Taiwan is not yet
clear, the United States will speak bluntly of its opposition to
unilateral changes to the status quo.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen said Keegan's speech was largely a reiteration of
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly's testimony to the
House International Relations Committee last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In his view, Tan Sun Chen said, Keegan's remarks manifest U.S.
concerns about the Taiwan Strait situation. "Keegan's statements can
serve as a reminder to us and let our people gain a better
understanding of the current state of Taiwan-U.S. relations, " he
noted.</P>
      <P>Stressing that U.S. concerns about Taiwan's new constitution plan
largely results from its lack of understanding of the details, Tan
Sun Chen said the foreign ministry has compiled all the president's
relevant statements and sent them to the ROC's overseas offices.</P>
      <P>"Our diplomatic staff have been directed to expound on our new
constitution plan to authorities of their resident countries in terms
of the president's remarks, " Tan Sun Chen told lawmakers, adding
that the foreign ministry will join forces with the Government
Information Office in preparing a new constitution position paper to
facilitate international publicity on the ROC government's stance on
this critical topic.</P>
      <P>The minister also confirmed that President Chen intends to
appoint Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman to serve as the ROC's new
representative to the United States. Incumbent representative, Chen
Chien-jen, has tendered his resignation.</P>
      <P>Asked whether reports about the possibility that a bomb concealed
in a remote-controlled toy airplane operated by a terrorist might
explode over President Chen and the crowd on the day of his
inauguration for a second four-year term on May 20 will affect
foreign dignitaries' attendance at the inauguration ceremony, Tan Sun
Chen said the foreign ministry has so far not received information
that any foreign guest would cancel their trip to Taiwan to attend
the ceremony because of misgivings about terror threats.</P>
      <P>Chen said the foreign ministry will gear up preparations to
ensure that foreign dignitaries receive hospitable treatment and
attentive security protection during their visits to attend the
presidential inauguration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FLU VACCINATION PROGRAM BEARS FRUIT: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The outbreaks of influenza this year have
been 80 percent less serious than those of the previous two years,
showing the vaccination program implemented late last year has
borne fruit, a Department of Health (DOTH) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su Ih-jen, director of the DOH's Center for Disease Control, said
it is estimated the vaccination program will save NT$20 billion
(US$606.06 million) in health insurance costs over the course of this
year, which he said is well worth the NT$126 million spent on the
program.</P>
      <P>According to an assessment report Su delivered at the Legislative
Yuan's Health, Environment and Social Welfare Committee
meeting, as of March 12 of this year, the DOH has targeted medical
institution staff, disease prevention workers, citizens over the age
of 65, and residents of old age homes with the vaccination program.</P>
      <P>The report showed that 271,521 of medical staff and disease
prevention workers, or 92.1 percent of the total of 294,864 in
Taiwan, have received flu shots. Meanwhile, 1.42 million of Taiwan's
senior citizens, or 69 percent of the total, and 72,996 of the 80,101
old age home residents have received shots. In addition, nearly
25,000 of those directly or indirectly employed in the poultry
industry have been vaccinated.</P>
      <P>Su gave the influenza vaccination program report at the committee
meeting to highlight its effectiveness in order to secure the budget
for the program for the next fiscal year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIES WITH CHINA TO BE TOUGH IN NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS: DPP OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's ties with mainland China
will be "relatively tough" in the next couple of years, and the
public should not raise their expectation too high about an
improvement in this field, an official of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, director of the Department for Chinese Affairs
under the DPP, said Beijing did not anticipate that President Chen
Shui-bian would win a second term, nor did they expect that the DPP
would rule the island for a considerable period of time.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Beijing is still waiting for Chen's victory to sink in
before responding to the new situation in Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>When President Chen won the presidency in 2000 with 39 percent of
the votes, Chen Chung-hsin said Beijing didn't believe the new
president would be able to secure a second term and were astounded
that he was able to win in 2004 with a majority.</P>
      <P>Beijing is in no hurry to respond to President Chen's victory,
probably because the referendum initiated by the president failed to
be validated, and his election victory was questioned by the
opposition, Chen Chung-hsin said.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Beijing frowned on Taipei's proposal for a
referendum on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, Chen Chung-hsin said
bilateral ties would be tough before 2006, the year President Chen
vowed to put a new constitution for the island to a referendum.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he played down the possibility that ties between
Taipei and Beijing could improve significantly in the next two years.</P>
      <P>Beijing has tried to disarm Western powers by portraying itself
as a peace-maintaining force in the region, but it never denounces
the use of force against Taiwan; therefore, the United States has
warned that neither Taiwan nor the mainland should alter the status
quo unilaterally.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainlanders naturalized in Taiwan should
be restricted from taking part in civil service examinations for a
certain period as stipulated by related laws, according to a proposal
presented Friday by a commission under the Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Civil Service Protection and Training Commission
said after a meeting for the revision of related laws that according
to the existing Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, mainlanders who are
naturalized in Taiwan can serve as teaching personnel in
universities, researchers with academic institutions and
professionals of social and educational organizations according to
related laws without being subject to the limitation of 10 years of
naturalization.</P>
      <P>However, the same bill stipulates that mainlanders who have not
been naturalized in Taiwan for 10 years cannot run for public office,
cannot serve as officials of government agencies, state-run
enterprises and political parties unless otherwise exceptional
stipulations by law are present.</P>
      <P>It also stipulates that mainlanders who have not been naturalized
for more than 20 years cannot serve as agents of intelligence
institutions, military men and civilian employees and teachers of
institutions under the Ministry of National Defense.</P>
      <P>The commission suggested that the Mainland Affairs Council under
the Executive Yuan revise related regulations stipulated in the
statute to make clear the situation.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan is responsible for Taiwan's civil service
system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The launch of the Taiwan satellite
ROCSAT-2 from the Vandenberg air force base in California has been
postponed until late May, an official of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Los Angeles said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made in order to secure a successful launch out
of concern over weather and personnel conditions, the official said.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-2 was slated to lift off April 10 (Taipei time) , local
weather conditions permitting. The satellite's launch has been
delayed several times since it was transported from Taiwan to the
United States in early December last year.</P>
      <P>The launch of the satellite, a cooperative venture between the
Republic of China's National Space Program Office and the Natural
Disaster Study Center under National Chengkung University, is aimed
at capturing high-resolution real-time images for application in the
prevention of natural catastrophes and environmental hazards.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-2 is designed for practical application purposes as part
of the ROC government's 15-year space technology development plan
implemented in 1991, which focuses on three satellites with different

      <P>ROCSAT-1 was launched in 1999 and ROCSAT-3 is scheduled to lift

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN RESIDENT CONFIRMED NOT TO HAVE SARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kinmen resident suspected of contracting
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during a recent trip to
mainland China was confirmed Friday not to have the atypical
pneumonia.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, head of the Cabinet-level Department of Health,
made the announcement after a second test by the DOH's Center for
Disease Control of the 79-year-old man's throat swab showed a
negative result -- an indication that the man was not infected with
the potentially deadly virus, which broke out for the first time in
the first half of last year in many parts of the world.</P>
      <P>A local hospital on the outlying Kinmen Island carried out the
first test on Thursday, which showed that the man did not have the
disease as had been suspected.</P>
      <P>The senior, surnamed Tsai, developed a fever and a partially
inflamed lung -- initial and key symptoms for the pneumonia-like SARS
-- over the last weekend after returning home from Xiamen on a group
tour through the "mini three links" framework.</P>
      <P>The suspected case came after Beijing and Anhui province reported
SARS cases earlier the same week. Tsai had visited Beijing, Shanghai
and Suzhou during his mainland trip.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 60 other members of the tour group were all
located and none of them has SARS.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DOH has heightened the country's SARS response
alert level to Level A from the previous Level Zero, while all
inbound passengers via the "mini three links" are required to fill
out a special quarantine questionnaire starting from Friday.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refers to direct transport and trade ties
maintained between Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and the
Fujian ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou in view of the lack of such direct
services between Taiwan proper and mainland China.</P>

and have high morale, so there is no question of a coup, Minister of
National Defense Tang Yiau-min was quoted as saying Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chin Hui-chu, who called on the minister along with
several other People First Party (PFP) lawmakers said afterward that
Tang said the armed forces have come a long way in remaining neutral
in politics since Tang took office; therefore, it is out of the
question that the armed forces could stage a coup.</P>
      <P>The PFP, which was accused by President Chen Shui-bian of
attempting a military coup d'etat along with its political partner
the Kuomintang after the March 20 presidential election, has sought
to clear the party of the charge with officials' statements that
there was no hint of a coup.</P>
      <P>Chin said the minister also assured the PFP lawmakers that the
number of military personnel ordered to remain in their barracks on
March 20 has been sealed to prevent meddling. The Control Yuan and
law enforcement authorities may look into the matter to settle the
controversy over whether extra troops were kept in their barracks
during election day, as the opposition has claimed, to the detriment
of the opposition presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>As to planned arms purchases from the United States, the minister
was quoted as saying that his ministry is negotiating with the
Pentagon over the details of the deal; however, the special budget
for the purchase will have to be prepared by his successor as Tang is
set to retire by May 20 when President Chen is inaugurated for his
second term.</P>
      <P>Tang has been plagued by eye illness and has not been seen in
public since March 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME NOT RIPE FOR DIRECT LINKS WITH MAINLAND: FORMER PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said Friday
that before local agricultural and fishery industries are
competitive, it is not appropriate to talk about direct trade, postal
and transportation links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when he was speaking at the inauguration of
an alliance comprising Taiwan agricultural industry officials and
scholars at National Chunghsing University in Taichung, central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee, in addressing the inauguration ceremony, spoke of the
importance of Taiwan's agricultural industry to Taiwan's economic
development.</P>
      <P>He said that if one loves Taiwan, one must start with Taiwan's
agriculture, saying that without the efforts of Taiwan's agricultural
industry, Taiwan's economic development today would not be possible.</P>
      <P>He also said that in cross-strait economic exchanges, one's
nation is the most important, and one cannot only consider the
interests of a few.</P>
      <P>"If everyone goes to the mainland, who will care for the farmers,
workers or even government employers," Lee asked.</P>
      <P>He said that a national leader has to take care of all the
people, and not just "take care of individual interests or a few
groups, " referring to the repeated appeals from some tycoons for
early links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>He stressed that until local agriculture is competitive, it will
not be appropriate to talk about direct links with the mainland,
unless in the situation of "one country on each side of the Taiwan
Strait."</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy remains in good shape and
the recent falls in the domestic stock market are only a temporary
phenomenon driven mainly by the international market situation,
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks during a creativity awards ceremony sponsored
by the China Development Industrial Bank.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the economy has been gently recovering and
claiming that now is a good time for young men to set up their own
businesses, Yu said that the domestic economic prospects are
optimistic and that the present stock market plunge is merely a
"temporary" consequence of a volatile global market.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's decision to cool off its overheating economy and
the rising price of crude oil in the international market were
ascribed by Yu as the major reasons behind the recent share price
falls on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The weighed index, the key barometer of the domestic bourse,
plummeted by 284.4 points earlier in the day to finish at 6,117.81.
It fell by 172.54 points to close at 6,402.21 at the end of
Thursday's trading session. The sharp falls have prompted grave
concern from the public.</P>
      <P>In view of the mainland's conspicuous plan to stem its
overheating economy, government officials have made it clear that the
move is expected to have limited impact on Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, vice chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said Thursday that it would be
good for the entire world, including Taiwan, if the mainland can
adequately handle its booming economy.</P>
      <P>She urged the public not to overreact to temporary falls in the
domestic stock market on the grounds that the current woes will soon
be over as long as the mainland economy takes a soft landing.</P>
      <P>An official of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs claimed that the mainland's curb on its economy --
mainly targeting the traditional steel, cement and real estate
businesses -- is not very likely to have a huge impact on the
domestic economy because hi-tech parts and components form the bulk
of Taiwan's shipments to the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO EASE RESTRICTIONS TOURISTS FROM MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
approved Friday a draft package of amendments to the regulations
governing mainland Chinese people making sightseeing trips to Taiwan,
with a view to opening the door wider to visitors from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, MAC Vice Chairman Chen
Ming-tong said the decision to ease restrictions on sightseeing trips
by mainland tourists is part of the government's efforts to boost
tourist arrivals. The government has designated 2004 as "visit Taiwan
year."</P>
      <P>Taiwan allows three categories of mainland citizens to make
sightseeing trips to the island -- those who are undertaking advanced
study abroad; those who have permanent residency in a foreign
country; and those who have resided in Hong Kong or Macau for at
least four years and have obtained work permits there. Their spouses
and next of kin are also allowed entry.</P>
      <P>At the moment, these mainland visitors must abide by the "group
in, group out" principle, which permits them only to travel as part
of a tour group, and they are banned from changing their travel
itineraries.</P>
      <P>Under the revised rules, the "group in, group out" principle will
be scrapped and mainland visitors will be allowed to change their
travel itineraries, so long as it is done through their local travel
agents, who must report changes to the relevant government
authorities.</P>
      <P>With a view to cutting red tape and standardizing visa processing
operations, Chen said, the Travel Agents Association of Taiwan will
serve as the centralized service counter in the future to facilitate
all application procedures.</P>
      <P>The revised rules will take effect after the Cabinet approves the
measures in the coming week, Chen said.</P>

(44.1 percent), changed appearance (23.3 percent) and lowered libido
(12.6 percent).</P>
      <P>However, 26.7 percent of the respondents also said that they are
not worried about any of these things.</P>
      <P>Asked about their satisfaction with their weight, 50.7 percent
said they are satisfied, compared with 40.5 percent who said they are
not satisfied, and 8.8 percent who have no opinion.</P>
      <P>On further analysis of the 40.5 percent of respondents who are
not satisfied with their weight, only 43.3 percent are truly
overweight.</P>
      <P>On whether their family members are concerned about their health,
28.2 percent said their families are often concerned about them,
while 36.6 percent said that their families only care about them
occasionally.</P>
      <P>The DOH conducted the survey between April 22 and 26 via

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that
the city will make the best possible preparations to safeguard the
security of the May 20 inauguration ceremony for President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks amid speculation that there may be
disturbances on that day because of post-election controversies and
gangster involvement.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that Taipei city police have yet to receive
concrete information in this regard, but will "make the best possible
preparations for the worst-case scenario" and will not ignore any
reports but welcome any information that can help them deal with the
situation.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is more concerned about traffic control, which he said
could spark quarrels, and he added that the city government has
requested that the Presidential Office prepare for an influx of
uninvited people trying to enter the square in front of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The security of the inauguration ceremony has been a major
concern of law enforcement authorities after the opposition-incited
post-election sometimes violent protest rallies.</P>
      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA) held a meeting Thursday
during which it was decided that 12 checkpoints will be set up around
the controlled areas for the 500,000-strong rally, to ensure that
only those who have invitation cards can enter the square.</P>
      <P>Participants in the ceremony will not be allowed to carry
umbrellas, cameras, whistles or items deemed to be a potential
hazard, NPA officials said.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, a declaration announcing the inauguration of the
"Revolution Party" signed by Lai Chu-hsing, a local small
businessman, was faxed to the Legislative Yuan in which Lai said that
if the truth of the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu does not come to light before May 20, he
will make a lifelong association with the president and former
President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Lai, the boss of a small company selling high-tech water
products, was described by his staff as being a righteous man but too
keen on politics.</P>
      <P>Supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party have held several
sometimes violent rallies since the March 20 presidential election.
Gangsters are said to have mingled with supporters to trigger riots
during an April 10 rally.</P>
      <P>The supporters are demanding a vote recount and an investigation
of the election-eve shooting, which they claim swayed the election in
Chen's favor in the bitterly contested election. Chen won by only
29,518 votes against his rival, KMT Lien Chan, out of more than 13
million ballots cast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN STOWAWAY DETENTION CENTER TO OPEN IN MAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly developed Kinmen detention center
for illegal mainland Chinese immigrants is scheduled to open next
month, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Under constant pressure from an ever-increasing number of
mainlanders illegally sneaking into Taiwan and the mainland
authorities' slow pace of accepting the repatriation of their runaway
citizens, the government decided last year to increase Taiwan's
detention and accommodation capacities for such stowaways.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) , which supervises police
agencies at all levels, began last year to sponsor the expansion of
Taiwan's three existing detention centers while seeking to build new
detention centers in offshore areas, Chen said after attending an
inter-division meeting.</P>
      <P>When the Kinmen detention center becomes operational in May and
expansion of the three existing detentions centers -- in Hsinchu,
northern Taiwan, Ilan, eastern Taiwan and on the outlying island of
Matsu -- is complete in June, Taiwan is expected to be able to detain
and accommodate some 3,700 mainland stowaways, up from the current
level of 2,300, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>New dormitory rooms are also expected to be built at the Matsu
detention center, which are scheduled to be completed in 2010, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the MOI will continue to increase its
hiring of personnel from the police sector and from among military
conscripts to serve as managers and warders at the detention centers
to meet the growing demand.</P>
      <P>As the number of female stowaways has increased by leaps and
bounds, Chen said, the National Police Administration will continue
to increase its recruitment of female officers to work exclusively at
the centers.</P>
      <P>To beef up the detention center manpower, the MOI has also hired
179 unemployed citizens to work as aides at the centers. Their
performance has generally been satisfactory, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the number of mainland stowaways apprehended has always
outpaced the number of those being repatriated back to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Noting that the illegal immigrants are not only causing an
increasing financial burden for the government but have also caused
problems with social order and the distribution of resources, Chen
once again called for the mainland authorities to face the issue
squarely and resume cross-strait dialogue to seek an early solution
to the problem.</P>

      <P>Also seized were seven young mainland women who were smuggled

prostitutes in the Taipei-Taoyuan area. The illegal mainland
immigrants told coast guard officers they had each spent NT$200,000
to sneak into Taiwan to work in the sex trade. They have been sent to
an illegal mainland immigrant detention center in Hsinchu to await

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, JAPAN INCREASE AIR TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic authorities from Taiwan and
Japan signed a pact Friday to increase the number of Japanese cities
included in Taiwan-Japan bilateral weekly flight services, according
to a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Under the new agreement -- endorsed by Hsu Shui-teh, chairman of
the Association of East Asian Relations (AEAR) and Reijiro Hattori,
chairman of the Japan Interchange Association (JIA) -- Sendai, a city
in northeastern Japan popular with tourists, and Hiroshima in the
Kansai area have been added to the existing list of Japanese cities
operating weekly flights to and from Taiwan, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>With the inclusion of Sendai and Hiroshima, the number of
Japanese cities operating regular weekly flights to and from Taiwan
has increased to seven from the previous five -- Tokyo, Kyoto,
Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo.</P>
      <P>Sendai and Hiroshima had been operating only irregular charter
flights to and from Taiwan prior to the renewal of the bilateral
agreement.</P>
      <P>AEAR and JIA are quasi-official agencies authorized by the
Taiwanese and Japanese governments, respectively, to handle exchanges
in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>The renewed air pact is a shot in the arm for Taiwan in its
efforts to double the number of foreign tourists arriving in Taiwan
by 2008, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>The pact, which took immediate effect, will not only help attract
more Japanese tourists to Taiwan, but will also help boost economic
and cultural exchanges between the two countries, the officials added.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Japan
is Taiwan's largest source of tourists from overseas, with about
one-third of the 2-3 million tourists visiting Taiwan each year being
Japanese.</P>
      <P>Under the renewed pact, CAA officials said, Taiwan's China
Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways will both increase regular weekly
flights to and from Japan.</P>
      <P>CAL is planning to add three weekly flights to and from Hiroshima
from June, while EVA will operate two weekly flights to and from
Sendai, starting at the end of August or early September, CAA
officials added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CONFIDENT JOBLESS RATE CAN BE CUT TO 4% NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
he is confident the unemployment rate can be cut to 4 percent next
year.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received the winners of
the national model worker awards, along with their families.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that recent statistics show that the jobless rate was
4.45 percent in March, the lowest figure in nearly three years. The
figure is lower than the 7.2 percent for Hong Kong, 5.7 percent for
the United States and 5 percent for Japan, and compatible to the 4.5
percent for Singapore.</P>
      <P>Chen said that during his presidential campaign, he pledged six
things to the country's workers -- to provide more job opportunities
to cut the unemployment rate to under 4 percent; to protect
grassroots workers and ban the import of cheap mainland Chinese
laborers; to provide each worker with a NT$20,000 (US$602) subsidy to
upgrade their skill; to establish a system to provide lifelong
protection for retired laborers; to cut the casualty rate resulting
from vocational disasters; and to include three vital workers' rights
into the new constitution.</P>
      <P>"The six assurances, which were my platform during my
presidential campaign, will become government policies after my
election. In the near future, they will be the result of the
performance of the administrative team," the president said.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that the jobless rate this year will drop
to 4.5 percent and that it will have a chance to be further cut to 4
percent next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY MUM ON REPORT ABOUT INTELLIGENCE WAR WITH BEIJING IN UKRAINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) of
the Ministry of National Defense declined to make any comment Friday
on a media report that intelligence agents from the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait have engaged in a fierce intelligence war in Ukraine.</P>
      <P>The report out of Hong Kong said Taiwan has sent military

scores of this type of warplane from Russia.</P>
      <P>Responding to press inquiries about the MIB's view on the report,
a spokesman for the bureau said it is the military's established
practice to refrain from commenting on any intelligence-related
report or speculation.</P>
      <P>According to the Hong Kong media report, Taiwan's air force has
sent pilots to test-fly the Su-27SK jet fighter. The Air Force

    <HEADLINE>CDC RETESTING KINMEN SENIOR FOR SARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A second throat-swab taken from a Kinmen
senior citizen who had recently developed a fever upon returning from
a trip to Beijing has been sent to Taipei for another round of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) testing.</P>
      <P>Su Ih-jen, director-general of the Center for Disease Control
(CDC) under the Department of Health (DOH) , said Friday that the
79-year-old Kinmen resident, surnamed Tsai, is now in good shape,
adding that his fever is gone.</P>
      <P>Although the first throat-swab tested negative for the SARS
virus, Su said a second and third throat-swab test is necessary to
confirm the Kinmen man has not been infected with SARS. The results
of the second test are expected to come out Friday afternoon, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chang Shang-chun, director of the Infection Prevention Medical
Network, Northern Taiwan Command Headquarters, pointed out that
throat-swab tests are not 100-percent accurate and that the first
test does not guarantee the Kinmen senior does not have SARS. Chang
said that the man has displayed slight symptoms of pneumonia and
partial filling of the lungs with fluid -- a symptom of SARS.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen resident, who traveled to Beijing with a 59-member
tour group several days ago, developed a fever -- an index symptom of
SARS -- on the day of his return Wednesday. He was immediately
quarantined, and Kinmen County Hospital staff rushed his throat-swab
to Taipei for testing Thursday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Kinmen County Department of Health said that
they have contacted all the other members of the tour group to ask
them to conduct self-health management. None of the 58 tourists have
developed fever, they added.</P>
      <P>This marks the second case in the outlying island of Kinmen of an
individual being monitored for possible SARS infection since the
outbreaks of the potentially fatal flu-like disease subsided in
mainland China last summer.</P>
      <P>Kinmen activated a "Level A" SARS alert mechanism Wednesday after
a woman getting ready to board a flight to Kinmen was discovered to
be running a fever. The woman, who was discovered to be an illegal
alien from mainland China, was therefore not allowed to board the
flight. She was later found to only be suffering from a cold, Kinmen
health authorities said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) upgraded Taiwan's
epidemic prevention mobilization level against SARS from "Level Zero"
to "Level A" from April 24 after Beijing confirmed two SARS cases a
day earlier in mainland China, in addition to two already reported
suspected cases and one possible fatality from the disease.</P>
      <P>Under the activated "Level A" SARS alert mechanism, all inbound
and outbound passengers are required to have their temperatures taken
and to fill out SARS questionnaires. All passengers arriving from
mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau have to exercise self-health
management, including regular hand-washing and temperature-taking,
while all government agencies and institutions are advised to conduct
temperature-taking.</P>
      <P>The DOH has a four-level SARS alert system -- Zero, A, B, and C
-- with "Level C" being the highest level of alert.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was hit hard by SARS between March and June last year,
resulting in 37 deaths and heavy economic losses.</P>
