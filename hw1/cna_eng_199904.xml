    <HEADLINE>ROC TIES WITH PARAGUAY REMAIN CLOSE, FM SAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The diplomatic ties between the Republic of
China and Paraguay are expected to remain solid after Paraguayan
Senator Luis Gonzalez Macchi assumed the presidency on March 28,
Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipei intends to invite Gonzalez, a political heavyweight in
Paraguay who is friendly to Taiwan, to visit the island as soon as
the political situation in that country settles, Hu noted.</P>
      <P>Gonzalez, a key figure in Paraguay's ruling Colorado Party, was
originally scheduled to visit Taiwan in February of this year at the
invitation of the ROC government. The visit, however, was delayed due
to political unrest in Paraguay, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The ROC government welcomed Gonzalez's being instated as the
leader of Paraguay, which is a diplomatic ally of the Republic of
China, Hu said. President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan,
Premier Vincent Siew and Minister Hu himself have all sent felicitous
telegrams to Gonzalez, he noted.</P>
      <P>The ROC Ambassador to Paraguay Liu Tin-tsu went to the Paraguayan
Presidential Office on March 28 to congratulate Gonzalez in person.</P>
      <P>Gonzalez's predecessor, President Raul Cubas, was impeached after
the murder of Vice President Luis Maria Argena on March 23. Cubas
handed over the presidency to Gonzalez on March 28.</P>
      <P>The change in the country's leadership brought to a halt a
weeklong, bloody conflict stemming from the vice president's murder
and party infighting.</P>
      <P>Huang Kun-hui, secretary general of the ROC Presidential Office,
visited Paraguay last year on behalf of President Lee Teng-hui. He
extended President Lee's invitation to Gonzalez to visit Taiwan.</P>

calendar. The following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

in Canton by the ruling Kuomintang.

1938: The Emergency National Congress of the Kuomintang in
Wuchang elects Chiang Kai-shek as its director-general and decides to
organize a People's Political Council and a San-min-chu-i Youth
Corps.

nation's all levels of governments to call Dr. Sun Yat-sen the
"National Father of the Republic of China."

1954: The US Air Force Academy is established in Colorado.

serve, but difficult to please. If you go beyond your duty to please
him, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he always
takes into consideration their capacity. A fool, on the other side,
is easy to please, but difficult to serve. If you go beyond your duty
to please him, he will be pleased. But in his employment of men, he
expects them to be able to do everything."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MULLS MORE AID TO MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is planning a second
wave of aid to Macedonia to help the Balkan state cope as refugees
continue to pour in from nearby Kosovo, Foreign Affairs Minister
Jason Hu said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipei sent US$2 million to Macedonia on March 26 to help the
country settle Kosovar refugees, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The ROC was one of the few countries that sped cash aid to
Macedonia for emergency assistance since NATO bombings began last
week. Those air strikes have unleashed tides of fleeing refugees into
areas bordering Kosovo, Hu noted.</P>
      <P>In the second aid package, Hu said, Taiwan may dispatch relief
efforts in addition to cash to Macedonia so as to provide extensive
assistance to the refugees.</P>
      <P>He said it is hoped that personnel from the ROC Red Cross Society
or the Tzuchi Compassion Foundation will be seen working in refugee
camps in Macedonia soon.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan about Taiwan's aid to
Macedonia, Hu said from now until the end of September, Taiwan will
accelerate its assistance as well as its presence in Macedonia. The
aim is to beef up Taiwan's influence in the Balkan state prior to its
presidential election in mid-October.</P>
      <P>The ROC efforts in Macedonia is imperative at present, he added,
not only because of the refugee issue, but also because the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Vasil Tupurkovski, head of Macedonia's reconstruction
organization whose Democratic Alternative Party holds the foreign
affairs, finance and interior ministries in a coalition government,
is a front-runner in the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Tupurkovski also spearheaded the campaign to establish formal
relations with Taiwan, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>Macedonia established formal diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China on Jan. 27 of this year, becoming the second
European country to do so following the Vatican.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Spurred by strong consumer spending,
Australia's economy is showing no signs of slowing down as consumers 
keep buying to cash in on low interest rates.</P>
      <P>Retail sales during February totaled about US$$7.7 billion,
slightly less than January's levels. But it was the second strongest
sales month on record, economists said.</P>
      <P>They said the figure suggested the buoyant consumer sector would
underpin another strong economic growth period for the first quarter
of 1999.</P>
      <P>Along with better than expected building industry figures on
Tuesday, and strong demand for imports, most economists believe
economic growth in fiscal 1999-2000 will outstrip the government's
official forecast of 3.25 percent. In 1998-99, Australia achieved a
growth of 4.8 percent in its gross domestic product.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA OFFERS TROOPS FOR UN PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN E. TIMOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has offered to provide troops
for a UN peacekeeping force in East Timor to prevent violence as the
former Portuguese colony undergoes the process of attaining full
autonomy or independence.</P>
      <P>The offer was made by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer in a
speech at the national Press Club in Canberra after resistance leader
Xanana Gusmao warned of a possible blood bath in East Timor earlier
this week.</P>
      <P>Downer told reporters and political analysts that he and a senior
UN emissary, Francisco Vendrell, had agreed that a civilian UN
presence could be established in East Timor as early as next month.</P>
      <P>He said the Australian government hoped peacekeeping troops will
not needed, adding, "If that does not eventuate and if the UN makes
the call, Australia will respond appropriately."</P>
      <P>Downer said a peacekeeping operation would have to have a clear
and achievable mandate, adequate probability of success, adequate
resources and be of a limited duration and scope with an "exit
strategy."</P>
      <P>Another consideration is the costs to Australia. These include
whether the country's Defense Forces and Federal Police can undertake
other tasks such as national defense in addition to ensuring the
safety of Australian citizens in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Downer noted Australia had on many occasions discussed with the
Indonesian government the need to disarm militia groups in East
Timor.</P>
      <P>Xanana, in a letter to the Australian ambassador to Jakarta on
March 27, appealed to Australia to pressure Indonesia and warned that
his people's patience was running out as they faced unbearable
hardship.</P>
      <P>Xanana accused Jakarta of "a systematic policy of terror,
threats, and murder of defenseless civilians" in East Timor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC OIL PRICES TO BE RAISED BY 2-TO-3 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic oil prices will be raised by 2 to
3 percent in the near future to reflect rising crude oil prices in
the international market, Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) officials
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>CPC President Pan Wen-yen said the state-owned company is
considering raising retail prices for its products in the coming
days to reflect its rising crude oil import costs.</P>
      <P>"We have not yet made a final decision on the planned price
hike," Pan said, adding that he does not rule out the possibility of
making a formal announcement of the upward adjustment next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pan said the CPC has received notices from Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait that they will cut their crude oil supplies to the company.
"We have bought crude oil from other countries to make up for
reduced supplies from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Therefore, there will
be no problems with domestic oil supplies.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Pan said as international crude oil prices are not
expected to weaken in the foreseeable future, the CPC must raise its
product prices to reflect its increased import costs.</P>
      <P>Pan said if the CPC does not adjust its prices now, it may have
to raise prices for its oil products by more than 10 percent in the
second half of this year.</P>
      <P>"We fear that such a large range of price hikes may trigger a
dramatic adverse impact on domestic consumer prices. Against this
background, we think it will be better to make a modest adjustment
right now," he explained.</P>
      <P>International crude oil prices have risen significantly since
the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries announced in late
March that its member states will cut production from April 1 to
wipe out a glut on the market.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of decreased supplies, crude oil prices have
climbed to US$16 a barrel in recent weeks, far higher than the CPC's
projected import costs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Hao Pei-tsun's upcoming trip
to mainland China is a private visit that the government should not
prohibit or attempt to monitor, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Su Chi said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Su said Hao's
mainland visit, scheduled to begin on April 3, does not violate any
Republic of China law on visits to mainland China by private citizens
or public functionaries.</P>
      <P>The council, the top ROC government agency in charge of relations
with mainland China, trusts that Hao will "behave himself" and
believes that the ROC government need not monitor his visit, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su said that he personally has great respect for Hao, who has
held a variety of government positions, including that of premier and
defense minister.</P>
      <P>Under current ROC law, all government officials and employees,
including retired ones, are required not to reveal information
related to national security or military intelligence, Su noted.</P>
      <P>"I believe Mr. Hao will not do anything that would harm or
endanger the interests of the government and the people of the
Republic of China during his mainland trip," he added.</P>
      <P>Hao is expected to arrive in Yencheng, located in the eastern
Chinese province of Jiangsu, on Sunday. During the visit he will
sweep the tomb of his ancestors in accordance with one of the most
important holidays in Chinese culture. A popular figure in his
hometown, Hao would be the first retired ROC premier to visit the
mainland since the ROC government relocated to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>It has been rumored that Hao will meet with Wang Daohan, mainland
China's top negotiator with Taiwan, during his visit.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chuo Jung-tai, during the
interpellation session, asked Su to "prevent" Hao from doing anything
that would be harmful to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su responded by saying that the Republic of China is a democratic
society and that it is improper for the government to speculate on
whether Hao will do anything harmful to ROC interests.</P>
      <P>News of Hao's planned trip has provoked heated debate at the
Legislative Yuan because of the offices he has held.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING NOT TO SUCCEED IN 'THREE EMPTIES' STRATEGY TOWARD TAIWAN: FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's "three empties" strategy
for completely isolating the Republic of China will not succeed by
the end of the century, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jason Hu said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks when he was fielding questions by Legislator
Hsu Tien-tsai at the Legislative Yuan about whether Beijing could
successfully isolate Taiwan with its "three empties" strategy.</P>
      <P>The strategy calls for Beijing to lure away all the ROC's
diplomatic allies by the turn of the century, to block Taiwan from
joining any international organizations or taking part in the
activities of those organizations and to take away all the bargaining
chips Taiwan has used to seek a footing equal to Beijing's.</P>
      <P>As to how to deal with Beijing's efforts to squeeze Taiwan, Hu
said the first step will be to solidify diplomatic relations with
allies by paying greater attention to cooperative projects, engaging
in more high-level exchanges and establishing more person-to-person
connections with government officials in countries that have
relations with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>There have been reports of shaky relations with some allies, Hu
said, but he added that no such reports have been received during the
past eight months.</P>
      <P>Hu stressed that pressure from the mainland will not lessen and
that the ministry's diplomatic missions overseas have to mobilize so
that Beijing feels pressure in every foothold.</P>
      <P>The ministry has in place a system to re-evaluate every three
months the stability of relations with ROC allies, Hu said, adding
that the system has worked well in the past. The ROC's relations with
two-thirds of the 28 nations that maintain diplomatic relations with
the Republic of China are firm and solid, he said.</P>
      <P>The ministry's annual budget for foreign aid projects currently
totals US$200 million, though emergency relief, such as that provided
to several Central American countries after they were devastated by
Hurricane Mitch last year, does not come out of that budget but from
other sources, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su
Chi said Thursday that he knew nothing about, nor was he in a
position to comment on, reports that former Taipei Mayor Chen
Shui-bian had sent a message through a Singaporean leader to Beijing.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that Chen asked former Singaporean Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew to deliver a message to mainland Chinese
authorities regarding the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) stance
on Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Reports that Chen had asked Lee to convey a message to Beijing
caused concern among members of the Interior Affairs Committee of the
Legislature.</P>
      <P>As the committee is scheduled to examine the budget for the
Cabinet-level MAC under the Executive Yuan on Thursday, Su appeared
before the committee to report on matters related to MAC's budget and
to answer lawmakers' questions.</P>
      <P>Cho Jong-tai, a DPP legislator, called on Su to provide an
explanation of the reports about Chen.</P>
      <P>In response Su said that as far as he knew, the Presidential
Office had denied allegations that Chen had asked Lee to pass along a
message.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper cited a senior official in the Presidential
Office as saying that Chen had visited Singapore four times during
his four years as Taipei mayor. The official was quoted as saying
that in addition to discussing cross-strait relations during his
visits to Singapore, Chen also asked Lee to pass on a message to
Beijing that the DPP would not likely declare independence.</P>
      <P>Cho called on Su to explicitly deny the allegations on Chen's
behalf, but Su said he was in no position to do so, especially since
Chen is now a private citizen, not a public official. To speak on
matters regarding Chen would be the same as interfering into the
affairs of any man off the street, Su said.</P>
      <P>When Cho chided Su for his response, asking the chairman to take
the matter more seriously, Su said that while he attaches much
importance to issues of national security, he considers human rights
important as well.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISSIDENTS REGRET DEATHS IN TIANANMEN MASSACRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Exiled mainland Chinese dissidents Wang
Dan and Wuer Kaixi on Thursday expressed deep regret at the many
students and democracy activists killed in the 1989 Tienanmen Square
massacre prompted by the pro-democracy movement of which they were
both leaders.</P>
      <P>Wang arrived in the central Taiwan city of Taichung a day earlier
to pay a visit on Wuer Kaixi, his ally in the June 4 student
campaign, who now lives in the city.</P>
      <P>The two men had not seen each other for nearly 10 years, ever
since they split up to escape arrest following the bloody crackdown
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.</P>
      <P>The two one-time comrades had an all-night chat at Wuer's
residence, where they rehashed the June 4 bloodshed, Wang said later,
adding that they both became so excited, they were unable to stop
expressing their feelings over the painful memories.</P>
      <P>He and Wuer also called Ding Zhiling in Beijing, the
representative of family members of the victims of the massacre, to
apologize for their role as "promoters of a battle," Wang told
reporters.</P>
      <P>Wang has made similar apologies on several public occasions since
arriving in Taiwan on March 27 for a weeklong visit.</P>
      <P>After escaping from mainland China, Wuer lived in the United
States before marrying a woman from Taiwan and settling in Taichung,
where he hosts a nationwide radio show.</P>
      <P>Wang was a guest on the show, where he fielded telephone calls
from listeners and revealed his innermost feelings about the time he
spent in a mainland jail.</P>
      <P>Wang was jailed in July, 1989 for his part in the pro-democracy
demonstrations in Beijing, and was released in February 1993. He was
arrested again in October 1996, and sentenced to 11 more years of
imprisonment before being released on medical parole in April 1998.</P>
      <P>Asked about his plans for the future, Wang, who is currently
studying at Harvard University for a masters degree in history, said
he intends to study for a doctorate after finishing his current
studies, and then, if permitted by Beijing, will return to mainland
China "to do what he should do." Failing that, he said, he plans to
persuade another doctoral degree before pursuing a career, possibly
in journalism.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he would consider living in Taiwan, Wang told his
audience in a humorous tone that if he finds a Taiwanese girlfriend,
like Wuer did, he may think it over.</P>
      <P>Following the radio interview, Wang headed to Tunghai University
to deliver a speech titled "The Journey of Wang Dan's Heart." He is
scheduled to leave Taiwan on Sunday for his home in the United
States.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's population is graying fast and
more than half of its social security payments now go to elderly
people, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS tallies, Taiwan had 1.81 million of elderly
people at the end of last year, accounting for 8.2 percent of its
total population.</P>
      <P>Elderly people refer to those who are aged over 65. According to
the United Nations definition, a country will be defined as a
"graying society" when its elderly people make up 7 percent of its
total population.</P>
      <P>Taiwan became an aging society in 1993 when its elderly people
accounted for 7.1 percent of its total population for the first
time. The ratio has since risen steadily and reached a new high of
8.2 percent in 1998. The average age of all Taiwan residents
reached 31.2 last year, also higher than the UN standard for an aging
society.</P>
      <P>DGBAS tallies showed that Taiwan had a population of 21.93
million at the end of 1998, up 8.5 percent from 1997. The average
life span of Taiwan people was 74.6 years, ranking 21st in the
world.</P>
      <P>With the number of elderly people increasing, Taiwan's total
social security expenditure amounted to NT$744.9 billion last year,
accounting for 8.8 percent of its gross national product (GNP).</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS tallies, 51 percent or NT$380.1 billion of
total social security expenditures were spent on various pension

    <HEADLINE>`ANGEL BANK' OPENS IN TAIPEI TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An unprecedented manpower resources
organization, dubbed the "Angel Bank," opened in Taipei on Thursday
to encourage voluntary service to care for the island's elderly
citizens.</P>
      <P>"The Angel Bank is designed to reward volunteers and promote
voluntary service in local society," said Chen Li-hua, a section
chief with the Taipei City Government's Bureau of Health.</P>
      <P>Chen, who initiated the project, said similar manpower
organizations have been operating successfully in many advanced
countries for many years.</P>
      <P>"We hope the opening of the Angel Bank will encourage more people
to volunteer their time to provide care for elderly people who need
assistance in their daily lives," Chen said, adding that at present,
many local volunteers are only willing to work in hospital
out-patient departments.</P>
      <P>From now on, Chen said, volunteers can "deposit" the time they
have contributed to voluntary service in the Angel Bank. "When a
volunteer has contributed 300 hours, he or she will become eligible
to receive similar voluntary service from other volunteers, should it
ever become necessary," she explained.</P>
      <P>The new bank will allow young people to "deposit" their
contributions to ensure that they in turn will be cared for when they
grow old, Chen said.</P>
      <P>To reduce the bank's risk of "bankruptcy," Chen said only
volunteers who have contributed the requisite time will be eligible
for return services in the initial stages, although she added that
"when the Angel Bank grows stronger, we'll consider allowing family
members of qualified volunteers to be eligible for feedback
services."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Angel Bank now has some 70 "seed" members,
most of whom are women aged between 20 and 50 years old.</P>
      <P>The bank's headquarters is located in the Hsinyi District's
health office in Taipei, but Chen said the bank plans to open
branches in all of the city's 12 administrative districts. "Each
branch office will enlist at least 100 volunteers. All adult citizens
interested in volunteering to take care of elderly citizens are
welcome to join our workforce," Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE CONTAINER PORT HANDLING RATE FALLS SHORT OF REFORM TARGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One year after hard-fought reform,
Australia's handling of containerized cargo at five major ports is
falling short of the government's target, according to figures
released by the Department of Transport on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The reform of the waterfront industry was initiated by Workplace
Relations Minister Peter Reith, who set the handling of a 20-foot
container at 25 20-foot equipment units (TEUs) per hour after Patrick
Stevedores, the second largest stevedoring firm in Australia, started
the reform process by substantially cutting its workforce in order to
raise productivity.</P>
      <P>Patrick's 1998 efforts improved productivity by increasing the
containerized cargo handled from 18.8 TEUs at the Melbourne Port in
Victoria in December 1997 to 21.5 TEUs in the same 1998 period.</P>
      <P>Also registering slight improvements were Adelaide Port in South
Australia and Fremantle Port in West Australia.</P>
      <P>Adelaide registered a rise in its handling of containerized cargo
to 23.2 TUEs in December 1998 from 21.4 TEUs during the same period
in 1977 while Fremantle handled 20.7 TEUs, up from 18.9 TEUs during
the same period.</P>
      <P>Handling of containerized cargo at the Brisbane Port remained
unchanged at 16.8 TEUs.</P>
      <P>Sydney Port turned in the worst performance. Instead of improving
its rate of handling, it registered a decline of 15.7 TEUs in
December 1998, down from 18.4 TEUs a year ago.</P>
      <P>Compared with container ports in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Japan, Australia's major ports lagged behind in terms
of productivity, as the Asian ports averaged between 28 TEUs and 35
TEUs per hour, shipping industry experts said.</P>
      <P>Federal Transport Minister John Anderson blamed the Maritime
Union of Australia (MUA) for the poor performance in Sydney, saying
the figures were a "stark illustration of the damage being caused by
the refusal of sections of the MUA to embrace waterfront reform."</P>
      <P>Parrick's chief executive, Chris Corrigan, claimed recently that
his firm was achieving an average crane rate at or near the benchmark
-- "a full 25 percent higher than last year with a greatly reduced
number of employees."</P>
      <P>But assistant secretary of the Australian Council of Trade
Unions, Australia's largest trade organization, Greg Combet said that
if the government was claiming "a great victory" on the waterfront
when the national crane rate had fallen, "then good luck, Peter
Reith."</P>
      <P>He said it was "absolute rubbish" to suggest higher crane rates
represented a defeat for the union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CORPORATE EARNINGS IN SINGAPORE PLUNGE 90 PERCENT IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The total earnings of the 193 companies
that filed 1998 full-year results dived nearly 90 percent to S$507.9
million (about US$298 million) in 1998 -- a much more drastic fall
than the 48 percent plunge sustained by 106 companies in Singapore's
last recession in 1985.</P>
      <P>The companies' earnings were down 75 percent to about S$800
million in the first half of last year, compared with S$3.2 billion
in the same period in 1997.</P>
      <P>But they incurred losses of S$292 million in the second half, at
which time Singapore's economy slid into recession. The same
companies had enjoyed a combined S$1.3 billion in earnings in the
second half of 1997.</P>
      <P>Despite last year's economic downturn, however, the proportion of
companies that reported positive earnings last year was only
marginally lower than in 1995.</P>
      <P>A total of 130 companies, or 67 percent the total, managed to
stay in the black. Of these, 50 companies or 39 percent, actually
turned in higher earnings in 1998 compared with 1997, while another
six returned to the black.</P>
      <P>In comparison, total corporate earnings during the 1985 recession
declined by 48 percent to S$483.1 million from the previous year's
S$925.1 million. Some 68 percent of the 106 companies reported
positive earnings, with a quarter managing to better their
year-on-year profits.</P>
      <P>A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that, on average,
earnings per company were about S$2.6 million last year, about half
of the S$4.6 average earned by companies in 1985, when the economy
contracted during the second half and shrank 1.6 percent for the
whole year.</P>
      <P>Analysts attribute last year's sharp plunge in total earnings to
companies taking the opportunity to clean house by making huge
provisions. For example, Singapore's five local banking groups made
provisions totaling some S$3.2 billion, while three of the four big
property companies -- City Developments, DBS Land, Singapore Land and
Keppel Land -- wrote down another S$3.1 billion in total.</P>
      <P>While the exact figures for 1985 are hard to come by, some
analysts reckon that last year's figures represent a five-fold
increase in provisions compared to 1985.</P>
      <P>Some market analysts also blame rising costs for the lower
earnings-per-company figure.</P>

      <P>Civic organizations will be allowed to use
"Taiwan" and "Taiwanese" in their names starting April 1, as old
regulations that effectively require the use of "China" and "Chinese"
were ruled unconstitutional on Thursday by the Council of Grand
Justices of the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>The council's ruling came at the request of the Chinese Society
of Comparative Law (CSCL), which had argued that the regulations, set
by the Ministry of Interior, contravened Article 14 of the Republic
of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>That article states that all people may freely form civic
organizations or groups. MOI regulations, however, mandate that all
such societies and groups must be named after the administrative
district in which the society or group plans to set up.</P>
      <P>This regulation effectively bars groups from using "Taiwan" or
"Taiwanese" in their names, as Taiwan is regarded as falling within
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The council ruled that the names used by the groups should be

      <P>The MOI should revise the regulations to ensure they are

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian said
during a visit to Japan on Thursday that the time is not ripe for him
to talk about whether he will run for the Republic of China's 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The stalwart of Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said at a Tokyo news conference that while the DPP of
course hopes to win the election, he attaches great importance to the
party system and to opinions within his party, and must listen to the
views of the island's people on his presidential candidacy before
deciding on his course of action.</P>
      <P>Describing his visit to Japan as "a journey of consensus-seeking
on Asia-Pacific security," Chen said he will use the trip to gauge
the feasibility of communicating and cooperating with Japan on the
security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has twice held the post of chairman of the
legislature's national defense committee, said both the ROC and Japan
are very important to the Asia-Pacific's regional security, and that
the two nations "share each other's joys and sorrows."</P>
      <P>He stressed that national security is the foundation for a
nation's construction, and added that without security, the economic
development of a nation will be adversely affected.</P>
      <P>Remarking on Japan's problems regarding North Korean missile
tests and intrusion of North Korean spy ships over the past year,
Chen said he sympathized, because Taiwan faces similar military
threats from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the "new middle route" that he recently began
espousing is based on national security, and noted that the
government and the people should cease their disagreements and reach
consensus on the issue of national security.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, a joint
defense concept proposed by the United States for the region, Chen
said the concept had originally faced severe opposition in Japan, but
noted that North Korea's missile test-firing had finally resulted in
a consensus.</P>
      <P>Chen urged Beijing to take note of the fact that if not for the
North Korean missile threat and mainland China's enforcement of its
armed forces, the US and Japan would have no need to even propose the
idea of a TMD system.</P>
      <P>In the same way, Chen said, it is mainland China's deployment of
armed forces and missiles along its coastline that have made Taiwan
consider the TMD system.</P>
      <P>Chen said he supports President Lee Teng-hui's view regarding the
TMD system. Lee has said that if mainland China renounces the use of
force against Taiwan, it would not be necessary for Taiwan to join
such a system.</P>
      <P>The charismatic former mayor said that like other advanced
nations, the focus of Taiwan's voters in 2000 will be on financial,
economic, industrial and commercial issues, while domestic issues
will take precedence over foreign issues.</P>
      <P>Turning to Japan's refusal to allow Lee to visit Japan and attend
an alumni meeting at his Japanese alma mater for fear of offending
Beijing, Chen urged Japan to just say no to Beijing in order not to
let down the many people who want Lee to visit Japan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan court handed down a relatively
lenient one-year prison term to a pilot from mainland China who
hijacked his Air China Boeing 737 passenger aircraft to Taiwan last
October, sources reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan District Court found Captain Yuan Bin guilty of
violating air safety rather than the much more serious charge of air
piracy, which can be a capital offense.</P>
      <P>In deciding a just sentence, which was lighter than expected, the
judge took into consideration the facts that Yuan did not use force
to divert the plane and that the safety of passengers aboard were
never threatened.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yuan's wife Xu Mei, who accompanied him to Taiwan
aboard the same flight, received a six-month sentence for violating
national security and illegal entry. The sentence was suspended for
two years, and Xu was taken directly to a detention center to await
repatriation to the mainland, while her husband was taken to jail to
serve his term.</P>
      <P>Yuan said he diverted the Boeing 737 with 95 passengers and nine
crew because he was upset over pay and working conditions at Air
China. He denied having any intention to hijack the plane.</P>
      <P>The couple diverted the aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport on October 28 last year and immediately surrendered to
police. No one was injured.</P>
      <P>In 12 previous hijackings of mainland airliners to Taiwan, Taipei
has meted out prison sentences of at least six years.</P>
      <P>Beijing has demanded that Taipei return Yuan and all other
mainland hijackers imprisoned on Taiwan, saying they should be tried
in mainland courts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE TEENAGER HITS ON SOLUTION TO Y2K BUG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, April 1 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A teenage Singaporean boy has discovered
a way to break the Y2K Bug's grip over the computing industry, in a
find heralded by the information technology consultancy group Gardner
as a "just-in-time" solution to the millennium bug.</P>
      <P>Jack Hon Si Yue, 17, said he stumbled onto a code that would lick
the Y2K problem while working out the solution to an algebra problem.</P>
      <P>The Y2K problem arises from computer chips' inability to
distinguish between the years 2000 and 1900, as early programmers
dropped the first two digits to save precious memory space.</P>
      <P>Corporations are spending millions to ensure that their business
systems run smoothly past midnight, December 31, 1999. Singapore
Airlines, for example, has spent about S$50 million (US$29 million)
on the problem.</P>
      <P>Testing for Y2K compliance involves running tests on every chip,
and rewriting every line of computer code that uses a two-digit year.</P>
      <P>Hon, who grew up around computers, said an interview from his
home that he was working on an algebra problem when he had a flash of
intuition.</P>
      <P>"I was just idling, tired of revising for my O levels," he said.
"My mind was going, '1900 is not 2000. How do you get the computer to
recognize that?'"</P>
      <P>"Can you substitute one digit for the other? Or add a cipher
code?" he wondered. "The solution just came: Write a program that can
turn 00 to 2000," he said.</P>
      <P>Rather than rewriting all lines of problematic code, simply add
another layer of code that clears up the problem, he said. It took
him more than 30 minutes to work out the necessary equation, and
another three hours to test it.</P>
      <P>He woke up his father, science lecturer Hon Yuin Tai, 46, and
they worked through the night to refine it. The elder Hon sent the
formula a few days later to Sam Brittan, Gardner's worldwide Y2K
consultant.</P>
      <P>Brittan told The Straits Times in an interview from New York, "We
had to rework the formula, but after several weeks, and many many
tests later, I'm happy to be able to say it's worked beautifully."</P>
      <P>"We made it available to our clients, and we're talking to
companies on how to customize the solution for them," he said.</P>
      <P>Brittain said the boy's solution has a lot of commercial
potential, adding that Gardner has teamed up wth the Hons to market
it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT MULLS BICAMERAL SYSTEM FOR LEGISLATIVE REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang is mulling a
phase-by-phase push for reform of the nation's legislature into a
bicameral system, KMT Central Committee Secretary-General John Chang
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while meeting the press at the office of
the KMT's central committee. He did not elaborate, but said that the
time for the KMT to push for the amendment to the Constitution will
probably fall between May and July.</P>
      <P>He said that on April 6, he will invite speakers and deputy
speakers of the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan to meet on
the issue, and added that he hopes the participants will form a
consensus and plan a concrete direction for the amendment to the
Constitution, as well as arrange the timetable for the political
reform engineering.</P>
      <P>The conclusions reached by those attending the meeting will be
sent to the party's task force for the amendment to the Constitution
for finalization, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The country's opposition parties have long been asking the
government to reform the nation's legislative branch. At present, the
Legislative Yuan is responsible for the making of laws, while the
National Assembly is responsible for amending the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The opposition is hoping that the National Assembly will be
abolished and its functions transferred to the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AMBASSADOR TO HAITI REPORTS ON BILATERAL TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the Republic of China and
Haiti have been friendly over the past four decades, but ties have
become strained in recent years as a result of moves by mainland
China, ROC Ambassador to Haiti Chiou Jong-nan said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiou made the remarks while reporting on the latest developments
in bilateral relations between the two countries to a legislative
committee on foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>Although Haiti has only a limited market and the people there
lack purchasing power, Beijing set up a trade office in the country's
capital of Port au Prince in January 1997 with the aim of sabotaging
ROC-Haiti relations under the cover of trade promotion, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that because of the mainland's actions, the ROC
Embassy has been under greater pressure recently than in the past. He
further noted that there are no overseas Chinese students from the
Republic of China in Haiti, the embassy's staff is small and an ROC
agricultural mission to Haiti has only 11 members.</P>
      <P>He reported that Beijing's trade office has been headed by a
career diplomat, who has had extensive contacts with Haitian
political and economic figures and who has also arranged for a
Shanghai Trade Fair.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's representative to the United Nations, Qin
Huasun, paid a secret visit to Haiti last October, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>He said that Haiti will hold parliamentary elections this year
and a presidential election in 2000.</P>
      <P>To step up contacts with Haiti's trade and commerce industry, and
to promote bilateral trade relations, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs sent an official to Miami to handle trade exchanges between
the Republic of China and Haiti.</P>
      <P>While the country has been hampered by an insufficient
infrastructure, an unsteady supply of power and water, an unreliable
telephone system and problems with social order, the Haitian
government has made some improvements, Chiou said, adding that he
hopes Taiwan manufacturers will invest in the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FPG INSTRUCTED TO HANDLE ITS MERCURY-LACED WASTE PROPERLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  1  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) on Thursday demanded that the Formosa
Plastics Group (FPG) take adequate measures to handle its toxic waste
without provoking further international disputes.</P>
      <P>Fu Shu-chiang, director of the EPA's Solid Waste Control Bureau,
instructed FPG, a local petrochemical giant, to find a suitable
destination as soon as possible to dispose of its mercury-laden
industrial waste, in light of the fact that the US Environmental
Protection Agency has withdrawn a permit for the waste to be shipped
to California for disposal following strong opposition from local
residents.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the EPA will closely monitor how the FPG handles
the much-disputed toxic waste, Fu claimed that there is no evidence
to back foreign wire service reports that the company is planning to
transport the nearly 3,000 tons of toxic substances back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, FPG Manager Lee Chih-tsun also brushed
aside the reports, saying that FPG is planning to transport the
material to a third destination via the southern Taiwan port of
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The foreign reports sparkled fierce protests from Ting Shan-lung,
head of Kaohsiung County's Environmental Protection Bureau, and Liu
Lung-chuan, chief of the local Jenwu Township, with the two men
accusing FPG of long-term pollution of the environment in Jenwu,
where several FPG plants are located. They demanded FPG relocate its
plants elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The 3,000 tons of mercury-contaminated industrial waste were
produced by one of the Jenwu plants.</P>
      <P>The toxic waste was shipped to Cambodia last November, where it
was dumped at a landfill in a southern village. However, poor
handling of the waste by the local contractor, and the discovery by
environmental officials that the waste contained a wide range of
toxicity levels, panicked local residents and prompted grave concern
from the international community.</P>
      <P>Forced to find another destination for the waste, FPG reached an
agreement with a US waste disposal company which was going to store
the waste at a California landfill, until public outcry from the
people living in the vicinity of the proposed site drove the US EPA
to revoke its previous approval for the shipment.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and mainland China have agreed in
principle to jointly sponsor displays of Taiwan-made goods in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The agreement was reached by Lin Chen-kuo, chairman of the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OFFICIAL WARNS BEIJING TO `KEEP HANDS OFF' TAIWAN'S ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Warning Beijing against meddling in
Taiwan's 2000 presidential elections, an official in charge of
mainland Chinese affairs said on Thursday that the more Beijing tries
to influence the elections, the stronger the backlash it will cause
among the island's voters.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi told the
Legislative Yuan that it is difficult to predict how Beijing will try
to sway the outcome of the elections, but he expressed the belief
that Beijing should have drawn lessons from its previous experience
in trying to influence events in Taiwan, and should realize that any
such attempts will be doomed to failure.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to Beijing's attempts to intimidate local voters
in the runup to the island's first popular presidential elections in
1996 by test-firing live missiles into the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, whose pragmatic diplomacy is often
criticized by Beijing as a disguised attempt to seek Taiwan
independence, won an overwhelming victory in those elections.</P>
      <P>Hardly an election has taken place in Taiwan in recent years
without reports that Beijing has tried to interfere with the outcome
by supporting specific favored candidates, although nothing has ever
been proven.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a defense of the MAC's agenda, Su said that Taiwan
has made it's mainland China policy clear to the United States, and
will keep a close eye on the forthcoming trip to Washington by
Beijing's Premier Zhu Rongji.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is open to political dialogue with Beijing if
Beijing insists, although he pointed out that Beijing should realize
that such dialogue will lead nowhere, and could even damage the
current ties, unless Beijing renounces violence against Taiwan and
treats Taiwan as an independent political entity.</P>
      <P>As to the idea of an "interim agreement" with Beijing suggested
by Washington's Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Stanley Roth recently, Su said this is not an official US
opinion, although he added that when it comes to agreements, "one is
better than none."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST CROSS-STRAIT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SUMMIT SLATED FOR APRIL 9</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of students from Taipei's Chienkuo
High School are scheduled to leave for Beijing Saturday as they
embark on an expedition no Taiwan student has ever made before.</P>
      <P>Thirty-one students from Taiwan's most prestigious all-boys high
school will meet with a group of students from Beijing's Huiwen
Middle School on April 9 in a cross-strait summit meeting of high
school students, said Wu Wu-hsiung, principal of Chienkuo High
School. Wu will lead the group of students from the high school in
their visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>At the summit the mainland Chinese students will talk about how
they are preparing for the 21st century, while the students from
Taiwan will talk about the international perspective young people
should have as they head into the next century, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the summit, the Chienkuo students will visit
prestigious Beijing University, Qinghua University and four Beijing
high schools to familiarize themselves with the educational
environment on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Chienkuo students will give as gifts a set of textbooks
currently used by Taiwan high school students to Huiwen Middle School
and Jingshan High School, said Wu. As a traditional Chinese middle
school, Huiwen has students at both the junior-high- and
senior-high-school level.</P>
      <P>During their nine-day stay, the students will stay with 30 host
families in Beijing, said Huang Hsiao-tao, director of general
affairs at Chienkuo High School and the expedition's project leader.</P>
      <P>The Chienkuo students had previously requested permission to make
the home stay -- aimed at enabling the students to get a real
understanding of the daily lives of ordinary people in Beijing -- but
they were rejected by mainland authorities, Huang said.</P>
      <P>During their landmark visit the students will collect information
on the educational systems, teaching environment and campus culture
in mainland China, as well as on cross-strait relations. The
information they obtain will be the basis of a booklet that will be
distributed to students around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wen Kuei-lin, director of disciplinary affairs at Chienkuo High
School and a member of the visiting delegation, said that although
the students' activities have been somewhat restricted by authorities
in Beijing, they will still be able to do many of the things they
would like to do while in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The students are eager to find out how mainland students deal
with the pressure of entrance examinations, whether there exists
there the same "cram culture" that is pervasive in Taiwan, and what
type of extracurricular activities may be found on high-school and
college campuses in Beijing, Wen said.</P>
      <P>Wang Yung-yi, a Chienkuo student who will take part in the
expedition, said that what he most wants to know is what students in
Beijing -- who are of roughly the same age and who have the same
language and culture as Wang, but who live under a different
sociological system -- are thinking about.</P>

      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong formally opened a private office in Taipei Friday morning with
an inauguration ceremony attended by more than 100 supporters from
around the island.</P>
      <P>Soong, dressed in the trademark white jacket he wore as
provincial governor, personally hung up a nameplate to signify the
opening of the office.</P>
      <P>The 30-ping (180-square-foot) office is located at F1, No. 1,
Lane 304, Section 1, Chienkuo S. Road. Tang Chi-ming, former director
of the Social Affairs Department under the Taiwan Provincial
Government, is head of the office.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Soong said the main
purpose of establishing the office is to seek out public opinion and
formulate social consensus on various issues in hopes of leading the
Republic of China into a promising future.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will be the running mate of current Vice
President and presidential aspirant Lien Chan in next year's
presidential election, Soong said it would not be his willingness but
public opinion that would decide the issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that many people are concerned about the current situation
in Taiwan, Soong said that rather than worry, it is better to do
something.</P>
      <P>Soong said he will continue to request advice from senior
citizens from all walks of life and to think carefully about various
issues. He urged the public to join with him in resisting the
pressure currently being applied to Taiwan by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Soong stepped down as the first directly elected Taiwan
provincial governor last December. Shortly afterward he went to the
United States for a lengthy vacation. He returned to Taiwan March 1

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE LOAN GROUPS TO COME UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Private loan groups, better known as "huei"
in mandarin Chinese, will be legally regulated under the Civil Code,
starting next year, so that fraud and related financial
irregularities can be effectively curbed, sources from the
Legislative Yuan reported Friday.</P>
      <P>A revision to the law governing the application of the Book of
Obligations of the Civil Code passed its third reading at the
legislature Friday, paving the way for the eventual implementation of
regulations on huei's.</P>
      <P>About 15 percent of Taiwan adults are currently participating in
such groups, according to a recent poll. In that same poll 19 percent
of respondents said they viewed such groups as a risky means of
investment, compared with 57 percent who said the stock market was
risky.</P>
      <P>In each huei, which is formed for a specific period of time,
group members make a monthly contribution into an investment pool.
Each month that pool is awarded to one member of the group, by having
those members who have not been awarded the pot draw lots.</P>
      <P>After receiving the pot, group members continue paying into the
fund, adding an interest payment for the "loan" they have received to
their regular monthly contributions.</P>
      <P>The groups are usually small in size and members may include a
person's friends, business associates, neighbors or colleagues in a
company or organization.</P>
      <P>Until now huei's have been entirely unregulated, and there has
been no legal recourse for group members who have been cheated by
fellow huei members, who sometimes withdraw from the group after
winning the pot. In such cases, the huei's are usually suspended or
aborted.</P>
      <P>Under new regulations, whenever a huei is suspended or aborted,
both the head of the huei -- the person who formed the group -- and
all group members who have won the pot during previous drawings must
continue to make their regular monthly contributions, but group
members who have not won no longer need to pay into the pot.</P>
      <P>Each month the money that has been contributed is divided among
the group members who did not win the pot before the huei was
interrupted, and the monthly contributions continue until the end of
the huei's original lifespan.</P>
      <P>The regulations require huei heads to provide each member with a
list of the names, identification numbers, addresses and telephone
numbers of all other huei members. Members are given time to verify
the information on the list, which all members must sign before the
huei can begin to operate. In addition to containing contact
information, the list serves as legal proof of the huei's formation.</P>
      <P>People cannot simultaneously participate in a huei as its head
and as a regular member under the new regulations, and convicted
criminals and the mentally disabled are prohibited from forming
huei's.</P>
      <P>The regulations are expected to go into effect May 5, 2000, and
they will not be retroactive, legislative sources said.</P>
      <P>The amendment containing the regulations is the first amendment
to the law governing the application of the Book of Obligations of
the Civil Code since 1930.</P>

efforts to secure a more just and righteous society in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the audience, Lee also expressed gratitude to members of

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE DISSIDENT SAYS TAIWAN TRIP IS TO LEARN ABOUT ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prominent mainland Chinese dissident Wang
Dan said on Friday that he has seen the people and things he wanted
to see in Taiwan, and has basically accomplished what he wished to
accomplish during his visit here.</P>
      <P>He said that unlike Wei Jingsheng, another mainland dissident who
visited last December, he did not ask to meet with President Lee
Teng-hui, because he wanted to travel around the island to learn the
truth about the place through contacts with the people and did not
consider a study of the government system to be a major part of his
trip.</P>
      <P>Wang, who arrived here on March 27 for a weeklong visit, said
that he recorded his impressions about Taiwan in his journal every
day, and added that he intends to publish the memoirs in order to
share them with others.</P>
      <P>Wang, one of the student leaders of the ill-fated pro-democracy
movement in Beijing a decade ago, said that the Taiwan experience
proves that dictatorship is not the true way for the East and that
the Chinese are entirely capable of pursuing a democratic course.</P>
      <P>Wang said that while he is in no position to speak on the issues
of Chinese unification or Taiwan independence, he believes that as
long as both sides continue to bridge their gaps through exchanges,
political problems will disentangle themselves as soon as the time is
ripe.</P>
      <P>He also said that the 10 years he has spent in a mainland prison
have made him lose some of his youthful feelings. He added that while
he feels no remorse for having been sent to prison because of his
beliefs, he does have some regrets.</P>
      <P>Expressing a love of literature, Wang described his 10 years
behind bars as the most prolific for his poetry. He said he wrote
down "everything," from his feelings about friendship, to his
feelings about his parents, in his poems.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks during an interview by a local radio
station. He also had a long-distance telephone conversation with the
father of the late Taiwan singer and producer Chang Yu-sheng, who is
currently in Beijing to visit relatives there.</P>
      <P>Chang, who died two years ago at the age of 31 after a serious
car accident, wrote the music for Wang's poem "The Days When I have
no cigarettes to smoke."</P>
      <P>Wang said that he met with Chang in Beijing, and found him to be
a passionate young man. Wang had given him some of the poems he wrote
in prison to be tuned into songs, but the work was left unfinished
due to Chang's untimely demise.</P>
      <P>Wang said he and the senior Chang agreed that they would meet
sometime in Taiwan to talk about the singer they both loved.</P>
      <P>Because of the tragic death of Chang, Wang said that he also
wanted to meet with the singer A Mei, who recorded the song, but was
disappointed to find out that the singer is currently traveling
overseas.</P>
      <P>Wang later called on Academia Sinica, the highest academic
organization in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Yuan T. Lee met Wang for the first
time, and expressed the hope that as an intellectual, Wang will not
only focus on academic learning, but will also care about society.</P>
      <P>Wang is currently pursuing a masters degree in history at Harvard
University.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cerebral palsy sufferer Sun Chia-liang of
Taipei has never been willing to surrender to his affliction, and has
always strived for a glorious and creative life.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the fruits of his labor paid off -- in spades.</P>
      <P>The severely handicapped young man on Friday won a place in the
department of computer engineering at the Taiwan National University
(NTU), the nation's most prestigious higher learning institute. Quite
an achievement in itself, but even more impressive in light of the
fact that he had already been offered a place in the university's
Department of Mathematics a few days earlier.</P>
      <P>Sun said that he has yet to decide on which department to enroll
in, and added that he will take courses in both fields. Sun was
speaking during a tour of the NTU's downtown campus aimed at
acquainting him with his new environment and allowing him to talk
with his future professors on his future course of study.</P>
      <P>Sun, who has spent his entire life in a wheelchair, beat the
highest possible score of 700 to post the best performance in the
Taipei area high school's joint entrance examination in July, 1996.</P>
      <P>With a score of 756.6 after an upward adjustment of 20 percent to
take account of his handicap, Sun won a place at the elite Chien Kuo
Senior High School that most junior high school boys in Taipei only
dream of attending.</P>
      <P>In his second senior high-school year, Sun took part in the 1998
national university entrance exam, and achieved a score allowing him
to enroll in the Hsinchu-based National Tsinghua University.</P>
      <P>However, he did not enroll due to the distance between the campus
and his home in Taipei, preferring to wait another year and tilt at a
school closer to his home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN  SEES HOARDING OF RICE WINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>News that the price of rice wine in Taiwan
could increase more than five-fold in the next five years has led to
hoarding of the popular cooking wine, according to statistics
compiled by the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly (TTWM).</P>
      <P>In response to complaints from the public about reduced stocks of
rice wine in local markets, the TTWM announced on Friday that it will
open its distribution centers around the island to the public every
afternoon between Tuesday and Friday, but will ration each customer
to a maximum of two bottles at a time.</P>
      <P>The TTWM statistics show that sales of rice wine totaled 2.19
million cases in March, higher than the 1.6 million cases sold in the
same period of last year. However, the recall rate of empty rice wine
bottles was much lower, which shows that hoarding has been taking
place.</P>
      <P>TTWM officials noted that rice wine has long been a cheap and
convenient cooking wine in Taiwan. The wine currently sells at NT$24
(US$0.74) a bottle, and the officials noted that as production is
running close to capacity, it is difficult to further boost
production to deter hoarding.</P>
      <P>The huge increase in prices will be part of the cost of Taiwan's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), as the government has
to scrap the monopoly system and adopting a system of customs
tariffs.</P>
      <P>If the Legislative Yuan passes a new tobacco and wine tax law in
this legislative session, rice wine will be subject to new taxes, and
the price will immediately go up to NT$60 (US$1.85) a bottle, and
will soar to NT$135 (US$4.15) in five years.</P>
      <P>However, the TTWM officials assured the public that if the price
does increase greatly, an alternative cooking wine, priced at about
NT$32 a bottle, will be offered.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YUEN FOONG EXECUTIVE PLEADS QUILTY OF ATTEMPTED THEFT OF TRADE SECRET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based Yuen Foong Paper Co. said on
Friday it respects a decision by its adviser Hsu Kai-lo to plead
guilty in a US court to attempted theft of technological secrets from
a US firm.</P>
      <P>According to a CNA report from New York, Hsu admitted in a
Philadelphia court on Wednesday that he and his colleague Chou
Hua-ping had attempted to steal technological secrets relating to
the anti-cancer drug Taxol belonging to New York-based Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Yuen Foong spokeswoman Su Ying-lin said
Yuen Foong respects Hsu's decision. "We think Hsu is entitled to make
a choice that is in his best interests," Su said.</P>
      <P>According to US criminal procedures, a defendant can reach an
agreement with prosecution on giving up his or her rights to be
questioned by a jury in the court and then discussing with
prosecutors a mutually acceptable verdict.</P>
      <P>Noting that it was Hsu, not Yuen Foong Co., who has been charged
by US prosecution authorities, Su said Yuen Foong will not make any
comments before the Philadephia federal court metes out a verdict on
its charges against Hsu on July 13.</P>
      <P>Su said the company will continue employing Hsu and Chou
Hua-ping, both of whom face US charges of attempted theft of
Taxol-related technological secrets, commercial bribes and
telecommunications fraud. If convicted, Hsu faces a maximum jail term
of 60 years and a fine of up to US$2.5 million, while Chou may
receive up to 55 years plus a maximum US$1 million in fines. Chou,
who is in Taiwan, would be arrested if she sets foot on US soil.</P>
      <P>According to the CNA report, US prosecution has dropped its
charges against Hsu of committing commercial bribes and
telecommunications fraud after Hsu pleaded guilty of attempted theft
of Taxol-related technological secrets. In return, Hsu reportedly
agreed to provide all correct information related to the case and to
testify in court to Yuen Foong's role in the incident.</P>
      <P>In late January, the Philadelphia court approved a US
prosecutor's request to drop all criminal charges against Chester
Ho, a professor of Taiwan's National Chiao Tung University, in
connection with the Yuen Foong case to uphold "judicial justice."</P>
      <P>Ho and Hsu were arrested by Philadelphia FBI agents upon their
arrival in the United States on June 14, 1997 on charges of
attempting to steal Taxol-related technological know-how.</P>
      <P>Ho has been living in Boston since he was released on US$1
million bail on June 19, 1997. He is now a visiting scholar at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The "Taxol" case began in 1995 when an FBI agent, posing as a
technology broker, sought to mediate a deal related to Taxol
production expertise for Yuen Foong. Between 1995 and mid-1997, Yuen
Foong allegedly contacted the undercover FBI agent 135 times by
telephone or letter regarding the proposed deal.</P>
      <P>Yuen Foong has consistently denied FBI accusations that it
attempted to steal trade secrets from the US pharmaceutical company.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A technological mission from the Republic
of China will leave for Macedonia on Sunday to help the Balkan
nation develop its export industry, agriculture and small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</P>
      <P>Lo Ping-chang, secretary-general of the ROC government-run
International Cooperation Development Fund (ICDF), said on Friday
that the seven-member mission will be led by Alex Shyy, an ICDF
deputy department chief.</P>
      <P>Lo said Shyy and several mission members will leave for
Macedonia on Sunday to start work first. The remaining members are
scheduled to arrive in the former Yugoslav republic late this month.</P>
      <P>Lo said the ICDF has decided to post the mission in Macedonia
after ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu visited Macedonia in early March,
during hwich time Hu signed a memorandum on bilateral economic
cooperation with his Macedonian counterpart.</P>
      <P>The mission is expected to help Macedonia map out a comprehensive
export promotion program and set up a one-stop investment service
system and an investment promotion center, Lo said, adding that ROC
experts will also assist Macedonia in SME and agricultural
development.</P>
      <P>Lo said the mission's top purpose at the moment is to help
Macedonia increase job opportunities. Macedonia has been troubled by
its huge unemployed population, caused partly by its loss of the
former Yugoslav federal market.</P>
      <P>The mission will also help Taiwan companies intending to invest
in Macedonia find suitable joint-venture partners or investment
opportunities.</P>
      <P>According to the memorandum signed by Hu, Taiwan agreed to offer
loans to Macedonian SME operators and farmers in launching new
investment projects or expanding their current operations.</P>
      <P>Lo said the ICDF has approved a loan application by Macedonians
to open a bakery in the Macedonian capital of Skopje. A formal loan
agreement will be signed in the near future.</P>
      <P>In the future, Lo said the ICDF may also dispatch experts in
other fields to Macedonia to assist in its overall economic
development.</P>
      <P>The ICDF technical mission will stay in Macedonia until June
2002. After the agreement expires, the two countries will make an
overall review and decide whether to continue such cooperation, Lo
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOS ALAMOS LAB'S  SECURITY IS TIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Security at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, America's largest nuclear weapons facility, sometimes
seems straight from a Hollywood thriller, according to a report in
the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The report says that the suspected efforts by mainland China and
others to obtain data has put US researchers under the microscope.</P>
      <P>The report mentions security details such as secure phones and
special conference rooms rigged to jam electronic eavesdropping.
Heavily guarded walk-in vaults hold top-secret documents.
Fingerprints are scanned outside restricted zones. In some areas,
visitors are followed into rest rooms.</P>
      <P>"Secret Restricted Data" is marked on the 48 linked servers that
comprise Blue Mountain, the world's most powerful computer. Hidden
portals and sensors check people and cars for smuggled nuclear
material. The lab proudly calls its prison-like plutonium storage
site "the most heavily guarded four acres in the US.</P>
      <P>But for all the high-tech hardware used to protect the seven
million classified documents from spies, Los Alamos increasingly is
under attack by critics in Congress and elsewhere who fear security
is left behind when some scientists meet their peers overseas,
especially in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"The toughest problem is dealing with what's in someone's mind,
not with protecting classified documents in a file in the lab," said
John C. Brown, director of Los Alamos. "I don't know how you can have
one hundred percent guarantees."</P>
      <P>That's the challenge the FBI, CIA and other US agencies face as
they investigate whether Los Alamos computer scientist Wen Ho Lee
passed along nuclear weapon design data in the 1980's to help
mainland China build smaller, more powerful nuclear warheads
suspiciously similar to the W-88 warheads that are aboard US Trident
submarines. If true, the leak would be a major blow to US security.</P>

      <P>Following an economic aid package of US$2
million last week, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced
on Friday that it will organize delegations to send another aid
package to Macedonia to help the country settle ethnic Albanian
refugees.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsiang-pu, and Andrew L. Y. Hsia, the respective heads of the
European Affairs Department and the International Organizations
Department, said at a news conference following a meeting that MOFA,
in conjunction with 17 civic charity groups, will send assistance and

      <P>Citing information dispatched by the ROC embassy in Skopje, Liu
said that around 40,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have fled Kosovo, a
province in neighboring Yugoslavia, due to a genocide campaign being
conducted against them, to Macedonia. "What they need most at present
is clothing and food," he noted.</P>
      <P>Hsia said MOFA encouraged the private sector to do their best to
cooperate with the government in the move, and added that the
ministry will call a meeting next week to decide the appropriate time
to send the relief material to the Balkan state.</P>
      <P>Several groups, Hsia said, have revealed the amount of their
donations. "Although they are not large amounts, the money represents
the love and concern from the people of Taiwan," he noted.</P>
      <P>Hsia added that MOFA, following the proposal of the three
legislators, will also study the feasibility of helping the private
sector set up an institutionalized body to coordinate efforts in

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
informed its mainland Chinese counterpart on Friday that it will send
a vice secretary-general in late April to continue talks in
preparation for the visit by Wang Daohan, mainland China's top envoy,
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), SEF said it will dispatch Jan Jyh-horng to
the mainland late this month to continue bilateral talks to clear the
way for ARATS Chairman Wang's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>SEF said that its legal service personnel will accompany Jan to
the mainland, in the hope of resuming bilateral talks on technical
issues such as the repatriation of mainland Chinese hijackers and
illegal immigrants. SEF expressed the desire of being able to
conclude negotiations with ARATS on technical issues in order to
buttress the significance of Wang's autumn visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jan's planned mainland visit comes after his ARATS counterpart --
Li Yafei -- visited Taiwan in mid March. Jan and Li reached agreement
during their March meeting that Wang would visit the island this
autumn to reciprocate a landmark visit by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu to
the mainland last October.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations authorized by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to deal with bilateral exchanges in
the absence of formal contacts.</P>
      <P>Systematic SEF-ARATS talks were unilaterally suspended by Beijing
in 1995 after President Lee Teng-hui paid an unofficial visit to the
United States earlier that year. Beijing viewed Lee's US trip as a
covert move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL WORK TO EASE US TRADE FRICTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang, minister of economic
affairs said on Friday that Taiwan will continue negotiations with
Washington to ease trade friction amid reports that Washington faults
Taiwan's trade practices.</P>
      <P>Given the United States is one of Taiwan's biggest trade
partners, Wang said that Taipei will try to iron out trade disputes
with Washington via dialogue in hopes that Washington will not list
the island as one of those countries closely monitored by Washington
for possible sanctions under the Special 301 provisions of the 1989
US Omnibus Trade Acts.</P>
      <P>In its annual report, the office of US Trade Representative
(USTR) faults Taiwan for what it called Taiwan's incomprehensible
protection of intellectual property, discrimination against US firms
in government procurement procedures, and Taiwan's import policy.</P>
      <P>Citing several legal wrangles involving US patent rights in
Taiwan, the report blamed Taiwan's judiciary system for failing to do
justice to US firms when their intellectual rights were violated.</P>
      <P>The report, which covers 51 US trade partners, also blamed
Taiwan's government procurement process which they said unfairly shut
out US firms by imposing unnecessarily strict requirements on
would-be bidders.</P>
      <P>The USTR is expected to release on April 30 a list of countries
that require close monitoring and could be subject to trade sanctions
if they fail to address US concerns.</P>
      <P>Vowing to beef up trade dialogue with Washington, Wang said he
was confident that Taiwan, which has been on and off the list many
times but has avoided sanctions for several years, will not receive a
status worse than "special monitored country" as it did last
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Y2K JOKE FOOLS EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore, April 2 (CNA): The April Fools' Day joke in Thursday's
The Straits Times, about a teenager who had discovered how to solve
the Y2K problem, was so convincing that it drew calls from
journalists and computer specialists.</P>
      <P>A journalist from Channel News Asia telephoned to ask for the
youth's contact number, saying she had read that the teenager in
question was "camera-shy", but perhaps he could be "persuaded to go
on air".</P>
      <P>When told the story was a joke, she laughed and said she had
thought another Straits Times report, about university graduates
"speaking for their supper", had been the hoax.</P>
      <P>The article said the student, Jack Hon Si Yue, 17, had stumbled
on the code that would solve the Y2K problem while working out the
solution to an algebra problem.</P>
      <P>The Y2K problem arises from computer chips' inability to
distinguish between the years 2000 and 1900.</P>
      <P>A few computer specialists called to verify the story, and when
told it was the paper's April Fools' Day joke, one complained that it
was misleading to firms desperate for Y2K solutions.</P>
      <P>Senior correspondent Chua Mui Hoong, who wrote the story, said,
"I wanted a story that was incredible but plausible - straining
credibility, yet sounded convincing. The idea of a story on the Y2K
problem came in a flash at 10 p.m. and I wrote it up."</P>
      <P>Alert readers would have spotted the clues written in to give the
game away.</P>
      <P>The main ones: Jack's name, Si Yue, means "April" in Chinese,
while the name of the company, Polo Flari, is an anagram for April
Fool. Also, there is no IT consulting company called Gardner, but
there is one called Gartner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another reader telephoned to say that her aunt, a
computer novice who had signed up for computer classes, had also come
up with a solution.</P>
      <P>Alas, her message on the answering machine was deleted, along
with her contact number, so The Straits Times has not found out if
there is really a solution out there to the dreaded bug.</P>
      <P>Or could the phone call also have been an April Fools' Day joke?

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD SEEK COMMITMENT FROM ZHU RONGJI: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration should seek
a commitment from Premier Zhu Rongji during his upcoming visit to the
United States that mainland China will renounce the use of force
against Taiwan, an American China expert said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Stephen J. Yates, senior policy analyst for the Asian Studies
Center at The Heritage Foundation, said the Clinton administration
should also convince Beijing of the need to support Taiwan's bid to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>"This gesture would build confidence in the cross-strait
relationship. Because the WTO does not require sovereignty for
membership, this would not violate China's opposition to Taiwan's
membership in state-based international organizations," said the
analyst.</P>
      <P>In meeting with Zhu, Yates added, President Bill Clinton should
also "praise Taiwan's example of successful democratization that has
produced greater stability through increased political and economic
freedom."</P>
      <P>He said Zhu's priority during his visit to Washington next week
will be promoting Beijing's membership in the WTO.</P>
      <P>However, according to Yates, instead of trying to make deals on
subjects like the WTO, the Clinton administration should seek
Beijing's cooperation in matters of importance to US security.</P>
      <P>For example, the administration should make clear its resolve to
develop an effective missile defense system, emphasizing that
deployment of such a system to protect innocent civilians against
missile attack "cannot legitimately be considered a threat to China's
security."</P>
      <P>In addition to seeking a commitment from Zhu that the PRC will
renounce the use of force against Taiwan, the administration should
also seek mainland China's commitment to use its diplomatic leverage
to encourage positive changes in North Korea's military, diplomatic,
or domestic behavior, Yates said.</P>
      <P>President Bill Clinton should insist that mainland China
demonstrate market-opening reforms before agreeing to support its
entry into the WTO, and should hold mainland China to the letter and
spirit of its international human rights commitments, he added.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the United States has great interest in
deterring aggression and promoting freedom throughout Asia. But to
advance these goals, the Clinton administration needs to see results.
Actions speak louder than words, and "fresh promises from China are
no substitute for real reform." Unfortunately, he went on, Clinton's
China policy emphasizes cooperation over results.</P>
      <P>Yates concluded that the forthcoming summit offers Clinton an
opportunity to adjust course by insisting that mainland China's
reforms come before its reward -- membership in the WTO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Y2K HAZARD MAY BEGIN AS EARLY AS APRIL 9, DGBAS WARNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The year 2000 computer problem may attack
computers much earlier than the originally estimated date of Jan. 1,
2000, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) warned on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Millennium Bug, also known as Y2K, may attack as early as
April 9, when internal computer clocks and chipsets show the numeral
9999. According to the dating system used in some old computer
systems, April 9 is displayed as the 99th day of 1999, according to
DGBAS officials.</P>
      <P>However, 9999, the highest four-digit number, is also often used
to represent certain special codes, such as a calculation error,
which may lead some older computer systems to crash or display faulty
data, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS lists 12 other dates that computer systems may also run
into problems with, such as Sept. 9, 1999, when calendars will also
display 9999 in many computer programming data; Dec. 31, 1999, the
last day of the year; and Jan. 1, 2000, the first day of the new
year.</P>
      <P>Others include Jan. 3, 2000, the first day of work for most
businesses in the new year; Jan. 10, 2000, when a seven-digit date
(1/10/2000) will crop up for the first time in the new year.</P>
      <P>The remaining dates that are also potentially risky include Jan.
31, 2000, the last day of the first month of 2000; Feb. 29, 2000, the
extra day in a leap year; March 31, 2000, the last day of the first
quarter of 2000; Oct. 10, 2000, when an eight-digit date (10/10/2000)
will show up for the first time in the year; Dec. 31, 2000, the last
day of the year; Jan. 1, 2001, the first day of the 21st century; and
Dec. 31, 2001, the date when the operations of the past 365 days will
be checked, the DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Director-General Wei Duan gave an assurance that all
government and public sectors, including power, water supply,
telecommunications, transportation, finance, taxation, customs system
and law-enforcement administration sectors, should be Y2K-compliant
before June 30.</P>
      <P>He added that people affected by government inefficiency as a
result of poor preparedness for the Y2K crisis will be able apply for
compensation from the government.</P>
      <P>Businesses and operations in the private sector will also be held
accountable if they cause trouble or inflict losses on the public
because of failure to tackle the Y2K problem in advance, he noted.</P>
      <P>Wei estimated that the biggest impact of Y2K in Taiwan will be
seen in the banking, stock exchange, telecommunications, and medical
service sectors.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,   April  2  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait and Asia-Pacific
security is of mutual concern to both Japan and Taiwan, former Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian told reporters on Friday night.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a three-day private
visit, said that he met with some Japanese VIPs during his visit, but
he declined to reveal their names.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Japanese Diet, or parliament, is currently
screening a domestic bill in accordance with the guidelines set out
for US-Japan defensive cooperation.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Japan's ambiguous stance regarding "matters
surrounding Japanese territory," which are included in the
guidelines, Chen said that after meeting with Japanese officials, he
understands the necessity for Japan to adopt this attitude.</P>
      <P>Beijing has protested to Japan over the possibility that the
guidelines will include Taiwan in the proposed defensive system,
known as Theater Missile Defense (TMD), describing any inclusion of
the island in such a defense system as "interference in Chinese
sovereignty."</P>
      <P>The stalwart of the Republic of China's major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party stressed the necessity for both sides of
the Taiwan Strait to establish a mechanism for dialogue on military
mutual trust.</P>
      <P>He also indicated that Taiwan's inclusion in the TMD system would
not contradict the establishment of the dialogue mechanism, because
the establishment of such a mechanism would pacify Beijing as to
Taiwan's intentions.</P>
      <P>Chen said that through his visit, he has come to understand that
many Japanese people think that what Japan has provided mainland
China in the past has been based on the "sunshine policy," for
example, providing mainland China with large amounts of economic
assistance.</P>
      <P>However, they now think Japan should also have a "north wind
policy" with regard to mainland China, such as the TMD system and the
long established US-Japan Safety Treaty, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen disputed media reports that President Lee Teng-hui thinks
that Chen is the best successor for the presidency of the ROC in
2000, saying that it is not possible for a leader of a political
party to support a possible candidate of another political party,
especially since he has not yet even decided whether or not to run in
the election.</P>
      <P>Chen praised Lee for his contributions to the reform of the ROC's
democratic politics. Turning to Japan's refusal to allow Lee to visit
Japan and attend an alumni meeting at his Japanese alma mater for
fear of offending Beijing, he urged Japan to "just say no" to Beijing
in order not to let down the many people who want Lee to visit Japan.</P>

      <P>Touting the Republic of China as a state
which enjoys a well-established democracy, President Lee Teng-hui
said on Saturday that he does not expect to see many changes in
national policy after his retirement in 2000.</P>
      <P>Lee told visiting US Senator Craig Thomas, chairman of the Asian

Representative Greg Walden, that Taiwan is a country ruled by law
rather than by the personal whims of its leaders. He added that he is
not worried about his policies being changed by his successors.</P>
      <P>Now that the ROC's political reforms are taking root, Lee said,
the government is pushing for reforms in education, the judiciary,
administration, and in the spirit of the people, all of which will in
return consolidate the country's democratic development.</P>
      <P>When his guests, who visited Beijing before coming to Taiwan,
told him that Taiwan's participation in the US-led Theater Missile
Defense system is of great concern to Beijing, Lee pointed out that
Taiwan is more concerned about its safety and security than about
Beijing's worries.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that peace, stability and narrowing differences
through dialogue and exchanges are the supreme goals pursued by
Taiwan is its ties with mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ORNITHOLOGISTS TRACK BLACK-FACED SPOONBILL MIGRATION ROUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mystery surrounding the migration route
of the rare black-faced spoonbill was solved on Saturday when the
Taipei-based Chinese Wild Bird Federation (CWBF) unveiled the results
of its attempts to track the birds using satellites.</P>
      <P>The federation and the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
held a joint news conference to release a report which details the
north-bound flight path of a selected black-faced spoonbill.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the bird, known by its nickname
"Turtle," flew directly to mainland China's southeastern coastal
provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang after leaving a coastal area near
Taiwan's southwestern town of Chiku on March 14. After a brief
stopover there, it continued its journey to Jiangsu and finally
reached its breeding ground near the North Korean city of Haeju, a
city some 121 km northwest of Seoul.</P>
      <P>"This is the world's first comprehensive satellite tracking
report on the black-faced spoonbill's migratory route," said Chen
Hsi-chou, a COA department chief.</P>
      <P>Under a plan to study one of the world's rarest bird species, the
CWBF has installed transmitters on four selected birds, and all four
are transmitting signals.</P>
      <P>CWBF President Kuo Cheng-yu said another of the birds, nicknamed
Discoverer, has been wandering around the northern coastal region of
Hsinchu since leaving Tainan in the island's south on March 19. "The
bird appears to be getting ready to migrate northward," Kuo noted.</P>
      <P>Kuo said there are only some 613 black-faced spoonbills left in
the world, and added: "More than half of these surviving birds, or
about 363, tend to fly to Taiwan in autumn or winter to avoid the
frigid cold in their northern breeding grounds."</P>
      <P>As a result, Kuo said, Taiwan has emerged as one of the world's
most important black-faced spoonbill study centers.</P>
      <P>"The tracking of their migratory route is the first step in
exploring the species' habitat and its reproduction situation," Kuo
said, adding that such knowledge is expected to help work out
effective ways to protect the species.</P>
      <P>The black-faced spoonbill migratory route study project is
jointly initiated and carried out by the Bird Life International and
several Asian countries, including the Republic of China, Japan and
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the CWBF will continue working on the research project
to gain a better understanding of the rare species' living and
reproduction patterns as well as other related issues.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew urged Washington to
stick with its commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide
Taiwan with the arms necessary for it to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Noting that hundreds of missiles have been deployed by Beijing
along its coast across the Taiwan Strait, Siew told visiting US Sen.
Craig Thomas and Rep. Greg Walden that Washington should not
compromise a promise made to Taiwan in 1982 that it would not consult
Beijing on possible arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew also said Washington should not give in to demands by
Beijing that Taiwan be excluded from the US-proposed Theater Missile
Defense (TMD) system.</P>
      <P>Washington should take the security of the entire Asia-Pacific
region into consideration and provide Taiwan the option of joining
the missile defense program, he said.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's bid for membership in the World Trade Organization
(WTO), Siew noted that Taiwan has completed all necessary bilateral
negotiations. Siew said he hoped Taiwan's application would be judged
on its own merits and that the island's entry would not be postponed
until mainland China is admitted into the body.</P>
      <P>He thanked Sen. Thomas for sponsoring a resolution that calls for
US support for Taiwan's participation in international organizations.</P>
      <P>Thomas and Walden, who arrived in Taipei after a visit to Beijing
and Hong Kong, were accompanied by Vice Foreign Minister David Lee at
Saturday's meeting with Siew.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG CITY DETERMINED TO INTRODUCE LOTTERIES THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung will reintroduce public lotteries
later this year, despite the absence of consensus between the central
government and local governments around the island on the issue, a
city government official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wei Yao-chien, deputy secretary-general of the government of the
southern port city, said the lottery, in the form of scratch-cards,
will be introduced in Kaohsiung in August this year at the earliest,
and the proceeds used to finance public welfare projects.</P>
      <P>Wei was among a group of officials from the municipalities of
Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan Province, and 21 other cities and
counties around the island who were invited by the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) to a meeting on Saturday to discuss principally how
revenues generated from the officially sanctioned lotteries should be
distributed.</P>
      <P>The official from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)-governed city said that according to the revised statutes
governing lotteries and related financial programs, the central
government, or more directly, the MOF, does not have the right to
introduce, or authorize the introduction of, public lotteries.</P>
      <P>Wei blasted as "rubbish" a statement by a top Cabinet official
that the MOF will reintroduce lotteries so that the national coffers
can be augmented in order to fund the proposed national pension
program.</P>
      <P>He urged the central government not to use the national pension
as an excuse for stealing the right of local governments to introduce
lotteries.</P>
      <P>The MOF drew up regulations on official lotteries in 1995, but
has yet to put them into practice. At that time, it was estimated
that lottery profits could be as high as NT$20 billion (US$606
million) per year.</P>
      <P>The MOF said recently that it has reached an agreement with city
and county governments over relevant rules and distribution of funds
generated from lotteries. Technically, it said, the first public
lotteries will begin next year, with three different lottery schemes
being organized by the Bank of Taiwan, the Taipei Bank and the
Kaohsiung Bank, respectively.</P>
      <P>MOF statistics also showed that funds expected to be generated
from the officially sanctioned lotteries will be roughly 1 percent of
Taiwan's GDP, or NT$85 billion. Seventy-five percent of this will be
used for prizes, while another 10 percent used to cover
administration and marketing costs, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>All lotteries in Taiwan were banned in 1988 in an effort to
discourage gambling and speculation, but two years later, the
relevant statutes were revised so as to permit the introduction of
lotteries by Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, as well as by the Taiwan
provincial government.</P>
      <P>In 1990, Taipei City launched a single-lottery scheme but
suspended it after just three months. The short-lived lottery
resulted in revenue of about NT$900 million for the city government,
and provided jobs for the physically challenged.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A list of medical equipment that is not Y2K
compliant will be published in June, and any equipment on that list
that is not fixed by November cannot be used after that point, the
Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a survey of computer-controlled medical equipment used around
the island, more than 70 machines -- about one-fourth of the
approximately 290 included in the survey -- are incapable of
recognizing the year 2000, and this could result in incorrect
diagnoses and cause harm to patients, said the DOH.</P>
      <P>Many of the computers in use today recognize years by only their
last two digits. As a result these machines may mistake 2000 for
1900. This could cause systems to operate incorrectly or to crash

      <P>It is doubtful that the 2000 Olympic

artificial hormones unless the International Olympic Committee (IOC)

according to a British medical researcher.</P>

growth hormones by Olympic athletes, said current tests can be
applied only to white males, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>The IOC and the European Union have previously provided funding
to the research team, which is aiming to devise a test to detect
synthetic human growth hormone (hGH) abuse in athletes.</P>

traditional drug tests, as the hormone is indistinguishable from
naturally occurring human growth hormones.</P>

      <P>In an attempt to stem drug smuggling, the

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO BE PRAGMATIC ON 'DESIGNATION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior ROC official on Saturday urged
Beijing to adopt a pragmatic attitude toward engagements between
Taiwan and Macau after the Portuguese colony reverts to mainland
China's rule late this year.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), made the appeal at the opening session of a
two-day seminar on Taiwan-Macau relations.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Republic of China is hopeful that its current
commercial exchanges and airlinks with Macau as well as its
representative office there will remain unchanged after the colony's
handover on Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>"We also hope mainland leaders will not make too much fuss over
'label' or designation issues," Lin said, adding that mainland
authorities should deal with Taiwan-Macau engagements in a pragmatic
manner and based on a reciprocal, "win-win" principle.</P>
      <P>The existing ROC representative office in Macau is named "the
Taipei Trade and Tourism Office, Macau." Beijing authorities
reportedly want the word "office" to be changed after Macau's
handover.</P>
      <P>Lin said he hopes mainland China will not insist on a change to
the ROC representative office's designation. "It is meaningless to
make a fuss over such a superficial issue," he remarked.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that Taipei has expressed its stance on
issues related to the designation of its representative office in
Macau.</P>
      <P>Lin said in preparation for Macau's handover, the ROC government
has legislated a statue governing exchanges with post-handover
Macau.</P>
      <P>The mainland affairs expert-turned-technocrat said the MAC's
Macau Affairs Bureau will start operations on the same day of Macau's
handover to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that Taiwan and Macau have maintained
mutually beneficial relations based on the principle of reciprocity.
Two-way trade reached US$360 million in 1998, with Taiwan enjoying a
trade surplus of US$270 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said, Taiwan people made 820,000 visits to Macau
last year, making Taiwan Macau's second largest source of tourists,
second only to mainland China. The number of Taiwan-Macau flights now
accounts for 55.77 percent of Macau's total air traffic volume.
Moreover, more than 5,000 Macau residents have studied at various
Taiwan universities or colleges over the past few years. The number
of Macau residents who regularly work in Taiwan ranges between 15,000
to 20,000.</P>
      <P>"All these figures point to the ever closer relationship
between Taiwan and Macau," Lin noted, adding that the ROC looks
forward to seeing continued growth in Taiwan-Macau exchanges
even after Beijing reclaims the colony.</P>
      <P>More than 60 scholars and experts from Taiwan and Macau are
participating in the seminar being held at Taipei Fortuna Hotel. A
total of 25 papers on Taiwan-Macau-Hong-Kong-Beijing relations as
well as various problems facing Macau will be discussed during the
two-day seminar.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GENERATION-X WOMEN SAY LEE, LIEN UNCONCERNED OVER WOMEN'S ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most women in the so-called X generation do
not support President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President Lien Chan, but
that does not mean that Lien would have difficulty winning the 2000
presidential election, the results of a poll conducted by the
opposition New Party showed.</P>
      <P>The poll of women aged above 20 found that 70 percent of women
voters aged between 20 and 29 do not think President Lee Teng-hui is
concerned about the issues that most affect women in Taiwan, and 46
have the same opinion about Vice President Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Even among many women 30 and older, the president and vice
president are seen as being unconcerned with women's issues, as 46.4
percent said Lee is either "very unconcerned" or "unconcerned" about
women's problems, while only 22.1 percent said he is concerned. Lien
fared little better, as 43.5 percent of women 30 and older said he
does not care about women's problems, while 25 percent said he does.</P>
      <P>Although Lien -- the ruling Kuomintang's most likely presidential
candidate -- is far less popular among generation-X women than among
women above that age group, it is not at all certain that he would
have trouble winning the election, said Chen Sheng, a New Party
deputy at the National Assembly who oversaw the poll.</P>
      <P>Far fewer generation-X women vote than do women above that age
group, which means the female generation-X vote will not be a
significant factor in the next election, Chen said.</P>
      <P>If Lien wins the support of women 30 and older, he could easily
beat rival candidates from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party or those who run as independents, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The same poll found that 62.7 percent of respondents said they
choose candidates based on their personalities and character rather
than on their political party affiliation, and only 3.8 of
respondents said a candidate's party membership is a decisive factor
when deciding who to vote for.</P>
      <P>Chen said this finding may be of interest to those thinking of
running in next year's election as independents.</P>
      <P>Although has yet formally announced his candidacy, former Taiwan
Provincial Governor James Soong is thought to be considering running
as an independent.</P>
      <P>As for the appeal of a man and woman running on the same ticket,
22.6 percent of respondents said such a ticket stands a chance of
winning, while 33.6 percent said the ticket would not stand a chance.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted via telephone between April 1 and 2, was
based on surveys of 1,018 women voters aged above 20 and has a margin
of error of 3.1 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXTENDING TENURE OF PRESIDENCY CANNOT BE DONE RECKLESSLY: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to talk about revising the
constitution to extend by one year the tenure of the current
president of the Republic of China, the general-secretary of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said the issue cannot be handled recklessly.</P>
      <P>John Chang noted that issue is sensitive and that the KMT has
been addressing it in an "extremely cautious" manner.</P>
      <P>The extension would come as part of a plan to combine
presidental, legislative and National Assembly elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT is now preparing to make some revisions to the ROC
constitution, said Chang, although he added that before such
revisions are made there should be a consensus not only within the
KMT but among all major political parties.</P>
      <P>Chang said the amendments being considered by the ruling party
include ones to extend the term of office of legislators and ones
that would change the rights and responsibilities of the National
Assembly.</P>
      <P>Many scholars in Taiwan have said that after legislators' terms
are extended, amendments should focus on the combination of
separately held elections for various levels of government.</P>
      <P>Scholars have said elections for president, the legislature and
the National Assembly should be held at the same time, while
local-level elections -- such as those for mayor of Taiwan's special
municipalities, county magistrates and speakers of city and county
councils -- should be held at the same time as well.</P>
      <P>Such combination would be an improvement over the current
situation, in which elections of some sort are held nearly ever year
and which exacts a toll on society, scholars have said.</P>
      <P>But if such combination were to take place, the current
president's term would need to be extended by one year, Chang said
cautiously. To date, Chang admitted, promoting election combination
has been difficult.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT holds a majority in the National Assembly, it
does not have enough seats to pass constitutional amendments without
support from opposition parties, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that he will meet the speaker of National Assembly
and the president of the Legislative Yuan next Tuesday, to determine
the future direction of this issue.</P>
      <P>The KMT will do its best to understand public opinion regarding
constitutional changes before promoting the project, stressed Chang.</P>

      <P>The survey further found that local fathers generally spent less
time with their children than mothers. Only 31.61 percent of fathers
interviewed said they spent more than three hours a day with their
kids, compared to 66.19 percent recorded with local mothers.
Meanwhile, 57.84 percent of working mothers surveyed said they spent
over three hours with their children a day.</P>
      <P>Another disappointing finding was that 80.91 percent of parents
interviewed said most of the time they spent with their children
was used to watch television. Only 10-to-20 percent said they would
join with their chidden in athletic or video games or other
recreational activities; 26.76 percent said they usually accompanied
their children in doing homework, taking a walk or shopping.</P>
      <P>Survey results also showed that only 30 percent of local parents
would give their children aged between six and 12 corporeal
punishment, while 80.81 percent said they usually would only give
their children pep talks or advice when they do something wrong.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, parents with only elementary education
are more likely to resort to corporeal punishment, while those with
college or even higher-level education seldom use violent means to
punish their children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG DAN URGES MAINLAND CHINA TO STOP THREATENING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At the conclusion of a weeklong visit to
Taiwan, prominent mainland Chinese dissident Wang Dan on Sunday urged
Beijing to abandon threatening Taiwan with military aggression.</P>
      <P>Wang Dan, at a farewell media conference, said that the problems
between Taiwan and the mainland, instead of being solved by Taiwan's
ruling Kuomintang or mainland's communist regime, should be left to
the people to work out.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Beijing should take the lead in constructing a
harmonious political atmosphere between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to pave the way for two-way communication. "Beijing should
follow the global trend of adopting peaceful methods, not force, to
solve problems," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang said that visits to Taipei and Taichung made him realize how
energetic and urbanized Taiwan society was. The fact that the people
here are very concerned about future development on the mainland
also impressed him.</P>
      <P>Wang regretted that the short length of the trip did not permit
time to observe and understand the transition that had occurred in
Taiwan's upper society, including how the ruling and opposition
parties perform. He hoped he would be granted another opportunity to
visit Taiwan so as to understand more.</P>
      <P>Wang said that democracy movements had prospered on Taiwan due
largely to the efforts made by the island's intellectuals in
transforming Taiwan from a dictatorial regime into a democracy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democracy experiment of forwarding pragmatic suggestions
for political reform to the government is a good example for
intellectuals on the mainland to follow, said Wang Dan.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the people here are enthusiastic about
politics, yet the people in a mature democracy, such as the United
States, do not devote themselves so much to politics. He therefore
considered Taiwan as still undergoing a political transition and
predicted that more political transformations will take place in the
future.</P>
      <P>Wang Dan urged the winner of Taiwan's 2000 presidential election
to handle the problems between Taiwan and the mainland peacefully and
reasonably.

      <P>Former ROC Premier Hau Pei-tsun on
Sunday paid respect to the Founder of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, at his tomb in Nanjing, the capital of mainland China's
Jiangsu province.</P>
      <P>Praising Sun as a patriot and a great statesman, Hau said Sun,
who founded the ROC 88 years ago, is admired by the people both in
Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The former premier also visited a local museum set up to
commemorate the Nanjing Massacre in 1937. More than 300,000 civilians
were killed by occupying Japanese troops in the tragedy, a
major incident marking the start of the Eight-Year War of Resistance
Against Japan.</P>
      <P>Hau is slated to travel to Yancheng, his hometown in central

said that Hau's plan to meet Association for Relations Across the

      <P>ARATS is a semi-official organization authorized by Beijing to
deal with bilateral exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal

    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan businessmen scramble to invest
in Vietnam amid the nation's all-out, post-war economic development
efforts, Taiwan businessmen wishing to invest there still face risks,
Taiwan businessmen said Sunday at an investment seminar aimed at
encouraging Taiwan investment in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The seminar was held by the Kaohsiung office of the China
External Trade Development Council (CETRA).</P>
      <P>The Republic of China is Vietnam's largest foreign investor, as
Taiwan businessmen have invested a total of US$3 billion there.
Bilateral economic and trade relations have been growing steadily as
well.</P>
      <P>But some Taiwan businessmen said Vietnam's infrastructure --
including its electrical, transportation and communications systems
-- is insufficient. They also said that regulations governing
investment and trade are inadequate and that some localities are
governed by the rule-of-man instead of the rule-of-law.</P>
      <P>With an area of 331,000 square kilometers, Vietnam lies in the
eastern portion of the Indochina peninsula. Hanoi, Hai Phong, Ho Chi
Minh City and Towrane are its main industrial and commercial centers.</P>
      <P>The country's main products include crude oil, timber, rubber and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang left for
Jakarta on Monday to attend an annual ministerial-level energy
meeting between the Republic of China and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Wang said prior to his departure that the ROC must maintain
friendly relations with Indonesia as the Southeast Asian country is
a major source of its energy supplies.</P>
      <P>At present, Indonesia accounts for 30 percent of Taiwan's
total coal imports and 60 percent of its petroleum gas
imports. In 1998, Taiwan also imported 100 million metric tons of
crude oil from that country.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will take advantage of the annual meeting to
explore possible cooperative projects with Indonesia in energy and
other related economic fields.</P>
      <P>A delegation of economics officials and senior executives from
state-owned enterprises, including Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) and
Chinese Petroleum Corp., will also take part in the four-day meeting
that began on Monday and will run through Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang said Taipower will sign a technological cooperative
agreement with its Indonesian counterpart during the the annual
conference. "The deal is not only aimed at helping Indonesia upgrade
its energy technology but is also expected to stabilize our energy
supplies," he noted.</P>
      <P>The minister went on to say that Taiwan entrepreneurs have
poured more than US$13.5 billion for various investment projects in
Indonesia in the past few years, making Taiwan Indonesia's sixth
largest foreign investor.</P>
      <P>As Indonesia's political and economic situation changed
dramatically in the past couple of years, Wang said he is concerned
about Taiwan investors' operations there.</P>
      <P>"I'll meet with senior executives and rank-and-file members of
the Taiwanese chamber of commerce in Indonesia to collect first-hand
information about the problems or difficulties facing our investors
there," Wang said.</P>
      <P>In addition to conveying Taiwan business people's opinion or
their plight to the Indonesian government, Wang said he will also
ask relevant Indonesian authorities to take effective measures to
protect Taiwan investors' personal safety and their legitimate
rights and interests.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties,
substantive ROC-Indonesian relations have been close. Two-way trade
amounted to US$3.15 billion in 1998, with Taiwan suffering a deficit
of US$1.5 billion, a result of the island's large energy imports
from Indonesia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND DISSIDENT BARRED FROM RETURNING HOME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, April 5 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese pro-democracy dissident
Wang Xizhe was prevented from returning to Beijing from his exile in
the United States and instead had to take a flight to Bangkok,
Thailand to wait for a second chance to return home.</P>
      <P>An official of the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said that Wang, who boarded an Asiana
Airline flight from New York Saturday evening, had planned to arrive
in Beijing via Seoul, South Korea, on Monday.</P>
      <P>The official said the Asiana office in Seoul had refused to let
Wang board the flight for Beijing Monday morning. He quoted sources
as saying that Beijing had warned the airline that if Wang was
allowed to board the plane, it would have to bear all consequences.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed his displeasure to the Asiana Airline for
depriving him of the right to return home, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official added that four dissidents who had planned to meet
Wang at Beijing airport were taken away by police.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former factory worker, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison for what the Beijing authorities called
"counter-revolutionary" activities, but was released two years early
in 1993. He has since been jailed periodically for parole violations.</P>
      <P>Wang, who fled to the United States in Oct. 1996, had planned to
return home to go to his father's tomb, who died in February of this
year, for Tomb-Sweeping Day, the traditional day for the Chinese to
pay respects to their ancestors and clean the environment around
their tombs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN ENGINEERS SEE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM WITH BOEING 737S</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian engineers have identified a
structural problem with Boeing 737 jets, saying it can seriously
compromise safety, and both Ansett Australia and Qantas Airways are
inspecting their aircraft to ensure that they are safe.</P>
      <P>The Australian on Monday quoted engineers from the Civil Aviation
Safety Authority (CASA) as warning of the landing gear defect --
which can damage control cables, structural components and hydraulic
lines -- to Australian operators, the manufacturer and the US Federal
Aviation Administration.</P>
      <P>CASA has also issued an urgent air worthiness directive calling
for major inspections of Australian aircraft.</P>
      <P>CASA said the Boeing 737 is one of the world's most popular
airliners with almost 3,000 in service worldwide and more than 60
operating in Australia, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>It said the defect came to light after the crew of an Ansett
737-300, traveling from Launceston in Tasmania to Melbourne in
Victoria last March, heard a loud thump when they extended the
landing gear.</P>
      <P>The plane landed without incident, and a brief inspection failed
to reveal the cause of the thump. Nonetheless, Ansett, the second
largest airline operator in Australia, removed the aircraft from
service. A more detailed inspection revealed that a component in the
right landing gear, called the actuator beam arm, had fractured.</P>
      <P>Qantas is also investigating its fleet of Boeing 737s, according
to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, which subsequently found
the fractures were due to a combination of stress and corrosion.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou used a visit to
150 elderly single veterans in Taipei on Monday to say the government
should strengthen its care of elderly men.</P>
      <P>Braving drizzle on the Chinese traditional Tomb-Sweeping Day,
Mayor Ma arrived at the veterans' residence at Fang Lan mountain

      <P>Ma was warmly greeted by the veterans upon his arrival. After
listening to their stories of living conditions and visiting their
facilities, Ma said the government must improve the veterans' living
environment and facilities.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government should formulate a plan to solve how to
care for elderly single veterans and all other elderly men who need
care as soon as possible, because at present, an average of seven to
eight people care for one aged man in the Taiwan area. After 30 years
that average is expected to drop to three people doing the same job
due to an explosion in the aged population. Ma emphasized the
government should attach great importance to the issue.</P>
      <P>In addition to Ma's visit to Fang Lan mountain village, several

    <HEADLINE>EVEN AMID BAD TIMES, GAMBLING CONTINUES IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The economy has plunged into recession,
bonuses have evaporated, salaries have shrunk and more than 29,000
jobs have been lost, but this has not dampened Singaporeans' passion
for gambling.</P>
      <P>They parted with more than S$5.5 billion (US$3.2 billion) last
year on legalized gambling alone.</P>
      <P>But the economic crisis has left its mark. Instead of the hefty
jumps in takings seen in the last few years, growth last year was
negligible.</P>
      <P>Gambling houses took in S$4.2 billion in 1995, S$5 billion in
1996 and S$5.5 billion in 1997, but last year's takings were about
the same as in 1997, judging by the amount of tax on the takings
collected by the government. In 1997 the government collected S$1.26
billion from gambling-related revenue and the same amount last year.</P>
      <P>Singapore's favorite game of chance is 4-D, with last year's
takings topping S$3 billion. Horse racing came second, at more than
S$1 billion.</P>
      <P>Although the economy is not expected to do much better this year,
takings for gambling could swell.</P>
      <P>The government expects people to wager an extra S$250 million
this year on legalized football betting, which began last week.</P>
      <P>That could push spending on gambling this year close to the S$6
billion mark, provided the deadly viral outbreak in Malaysia and
Singapore does not disrupt the horse-racing calendar.</P>
      <P>While local legal gambling appears to be holding its own amid the
current recession, it is less clear how the industry's "gray" market
is faring.</P>
      <P>This market includes the gambling dollars that flow offshore to
casinos in Genting Highlands, Australia and other places, and cruise
ships anchored off Singapore.</P>
      <P>With police action against illegal 4-D syndicates squeezing
"black" money and the recession-induced slide in travel shrinking the
amount of "gray" money being generated, greater growth could be seen
in legal local gambling.</P>

Kai-shek's mausoleum in Tzuhu, Taoyuan county on Monday to mark the
24th anniversary of Chiang's passing.</P>
      <P>President Lee laid a wreath before Chiang's mausoleum and made
three bows to express his tribute to the late national leader. He
then observed a minute of silence and afterwards led all
participating officials in circling the mausoleum in remembrance of
the late president.</P>
      <P>Generalissimo Chiang died on April 5, 1975. April 5 is also the

mausoleum in Touliao, also in Taoyuan county, some 40 kilometers
south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The officials included Vice President Lien Chan, Premier
Vincent Siew, National Assembly Speaker Su Nan-cheng, Legislative

      <P>Braving chilly wind and drizzling rain, many people made
long lines in front of the Tzuhu and Touliao mausoleums for paying
tribute to the two late presidents.</P>
      <P>The pro-unification New Party mobilized more than 500 members
and supporters to visit the two Chiangs' mausoleums. The New Party
group was led by Legislator Lee Ching-hua, convener of the New Party
All-Out Development Commission.</P>
      <P>Some New Party supporters clashed with police because they were

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT HELPS MAINTAIN STABILITY IN W. PACIFIC (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), a unique
law of the United States enacted 20 years ago, is being seen by
officials and scholars of the United States and Taiwan as useful and
important in maintaining peace and stability in the Western Pacific.</P>
      <P>Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
late March that the United States' accomplishments of the TRA was
"very great," and that the United States will continue to honor its
commitment to the security of Taiwan as stated in the act.</P>
      <P>The TRA, which was passed by U.S. Congress in March, 1979 and
signed into law by former President Jimmy Carter on April 10, 1979,
states that it is aimed at helping "maintain peace, security, and
stability in the Western Pacific" and promoting the foreign policy of
the United States by authorizing the continuation of commercial,
cultural, and other relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the TRA was prompted by the Carter
administration's decision to switch diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing on Jan. 1, 1979. It authorized the establishment in
1979 of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), a non-governmental
organization, to take care of US interests in the absence of
diplomatic relations with Taipei.</P>
      <P>It says in Section 2 that it is the policy of the United States
to declare that peace and stability in the Western Pacific area are
"in the political, security, and economic interests of the United
States, and are matters of international concern."</P>
      <P>It adds that it is the policy of the United States to make
clear that the US decision to establish diplomatic relations with
Beijing "rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be
determined by peaceful means."</P>
      <P>"It is the policy of the United States to consider any effort
to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means,
inclusing by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and
security of the Western Pacific area, and of grave concern to the
United States," the TRA says, adding that it is the policy of the
United States to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character
"to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability."</P>
      <P>The act also states that it is the policy of the United States to
maintain its capacity "to resist any resort to force or other forms
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or
economic system, of the people on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Roth said in the Congressional hearing that the United States
continues to insist that the differences between mainland China and
Taiwan be resolved peacefully, and that the US position on this point
was clearly shown in March, 1996, when President Bill Clinton sent
two carrier battle groups to the waters near Taiwan in response to
mainland China's provocative missile-firing tests in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>In a seminar cosponsored by AIT and the Woodrow Wilson Center in
Washington on March 24, Roth also said, "I have no hesitation in
declaring the TRA a resounding success."</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years, the TRA has not only helped to preserve
the substance of US relationship with Taiwan but also contributed to
the conditions which have enabled the United States, mainland China,
and Taiwan "to achieve a great deal more," he added.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Roth said the fact that Washington-Taipei relations are
unofficial has not harmed Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>The TRA stipulates that "the absence of diplomatic relations or
recognition shall not affect the application of the laws of the
United States with respect to Taiwan, and the laws of the United
States shall apply with respect to Taiwan in the manner that the laws
of the United States applied with respect to Taiwan prior to Jan. 1,
1979."</P>
      <P>The act also states that the US Congress approves the
continuation in force of all treaties and other international
agreements, including multilateral conventions, entered into by the
two countries.</P>
      <P>The properties of Taiwan in the United States are also protected
under the act, which stipulates that "Recognition of the People's
Republic of China shall not affect in any way the ownership of or
other rights or interests in properties, tangible and intangible,
and other things of value, owned or held on or prior to Dec. 31,
1978, or thereafter acquired or earned by the governing authorities
on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Roth said that Taiwan's political transformation into democracy
over the past two decades has been profound, and that the shelter of
the TRA, made real by each successive US administration's
commitment to its provisions, helped make this transformation
possible.</P>
      <P>He further said that, although the United States will continue
to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons, "sustained peace does not
rely on military strength but on dialogue and consultations."</P>
      <P>Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security
Affairs Franklin Kramer said in the same Congressional hearing that
"We take our obligations to assist Taiwan in maintaining a
self-defense capability very seriously."</P>
      <P>"We do so not only because it is mandated by US law in the TRA,
but also because it is in our own national interest," he added.</P>
      <P>Roth and Kramer made the remarks in the Congressional hearing on
the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the TRA, which falls on
April 10.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Congressional hearing, the House of
Representatives adopted on March 23 by an overwhelming 429-1 vote
a concurrent resolution, calling on the US government to reaffirm
its commitment to the TRA and specifically to the guarantees that the
United States will provide adequate defensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The resolution also says that the United States should seek from
mainland Chinese leaders a public renunciation of any use of force,
and of the threat to use force, against Taiwan. The Senate Foreign
Relations Committee passed on the same day a similar resolution.The
resolutions also said that it should be US policy, in accordance with
the TRA, to publicly support Taiwan's admission to such world bodies
as the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, said the TRA has been
instrumental in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the
Taiwan Strait since its enactment 20 year ago.</P>
      <P>Fredrick Chien, president of the Control Yuan, also said in a
recent interview with the CNA that the TRA has contributed greatly to
the maintenance of stability in Taiwan and the Western Pacific area.

      <P>Chien was vice foreign minister when Washington broke diplomatic
relations with Taipei. He later served as representative in
Washington of Taiwan's Coordination Council for North American
Affairs (CCNAA), which was the counterpart of AIT.</P>
      <P>He said the TRA has remained unchanged in both content and
importance. "Some people believe the TRA should be amended, but we
believe it is better not to change it," he said.</P>
      <P>Chien, who had served as foreign minister and later president of
the National Assembly before his present post, said the relationship
between the United States and Taiwan is different from US
relationships with any other country, "because our relationship is
regulated by the TRA, a US law."</P>
      <P>It is important now to make all US lawmakers familiar with the
unique character of the US-Taiwan relationship, because 85 percent of
the members of 1979 US Congress have been replaced by new faces,
Chien said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, director general of the Government Information
Office, said recently in an interview with the CNA that the TRA has
enhanced the security and prosperity of Taiwan and the peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was a young diplomat privy to the development of the
legislation at the time in Washington, said that the TRA "displays the
justice-pursuing spirit of US foreign policy," and that it is
unprecedented in the history of international relations and
international law.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the TRA has played a very important role in the
past two decades, and that it has laid a solid foundation for the
development of friendly relations between the United States and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>James Lilley, former US ambassador to mainland China, said in
Washington in early March that, for the past 20 years, the TRA has
been successful in strengthening security relationships between the
United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lilley, who has also served as director of AIT in Taipei, also
said Taiwan still enjoys bipartisan support in US Congress despite
generational changes over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>To help make US lawmakers more familiar with the unique character
of the relationship between the two countries, Taiwan's
representative office in Washington is organizing celebrations to
highlight the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the TRA. One of
them is a cocktail reception to be co-hosted by Stephen Chen,
Taiwan's representative in Washington, and several Congressional
heavyweights on April 13.</P>
      <P>A large-scale seminar on topics concerning the TRA will be
jointly held in Washington on the next day by two prestigious think
tanks-- the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage
Foundation. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee; former AIT chairman David Dean; Sen. Murkowski
(R-Alaska), and Lester L. Wolff, a retired lawmaker who played a key
role in the drafting of the act, are expected to take part in the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that betel nut chewing is
popular in Taiwan, few of those who put "Taiwan's gum" in their
mouths realize the substance is poisonous, the Veterans General
Hospital said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the hospital reported that they have observed at least
10 poisoning cases over the past decade, with one patient dying
before reaching a hospital.</P>
      <P>The doctors reported their findings in the latest medical
publication of the hospital.</P>
      <P>They documented a case of a 42-year-old man, who despite not
regularly chewing betel nuts, developed dizziness, sweating, heart
palpitations, and vomiting after eating a "betel nut king." His
conditions only improved after treatment.</P>
      <P>A betel nut king, has the same appearance as an ordinary betel
nut but with twice as much alkaline. Every betel nut tree produces up
to four betel nut kings.</P>
      <P>Another 21-year-old man, who developed numbness in his limbs,
bulging eyes and lips, was told by physicians that he was not
suffering an allergic reaction to drugs or being inflicted by an
illness. Instead, they determined that his condition was the
result of betel nut chewing.</P>
      <P>The Veterans General Hospital doctors said that there are various
kinds of alkaline substances in betel nuts. In its production
process, other substances are added, including many carcinogens.</P>
      <P>As most cases of betel nut poisoning are not serious, they are
generally neglected or left unreported, they said.</P>
      <P>The doctors added that the amount of poison in betel nuts
needed to adversely affect a chewer varies from one to another. But
they cautioned betel nut users to remember that a small amount could
result in poisoning.</P>

      <P>The chief of mainland China's military
intelligence secretly directed funds from Beijing to help re-elect
President Clinton in 1996, former Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung
has told federal investigators.</P>
      <P>The Los Angeles Times on Sunday carried an investigative report
that indicated Chung's testimony links top Beijing officials to
secretly directed funds for Clinton's re-election campaign.</P>
      <P>Chung said he met three times with the intelligence official,
Gen. Ji Shengde, who ordered US$300,000 deposited into a bank account
for subsidized campaign donations intended for Clinton, according to
sources familiar with Chung's sealed statements to federal
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>During their initial meeting on Aug. 11, 1996, in Hong Kong, Ji
conveyed to Chung the Beijing regime's specific interest in
supporting Clinton:</P>
      <P>"We like your president," Ji said, according to sources familiar
with Chung's grand jury testimony. Chung testified that he was
introduced to the intelligence chief by the daughter of a retired
senior military officer.</P>
      <P>Chung's testimony has provided investigators the first direct
link between a senior mainland Chinese official and illicit foreign
contributions that were funneled into Clinton's 1996 re-election
effort. It is the strongest evidence to emerge in two years of
federal investigations that the highest levels of the Beijing regime
sought to influence the US election.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former ROC Premier Hau Pei-tsun said on
Monday that he has no plans to settle in mainland China,
according to reports from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hau is currently on a 10-day visit to his ancestral home in
the eastern mainland province of Jiangsu in the company of his wife,
two grown-up sons and a granddaughter.</P>
      <P>This is Hau's first mainland trip since he moved to Taiwan in
1949 after the Chinese communists took control of the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hau was quoted by local newspapers as saying in his hometown of
Ynecheng that he has never considered returning to the mainland for
settlement.</P>
      <P>"I don't think it is necessary to resettle on the mainland," Hau
said, adding that he may make occasional visits to the mainland in
the future simply for reminding the younger generations not to
forget their roots.</P>
      <P>Hau, an anti-Communist stalwart, said he believes as long as all
Chinese people do not forget their roots, it will be helpful to the
solidarity and unity of the Chinese race.</P>
      <P>Hau, a former military chief who retired from the ROC government
as premier in 1993, said he is concerned about economic and
educational development on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I think universal education is key to mainland China's bid to
modernize its economy and upgrade the quality of life of its people,"
said the 79-year-old former ROC premier.</P>
      <P>Hau and his family paid a visit to his parents' grave on Monday
morning. An emotional Hau reportedly broke into tears when he knelt
down and kowtowed to his parents' tombstone. Hau last visited his
hometown 61 years ago as a graduate of an army academy before taking
part in the Eight-Year War of Resistance against Japan.</P>
      <P>Hau also paid a visit to the grave of ROC national founding
father Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing on Sunday. "As a follower of Dr.
Sun, I should come here," he explained.</P>
      <P>During his low-profile, nostalgic mainland trip, Hau will visit
Fenghua in Zhejiang province, hometown of the two late ROC presidents
-- Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo. Hau served as chief of the
General Staff and defense minister during the terms of the two
Chiangs.</P>
      <P>Hau is also scheduled to meet with mainland China's top
negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, in Shanghai on April 9. Hau
said prior to his departure that he hopes to exchange views
with Wang on feasible ways to promote civilian exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait to help maintain regional peace and stability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE'S MONTHLY SALARY 1.5 TIMES CLINTON'S</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui's monthly
salary reached an average of NT$834,636 (US$25,292) last year, about
20 times that of an average salaried man here, according to a survey
by the Hong Kong-based Chinese weekly Yazhou Zhoukan.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that Lee's monthly salary was 1.5 times that
of US President Bill Clinton, but only about 65 percent of the top
Singapore leader's.</P>
      <P>Based on the findings of the Yazhou Zhoukan survey, the ROC's
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said although
salary levels in most Asian countries declined last year because of
regional financial turmoil, salaries of top leaders of Hong Kong,
Japan, Singapore and Taiwan were still higher than that of their
American counterpart.</P>
      <P>According to a report carried in the latest issue of the
CEPD-sponsored International Economic Situation Weekly, the US head
of state's monthly salary was equivalent to NT$550,011 in 1998,
based on an exchange rate of US$1 vs. NT$33.</P>
      <P>In terms of the same exchange rate, the top Hong Kong leader's
1998 monthly pay was about NT$1.15 million, compared to Japan's
NT$1.04 million and Singapore's NT$1.28 million.</P>
      <P>Quoting the Yazhou Zhoukan survey, the CEPD weekly further
said South Korea far lagged behind its Asian competitors in its
general pay levels. The South Korean head of state made about
NT$207,801 a month last year, only one-sixth of monthly salaries of
his Singaporean, Hong Kong and Japanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>The South Korean president's monthly salary was only higher than
mainland Chinese leader's, which stood at NT$3,399 last year,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>An interesting finding was that Taiwan's white-collar employees
in various professional fields generally made less money than their
American counterparts, but its president's salary was much higher
than the US president's.</P>
      <P>The Yazhou Zhoukan survey also found that a medical doctor could
make an average of NT$185,000 a month in Taiwan last year, while the
monthly earning of a Taiwan lawyer was about NT$203,000.</P>
      <P>The average monthly pay for a Taiwan bank executive was
NT$112,000, but Taiwan's top banker -- governor of the Central Bank
of China could only earn about NT$169,000 a month.</P>
      <P>A local technician could make an average of NT$142,000 a month,
while the monthly salary for a national university professor was
only about NT$94,000, according to the survey. And the average
monthly pay for local journalists stood at NT$68,000.</P>
      <P>Survey results further showed that the industrial and
commercial sector was the most lucrative profession in Taiwan. In
1998, the average monthly salary for the chief executive officer
reached NT$402,000 and that for a professional manager also
amounted to NT$223,000.</P>
      <P>The average monthly pay for a computer software programmer was
US$66,000 and those in the secretarial jobs could make an average of
NT$44,000 a month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSES RESERVED ABOUT INVESTING IN AFRICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that Africa is a
diplomatic stronghold of the Republic of China, Taiwan businesses
appear reluctant to invest there.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintains formal diplomatic ties with 27 nations around
the world, many of which are African countries.</P>
      <P>Although it is a government wish that the local business
community would cooperate with it in breaking into that part of the
world, Taiwan investments remain limited in that continent compared
to the amount poured into other continents.</P>
      <P>"Africa, a virgin land rife with investment and business
opportunities, only waits for ambitious and courageous pioneers,"
said Michael K.M. Wei, deputy director-general of the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT).</P>
      <P>"Africa is a promising market for many sectors. Its natural
resources, such as timber, coal, cotton and cocoa beans, are cheap
and of good quality," the BOFT official noted.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Africa totaled US$3.41 billion
in 1998, down 20.6 percent from 1997, ROC government statistics show.
Taiwan exported US$1.45 billion-worth of products and services to
Africa last year, down 4.9 percent from the year-earlier level, while
imports from African countries hit around US$1.96 billion, a fall of
20.6 percent from a year ago.</P>
      <P>South Africa is Taiwan's leading trading partner in Africa,
followed by Egypt, according to the same tallies. Taiwan exports to
South Africa and Egypt reached US$600 million and US$213 million in
1998, accounting for 44.7 percent and 15.7 percent, respectively, of
the country's total outbound shipments to that continent.</P>
      <P>The island's five other major export markets in Africa are
Nigeria, Liberia, Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia. The seven
countries together absorbed 83.2 percent of Taiwan's overall exports
to the continent, while on the other hand, South Africa is also
Taiwan's leading source of imports in Africa, the statistics
indicate.</P>
      <P>South Africa exported US$700 million-worth of goods and services
to Taiwan last year, accounting for 38.41 percent of the island's
total inbound shipments from Africa. Angora ranked second, exporting
more than US$300 million-worth of goods, or 16.58 percent of the
total, followed by Congo, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Ivory Coast.</P>
      <P>Imports from these six African countries to Taiwan made up nearly
90 percent of Africa's total shipments to the island.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, South Africa is also the African country which
has attracted the largest number -- 624 -- of Taiwan businesses to
set up footholds there.</P>
      <P>The ROC provided considerable economic aid to South Africa, once
a strong ROC diplomatic ally in Africa, during the period of the
US-led trade sanctions against it, prompting many Taiwan businesses
to invest there.</P>
      <P>Although Pretoria switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing in 1997, two-way substantive ties between Taiwan and South
Africa remain close.</P>
      <P>There are currently about 280 Taiwan businesses operating in
South Africa, most of which are in the garment and shoe-making
industries, while the rest are involved in the retail business,
import-export trade, and tourism sectors.</P>
      <P>But with the rapid deterioration in South Africa's public order
and security in recent years, Wei said many Taiwan companies with
operations in that country have expressed the wish to relocate their
factories to other countries in the region.</P>
      <P>During a working meeting sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs with its personnel stationed in Africa last month, several
South Africa-based Taiwan businessmen voiced their desire to relocate
their plants, Wei pointed out, adding that the ROC government will
work out special measures to help them shift their investments.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, meanwhile, is organizing a
fact-finding delegation to visit Senegal, Burkina Faso, Gambia and
Liberia in late May in the hope of seeking trade and investment
opportunities for Taiwan firms, Wei added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN HSU TO MEET NEW ERA FACTION HEAD CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chairman and presidential hopeful Hsu Hsin-liang will pay a visit on
Tuesday to Chang Chun-hung, convener of the party's New Era faction,
against the backdrop that several factions within the DPP are hoping
that Hsu will remain in the party.</P>
      <P>The possibility that Hsu might quit the DPP and run as an
independent has become a dilemma for the opposition party. The office
of the New Era faction is seeking the help of more than 20 DPP
Legislators to stop Hsu from quitting the party.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DPP Central Committee called on party members to
persuade Hsu not to quit. The DPP's party congress is scheduled to
convene on May 8 leading to speculation that if Hsu is to quit, he
will announce it prior to the congress.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsin-chien, former DPP chairman, predicted that Hsu would
not quit. However, Hsu stressed recently that he must consider
whether the DPP has fostered new values, a new way of thinking, as
well as defining a new historical mission.</P>
      <P>Hsu was disappointed with the DPP's failure to transform itself,
and has since contemplated his future relations with the party.</P>
      <P>The DPP's existing party platform contains a "four-year clause"
which states that a member may only run once for a major public
office within a four-year period.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, since former Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian, the DPP's
heavy-weight personality, ran for Taipei mayor last year, he should
not be able to seek the presidency next year, according to that
clause. However, since he is the only one within the party likely to
win the presidency, DPP officials are inclined to abolish the
so-called four-year clause.</P>
      <P>Party headquarters plan a vote on the four-year clause at the May
congress, despite dissent.</P>
      <P>Complicating matters is the fact that members of the procedures
sub-committee, its spokesman and its preparatory sub-committee as
well as emergency sub-committee conveners are all Chen supporters.
The only exception is the New Era faction's convener Chang, who has
remained neutral.</P>
      <P>Former DPP chairman Yao Chia-wen has proposed revising the
"four-year one option clause" with a "four-year two options clause"
in regard to election bids for president, vice president, party
chairman and mayor of Taipei or Kaohsiung--Taiwan's two largest
cities.</P>
      <P>Hsu's office staff said on Monday that Yao's proposal would not
have much influence on Hsu's decision.</P>
      <P>Some DPP's Legislators affiliated with the New Tide faction
suggested holding a policy seminar prior to the opening of the DPP
party congress, to allow Chen and Hsu an opportunity to debate
party policy, how to implement it and how they see the future.</P>
      <P>Former DPP chairman Huang wondered the feasibility of the debate
because the party has not yet nominated a presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>The Five-member Sub-committee of the Formosan Faction is
scheduled to meet on Saturday to discuss activities for the 20th
anniversary of the Kaohsiung Formosa Magazine Incident. It is not
known whether the sensitive issue of Hsu's quitting will be discussed
at the gathering.</P>
      <P>Members of the sub-committee include: former DPP chairmen Shih
Ming-teh, Hsu Hsin-liang, Chang Chun-hung (acting chairman for a short
period), Yao Chia-wen, and the incumbent chairman Lin Yi-hsiung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAKE-UP MEASURES NEEDED TO OFFSET REVENUE DEFICIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui has recently
asked the government to take make-up measures to offset declining
government revenues while introducing tax reduction program,
Cabinet source said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The economic recession and reduction in certain types of taxation
has led to a decline in government revenue for 1999, and a serious
deficit has appeared, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid any further widening of the deficit, Lee said
that any administrative departments mulling downward tax adjustments
to provide stimulus to certain industries should provide substitute
measures that can cover the resultant revenue insufficiency.</P>
      <P>All levels of government that are involved in revising
regulations which will reduce government revenue should also ponder
make-up plans, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the Executive Yuan, many administrative departments
have set up tax-reduction schemes to boost stalled development in
certain industries. The reduction of business tax for the banking
industry and the cutting of the share transaction tax are the most
prominent examples.</P>
      <P>These considerable reductions have lowered tax revenue to less
than 60 percent, putting a heavy burden on the government's finances.</P>
      <P>Extra annual expenditure of up to NT$30 billion from this year to
subsidize the new national pension scheme has further added to the
need for revenue make-up plans.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a bond foundation would be a feasible and
proper way of helping the government to raise revenue, said Lee,
adding that experts should be hired to assist the government in asset
management.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC OFFICIALS STAND BY PRATAS INVESTMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of the Interior officials on
Monday adopted a positive stance on a plan by the ruling Kuomintang
to invest in the Pratas islands, a group of islets in the South China
Sea.</P>
      <P>The officials said investing in the Pratas, also known as the
Tungsha islands, can reassert ROC sovereignty over the territory, as
well as providing a boost to tourism, although several issues, such
as water supplies and desalination, would pose thorny problems, they
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said during a regular news briefing that his ministry will stay
abreast of any government moves to develop resources in the South
China Sea region.</P>
      <P>However, he declined to confirm recent reports that the proposed
investment project has gained MND approval, saying only that the
ministry is studying the issue.</P>
      <P>Tungsha Island, the largest of the archipelago, is a
horseshoe-shaped coral atoll measuring about 100 square kilometers,
with about 168 hectares lying above sea level.</P>
      <P>ROC military facilities cover the island, which lies about 450 km
southwest of Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. There is also a runway to
allow the island to be resupplied by air.</P>
      <P>Other establishments on the windswept island include a weather
station, power generator, hostels for fishermen, and a reservoir with
a capacity of 100,000 gallons of fresh water.</P>
      <P>Mainland China also claims the Pratas islands.</P>
      <P>According to reports, Liu Tai-ying, director of the KMT's
Business Management Committee and chairman of the KMT-owned China
Development Corp. (CDC), has won the support of ROC President and KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui for a proposal for the CDC to invest more than
NT$100 million (US$3.02 million) in developing the islands into a
tourist resort.</P>
      <P>In his plan, Liu also recommends that Taipei should invite
Washington, Tokyo and Beijing to join in efforts to develop the
disputed area, saying that resource sharing is the best way to settle
thorny sovereignty disputes in a region believed to be rich in oil
and gas.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan and mainland China, Brunei, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Vietnam all claim sovereignty over territory in the
South China Sea. The most bitter dispute centers on the Spratly
Islands, located to the south of the Pratas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SEEKING CLOSER TIES WITH POLAND, CZECH AND HUNGARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By L.R. Yen and Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After its success in forging diplomatic
relations with Macedonia, the ROC is seeking to enhance its
substansive relations with Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.</P>
      <P>The successful development of Taiwan's small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) will be the principal medium through which it
hopes to promote closer ties, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said recently, adding that there is a need to allay a
commonly held belief that the ROC has "bought" its diplomatic ties
with its poorer African and Latin American allies.</P>
      <P>The government should not only help foster a better understanding
of the country's diplomatic situation, but also develop genuine
"mutually beneficial" relationships with its potential allies, he
said.</P>
      <P>After the breakdown of communism in Europe, former socialist
countries faced urgent problems with economic development and
unemployment.</P>
      <P>Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary wish to emulate the ROC's
experience in the development of SMEs, credited with bringing about
Taiwan's "economic miracle," in their own economic development.</P>
      <P>Instead of making frequent claims of "promoting substantial
relations," MOFA will extend the ROC's diplomatic relations through
"experience sharing" to benefit prospective allies with practical
results, according to MOFA officials.</P>
      <P>MOFA and the Chung Hua Institute for Economic Research held a
joint SME seminar for economic, trade and finance officials from the
three central European countries in February, and received a positive
response, while MOFA announced recently that beginning in July, ROC
economic and trade offices will begin a series of activities to
promote trade and relations with eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and MOFA is also slated
to hold a business exhibition targeted at Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Latvia, while the China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) will form a large-scale economic and trade delegation
to visit these countries in July.</P>
      <P>Taiwan offered Poland a US$20 million SME management loan in
January, which the Polish government will use for its SME policy
development.</P>
      <P>Polish Vice Economics Minister Bernard Blaszczyk expressed
gratitude towards Taiwan's SME investments in Poland, and also
thanked Taiwan for its care and help in training Poland's developing
SMEs.</P>
      <P>The MOFA officials pointed out that if Taiwan can build more
friendships with the rest of Europe through central and eastern
Europe, this would greatly benefit the country's international
relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe
arrived in Bangkok on Monday after being expelled from South Korea
while trying to return to mainland China, sources reported.</P>
      <P>Wang walked out of Bangkok airport displaying a poster reading
"right of return to homeland cannot be deprived." He told the media
that he had already braced himself for possible detention by the
Beijing authorities as he has spent 15 years in political detention
in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wang was planning to return to his homeland to visit the tomb of
his farther who died in February, but his plan was frustrated by the
Seoul authorities, who threw him out of the country.</P>
      <P>He told a CNA reporter he regretted not being able to pay his
last respects to his father, but said he will try again to apply for
travel documents to legally enter the mainland. Currently he holds
US-issued refugee travel documents.</P>
      <P>He did not say how long he intends to stay in Thailand, but added
that he did not expect to be expelled, as he had been granted legal
entry by the Thai authorities.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former factory worker, launched his career as an activist
when he wrote several big character anti-government wall posters in
1974.</P>
      <P>In 1981, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for what the
Beijing authorities called "counter-revolutionary" activities. He
served 12 years and was released in 1993. He has since been jailed
periodically for parole violations.</P>
      <P>Wang fled the mainland in 1996 after Beijing arrested and
sentenced another activist, Liu Xiaobo. Wang first surfaced in Hong
Kong and later went to the San Francisco area.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Petroleum Corp. (CPC) announced
Tuesday its intention to raise domestic oil prices an average of 2.69
percent, effective April 7.</P>
      <P>Domestic gasoline and diesel will be raised NT$0.3 per liter,
while bunker oil will be raised NT$137 per kiloliter.</P>
      <P>CPC said it decided to raise domestic oil prices after oil
producing nations reached an agreement recently to decrease output.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time CPC has raised oil prices since March
7, 1998 when it adopted a flexible system for the adjustment of
domestic oil prices.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, CPC has lowered domestic oil
prices seven times for an accumulated decrease of 14.63 percent.</P>
      <P>Although the government on Feb.1 allowed the private sector to
import liquefied natural gas, aviation oil and bunker oil, the sector
has not yet imported the oil. Therefore, CPC will also raise prices

      <P>Washington, April 5 (CNA): US Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN) wrote
President Bill Clinton Monday that investigators from both the
Congress and Justice Department should be allowed to interview
principal witnesses in mainland China in order to find out

    <HEADLINE>AMERICANS SHOULD BETTER UNDERSTAND TRA: US DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)

(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 5 (CNA): As tensions between the United States
and mainland China mount and the issues become more complex,
Americans' familiarity with the history of two decades of the Taiwan
Relations Act "someday might make a difference between a major war or
a milestone for peace in the heart of Asia," wrote the Houston
Chronicle Monday.</P>
      <P>In an editorial titled "History Lessons," the Texas newspaper
noted that relations between the US and the PRC have for decades been
buffeted by tempests and typhoons of varying degrees. As Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji visits this week, the storm warnings are flying
high again.</P>
      <P>But regardless of the political weather at the moment, one of the
principal realities is the United States' long-standing relationship
with the democratic Republic of China on Taiwan. "It is somewhat
ironic that Zhu's visit comes the same week that the 20th anniversary
of the Taiwan Relations Act is observed," said the editorial.</P>
      <P>The Act, like so much in US-Sino relations, is an oddity. So odd,
in fact, that people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait would prefer
it be done away with -- but for starkly different reasons. Even in
Washington, the Act is a source of deep contention, added the
newspaper.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of the TRA, the editorial continued, "the
20th anniversary of its passage is a very appropriate time to say
that Americans would benefit from a better knowledge and
understanding of the law upon which, it is no exaggeration to say,
the future of the world might turn."</P>
      <P>The law stems from President Jimmy Carter's 1978 normalization of
relations with Communist China, conceding that the People's Republic
is "the sole legal government of China." The move made US relations
with the huge Chinese mainland somewhat less complicated, but the
relations with the more democratic Republic of China on Taiwan more
difficult, according to Houston Chronicle.</P>
      <P>The TRA enables unofficial commercial, cultural and other
dealings with Taiwan and offers protection from the United States
that the democratic island -- which has been a model for economic
success and, more recently, rapid democratization -- has needed to
survive, wrote the newspaper.</P>
      <P>Tensions have grown, and the issues have become more complicated
over the years. For example, the TRA codifies a role for the Congress
in conducting foreign policy that to some degree overrules the
executive branch's prerogatives, said the editorial.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it added, the TRA's provisions assert the US
position that the island's future is to be determined by peaceful
means only while acknowledging that United States' aid given to
Taiwan has been crucial to that government's continued existence.</P>
      <P>The newspaper concluded that as tensions mount and the issues
grow more complex, Americans' familiarity with the nuances and
history of two decades of the Taiwan Relations Act someday might make
a difference between a major war or a milestone for peace in the
heart of Asia.</P>

      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian will
leave Wednesday for a five-day visit to South Korea and Mongolia as
part of an international tour in which he will exchange opinions
with officials there in the run-up to next year's presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Considered by many to be the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's most likely presidential candidate, Chen has also been
traveling around Taiwan, and his travels are said to be in
preparation for a presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Chen, who recently returned from Japan, said the issue of security
in the Asia-Pacific region would be the focus of his trip to South
Korea, as it was in Japan.</P>
      <P>While in Seoul, Chen will call on members of parliament and
political party officials, though he has refused to name whom he will
meet. In addition, he will atttend a seminar at Kyongnam Universty,
from which he has received an honorary doctorate.</P>
      <P>After South Korea, Chen will then travel to Ulan Bator, Mongolia,
to meet with former Ulan Bator Mayor and current Mongolian Premier
Janlaviin Narantsatsralt. Taipei and Ulan Bator signed a sister-city
agreement when Chen and Narantsatsralt were mayors.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that strong neighboring countries have not prevented
Mongolia from becoming independent, sovereign, dignified and secure.
Taiwan could learn a lesson from Mongolia, he said.</P>
      <P>This is Chen's first visit to Mongolia. He had hoped to visit
Ulan Bator to sign the sister-city agreement, but Chen instead sent
his deputy, Pai Hsiu-hsiung, because of pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen has announced that he will visit the United States later
this month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ZHU RONGJI'S US VISIT SEEN BECOMING A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The visit of Premier Zhu Rongji, which
starts on Tuesday, is seen as a difficult balancing act because many
Americans still regard mainland China as the "Evil Empire."</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday, said, in a article by
its Hong Kong-based corespondent Rowan Callick, that Zhu's key goal
is to put US ties with mainland China back on track following recent
friction over the alleged theft of US nuclear secrets by China and
the mainland Chinese media depicting President Bill Clinton as Hitler
for his role in the NATO bombings of Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>Though known as a reformist, Zhu is unlikely to clinch mainland
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) because it
requires Beijing to quicken the pace of economic reforms and market
opening measures. Currently the mainland is experiencing anxiety over
rising unemployment and social dislocation which is slowing the pace
of economic reforms there.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Clinton and Zhu will probably issue a
statement noting their closeness on WTO issues. The visit now appears
unlikely to clinch any formal agreement because mainland China's
entry requires other countries, including Australia, to sign off on
WTO membership.</P>
      <P>While Zhu is facing US hawks and a hostile Congress, Clinton
will be unable to help as he himself is under siege for the failure
of NATO's bombing campaign to relieve the plight of suffering ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Clinton is regarded as being too accommodating to mainland China
and he is still facing murky tales of mainland Chinese officials
contributing money to his re-election campaign.</P>
      <P>Australia wants firm relations ties between mainland China and the
US because a further falling out between the two would place
Australia in an awkward position. However, Australia does not want to
see the US concede the mainland's entry into the WTO, the daily
reported.

ISLAMIC LEADER ACCUSES SUHARTO OF FOMENTING VIOLENCE</P>
      <P>Canberra, April 6 (CNA) An influential Islamic leader and
Indonesian presidential candidate, has for the first time accused
former President Suharto of deliberately provoking the recent
violence and bloodshed as a way of delaying or disrupting the
national election on June 7.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Dr. Amien
Rais, former leader of the Muhammadiyah group in Indonesia, said he
suspects Suharto of destabilizing parts of Indonesia as a way of
influencing the June election.</P>
      <P>Amien, who stepped aside from the group, which has a membership
of 28 million, in order to take part in the June presidential
election, is the first Indonesian leader to implicate Suharto on the
record.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Suharto and the ruling Golkar Party are using
large sums of money to neutralize political opponents and to bribe
voters. Rais said that parts of the Army seemed to be working with
Suharto and he called for the resignation of the commander of the
armed forces and the former Suharto adjutant -- General Wiranto.</P>
      <P>"Most probably Suharto is involved in destabilizing the political
situation and trying to delay the election. I believe he is involved
in the unrest on Ambon, but I cannot prove it," Amien told the daily.</P>
      <P>"Part of the army is working with him, but not the whole army,"
he added.</P>
      <P>More than 200 people have died in clashes between Muslims and
Christians on the island of Ambon in recent months.</P>
      <P>Across the archipelago, violence and mass unrest have broken out
with increased frequency since Suharto resigned on May 2 of last year
amid economic crisis, he said.</P>
      <P>"Suharto is defending himself, defending the economic imperial of
his children," Amien said.</P>
      <P>President B. J. Habibie has guaranteed the physical safety of
Suharto and has refused to convene an independent inquiry into
alleged corruption by the former president.</P>
      <P>Amien has said publicly that one of Suharto's daughters phoned
him last November with an offer of multiple pay-offs of 11 billion
rupiah in an apparent effort to blunt his campaign against Suharto
and his family.</P>
      <P>Amien told the Review that Suharto could face a trial under a
reformist government.</P>
      <P>"He still has a lot of networks, a lot of allies and friends in
the armed forces and the bureaucracy; a lot of people believe their
fate depends on him and if he collapses, if he goes on trial, there
will be a lot more political and economic fallout.</P>
      <P>"We have to hit him, again and again, harder and more often,
until we deliver the coup de grace, and then we can begin to build a
democratic Indonesia," Amien said, adding "The status quo forces will
do anything to delay or disrupt the election. They are afraid of the
election."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT ETHNIC ALBANIAN REFUGEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia was reluctant to accept a
portion of ethnic Albanian refugees who successfully fled to
Macedonia out of fear of a repetition of the influx of mainland
Chinese students and refugees into the country after the Tiananmen
Square massacre in 1989.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on Monday told reporters that
Australia would not give any temporary stay to ethnic Albanian
refugees because it would repeat the experience of allowing more than
mainland 55,000 Chinese students and refugees into Australia after
the June 4 massacre.</P>
      <P>His answer was in response to an urgent call from the opposition
Labor Party that the government should be more flexible in accepting
ethnic Albanian refugees.</P>
      <P>Albanian Australian communities here also made a similar request
to the government, saying Australia should increase its immigration
intake for ethnic Albanian refugees because they are desperate and
need help.</P>
      <P>The United States, and some European countries, including Italy,
have agreed to accept tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
fleeing massacre by Serbian troops.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said the government would only extend visas for some
2,000 ethnic Albanians who were already in Australia before the start
of the NATO bombings of Yugoslavia last week.</P>
      <P>Former Labor Party Prime Minister Bob Hawke was sympathetic with
the mainland Chinese refugees and granted them a temporary stay in
Australia. But four years later, most of the mainland Chinese
refugees used their refugee status to gain permanent residency.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said the government was worried about a recurrence of
that situation, adding, it would cause a financial strain for
Canberra.</P>
      <P>Among the 55,000 mainland Chinese refugees given a temporary stay
in Australia, most of them succeeded in gaining permanent residency
status and later a number of them applied for family members to come.
The influx cost Australian taxpayers an enormous amount because the
new arrivals were entitled to social welfare upon their arrival in
Australia.</P>
      <P>The influx of mainland Chinese refugees and their parents effected
the government budget, immigration analysts said.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent a similar situation from recurring, the
Coalition government under Prime Minister John Howard last year
introduced a very tough immigration policy aimed at discouraging
family reunions by imposing a two-year waiting period.</P>
      <P>During the waiting period, parents of Australian citizens are not
entitled to any social welfare.</P>
      <P>Since 1997-98 Australia has set its immigration limit at around
68,000 migrants plus 4,500 humanitarian refugees, down sharply from
the 100,000 intake in 1996-97 during the Labor Party government under
former Prime Minister Paul Keating.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  5  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Taiwan stainless steel wire
producers are among companies from six countries that were accused
Monday of dumping stainless steel round wires on the US market at
below market prices, sources from the Department of Commerce (DOC)
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>After completing an investigation into dumping charges filed by
10 US steel producers, the DOC ruled that companies from six
countries -- including Taiwan's Rodex Fasteners Corp., Tien Tai
Electrode Co. and Kuang Tai Metal Industrial Co. -- dumped the wires
on the US market.</P>
      <P>Steel producers from South Korea, Japan, India, Canada and Spain
were also named in the ruling.</P>
      <P>The DOC's verdict has been referred to the US International Trade
Commission (ITC) for adjudication. The ITC is scheduled to hold a
final public hearing on the case Wednesday, and it will decide in 45
days whether the foreign steel producers have hurt the interests of
the 10 US companies.</P>
      <P>If the ITC upholds the verdict, then starting May 24 Tien Tai
Electrode and Kuang Tai Metal will be subject to a punitive tariff
rate of 4.75 percent, while Rodex Fasteners will face a punitive
tariff rate of 3.94 percent, according to the DOC sources.</P>
      <P>Stainless steel round wires from certain steel producers in South
Korea, Japan, India, Canada and Spain would face tariff rates ranging
from 3.07 percent to 24.4 percent.</P>
      <P>According to DOC tallies, Taiwan is the third largest exporter of
stainless steel round wires to the United States, behind only Canada
and South Korea. Taiwan exported 2.25 million kilograms of stainless
steel round wires worth about US$3.97 million to the United States in
1996.</P>

      <P>A 27-year-old mainland Chinese woman
married to a Taiwan man was found burned to death in her home in
Minhsiung village in southern Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>The body of Mo Yen-yin was found by police in the couple's
bedroom.</P>
      <P>The woman's husband, 37-year-old Tsai Kun-jung, said his wife
died of self-immolation and that he himself nearly burned to death in
the fire.</P>
      <P>But neighbors reported hearing loud squabbles between Mo and
Tsai, and police said there were signs that there had been a fight in
the house. Authorities are continuing their investigation into the
cause of the fire.</P>
      <P>The fire was reported to the village fire brigade in the wee

sitting in the parlor on the ground floor of the house. His chest had
been burned, and the fire had already been extinguished.</P>
      <P>Tsai told firefighters that his wife had set fire to their
second-floor bedroom with herself in the room. When firefighters
rushed to the bedroom they found Mo's body lying in front of the
bedroom door.</P>
      <P>According to an initial police investigation, gasoline could be
smelled in the bedroom. In addition, some furniture in the room had
been destroyed by the fire.</P>
      <P>Gasoline may have been spilled onto Mo's body before she caught
fire, police said.</P>
      <P>Tsai told police that he and his wife had been having problems

      <P>Besides allowing four foreign-funded

ventures in mainland China, Beijing is also thinking of permitting
foreign companies to buy the bad debts of mainland Chinese banks, a

from affecting mainland China's financial market, and it would
further open the market, according to the Wen Hui Bao daily.</P>

an all-out settlement of state-owned banks' bad debts. China

    <HEADLINE>POLICE ESCORT HOME FIFTH CRIMINAL TO BE REPATRIATED IN PAST MONTH</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vietnam recently handed over to Taiwan a
Republic of China national convicted of fraud in Taiwan, and the
man's return marks the fifth time in the past month foreign countries
have agreed to repatriate suspected or convicted criminals sought by
Taiwan, an official with Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau
(CIB) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>ROC police escorted 44-year-old Wu Ching-tsun back to Taiwan
aboard an EVA Airways flight Tuesday afternoon after he was handed
over by Vietnamese police. Wu fled to Vietnam after being sentenced
to five months in prison by Taiwan's Supreme Court in 1995. He was
arrested recently by police in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Wu is the fifth suspected or convicted criminal to be repatriated
to Taiwan in the past month, and his extradition comes after
high-ranking police officials in Taiwan visited five Southeast Asian
countries last month to promote joint crackdowns on criminal
activity.</P>
      <P>National Police Administration Director-General Ting Yuan-chin
and CIB Commissioner Cheng Ching-sung visited Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines in March.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that since 1996, police have conducted around
a dozen crackdowns on gangsters in Taiwan every year, but as the
masterminds of most criminal operations have fled the country, the
public has questioned the effectiveness of these crackdowns.</P>
      <P>Police said the crackdowns would continue and that bringing back
gangsters who have fled Taiwan will be the focus of their next one.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, the bureau will ask for more money and will
station ROC police officials in other countries to track and collect
information on suspected Taiwan criminals who live abroad, bureau
officials said.</P>

      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Tuesday that it will soon announce an aid package to relieve
the suffering of the thousands of Albanian refugees who have flooded
into Macedonia from neighboring Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said at a news conference that MOFA, in
conjunction with 17 local charity groups, has worked out a package to
help Macedonia settle some of the Albanian refugees who have fled
there to avoid ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, a province of neighboring
Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>The ROC government is very concerned about the Albanian refugees'
safety and needs in Macedonia, and it will make public its detailed
aid package within this week in order to help Macedonia quickly
tackle the refugee crisis, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the ROC embassy in Macedonia has suggested that
Taiwan charity groups go first to refugee camps in Tetovo and
Gostivar, in western Macedonia, where around 50,000 refugees have
gathered.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Satellite phones, which allow people to
call into and out of the most remote places in the world, are now on
sale in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Satellite-based global-telephone network provider Iridium has
tied up with SingTel Mobile to provide the service.</P>
      <P>It involves the use of the world's first hand-held satellite
phones, which cost US$4,000 each.</P>
      <P>Calls are charged at between US$2 and US$6 a minute, depending on
where the calls are made and whether they are domestic or
international calls.</P>
      <P>Iridium uses 66 low-orbit satellites to transmit the calls,
unlike normal cellular phone networks, which rely on ground stations.</P>
      <P>Both Motorola and Kyocerea, a Japanese manufacturer, make the
handsets, and the Motorola ones became available here less than two
weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Iridium launched the service in November last year.</P>
      <P>There are fewer than 10,000 subscribers around the world and
SingTel's product manager for international mobile service, Ng Tai
Tee, said that about 10 Singaporeans have already bought the phone.</P>
      <P>She said she expected this number to rise to several hundred next
year.</P>
      <P>Current users are businessmen and executives working in
inaccessible regions of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, she said.</P>
      <P>Those who do not want to buy the handset can rent it from SingTel
Mobile at S$50 (about US$29) a day. Calls are not included in the
rental fee.</P>
      <P>Besides SingTel Mobile, Iridium has agreements with about 300
other cellular operators around the world.</P>
      <P>The only other portable satellite phone now on the market is the
Inmarsat mini-M, which was launched in 1997 and comes in the form of
a laptop-sized phone set and antenna.</P>
      <P>It costs US$3,000 and the usage charge is US$3 a minute. There
are about 500 customers using the phone in Singapore.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday that
the Republic of China has always been concerned over crises in the
international community, and has always been willing to contribute to
efforts to help ease these crises.</P>
      <P>In an meeting with former US Congressman Stephen Solarz at the
Presidential Office, Lee said the ROC is one of the few countries in
the world to have sped cash and other aid to Macedonia to help the
refugees who have streamed into the country in the wake of the Kosovo
conflict in neighboring Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>The prevention and handling of international crises, most of
which stem from human infractions, are directly related to
international stability and the security of all nations around the
world, Lee said.</P>
      <P>If a crisis is prevented before it erupts or handled before it
becomes full-blown, tension and confrontation can be reduced, and
even war can eventually be avoided, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee welcomed the visit to Taiwan by Solarz, who is currently a
board member of the New York-based International Crisis Group (ICG),
a private non-profit organization formed to strengthen the
international community's ability to prevent international crises.</P>
      <P>Solarz, a big supporter of the ROC who sees the country as a very
strong democracy, has visited Taiwan many times in his previous
capacity as a Democratic member of the House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>During his audience with President Lee, Solarz thanked him for
his consistent support for efforts to prevent and handle
international crises. He also offered his congratulations to Lee, who
was celebrating his golden wedding anniversary.</P>
      <P>The ICG, first conceived in 1993 by veterans of crisis operations
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Northern Iraq and Somalia, was
formally established in November 1995 in New York, comprising some 50
international statesmen, former parliamentarians, business
executives, and civic and humanitarian leaders.</P>
      <P>The ROC is one of the donors to the ICG, whose annual budget
comes from a wide range of sources, including donations from
individuals, foundations, governments and corporations.</P>
      <P>Among the ICG's board members are Malcolm Fraser and Michel
Rocard, former Prime Ministers of Australia and France, respectively,
Solarz, Ed Turner, president of the global news network CNN, and

(JA) stocks, worth NT$8.5 billion (US$256.8 million).</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Evergreen Marine Corp. (EMC), affiliated to the

that EMC was putting in a tender for JA shares.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the JA stockholder who is selling his 4
percent share in the company had invited Evergreen to make him an
offer, but was turned down as the company would prefer to concentrate
on its own airline business.</P>
      <P>He further declared none of the group's affiliates, including EMC
and EVA Airways, will become involved in JA's operation, explaining
that EVA is now busy releasing its own shares on the stock market,
which means the company must concentrate on its own business.</P>
      <P>EMC holds a 25.58 percent share of EVA. The EMC official's
remarks echoed those of EVA spokesman Nie Kuo-yui, who spelled out
that EVA has at present no plans to invest in other airlines.</P>
      <P>EVA is one of the few Asian air companies which made a profit
last year. According to the company, its 1998 revenue reached

      <P>At a press conference on Tuesday, Prime Minister John Howard

But he also said the government will see to it that they return to

      <P>He said Australia will donate another US$2.6 million to buy food
and medicine for ethnic Albanian refugees of the crisis in Kosovo,
following an earlier donation of US$1.3 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at a separate news conference on Tuesday, Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer said the Australian government remained
worried about the safety of two missing aid workers believed to have
been detained on the border of Yugoslavia and Croatia.</P>
      <P>Earlier, the Australian government had been reluctant to accept
any ethnic Albanian refugees for fear of upsetting the current

down a flight of stairs while visiting the Provincial Taiwan Museum
of Fine Arts earlier in the day, according to other members of the

      <P>Wang, 71, was immediately rushed to the nearby Chung Shan General

      <P>"China's division," a concept suggested by
Wang Daohan, Beijing's point man in dealing with Taiwan, to replace
Taiwan's idea of "a divided China," is a step forward from Beijing's
usual claim that there is only one China, a Taiwan official said on

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Su Chi said it remains to be

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>High-temperature undersea hot springs
recently discovered to the northeast of Taiwan may help detect the
activities of tectonic plates and eventually contribute to earthquake
prediction, an oceanographic geologist said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Prof. Chen Chen-tung of National Sun Yat-sen University and his
research team conducted an undersea probe of the sea bed near
Gueishan (Turtle Hill) Island, off the northeastern Taiwan city of
Ilan last month, and discovered Taiwan's first undersea hot spring.</P>
      <P>The springs, which are unrecorded in any local historical or
geological archives, are eruptions of billowing steam mixed with
sulfur fumes, with temperatures as high as 102 degrees Celsius, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>After diving to the hot springs, collecting sulfur samples from
the eruptions, and erecting four thermometers in the area, Chen said
he now has scientific proof that the group of undersea hot springs
actually exist.</P>
      <P>He added that he believes similar high-temperature undersea hot
springs also exist in other nearby areas and in eastern parts of the
Tiaoyutai Islands, which lie further north.</P>
      <P>Chen said his research was inspired by recent reports that
Japanese scientists have discovered undersea hot springs near the
island of Okinawa.</P>
      <P>He said he felt that similar undersea hot springs should be found
in the Taiwan area, which is located on the same belt of the Pacific
Rim, or "ring of fire," where oceanic tectonic plates are
exceptionally active.</P>
      <P>Chen and his research team will again visit the undersea hot
springs on April 23 to collect data from the undersea thermometers in
order to further evaluate the hot springs' research value.</P>

is graying rapidly, and people aged 65 and over will increase from 9
percent of the population in 1999 to 14 percent in 2121, while those
aged over 100 will increase from 740 to a massive 14,000.</P>
      <P>That means the average number of persons sharing the cost of

likely top Zhu's talks with US officials.</P>
      <P>Given that the United States and other Western countries have
become increasingly impatient with what they perceive as Beijing's
procrastination in its efforts to join the WTO, why shouldn't those
countries help Taiwan enter the WTO before Beijing does? Lien asked.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a speech delivered to a general
meeting of the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which is one of the world's economic powerhouses and at
the WTO's doorstep, should continue to upgrade industrial and
business research and development, raise educational levels and
obtain more advanced technologies to further increase the country's
overall competitiveness, Lien said.</P>
      <P>Taking stock of Taiwan's economic development, Lien said some
sectors -- including the capital, stock and foreign exchange markets
-- need to be overhauled and streamlined if the country really
intends to secure sustainable development. There has been too much
liberalization and too little discipline in those sectors, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said Taipei does not
expect that Zhu's US visit will produce any "accident" detrimental to
Taiwan, though it will closely monitor Zhu's activities in the United
States.</P>
      <P>Beginning Wednesday afternoon Vice Foreign Affairs Minister David
Lee will preside over a supra-ministerial meeting at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to keep abreast of all Zhu's activities during
his US visit, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>Officials from MOFA, the ministries of economic affairs and
national defense, the Mainland Affairs Council and the Government
Information Office will take part in the meeting, Lee said.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday the group will mainly examine the impact mainland
China's WTO admission would have on Taiwan, as the latest reports
have indicated that Beijing and Washington have made progress in
discussions on this issue, Lee noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LEAVES FOR S. KOREA, MONGOLIA VISITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, a presidential hopeful of
Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), left
for a five-day visit to South Korea and Mongolia on Wednesday as part
of what he called an "Asian-Pacific security communication trip."</P>
      <P>The two-leg visit followed Chen's journey to Japan last week.
For similar "security" purposes, the former Taipei mayor is also
scheduled to visit the United States late this month.</P>
      <P>Local observers said Chen's frequent overseas trips are
not only designed to promote regional security cooperation to
maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the entire
Asia-Pacific region but also to increase his international exposure
for his presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Chen said prior to his departure for Seoul that he believes Taiwan
has something to learn from both South Korea and Mongolia.</P>
      <P>"Despite longtime military threat from North Korea, South Korea
has managed to thrive over past decades and even survive the
recent Asian financial turmoil under the leadership of President Kim
Dae-jung," Chen said, adding that South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves have increased from US$9 billion to US$50 billion at the
end of February this year. "I believe that South Korea's handling of
the regional financial crisis could provide some inspiration to
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>As for Mongolia, Chen said it is worth understanding how
Mongolia, surrounded by two gigantic neighbors -- Russia and mainland
China -- could gain its independence and keep its sovereignty
intact.</P>
      <P>The charismatic DPP heavyweight said he had strived to promote
city-to-city diplomacy during his stint as Taipei mayor. "I'm
convinced that despite Beijing's strenuous efforts to isolate Taiwan
in the international community, there is still ample room for Taiwan
to expand its external relations."</P>
      <P>In Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian capital, Chen will meet with
Mongolian Prime Minister Tsahiagiyn Elbegdorj, with whom he made
acquaintance back in June 1997 when Elbegdorj, then-mayor of
Ulaanbaatar, led a delegation to Taiwan to sign a sister-city
agreement with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Dozens of pro-independence people staged a demonstration at
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport to protest what they called
Chen's disregard for his pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators waved banners and posters reading: "In memory
of pro-independence martyr Cheng Nan-jung and condemn Chen Shui-bian
for his putting aside his pro-independence position."</P>
      <P>An unidentified protester dashed toward Chen and clapped his own
hands. "My move symbolized a slap on Chen on behalf of Taiwan people
to punish his disregard for his previous vow to promote Taiwan
independence," the demonstrator claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CNA report from Washington said Chen will
arrive in Washington, D.C. around April 20 for a two-to-three-day
visit. Chen last visited the US capital some 13 months ago when he
was still on his Taipei mayoral post.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Chen will hold a news conference at the
US National Press Club focusing on the triangular
Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations and the general prospects of
Taiwan's next presidential election slated for March 2000.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Chen will meet with Richard Bush, the top US
liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of official ties, as well
as American experts in mainland China- and Taiwan-related affairs.</P>
      <P>Some US China hands said they hope Chen will give more
detailed explanations of his concepts and stances concerning
international affairs, particularly those related relations with the
United States and exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CISCO SYSTEM MAKES TAIWAN ITS LIFELONG PARTNER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cisco System, the world's largest
manufacturer of computer networking equipment, regards Taiwan as its
lifelong business partner, and the company will continue to bolster
cooperation with both Taiwan's government and private sector, a Cisco
executive said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>John Chambers, chairman and CEO of Cisco System, said computer
networks are heading toward a state where digitized images, and audio
and video transmissions are all integrated into one system.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Asia-Pacific region is becoming one of the most
important markets in the world for makers of Internet-related
equipment, Chambers said.</P>
      <P>Cisco is planning to channel US$40 million into the Asia-Pacific
region in the next year and a half. In particular the company seeks
to bolster cooperation with Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Among its cooperative projects, Chambers said, Cisco is working
to jointly establish with Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry
(III) in July a cable modem laboratory, to further develop Taiwan's
Internet hardware technologies. Cisco previously helped III to
establish a laboratory in Taiwan to develop asymmetric digital
subscriber line (ADSL) technology.</P>
      <P>ADSL modems provide instant high-speed data communication
connections for Internet access, video conferencing, remote access
and multimedia applications. The modems operate across existing
copper telephone lines.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Cisco's future business strategy, Chambers said
Cisco is striving to perfect its One-Shop system to provide a
complete solution and follow-up services in light of the current
explosion in Web commercial activity. Cisco seeks to achieve this
goal through its Cisco Connection On-line (CCO), which now dominates
one-third of e-commerce around the world, he added.</P>
      <P>Cisco has successfully merged more than 20 companies worldwide
since 1993 under a "win-win" policy, Chambers noted.</P>
      <P>Chambers is currently in Taipei to attend the III-sponsored "New
Era Leadership Summit." Among the leaders in Taiwan's computer and
high-tech realm that Chambers will meet with during his stay are Stan
Shih, chairman and founder of Acer Computer and Morris Chang,
chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO HELP MACEDONIA OUT OF REFUGEE CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will do all it can to
help Macedonia deal with its refugee disaster, and is also very keen
to contribute to efforts to settle the conflict in eastern Europe,
Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu told reporters that Macedonia, the ROC's most recent ally, is
now stuck in a worse situation than it could have imagined, referring
to the swarm of ethnic Albanian refugees from the neighboring
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo which is threatening Macedonia's
development.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire services have quoted Macedonian Prime Minister
Ljubco Georgievski as saying that the country is in danger of
economic and political collapse unless the tide of refugees is
stemmed.</P>
      <P>In order to save Macedonia from its predicament, Hu noted, the
United States has so far offered Skopje a US$100 million aid package,
while Germany has also donated some US$6 million.</P>
      <P>Asked how much Taipei will spend on its own Macedonian aid
project, Hu said the government will do its best, but stressed that
money is not the only way in which Taiwan can help its friend.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to hold a meeting on Thursday
of local private charity organizations to discuss Taiwan's
humanitarian aid to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister David Lee revealed that a number
of doctors and nurses have expressing their willingness to travel to
Macedonia to provide their services. Macedonia has around 120,000
refugees at the moment, out of the approximately one million people
who have been made homeless by the Serbian ethnic cleansing program
of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND  CHINA  RELUCTANT  TO  FIGHT  HIGH SEAS PIRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has come under growing
pressure due to its reluctance to fight worsening piracy in the South
China Sea and other waters, according to The Australian newspaper.</P>
      <P>According to a report in the paper, the London-based
International Maritime Bureau -- an international watchdog -- says
that at least two and possibly four crews on vessels leaving mainland
Chinese ports have been murdered in recent months.</P>
      <P>The IMB estimates that at least 39 sailors have been missing
since last December from two confirmed incidents in which heavily
laden vessels disappeared soon after leaving Hong Kong waters.</P>
      <P>It said mainland China has now become a safe haven for gangs of
pirates running highly organized and heavily armed operations using
speedboats to target vessels in the South China Sea and surrounding
areas.</P>
      <P>Some of the worst piracy is masterminded by a single gang made up
of Indonesians, Malaysians and mainland Chinese, according to the
IMB. They overpower the targeted ships and then take control of them
and set sail for a friendly mainland Chinese port.</P>
      <P>At least one sugar vessel a month goes missing in South China,
one trade source told the daily. "China might be in the midst of a
smuggling crackdown, but it doesn't appear to be making any
difference," he said.</P>
      <P>Despite the rising piracy incidents, and urgent demands for
action from the international trading community, mainland China
appears reluctant to vigorously crack down on the pirates, the daily
reported, although Beijing has denied being soft on piracy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has privately questioned the
United States about NATO's strategy of bombing Yugoslavia despite its
public support for the air war in the interests of alliance unity.</P>
      <P>In a front-page story on Wednesday, The Australian Financial
Review reported that Foreign Minister Alexander Downer is understood
to have voiced Australia's concerns to US Ambassador to Australia
Genta Hawkins Holmes at a lunch in Canberra last Thursday when Downer
held a reception for Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Khai.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Downer has personally assured Holmes that
Australia as an ally to the United States would refrain from public
criticism of what it viewed as an ill-conceived attempt to force
Yugoslav President Slodoban Milosevic to end the persecution of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Downer's remarks were echoed by Prime Minister John Howard,
opposition leader Kim Beazley and the chief of the Australian Defense
Force, Adm. Chris Barrie, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>They all agreed that the NATO bombings were not moderating
Milosevic's behavior, but only intensifying the humanitarian crisis
as refugees poured out of Kosovo to escape the vicious Serbian
campaign of ethnic cleansing.</P>
      <P>The Australian officials questioned the assumption on which the
NATO action had been based and the failure of the United States and
its NATO allies to develop a "plan B" to end the crisis, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>Their views appeared similar to the reported views of US military
chiefs in the weeks before the air campaign was launched, the daily
reported.</P>

Taiwan investors in Indonesia, reports from Jakarta said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Habibie has also told Wang that the
Indonesian situation will soon resume its former "business as usual"

      <P>During their talks, Habibie and Wang exchanged views on
the general regional situation and development, existing bilateral

      <P>Habibie said the Indonesian government attaches great importance

      <P>At the conference, Indonesian officials introduced their

      <P>Indonesia is a major source of Taiwan's energy supplies. It now
accounts 30 percent of Taiwan's total coal imports and 60 percent of
its total petroleum gas imports. In 1998, Taiwan also imported 100

      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, substantive
ROC-Indonesian relations have been close. Taiwan is Indonesia's

    <HEADLINE>LA TIMES: A TOUGH LIST FOR ZHU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los   Angeles,   April   6   (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the sliding scale of
Washington-Beijing relations, Premier Zhu Rongji began an eight-day
visit to America Tuesday at a sour point.</P>
      <P>In addition to Beijing's demands that NATO halt its bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia, there is considerable tension over trade
issues, human rights, and allegations of espionage and illegal
campaign contributions.</P>
      <P>The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday carried an editorial, "A Tough
List for Zhu," that indicated it is to the premier's credit that he
is making the trip at all in these turbulent times.</P>
      <P>The editorial pointed out that even though Zhu has a reputation
as a polished, energetic leader in mainland China, he will find the
going tough on the fundamentals of the bilateral relationship between
mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>But the paper said that, despite the obvious difficulties and
challenges he faces, Zhu is wise in coming. A cancellation would have
been a mistake, as the relationship between the two countries
requires constant work and understanding.</P>
      <P>On foreign affairs, mainland China stands squarely opposed to the
NATO air assaults on the Yugoslavian forces uprooting the culture and
people of Kosovo. Of course mainland China has done plenty of its own
cultural uprooting when calls for autonomy have been raised in Tibet,
the paper pointed out.</P>
      <P>But of far greater concern to the Beijing regime is Taiwan, which

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION PARTY URGES CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of the convening of the
conference of the National Unification Council (NUC), Taiwan's
opposition New Party on Wednesday urged both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to engage in positive exchanges.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, Lee
Ching-hua, organizer of the pro-unification party's national
committee on elections and development, explained his party's view on
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee urged President Lee Teng-hui to expound openly that the "new
Taiwan people" are also Chinese people, and said his party hopes that
Beijing will announce that its "one China" formula is not the
People's Republic of China, in order to give the two sides more room
to seek unification.</P>
      <P>President Lee first voiced the "new Taiwan people" concept last
December during Taiwan's three-in-one election.</P>
      <P>The spokesman for the tiny opposition party said that although
the "new Taiwan people" concept is conducive to the solidarity of the
people of Taiwan, it will lead to suspicion and mistrust on the other
side of the strait, and should therefore be made clear that it also
refers to people of Chinese descent living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In regard to the concept of a "China division" raised by Wang
Daohan, mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Lee said his
party supports the concept of "a separately ruled China" proposed by
the government of the ROC, and that Wang's labored semantics are of
no help to the strengthening of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He also urged Beijing to listen to the voice of the Taiwan people
and to respect the will of the Taiwan people in the process of
seeking China's unification. "One China" should not refer to the
People's Republic of China under communism, he stressed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the controversial issue of the Theater Missile
Defense (TMD) system, Lee said his party's stance is that Taiwan and
mainland China should begin with the abandonment of mutual military
threats.</P>
      <P>These moves, together with the setting up of "hotline" to avoid
conflicts, and the exchange of visits of military delegations, will
be helpful in the establishment of a foundation for the strengthening
of mutual trust, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also said that as long as Taiwan does not follow a path toward
independence, and as long as mainland China renounces the use of
force against Taiwan, it will not be necessary for Taiwan to join the
TMD system.</P>

      <P>A 40 ton Taiwan fishing vessel sank on
Monday in Philippine waters off Luzon Island, and three survivors
have been detained, the Philippine National Police reported on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Of the seven crew members of the vessel, identified as the Hung

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui is to deliver a
speech at the National Unification Council (NUC) on Thursday which
will center on democracy and peace, a high-ranking government and
ruling Kuomintang official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee's speech will also stress that security is the most
fundamental issue for Taiwan, and that benign interaction across the
Taiwan Strait needs further constructive dialogue, the official
added.</P>
      <P>Lee's speech at the sixth meeting of the NUC will also reiterate
his hearty welcome to Wang Daohan's visit this autumn, the unnamed
official revealed. Wang is chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), mainland China's quasi-official
body authorized to handle contacts with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Touching on the KMT's mainland policy, the official said the
party feels it is not necessary to revise its policy, as under Lee's
direction, it has complied with the needs of Taiwan's situation and
the trend of Taiwan public opinion.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that this is best reflected by former Taipei mayor

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS TO LAUNCH HUNGER STRIKE TO PROMOTE REFERENDUM LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker from Taiwan's opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will launch a hunger strike on
Saturday in order to push for legislation of a public referendum law.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Trong Tsai, who initiated the campaign, said on
Thursday that more than 180 people, 43 of whom are incumbent
legislators, have expressed their support for the action, dubbed the
"410 fast."</P>
      <P>Tsai said he, along with other seven legislative colleagues, have
determined to embark on a long-term fight for the law.</P>
      <P>At a press conference on Wednesday, Tsai explained that April 10,
the beginning of the hunger strike, marks the 20th anniversary of the
enactment by the United States of the Taiwan Relations Act, which
states the "expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined
by peaceful means."</P>
      <P>The DPP legislator claimed that the most "peaceful means" is to
enact legislation making public referendums possible.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tsai's remarks, fellow DPP Legislator Chang Chuan-tien
stressed that the right to hold referendums is a basic human right,
as well as being an example of the democracy which Taiwan is been
pursuing. He urged the ruling Kuomintang to help promote the
legislation of the public referendum law.</P>
      <P>A draft law has already passed its first-reading in the
legislature, but because the ruling KMT holds more than a half of the
legislative seats, the party, especially its leader, President Lee
Teng-hui, plays an influential role on the passing of legislation,
according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the KMT opposes the proposed law that would provide the
right to Taiwan's voters to call a referendum on issues concerning
public interests because it believes that the people of Taiwan are
too immature to make political decisions.</P>
      <P>Coinciding with the start of the hunger strike, the Taiwan
Professors' Association will stage a demonstration in downtown Taipei
to back the call for the right of public referendum. Members of the
organization revealed they will join Tsai in his hunger strike after
the protest march.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China delegation comprised of
representatives from government and private charity groups will visit
Macedonia next week to provide medical and other humanitarian
assistance to the Balkan country.</P>
      <P>The delegation will be headed by Vice Foreign Affairs Minister
David Lee. With flight schedules erratic because of NATO's strikes on
Yugoslavia, the delegation may have to charter a plane from Taipei or
a European nation to Macedonia for the three-day visit.</P>
      <P>The visit comes as NATO forces continue to pound Yugoslavia for
its killing of ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo. Hundreds
of thousands of people have been driven out of Kosovo and have fled
to neighboring Macedonia and Montenegro to escape the campaign of
ethnic cleansing by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.</P>
      <P>Lee said that "the ROC is sympathetic to the plight of the
refugees who have been driven out of Kosovo," and added that by
providing humanitarian assistance, the ROC hopes that others will see
the island as not only an economic miracle, but also a caring nation.</P>
      <P>In addition to aid such as drinking water and pharmaceuticals
provided by the charity groups, the government will also provide
money, the second cash donation following US$2 million provided
earlier.</P>
      <P>Although Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu and Lee would not
reveal the exact amount of the new assistance, it is understood that
it will be more than US$2 million.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the situation in the Balkans is the greatest human
tragedy there since World War II, noting that there are 120,000
refugees in Macedonia alone and that the total number in the whole
region exceeds 1 million.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that some Western nations, including the
United States and Germany, have said they will accept some of the
refugees, Lee was asked if Taiwan will do likewise, but he said that
there is no such plan at present.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PEOPLE OUTPACE JAPANESE, SOUTH KOREANS IN NUTRITIONAL TERMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nutritional intake among the people of
Taiwan has continued to increase over the past few years, with per
capita daily intake reaching an average of 3,129 calories, according
to government statistics released on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) said Taiwan people have outpaced their Japanese and South
Korean counterparts in daily intake of calories, protein, minerals
and vitamins.</P>
      <P>According to a DGBAS study, local daily intake of protein and
vitamin C has exceeded Department of Health (DOH)-recommended levels,
while calorie, iron and calcium intake falls within standard levels.</P>
      <P>"The study indicates that local people's nutritional intake is
adequate," a DGBAS official said, adding that local people should
control their diet and avoid overeating in order to maintain good
health.</P>
      <P>DGBAS tallies show that per capita daily nutrient intake
increased significantly last year compared with the levels recorded
10 years ago.</P>
      <P>During the 10-year period, local people's fat intake recorded the
sharpest increase at 35.1 percent, followed by calcium intake, up
29.4 percent; iron intake, up 16.7 percent; protein intake, up 13.5
percent; phosphorous intake, up 11.2 percent; and vitamin C intake,
up 10.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The study also found that local people's intake of carbohydrates,
such as rice, sugar and noodles, has declined during the past decade,
pointing to diversification in the country's diet.</P>
      <P>The report went on to say that Taiwan people's average fat intake
is twice that of their Japanese counterparts; calorie intake is 53.2
percent higher; carbohydrate intake is 33.2 percent higher; and
protein intake is 23.2 percent higher.</P>
      <P>Compared with the United States, Taiwan people topped Americans
only in vitamin C intake while lagging behind in all other nutrients.
Local people's vitamin C intake was 25.8 percent higher than average
daily intake in the United States.</P>
      <P>Health officials said local people's daily protein intake, at 101
grams, exceeds the DOH-suggested level by 31 grams, while phosphorous

    <HEADLINE>EAT MORE VEGETABLES AND CUT FAT INTAKE TO AVERT CANCER: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eating more rice and vegetables while
cutting down on meat and fat intake will help reduce the risk of
cancer, local health experts said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Peng-Wang Chia-kang, vice chairman of the non-profit Formosa
Cancer Foundation (FCF), said a wise diet or a well-balanced diet can
help avert cancer.</P>
      <P>Peng-Wang, an academinician of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest
research institute, said the World Health Organization once
studied more than 10 million cancer cases around the world.</P>
      <P>According to the research, Peng-Wang said, 30-to-40 percent of
cancer patients studied might not have developed cancer if they had
controlled their diet.</P>
      <P>"Elaborate laboratory tests also show that eating more
vegetables can help lower the risk of cancer," Peng-Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, FCF Chief Executive Lai Chi-ming said rising
incidence of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer,
lung cancer and pancreatic cancer here is closely related to a
significant increase in local people's fat intake over the past two
decades.</P>
      <P>Lai said an adult man needs only 70 grams of fat intake a day,
compared to 40 grams needed by an adult woman. At present, Lai
said, local people's daily fat intake reaches 34 percent of thier
total daily calorie intake, far exceeding the required levels.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that local people eat chicken, duck, fish and
beans instead of pork, beef and mutton. He also urged local people
to eat more steamed foods while cutting down on intake of fried
foods.</P>
      <P>With financial support from Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., the
Formosa Cancer Foundation has published a diet manual with an aim to
help local people control their diet to reduce the risk of cancer.</P>
      <P>The foundation will also sponsor a series of publicity progams
to teach local people how to eat wisely and ensure their

    <HEADLINE>OCAC HEAD URGES INCREASED INTERNATIONAL PUBLICITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC)
Minister Chiao Jen-ho urged the government on Wednesday to step up
its international publicity drive to buttress global awareness of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Reporting to the Foreign Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs
committees at the Legislative Yuan, Chiao called on the government to
effectively strengthen international publicity to allow the world to
heed the fact of the ROC's existence. In the face of Beijing's
increased diplomatic blockade and threats against Taiwan, the
government should adopt a more active strategy regarding
international relations, he added.</P>
      <P>As a result of the increasing influence of Chinese people abroad,
the OCAC chief said Beijing has replaced its reserved approach of the
past with a strategy of active rapprochement to win the hearts and
minds of ethnic Chinese living abroad as part of its efforts to
achieve its goal of "one country, two systems" for governing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Early this year, Beijing held a nationwide conference on overseas
Chinese affairs -- the largest in 20 years -- which was attended by
more than 240 ranking government officials, according to Chiao.
Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin declared at the meeting that
Beijing's overseas Chinese affairs policy will be a significant
element in its efforts to build an advanced socialist society, he
added.</P>
      <P>Since Beijing launched its economic reforms in the 1980s, the
number of mainland Chinese officials involved in overseas Chinese
affairs has greatly increased to a current level of more than 20,000,
and over 1,000 trade, sports and cultural groups travel abroad every
year to promote mainland China's image, a far greater number than
Taiwan ever musters, Chiao went on to say.</P>
      <P>Lamenting the inadequate budget earmarked by the government for
this purpose, the OCAC head pointed out that its budget is tiny
compared with the level distributed by Beijing.</P>
      <P>For instance, the OCAC received a government budget of just
NT$7.4 million (about US$224,000) this fiscal year to help with the
operations of overseas Chinese presses, an amount which he described
as a "drop in the ocean."</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chiao said, Beijing is set to renew a wave of united
front efforts later this year to mark the 50th founding of the
Chinese Communist Party and the 20th anniversary of its establishment
of ties with Washington, as well as the imminent return of Macao to
mainland Chinese rule by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to a round-the-clock program already being aired by
the state-run China Central Television Station to the entire world,
he said Beijing will also produce a 24-hour English program for the
whole of Asia, and will broadcast more programs via satellite to the
United States, Canada, and Latin America.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Chiao continued, Beijing also allocates at
least US$5 million every year to help fund 200 Chinese-language
newspapers and more than 4 million copies of magazines in the United
States. He added that by providing such a wide range of services,
mainland China is gradually gaining momentum in overseas Chinese
communities around the world.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the changing situation of Taiwan and mainland China
among overseas Chinese people, Chiao said Taiwan no longer enjoys the
"monopoly" and the "advantages" which it had from the 1960s to the
1980s. At present, Taiwan and the mainland are at a "competing"
stage, he noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's foreign exchange
reserves in March totaled US$93.005 billion, the highest level since
August 1995, according to statistics released Wednesday by the
Central Bank of China (CBC).</P>
      <P>The number keeps the ROC in third place in the list of global
foreign exchange reserves.</P>
      <P>CBC's statistics show that the ROC's foreign exchange reserves at
the end of March increased US$389 million compared with the previous
month, and grew US$9.39 billion compared with the same month of last
year.</P>
      <P>The nation's foreign exchange reserves first topped US$100
billion in May 1995, at that time, the most in the world. Its foreign
exchange reserves the following month expanded to US$100.41
billion, the nation's historic high.</P>
      <P>The ROC's foreign exchange reserves after July 1995 decreased
gradually due to changes in the domestic financial situation, the
tension of relations across the Taiwan Strait and the Asian financial
turmoil. However, the figures always exceeded the US$80
billion-level.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the New Taiwan stronger dollar against the US dollar,
the nation's foreign exchange reserves rallied month by month. By
December of last year, the figure had risen to US$90.34 billion.</P>
      <P>The ROC's foreign exchange reserves in the first quarter of this
year increased US$2.66 billion. Dealers attributed the rise mainly to
routine monthly interest earned on foreign exchange reserves and the
continuous buying of foreign currencies in Taipei's foreign exchange
market.</P>

Chi said on Wednesday that a range of difficult political topics,
including the "division of China," can be taken up at the forthcoming
talks between the top negotiators from mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su pointed out that the recent remarks by Wang Daohan, chairman

concerning the "division of China" has become "more practical."</P>
      <P>Therefore, he noted that Taipei will not reject political topics
from being on the agenda during the talks this fall in Taiwan between
Wang and his Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>Su refined the current cross-Taiwan Strait state as "a divided
China" -- "there is one China, with two equal political entities."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is not afraid of engaging in talks concerning
the "division of China," "equal status," "diplomacy," and "Theater
Missile Defense," because the results of all talks must be then
scrutinized by the legislature.</P>
      <P>But Su said that reaching satisfactory conclusions to difficult
topics in two or three years is not easy. Therefore, Taipei hopes Koo
and Wang will start their talks with less difficult issues, so as to
gradually improve bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that Taipei will not restrict the topics to be
raised by Koo and Wang, but will oppose Beijing restricting the
cross-strait talks to limited political issues favoring Beijing. (By

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO RESTRUCTURE ECONOMY IN FACE OF NEW CHALLENGES: LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
said Wednesday the country's economy is facing the stern challenges
of restructuring and called on the people to adjust their methods and
thinking in order to strengthen the nation's financial security.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a speech delivered at the Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce general meeting
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's economy having been in the doldrums since last
year due to the Asian financial crisis, but was able to achieve a 4.8
percent growth in 1998, thanks to the joint efforts of the industrial
and business sectors, Lien pointed out.</P>
      <P>Since the 1980's, the ROC has been strengthening its economic
competitiveness and promoting liberalization and globalization by
privatizing state-owned enterprises, developing an Asia-Pacific
Regional Operations Center (APROC) and opening up the manufacturing
and industrial services to foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also achieved satisfying results in upgrading its
industries, Lien said, but cautioned , it doesn't mean there are no
problems in our economic disposition. He called the Asian financial
storm of 1997 a litmus test for Taiwan's economic system.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was less hit by the economic depression due to the
stability of commodity prices, a trade surplus and large foreign
reserves, said Lien. He cautioned that in facing new
challenges, the nation should strive for better discipline and secure
sustainable development.</P>
      <P>As an island, Taiwan lacks natural resources, thus it cannot
afford to destroy the environment, Lien pointed out, adding that the
country needs to strike a balance between economic development and
sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Lien also addressed industrial and business sector concerns, such
as the improvement of public security, increased administrative
efficiency, and an overhaul of the financial sector.</P>
      <P>Lien believed that long-term positive economic developments
depend on strengthening the fundamentals, which means a continuation
of industrial and business research, rising the educational level and
obtaining more advanced technologies to further increase Taiwan's
national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Lien concluded that Taiwan's economy is facing structural
changes. "We need to strengthen the economy fundamentals, restructure
business enterprises and improve our production conditions," he said.
He urged the industrial and business sectors to continue their hard
work to help the ROC's overall economic development.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) on Wednesday issued a statement affirming the
contribution of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) to the safeguard of
Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the TRA's enactment by the
US Congress, the DPP said that the TRA has been "an important
pillar" to the maintenance of the security of the Taiwan Strait and
the peace of East Asia during the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The statement noted that the DPP has no intention of provoking
conflicts between mainland China and Taiwan over the "Taiwan
independence" issue, because the party understands the United States'
deep concern, as stipulated in the TRA, over the stability of the
Western Pacific.</P>
      <P>The DPP indicated it supports the US asking Beijing to give up
military attempts to take over Taiwan, and called for effective
international cooperation to control mainland China's weapon
proliferation.</P>
      <P>The party expressed its appreciation for the US Congress' support
for Taiwan, and hopes that the US will follow the provisos in the
TRA to support Taiwan's entry into the International Monetary Fund,
the World Health Organization and the World Bank.</P>
      <P>The DPP advocates Taiwan's joining the World Trade Organization
(WTO), because only under the WTO guaranteed framework, can
Taiwan gradually open its trade with mainland China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 6 (CNA): The visit of Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji to the United States this week "exposes the absolute weakness
and wrong-headedness of the Clinton-Gore administration's foreign
policy," said Republican presidential contender Gary Bauer Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Rather than considering the many valid reasons why China should
not be rewarded a coveted World Trade Organization (WTO) membership,
President Clinton and his top officials have been pulling out all
stops to seal a deal. Once again, we are confronted by the sad
spectacle of photo-op diplomacy," Bauer noted in a statement.</P>
      <P>"Our foreign policy is being driven by trade considerations.
Rather than basing diplomatic decisions on national security and
support for human rights, we are chasing dollars," added the leading
critic of the Clinton administration's zealous desire to have Beijing
join the WTO.</P>
      <P>By all objective measures, Bauer stressed, "China should be
facing condemnation rather than rewards. The plain fact is that China
has emerged as the world's gravest threat to American values and
security. It is incredible that our leaders refuse to acknowledge
this simple reality."</P>
      <P>He continued that in the last two months, "it has become clear
that China stole some of our most important and sensitive nuclear
secrets; that they continue to threaten the United States and its
allies over important security matters in Asia; and that the Chinese
government continues to ruthlessly clamp down on basic human rights.
Yet this administration rushes to help the Chinese gain a coveted
seat on the WTO."</P>
      <P>Bauer concluded that "It is time to relink human rights
and American values to America's foreign policy with China. We should
put the brakes on Chinese membership in WTO. We should deny China
most favored nation trading status. It is time common sense returned
to American foreign policy."</P>

      <P>A convicted Taiwanese former politician who

      <P>The China Times reported on Wednesday that Nien Chung-jen, the
former deputy speaker of the Changhua County Council, has failed
twice to report to prosecutors in Taitung County despite being
summoned to begin a thirty-five-month sentence.</P>
      <P>A gangster-turned politician, Nien was convicted of one count of
hiring illegal mainlanders as bodyguards, and two counts of
racketeering.</P>
      <P>He has also been convicted of killing a backhoe driver in an
racketeering attempt against his employer, a sand and gravel site
owner. That case is still under review by the Taiwan High Court after
Nien appealed a 20-year imprisonment sentence handed down by the
Taitung District Court.</P>
      <P>Nien was the first gangster-turned politician detained in the
government's crusade against the underworld in 1997. In December of
that year, he was transferred from Green Island Jail where most of
the island's gang lords are detained to a hospital in Hualien County
for medical treatment, and then released on bond of NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>Court documents show that he had a body weight of only 39 kg
when he was released due to kidney disease.</P>
      <P>Nien has failed since the beginning of this year to turn up at

      <P>An official from the Criminal Investigation Bureau told CNA that
police are looking into the allegations that Nien has fled to

    <HEADLINE>LEE   URGES   GOODWILL  TO  PROMOTE  NORMAL  CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said on Wednesday that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should focus
on developing their economies and democracies to maximum the benefit
of the people.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when he met with overseas scholars
prior to an international conference on mainland China's reforms.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the ROC has always worked toward negotiation,
instead of confrontation, and the use of communication to assuage
hostilities between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that Wang Daohan, mainland China's top negotiation with
Taiwan, will visit Taiwan in the autumn, Lee expressed his
sincere welcome, saying that a little more goodwill, and a little
less hostility, a little more mutual trust, and a little less
suspicion, will contribute to normal cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Wang and his Taiwan counterpart, Koo Chen-fu,
last October agreed that they would step up dialogue and engage in an
institutional channel of communication.</P>
      <P>The president also said that democracy will play an ever
increasing important role in the development of cross-strait
relations, adding that when mainland China deepens its reforms, it
will help its democratization. And when the mainland China becomes
more democratic, it will help cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he calls any nation democratic if it respects
human rights, the rule of law, and pays attention to the value and
dignity of men.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that reforms implemented by the mainland have resulted
in structural changes, and that they have substantially improved the
lives of mainland people in coastal areas and major cities.</P>
      <P>As the mainland economy becomes market oriented and privatized,
it effectively undermines the Beijing power base as well as deepens
the craving for democracy among its people, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The president said that during the five decades of separated rule
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the ROC has
pushed through political reforms and economic development. Such a
valuable "Taiwan experience," has won recognition among
the international community and has become the model for developing
countries.</P>
      <P>Lee said the "Taiwan experience" has also played a substantial
role in reforming the mainland, reaffirming that close exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait bring about positive
effects.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference, dubbed "the PRC's Reforms at Twenty: 
Retrospects and Prospects" will open at the Grand Hotel Friday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is mulling a cut in the
number of conscripts from three-fourths of the whole military
strength to one-half, said the Minister of National Defense Tang Fei
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The other half will be filled by volunteer recruits, said Tang,
in a brief to the Legislative Yuan on the military conscription
overhaul.</P>
      <P>Other change aimed at increasing the professionalism of the armed
forces, is shortening the period of mandatory military service from
two years to one year, said Tang.</P>
      <P>Owing to the government's limited financial sources, and the
concerns about national security , Tang ruled out the possibility to
replace draftees completely with recruits, said Tang.</P>
      <P>The MOND set a target of 400,000 as the number of armed force
personnel necessary for the island's defense. That number, however,
is beyond the government's means if some of them were not
conscripted, explained Tang.</P>
      <P>A thoroughly assessment will be completed within two years, and
the half-half formula for draftee and recruits will be appropriate
whatever the strength of armed forces is, said Tang.</P>
      <P>Tang pledged to trim the 60 percent portion of the national
defense budget devoted to armed forces personnel, admitting the
number is high compared to 30 percent in the United States and 50
percent in Japan. Tang blamed the figure on deep cuts in the defense
budget.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Raytheon Co. of the United States will join
Taiwan's Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) in its efforts to tackle
the year 2000 computer problems in the country's industrial sector,
IDB sources reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>IDB forged an agreement Wednesday with Raytheon, formally
contracting the renowned US missile manufacturer to help out in
preparing Taiwan to deal with the Millennium Bug, also known as Y2K.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Raytheon will provide IDB with Y2K
technology and relevant inspection software packages. In return, IDB
will seek offset industrial cooperation contracts for Raytheon from
other related Taiwan companies, said IDB Director General Wang
Ya-kang.</P>
      <P>Wang predicted that 80 percent of the companies in Taiwan's
manufacturing sector will pass the Y2K test on Friday, April 9, or
the 99th day of 1999.</P>
      <P>There is fear worldwide that Y2K may attack as early as April 9
of this year, when internal computer clocks and chip sets show the
numeral 9999. According to the dating system used in some old
computer systems, April 9 is displayed as the 99th day of 1999.</P>
      <P>However, 9999, the highest four-digit number, is also often used
to represent certain special codes, such as a calculation error,
which may lead some older computer systems to crash or display faulty
data.</P>
      <P>Wang expected that 90 percent of the companies in Taiwan's
manufacturing sector will be Y2K compliant by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, personnel from the IDB Y2K Service Group,
the Institute for Information Industry, and the Industrial Technology
Research Institute will regularly attend future training workshops
sponsored by Raytheon in regard to Y2K handling measures and
technologies, Wang added.</P>

      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister David Lee will lead the ROC

      <P>The ROC will also send a second round of cash aid to Macedonia to

officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials, however, would not reveal the exact amount of the
new cash aid to Macedonia, the ROC's most recent ally. It is
understood that the amount will be more than US$2 million.</P>
      <P>Taipei sent US$2 million to Macedonia on March 26 to help the
country settle Albanian refugees from Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Stressing that money is not the only way Taiwan can help its

Macedonia with Taiwan personnel flying there to personally render

    <HEADLINE>DECREASED EXPORTS, INVESTMENTS CAUSED ROC ECONOMIC RECESSION IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A decrease in exports and investment in
domestic inventories were the two major factors that caused the
nation's economic growth rate last year to be significantly lower
than originally targeted, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's economy in 1998 only grew 4.8 percent,
much lower than the expected 6.7 percent level, and the lowest level
since 1983.</P>
      <P>CEPD said due to the lingering effects of the Asian financial
turmoil many of the nation's targeted macroeconomic goals were not
achieved last year.</P>
      <P>However, the CEPD said, compared with other nations in East Asia,
the ROC's macroeconomic performance in 1998 was relatively stable.
The three characteristics of the nation's macroeconomic performance
in 1998 were:</P>
      <P>-- the economy maintained moderate growth;</P>
      <P>-- the misery index increased slightly; and</P>
      <P>-- financial markets fluctuated.</P>
      <P>The nation's 4.8 percent economic growth rate in 1998 ranked the
15th in the world. Due to the New Taiwan dollar's weakness against
the US dollar, the nation's 1998 gross national product (GNP)
declined to US$262.3 billion if calculated in US dollars. The per
capita GNP also dropped to US$12,040, retreating to 1994 and 1995
levels respectively.</P>
      <P>The CEPD indicated that the ROC's exports in 1998 decreased
significantly, leading to a shrinkage of the nation's trade surplus
with a contribution to the overall economy 1.2 percentage
points smaller than estimated.</P>
      <P>Last year, consumption by the ROC government and private sector
kept the nation growing. The two sectors' spending contributed 0.5
percentage points more to the economy than was expected, however,
investments by the government and private sector did not attain
targeted goals.</P>
      <P>Investments in domestic inventories in 1998 declined
significantly, mainly due to a large decline in demand for all
commodities. The nation's total government and private sector
investments in 1998 lagged 0.7 percentage points behind their
targeted contribution rate to the economy.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China welcomes and
appreciates US President Bill Clinton's reaffirmation of his
administration support for the ROC's cause, the Taipei representative
office in the United States said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC embassy in Washington, D.C. issued the
statement after Clinton delivered an important foreign policy
speech, in which he said the United States will continue to maintain
strong, unofficial relations with democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Clinton also reaffirmed the consistent US stance that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should resolve their disputes with
strictly peaceful means. Clinton delivered the speech at a
presentation organized by the US Institute for Peace.</P>
      <P>In response, the ROC representative office said pursuing peaceful
solution to cross-strait disputes has long been Taipei's basic policy
toward its relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Clinton's speech indicates that our stance on the solution to
cross-strait differences complies with America's," the statement
said, adding that the ROC will continue promoting constructive
dialogue and contact with mainland China to forge mutual
understanding and trust.</P>
      <P>The statement went on to say that the ROC deems it a "timely
move" Clinton's reaffirmation of the US policy toward Taiwan as
mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji arrived in Washington, D.C. for
an official visit.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Clinton touched on Taiwan-related topics many
times, signifying his concern about the situation in the Taiwan
Strait as well as the US determination to maintain peace and
stability in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RENOWNED HORSE PAINTER PASSES AWAY AT 90</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A veteran artist known for his paintings of
horses, Yeh Tzuei-pai died of pneumonia Tuesday at the age of 90,
though memories of his paintings and of the artist himself will live
on in fans in both Taiwan and abroad.</P>
      <P>Yeh, a general who followed Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in
battles against the Japanese and against Chinese communists before
turning to painting, will be remembered for Chinese brush paintings
of horses full of life and beauty.</P>
      <P>His most famous work -- "Sky Horse" -- is symbolic of Yeh's
paintings and so illustrious that one of his fans in Japan is
building a "Sky Horse Museum of Fine Art" exclusively to display
Yeh's paintings.</P>
      <P>Kazushige Fujino, a rich Japanese businessman who several years
ago came to Taiwan trying to purchase some artistic masterpieces to
beef up his personal collection, was moved by Yeh's horses and
consequently developed a long-lasting friendship with Yeh.</P>
      <P>Fujino was so touched by Yeh's "Sky Horse" that he wrote an essay
titled "The Dandelion" to describe his feelings as he observed the
flying horse. He said in the article that he found where his heart
belonged simply by looking at the horse.</P>
      <P>He financially sponsored an exhibition of Yeh's works in Tokyo's
Ginza, and is now having built a fine art museum exclusively to
display Yeh's horses. The museum is expected to open to the public on
May 25 this year.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who will be saluted by the Republic of China government in a
military-sponsored funeral service, insisted that he be cremated and
that his ashes be scattered into the Pacific Ocean, according to his
family members.</P>
      <P>During his 50-year artistic career, Yeh was twice conferred with
citations by presidents of the Republic of China and received
numerous awards for his artistic achievements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON AGAIN DEFENDS ENGAGEMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 7 (CNA): The United States has maintained
strong unofficial ties to a democratic Taiwan while upholding its
"one China" policy, and has encouraged both sides to resolve their
differences peacefully and to have increased contact, US President
Bill Clinton said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But he added that the US has also "made clear that neither
can count on our acceptance if it violates these principles".</P>
      <P>In a foreign policy address on US-China relations, Clinton once
again defended his policy of engagement with the People's Republic of
China, claiming that bringing former adversaries Russia and mainland
China into the international system as open, prosperous and stable
nations is one of the major challenges for America in the next
century.</P>
      <P>The president said he wanted to speak about the US' relationship
with the PRC because it is being tested and hotly debated as mainland
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji arrives in Washington.</P>
      <P>A growing number of people, who say that the PRC is the
next great threat to US security and well-being, "are concerned
rightly by Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan and at others," admitted
Clinton, adding, "We know that in the past decade, China has
increased its deployment of missiles near Taiwan. When China tested
some of those missiles in 1996, tensions grew in the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>But Clinton noted, "We demonstrated then with the deployment of
our carriers that America will act to prevent a miscalculation there.
Our interests lie in peace and stability in Taiwan and in China, in
the Strait and in the region, and in a peaceful resolution of the
differences. We will do what is necessary to maintain our interests."</P>
      <P>The United States has known since the early 1980s that the PRC
has nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the US. "Our defense
posture has and will continue to take account of that reality," added
Clinton.</P>
      <P>The president, however, pointed out that because of US
engagement, mainland China has "at best marginally increased its
deployed nuclear threat in the last 15 years." By signing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, mailand China has accepted constraints
on its ability to modernize its arsenal at a time when the nuclear
balance remains overwhelmingly in favor of the United States.</P>
      <P>Clinton also said the United States is determined to prevent the
diversion of technology and sensitive information to the PRC, and the
restrictions placed on US exports to mainland China are tougher than
those applied to any other major exporting country in the world.</P>
      <P>But he believed that mainland China's biggest challenge in the
coming years will be "to maintain stability and growth at home by
meeting, not stifling, the growing demands of its people for openness
and accountability. It is easy for us to say; for them it is a
daunting task."</P>
      <P>In fact, the president continued, almost every goal to which
Beijing leaders are dedicated, from maintaining stability to rooting
out corruption, and to reuniting peacefully with Taiwan, would
actually be advanced if they embraced greater openness and
accountability.</P>
      <P>Yet citing the lessons from Japan's long recession and Russia's
current economic troubles, Clinton said "as we focus on the potential
challenge that a strong China could present to the United States in
the future, let us not forget the risk of a weak China beset by
internal conflicts, social dislocation and criminal activity,
becoming a vast zone of instability in Asia."</P>
      <P>The president noted that "we can only deal with the challenge if
we continue a policy of principled, purposeful engagement with
China's leaders and China's people.....Our long-term strategy must be
to encourage the right kind of development in China, to help China
grow at home into a strong, prosperous and open society coming
together, not falling apart; to integrate China into the institutions
that promote global norms on proliferation, trade, the environment
and human rights."</P>

      <P>Canberra, April 8 (CNA): Australia's unemployment rate is
expected to drop below 7 percent in the second half of this year as
the country's economy continues to perform strongly, employing more
people, according to a new survey by one of the four leading banks
here.</P>
      <P>The quarterly survey by the National Australia Bank shows that
the retail, construction, business service and communication sectors
are shrugging off fears about a global slowdown and as a result
trading conditions and confidence remain high.</P>
      <P>The survey shows improved trading, profitability and employment
conditions throughout the economy during the first three months of
this year. The bank will revise upward a government forecast of
Australia's GDP (gross domestic product) growth to more than 4
percent in fiscal 1998-99 from the previous estimate of 3.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Australia's GDP grew 4.8 percent in fiscal 1997-98, the highest
among developed countries.</P>
      <P>The bank also predicts that employment will rise which will
result in the unemployment rate falling below 7 percent in the second
half of this year. The unemployment rate currently is 7.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello said his government's goal is to
bring the unemployment rate down to 5 percent in the longer term. He

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS LOCAL PEOPLE HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT Y2K</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan people do not know
the Y2K hazard, according to the results of a public opinion poll
released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,216 adults, conducted on April 4-5 by
a market research company at the request of Legislator Lin
Chih-chia, found that 84.7 percent of the respondents said they have
no idea what Y2K means.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 38.3 percent said they think Y2K is a
cosmetic brand name; 15 percent said they deem Y2K a household
article; and only 18.3 percent said they know Y2K refers to the year
2000 computer problem.</P>
      <P>Survey results further show that 67.7 percent of those
interviewed said they do not have confidence in the government's
ability to tackle the Y2K- or Millennium Bug-related issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll found that 80.3 percent of the respondents
have not installed computers in their own home, and as high as 92.5
percent said they do not know the Millennium Bug may attack as early
as Friday or April 9, when internal computer clocks and chipsets
show the numeral 9999. According to the dating system used in some
old computer systems, April 9 is displayed as 99th day of 1999.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, Legislator Lin said the government
is to blame for local people's little knowledge about the possible
Y2K threat to their personal and property safety.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government should step up publicity efforts to help
ordinary members of the public understand the critical Y2K hazard.
He suggested that the Cabinet call an interministerial meeting, to
be chaired by Vice Premier Liu Chao-hsuan, to discuss measures to
ensure "zero defects" in Y2K control at various government
departments and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>Lin also urged local people to check their bank passbooks on
Thursday to avoid any possible financial losses in case the
Millennium Bug really attacks on Friday. "If possible, local people

    <HEADLINE>1 DEAD, 38 INJURED IN TAIPEI BUS ACCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One person was killed and 38 injured on
Thursday morning when one city bus plowed into another, knocking the
second bus into several cars and motorcycles, and then hitting
several others itself.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred at around 8:30 a.m. when a bus driven by
32-year-old Chiu Wen-chih hit another bus at the intersection of
Hsinhseng South Road and Hoping East Road. Chiu, who was driving a
Capital Transport Co. bus, was supposed to have turned left from
Hsinhseng South Road onto Hsinyi Road. But he failed to make the turn
and instead proceeded to the next intersection.</P>
      <P>Chiu did not slow as he neared the intersection, even though
traffic in his direction was stopped for a red light. Chiu's bus, a
No. 226 Capital bus, rear ended a No. 311 Chunghsin bus. Propelled by
the powerful collision, the two buses crashed into five automobiles,
three taxis, three motorcycles and one bike. In all 38 people were
slightly or seriously injured in the accident.</P>
      <P>Twenty-seven-year-old motorcycle driver Kuo Jui-wen was hit by
one of the buses and trapped underneath its wheels. She died after
being rushed to the hospital.</P>
      <P>Police are now investigating the cause of the accident. In
particular they will seek to understand why Chiu did not follow his
normal route and turn from Hsinhseng South Road onto Hsinyi Road.</P>
      <P>Chiu underwent Thursday a series of tests at National Taiwan
University Hospital (NTUH) to ascertain his mental state. Police said
passengers reported that Chiu appeared to be in a trance.</P>
      <P>Capital Transport President Lee Chien-wen said his company would
not seek to escape punishment and would provide compensation if it is
found to have been at fault.</P>
      <P>Lee said initial police investigations indicated that the brakes
on Chiu's bus had failed, and police are trying to determine whether
the failure occurred before or after the accident.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Chiu had worked for Capital for two years and had
a clean record. Before working for Capital, Chiu had been a tour bus
driver, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou paid a visit to the victims
of the accident, who were being treated at NTUH and Jen Ai Hospital.</P>
      <P>Ma also extended his heartfelt condolences to Kuo's family,
saying that he was sorry the accident resulted in the loss of life.
He said he is determined to punish those responsible for the tragedy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE RECEIVES TRADE DELEGATION FROM NEBRASKA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said Thursday the
Republic of China has completed preparations for entry into the World
Trade Organization and that it is waiting for the arrival of the
right time.</P>
      <P>President Lee made the remark when receiving an 11-member
economic and trade delegation from the US state of Nebraska led by
Gov. Mike Johanns.</P>
      <P>Johanns said he last visited the Republic of China seven years
ago. In his current visit, he said he can see that the Republic of
China has made great strides in the development of its political and
economic systems.</P>
      <P>President Lee said that in addition to striving for political and
economic reform, a renaissance of Chinese culture would be conducive
to democratic politics and a free economic system. He also indicated
that the ROC's successful development experience can be a model for
the future development of mainland China.</P>
      <P>In regard to bilateral economic and trade cooperation, President
Lee said Taiwan province and Nebraska state established sisterly ties
in 1983, and the volume of two-way agricultural trade between them
has been significant. There is more room for the two sides to enlarge
this type of trade in the future, he added.</P>
      <P>President Lee said agriculture is not a sunset industry and that
it should be combined with high technology to promote its
development.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Vice Foreign Minister David Lee, the Nebraskan
delegation went to the Presidential Office in the morning to call on
President Lee. Also present were Ding Mou-shih, senior adviser to the
president, and Lin Pi-chao, deputy secretary-general to the

    <HEADLINE>MOTC MINISTER TO FLY TO SHOW CONFIDENCE IN Y2K CONTROL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister
Lin Feng-cheng will travel by air to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung on Friday to show his confidence in the domestic civil
aviation agency's ability to handle the Y2K challenge.</P>
      <P>Lin made the decision during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Transportation and Communications Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, some lawmakers expressed concern about the
Civil Aeronautics Administration's (CAA's) preparedness for the
impending Y2K crisis.</P>
      <P>Opposition Legislator Tsai Huang-lang suggested that Lin take the
first scheduled flight from Taipei to Kaohsiung on April 9 to enhance
the public's confidence in the CAA's ability to tackle the year 2000
computer problems satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>April 9, when some internal computer clocks and chipsets will
show the numeral 9999, is likely to be the first day when the Y2K,
also known as the Millennium Bug, may attack. According to the dating
system used in some old computer systems, April 9 will be displayed
as the 99th day of 1999.</P>
      <P>The problem with this is that the numeral 9999 is also used as a
computer error code, which means computers may crash or behave
erratically when they read the number.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin said he would accept Tsai's proposal if the
legislative committee made a formal decision on the proposed travel
plan.</P>
      <P>The committee then adopted a resolution inviting Lin and CAA
Director-General Chang Yo-heng to take a flight to Kaohsiung on
Friday in the company of committee members.</P>
      <P>Lin, Chang and several legislators will take a UNI Airlines
flight from Taipei to Kaohsiung at 6:55 a.m. on Friday, and return to
Taipei after having breakfast at Kaohsiung airport.</P>
      <P>"The round-trip flight is mainly aimed at demonstrating to the
public that our civil aviation facilities will be able to pass the
Y2K challenges," Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the face of the possible computer failures on Friday, Lin
said, the CAA has formed a special task force to handle any
emergencies. "The CAA Y2K special task force will begin operations on
Thursday evening and will not be disbanded until 8 a.m. April 10, by
which time we will have been able to prove that our civil aviation
control system can survive the Y2K test," the minister noted.</P>
      <P>Lin further said if the aviation control system is affected by
the Millennium Bug, the CAA has two measures to cope with the
situation. One is to resume the operating system used 28 years ago,
while the other is to resort to manual operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said all other operations and services under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC), including freeway toll collection, mobile phone
communications and postal savings deposits and money transfer
services, have also already been adjusted to cope with possible Y2K
challenges.</P>
      <P>"I believe there will not be any problems with any
MOTC-administered services on Friday. We will be able to pass the
Y2K-related tests," Lin said confidently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US POLICY ANALYST SAYS US MUST STAND UP FOR TMD SYSTEM IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  7 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's increased deployment
of missiles near Taiwan requires that the United States sell Taiwan
Theater Missile Defense systems, and such sales are consistent with
the goal of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act as well as the US goal that
future Taiwan-mainland China relations be determined by peaceful
means, according to a senior American policy analyst.</P>
      <P>Richard D. Fisher, Jr., director of the Asian Studies Center at
the Heritage Foundation, wrote Wednesday in a background analysis
that mainland China's growing missile forces and its campaign to
block the development and deployment of US missile defenses pose a
serious challenge to US-mainland China relations and to stability in
Asia.</P>
      <P>The prevention of a future crisis with mainland China requires
that America be firm and resolute in responding to future mainland
Chinese threats. "Missile defenses in Asia can help to persuade China
that missile competition with the United States cannot succeed, and
that China must instead refrain from threatening the US and its Asian
neighbors," said the analyst.</P>
      <P>Fisher noted that revelations that mainland China stole US
nuclear warhead secrets highlight two strategic challenges to the
United States. First, new, small nuclear warheads -- developed with
the help of US information on warhead designs -- will allow mainland
China to put multiple warheads on new intercontinental ballistic
missiles or equip short-range missiles with nuclear warheads.</P>
      <P>In Asia, mainland China already has increased to over 100 the
number of missiles targeted at Taiwan, and future theater ballistic
and cruise missiles could threaten US forces and allies in Asia, said
Fisher.</P>
      <P>Second, mainland China's vigorous campaign to block missile
defense cooperation between the United States and Japan and future US
sales of missile defense equipment to Taiwan "seeks to preserve a
growing advantage in missile forces while putting great pressure on
US allies in Asia in the hope that this will weaken their alliances
with the United States," he said.</P>
      <P>Fisher said if the United States and its allies did not cooperate
in missile defenses, this would "undermine allied confidence in US
defense commitments and force Asian states to consider building their
own missiles to deter China."</P>
      <P>The People's Liberation Army hopes that by developing a range of
nuclear and non-nuclear missiles, it can deter American support for
Taiwan and project military power in Asia, added the analyst.</P>
      <P>For mainland China, missiles are a weapon system that it can
produce; it has much difficulty in producing modern combat aircraft
and warships. Missiles also address a military weakness of the United
States and its allies: the lack of effective missile defense systems,
said Fisher.</P>
      <P>He continued that by having more accurate missiles mainland China
will be able to seek greater political leverage in Asia, and mainland
China will likely use the threat of its new missile forces to coerce
political concessions, especially from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fisher wrote that mainland China also hopes to create the
impression that American defensive missiles, not mainland China's
offensive missiles, threaten peace in Asia. But it can be expected
that mainland China will increase its missile forces in response to
US missile defense plans. The Clinton administration is not
responding adequately to mainland China's threats and is not
sufficiently affirming the need for US missile defenses, he said.</P>
      <P>"China's attack against US missile defense plans must be seen as
an attempt to limit the future scope of US alliances in Asia. This is
unacceptable for the United States, as its alliances are a vital
element of its national security in Asia," said Fisher.</P>
      <P>To prevent the US-mainland China relationship from lapsing into a
Cold War-like confrontation, Fisher stressed that America must
demonstrate resolve and leadership in responding to the challenge of
mainland China's growing missile forces and its anti-missile defense
campaign.</P>
      <P>The United States should state that mainland China's missiles
threaten peace in Asia; deploy national missile defenses; use
Theater Missile Defense systems to strengthen US alliances in Asia;
sell Theater Missile Defense systems to Taiwan; and suspend
commercial space cooperation with mainland China pending missile
control negotiations, concluded Fisher.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT IS 20 YEARS OLD (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), a US law
that governs unofficial ties between the United States and the
Republic of China on Taiwan, will be 20 years old on April 10.</P>
      <P>US President Jimmy Carter announced on Dec. 15, 1978 that the
United States had decided to establish diplomatic relations with the
People's Republic of China on Jan. 1, 1979 and cut its formal ties
with the Republic of China. A special law was needed to regulate
America's relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal ties.</P>
      <P>In late January 1979, President Carter sent a hastily drafted
bill, known as the Omnibus Bill, to the US Congress for deliberation
and enactment. The bill clarified the application of American laws to
the people of Taiwan so as to allow for an unofficial relationship
between the peoples of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Many members of Congress were unhappy with Carter because of his
decision to recognize Beijing without fully consulting them. They
also thought Carter had not given enough consideration to the
security of Taiwan and its people. Therefore, they decided to revise
the draft bill by adding new provisions that offered more security
guarantees to Taiwan. The revised bill, later known as the TRA, was
signed into law by Carter on April 10, 1979.</P>
      <P>In addition to maintaining cultural and commercial ties between
the United States and the Republic of China, the law also allows the
United States to sell defensive weapons and equipment to Taiwan to
ensure its security.</P>
      <P>After Washington recognized mainland China, the Sino(ROC)-US
Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1954 was suspended, resulting in the
withdrawal of American forces stationed in Taiwan. The TRA then
became a timely replacement to the mutual defense treaty.</P>
      <P>Under the TRA, the United States is obliged to assist Taiwan when
it faces a military threat. During the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis,
caused by the firing of missiles into the seas around Taiwan by
mainland Chinese forces during military exercises, the US government

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT IS 20 YEARS OLD  (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the implementation of the TRA, commercial and cultural
relations between the two countries have developed steadily despite
the lack of formal ties. ROC-US trade in 1978 was a mere US$7.3
billion. The two-way trade volume between the two countries reached
US$49.07 billion in 1998, an increase of more than six fold over 20
years. The Republic of China has become an important trading partner
of the United States.</P>
      <P>In 1978, the ROC government approved 10 investment projects in
Taiwan from the United States with a combined capital of US$69.8
million. Last year, 208 projects with a total investment of US$887.2
million were approved, a 12-fold increase in 20 years. Meanwhile, the
ROC's investments in the United States jumped from US$3.3 million in
1978 to US$598.7 million last year.</P>
      <P>Culturally, the United States has continued to be the ideal place
for Taiwan students to pursue advanced studies. In 1978, 4,350 Taiwan
students went to the United States for advanced studies. By 1998 that
figure had jumped to 13,190.</P>
      <P>Arms sales constitute the core of the TRA, which stipulates that
the United States shall sell sufficient defensive weapons and
equipment to Taiwan to meet its security needs. As a result, the
Republic of China has been able to buy tanks, missiles, warships, jet
fighters and other military hardware from the United States. The
ROC's total purchases since the act's enactment are estimated at some
US$40 billion.</P>
      <P>Jaw Ling Joanne Chang, a research fellow at Academia Sinica's
Institute of European and American Studies, said during a recent CNA
interview that the TRA has served the following purposes:</P>
      <P>--It has prevented crises and deterred Beijing aggression toward
Taiwan;</P>
      <P>--It has created a viable environment for Taiwan to develop its
economy and democratic political system;</P>
      <P>--It has enabled the people of Taiwan to pursue a free,
democratic and prosperous life, setting a good example for mainland
China to follow; and</P>
      <P>--It has given Taiwan confidence to increase contacts with
mainland China and hold dialogue with Beijing on matters of mutual
concern, such as the reunification of China.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The TRA is not perfect. Despite the useful role the TRA has
played in the past 20 years, there are still areas in the law that
could be improved to make it more effective, Chang said.</P>
      <P>For example, the provision that says the United States shall sell
defense articles and services to Taiwan in such quantities as are
"necessary" to enable Taiwan to maintain a "sufficient" self-defense
capacity does not indicate whose standards of necessity or
sufficiency should be applied--Taiwan's or Washington's, she said.</P>
      <P>Besides, the US president and the US Congress should also jointly
determine the nature and quantity of arms to be sold to Taiwan,
according to the TRA. In fact, it is usually the executive branch of
the US government that has the final say over arms sales. She
suggested that the US president and Congress keep in close contact in
making decisions on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Jason Hu praised the US Congress for
its role in both the enactment and the implementation of the TRA,
which has functioned well in the past 20 years in promoting
unofficial relations between the two countries. In this regard, he
said in a recent interview with CNA, Taiwan should maintain good
communication with the US Congress to ensure its interests remain
effectively protected.</P>
      <P>During the past couple of years, there have been suggestions that
some provisions of the TRA should be revised in light of a changing
cross-strait situation. Revisions may be helpful, but Taiwan should
keep a close watch that they do not produce negative effects, he
said.</P>
      <P>Twenty years have passed since the TRA was enacted. The Republic
of China has through the years become more democratic and more
prosperous, he said. To further strengthen bilateral relations,
Washington should change its policy by promoting
government-to-government dialogue with Taipei and allowing visits by
higher ranking officials to each other's country in the 21st century,
Minister Hu urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SCORES US$1.09 BILLION TRADE SURPLUS IN MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan scored a US$1.09 billion trade
surplus in March -- its third consecutive surplus and an increase of
US$700 million compared with the same period last year, according to
government statistics released Thursday.</P>
      <P>A summary of imports and exports that cleared Taiwan customs in
March showed that exports totaled US$10.41 billion, while imports
totaled US$9.32 billion. Both levels were the highest seen since last
April, though March exports were 1.6 percent lower than in March
1998, while imports were 8.5 percent lower. The figures were released
by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>For the first three months of this year, Taiwan's exports totaled
US$27.8 billion and its imports, US$25.13 billion. Year-to-March
exports are 3.5 percent higher than during the same 1998 period,
while year-to-March imports are 6.8 percent lower.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has amassed a year-to-March trade surplus of US$2.67
billion, compared with a deficit of US$100 million in the same 1998
period.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of MOF's Department of Statistics, said
three consecutive monthly trade surpluses will help improve Taiwan's
international current account. Taiwan's quarterly trade conditions
have improved from negative to positive growth, indicating that
Taiwan's foreign trade will likely return to normal and become
stable, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the director noted that the Wharton Econometric
Forecasting Association has predicted 3.4-percent global trade growth
for 1999, up from 3-percent growth last year. This will also benefit
Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>The construction of Taiwan's high-speed railway and the Y2K
crisis will surely attract more investments in capital goods, which
in turn is expected to accelerate the pace of the resurgence of the
domestic economy, he said.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Trend Micro Inc. was
the world's first computer software firm to devise a program to
counter a cunning virus called Melissa, just 20 minutes after the
virus was discovered, a company executive said here on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Trend Micro Southeast Asian Affairs Manager L.C. Lu, who flew
into Singapore to attend an Internet technology fair, said that the

70 minutes -- 20 minutes to devise the anti-Melissa software, and 50
minutes to upload the program -- to enable users worldwide to counter
the Melissa virus after it appeared in E-mail systems on March 26.</P>
      <P>Lu attributed Trend Micro's fast response to the widespread use

    <HEADLINE>REFORMS FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECT MAINLAND CHINA: US CHINA HAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has been fundamentally
affected by reforms that have taken place there over the past two
decades, a US China hand said in Taipei on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Harry Harding, dean of the Elliott School of International
Affairs at George Washington University, made the remarks during a
keynote speech at an international conference to review the reforms
over the past two decades in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Harding, who was among several people who briefed US President
Bill Clinton before his visit to the mainland last year, noted that
the reforms have seen the rise of nationalism in the mainland which
he said has made the issue of China's unification more urgent.</P>
      <P>The scholar noted that the reforms have led to the virtual
extinction of ideology, as the mainland no longer stresses the
liberation of Taiwan -- an ideology which has preoccupied Beijing's
leaders in the past.</P>
      <P>Noting that the rise of nationalism has provided unity and
direction for the country, he also said that territory issues,
unification, and the development of a comprehensive national power
have become mainland China's prime objectives.</P>
      <P>But Beijing's leaders have become more "impatient" with
unification as they cannot understand why Taiwan will not accept
terms of unification which are more generous than in the past as the
socioeconomic gap between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait narrows.</P>
      <P>On the effect on relations between the United States and mainland
China, he said that increasingly, the issue between the mainland and
the United States is not ideology but the relative power of two major
nations, one of which is a status quo power and the other a rising
force.</P>
      <P>Harding said that the reforms over the past two decades have had
a far-reaching effect on mainland China's foreign policy and its
relations with other countries.</P>
      <P>He said that as mainland China gradually becomes an emerging
power, it becomes more resistant to pressure from other countries, a
situation which also affects cross-strait relations and relations
between mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Harding said that the mainland and the United States should also
define the role each plays in Asia. He said crucial issues will be
whether the United States will be willing to accept the mainland as
the emerging power in the region, and whether the mainland will be
willing to accept the role of the United States as holder of the
balance of power in the region.</P>
      <P>He also said that although the reforms have opened mainland China
to an unprecedented degree, making it a major world trading partner
with major investment from the United States, Japan, the European
Union and Taiwan, the trade barriers it has erected against its
trading partners have become a source of tension.</P>
      <P>He noted that the large trade imbalance Beijing enjoys has become
unacceptable for the United States, while in the case of Taiwan, the
concern has been more that the large amount of investment from Taiwan
has made the island more dependent on the mainland, which the
mainland could use as leverage against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that human rights have seen improvement in mainland
China, but have also become a source of irritation with many other
nations, noting that the improvements are not "complete, even or
continuous," citing the practice of forced abortion and the situation
in Tibet as examples.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that while this has not affected mainland China's
foreign policy, it has affected its foreign relations with other
neighboring countries, and noted that the United States has put the
issue high on its mainland agenda.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan too, the issue is becoming increasingly important, he
said, noting that Taiwan will ask how can it even consider
unification until the issues of democratization and the honoring of
human rights have moved further along.</P>
      <P>He also said that Beijing has engaged in a more cooperative
foreign policy but this has not lessened the tension with other
nations, noting that although Beijing participates in many
international institutions, compliance with international norms is
still incomplete.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to the next century, Harding said that reforms in
mainland China have been a mixed blessing for the United States and
Taiwan alike, pointing out that they have not resolved some problems
but have created several new ones which the rest of the world has had
to prepare for.</P>
      <P>He also attributed the contractions of the reform process to the
fact that Beijing's leaders do not see reforms as good things, but as
a necessary evil required to develop a "comprehensive national
power."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NORMALIZATION OF CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS URGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China should promote
the normalization of their relations and work together for the
long-term welfare of all Chinese people, President Lee Teng-hui said
here Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the 14th plenary meeting of the National Unification
Council (NUC), Lee said that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
should try to normalize their relations through constructive dialogue
"with democracy and peace as the main pivots."</P>
      <P>"We welcome a visit to Taiwan by Mr. Wang Daohan... to continue
the constructive dialogue launched last year, and to facilitate a
meeting between the top leaders of the two sides," Lee said. Wang,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), is mainland China's chief negotiator with Taiwan. His
Taiwan counterpart is Koo Cheng-fu, chairman of the Strait Exchange
Foundation (SEF). Koo visited the Chinese mainland last year.</P>
      <P>"The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should resume the
institutionalized cross-strait consultations as quickly as possible
... and gradually establish mechanisms for cross-strait peace and
stability," Lee said, adding that the two sides should "expand and
enhance the scope of cross-strait exchanges and cooperation to build
mutual trust and seek mutual benefits."</P>
      <P>To reach the goal of national unification, the two sides should
narrow the gap between them, Lee said. "Only when mainland China
quickly accomplishes its social diversification and political
democratization, can the two sides gradually establish consensus
regarding future developments on the basis of democracy and
freedom."</P>
      <P>"We call upon the Beijing authorities to open their minds, cease
their internal suppression of different voices, protect human rights,
and create room for everyone to fully express his or her free will,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The NUC, established in 1990, functions as an advisory board and
provides the President with research findings and ideas. The council
has 61 members and researchers. The 13th plenary meeting of the
council was held in July, 1998.</P>
      <P>President Lee, who heads the NUC, said "Our unswerving
objectives are peace, mutual benefit and joint prosperity for both
sides of the Taiwan Strait." The government's mainland policy has
not been changed, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that the development of cross-strait relations
"should begin from the recognition of historical fact and the
political reality of separate rule by two distinct but equal
political entities." "While promoting cross-strait relations, we must
not waver in our stance of giving top priority to national existence,
as well as placing the people's safety and welfare foremost."</P>
      <P>"If Beijing authorities reduce their hostilities toward us and
concurrently diminish the uncertainties in mainland China's
development, then there may be a greater shift in this government's
policies," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is forced to continue the policy of "avoid haste, be
patient; walk steadily to go far," because Beijing's hostilities
towards Taiwan continue to deepen, he pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE'S CLOSING REMARKS TO NUC'S 14TH PLENUM (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of the
speech delivered by President Lee Teng-hui at the closing ceremony of
the 14th Plenum of the National Unification Council (NUC) on
Thursday:</P>
      <P>Vice-Chairmen of the Council; Members of the Council; Members of
the Research Council:</P>
      <P>After rigorous deliberations, the 14th Plenum of the National
Unification Council will be closing shortly. I would like thank you
again for attending the meeting today and for offering your valuable
recommendations on matters concerning international affairs, mainland
affairs and cross-strait relations, which will be forwarded to the
relevant government agencies for their reference. I am certain that
your recommendations will be helpful to the formulation of our
policies and programs toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>It is of timely significance that the plenary meeting of the NUC
is being held now. Looking at the current trend of world, it
continues to develop in the general directions of peace, cooperation
and prosperity. Interminable regional conflicts notwithstanding, as
the tides of globalization, information and democratization continue
to spread throughout the world, the depth of mutual interdependence
among countries and among regions deepens every day, while the
expectations of countries for political democracy, economic
prosperity and world peace grow more ardent. As for Asia Pacific,
this region was ravaged severely by a financial storm during the last
two years. The most difficult period may be over, but the turbulence
has yet to subside. All the countries in this region now fully
understand the urgency of economic and financial stability and
re-acknowledge the importance of regional mechanisms for dialogue.</P>
      <P>After the end of the Cold War, all the countries in the world
have strengthened dialogue and cooperation to reduce tensions and
maintain safety. However, to this day the security of Taiwan Strait
and the South Seas, important air and sea passageways in the West
Pacific, cannot yet be ensured. The major reasons are the refusal of
Peking authorities to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, the
rapid expansion in their military budget year after year, the
acceleration of their deployment of missiles and other offensive
weapons, and their unilateral suspension of institutionalized
cross-strait consultations. These actions delay the establishment of
normal relations between the two sides and present a threat to the
security and stability of the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>In recent years, significant internal and external changes have
occurred in Mainland China. The social and economic developments
since its reform and opening up have gradually affected the political
sphere. Its people not only have demanded economic liberalization,
but also have begun to seek political democratization. Concurrent
with developing the economy, however, the Chinese communists have
suppressed democracy and human rights inside the mainland to preserve
their one party dictatorship rule. On the other hand, in their
external relations, they have pursued outward expansion and aspired
for regional hegemony. All of the above make Mainland China an
important variable in the security of the Asia Pacific region.
Whether the Peking authorities can respond to their domestic demands
for democracy and human rights and participate in international
frameworks and mechanisms of peace and cooperation will significantly
affect the well being of all Chinese people and peace of the world.

the ROC has become mature and has taken root. These elections have
fully manifested our democratic values, rational demands and peaceful
process. Such rational and mature political environment has enabled
the government and people to remain calm, think objectively, and
effectuate policy measures in facing the new challenges of the new
century, as well as in promoting new developments for a new era. In
particular, by firmly rooting our foundation in democracy and human
rights, we have received world affirmation and recognition for
promoting pragmatic diplomacy and strengthening international
cooperation. The ROC thereby has become a new force for world peace
and development.</P>
      <P>Concerning the development of cross-strait relations, the ROC has
always acknowledged historical reality and given primary
consideration to safeguarding the people*s welfare. Since 1987 when
the ROC government lifted the ban on family visits to the mainland,
our unswerving objectives are peace, mutual benefit and joint
prosperity for both sides of the Taiwan Strait. My abolishing the
Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist
Rebellion in 1991, is a concrete demonstration of our sincerity to
abandon the use of force in resolving cross-strait issues. In
addition, we have pragmatically faced the reality of the existence of
Peking authorities, and further have begun cross-strait exchanges
based on the principles of parity and reciprocity. Further
developments and implementation of these policies include the first
Koo-Wang talks, many rounds of institutionalized consultations
between the two sides, and my "six positions" regarding the
establishment of normal bilateral relations, which I first announced
four years ago today at your Plenary Meeting. These six positions
are: to pursue unification of China based on the reality that the two
sides are governed separately by two distinct political entities; to
strengthen cross-strait exchanges based on Chinese culture; to
enhance trade and economic relations to develop a mutually beneficial
and complementary relationship; to ensure that both sides join
international organizations on an equal footing and that the leaders
of both sides meet in a natural setting; to adhere to the principle
of resolving all disputes by peaceful means; and to jointly safeguard
prosperity and promote democracy in Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the Peking authorities have never responded
reasonably to our goodwill and sincerity. They even have gone so far
as to unilaterally distort reality and create tensions in the Taiwan
Strait. Nevertheless, under the patient and persistent efforts of the
ROC, Mr. Koo Chen-Fu led a delegation to the mainland last October.
This visit is a constructive step forward for peace in the Taiwan
Strait and security in the Asia Pacific region and lets the Peking
authorities have some rudimentary understanding of the essence and
accomplishment of our democracy.</P>
      <P>After today, our first task in the promotion of cross-strait
relations is to increase our understanding of Mainland China. We must
not only look at a particular event, published statistics, or the
superficial impressions of tourists to the mainland. Rather, we must
fully grasp the total situation there. Without question, the ability
of Mainland China to attain wealth and peace deserves applause.
However, we should not be overly optimistic and create expectations
based on wishful thinking. Nor, should we be excessively pessimistic
and make mistakes in judgement. What we must do is to present a clear
comparison based on objective facts. Presently, there exists a high
degree of uncertainty in Mainland China. If such uncertainties cannot
be eliminated quickly, then the basic reforms cannot be completed.
For example, some uncertainties are created from systemic ambiguities
and others are produced by the delays in democratization. Still,
additional uncertainties result from the rule of man rather than the
rule of law. These uncertainties leave open a big question mark on
the future development of Mainland China.

PRESIDENT LEE'S CLOSING REMARKS TO NUC'S 14TH PLENUM (III)</P>
      <P>In recent years, all the countries around the world take into
consideration the above uncertainties in formulating their policies
toward Mainland China. The ROC is separated from the mainland by only
a body of water and there are frequent exchanges between the two
sides. Therefore, it is even more impossible for the ROC to ignore
these profoundly ingrained changes. If Peking authorities reduce
their hostilities toward us and concurrently diminish the
uncertainties in Mainland China*s development, then there may be a
greater shift in this government*s policies. Nonetheless, while our
good intentions are currently on the rise, Peking*s hostilities
continue to deepen. We have been unable to achieve our win-win
scenario and are forced to continue our policy of "avoid haste, be
patient; walk steadily to go far."</P>
      <P>Therefore, we must insist on the following:</P>
      <P>1. The development of cross strait relations should begin from
recognition of the historical fact and political reality of separate
rule by two distinct but equal political entities.</P>
      <P>2. While promoting cross-strait relations, we must not waver in
our stance of giving top priority to national existence, as well as
placing the people*s safety and welfare foremost.</P>
      <P>As we look ahead to the 21st century, creating peace based on
democracy and stimulating progress through cooperation have already
become unstoppable global trends. Looking to the future, the two
sides of the strait should work together to create a new horizon.
That is, with democracy and peace as the main pivots, they should
promote the normalization of bilateral relations through constructive
dialogue, and jointly seek the long-term welfare of all Chinese
people on both sides of the strait. Toward this, I would like to
raise the following points:</P>
      <P>1. We welcome a visit to Taiwan by Mr. Wang Daohan, Chairman of
the Association for Relations Across the Strait, to continue the
constructive dialogue launched last year, and to facilitate a meeting
between the top leaders of the two sides.</P>
      <P>2. The two sides of the Strait should resume the
institutionalized cross-strait consultations as quickly as possible
to address the myriad functional problems that have arisen from
cross-strait exchanges and gradually establish mechanisms for
cross-strait peace and stability.</P>
      <P>3. Expand and enhance the scope of cross-strait exchanges and
cooperation to build mutual trust and seek mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>4. Narrow the development gap between the two sides to bring
about unification. Only when Mainland China quickly accomplishes its
social diversification and political democratization, can the two
sides gradually establish consensus regarding future developments on
the basis of democracy and freedom. We call upon the Peking
authorities to open their minds, cease their internal suppression of
different voices, protect human rights, and create room for everyone
to fully express his or her free will.</P>
      <P>Ladies and gentlemen: in this global community where interaction
among members grow closer every day, the peace and stability of the
Taiwan Strait and the development of cross-strait relations have
already become major regional issues and widely receive the attention
of the world. We must acknowledge this significant trend. Therefore,
how to create future prospects for the two sides of the strait using
ingenious intelligence, flexible policies, and constructive actions
is something that all the people should jointly work for and
contemplate. I hope the Peking authorities will also uphold good
intentions and pragmatically face the tide of global development to
work together with us to create a vast development horizon for all
Chinese on both sides of the strait in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Thank you all.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA CRITICIZED OVER PLAN TO HOUSE ALBANIAN REFUGEES IN BASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's plan to house most of the
4,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in regional military bases has come
under strong criticism from critics who demanded that the Howard
administration treat them more humanely because of the trauma they
have suffered as targets of an ehtnic cleansing campaign by Serbian
troops in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Opposition leader Kim Beazley of the Labor Party said he did not
agree with the government plan to send the Albanian refugees to
remote areas of Australia.</P>
      <P>"I don't want them to go into an experience of Australia that is
ungenerous, that is distant, that is only going to add to the traumas
they' ve already experienced," he told reporters on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Greg Sheridan, foreign editor of the Australian, on Thursday said
in an article that the 4000 refugees are new "mates" who deserve a
fair go while staying in Australia.</P>
      <P>"Having decided to accept 4000 Kosovo Albanian refugees, it is
crucial now that the Howard government treat them decently and avoid
the mentality of punishment and control that has characterized so
much of our recent refugee policy," he said.</P>
      <P>The Australian governments have been criticized for mistreating
the Cambodian boat people, who languished for years in the isolated
Port Hedland detention facility in Western Australia.</P>
      <P>Even before the government decision on how to airlift these
Albanian refugees, Prime Minister John Howard said on Wednesday that
his government would introduce a special legislation on April 19 when
Parliament resumes session in which it will prevent all the Albanian
refugees from applying for social security benefits or permanent
residence.</P>
      <P>Howard wanted to prevent the recurrence of the asylum given to
more than 55,000 Chinese students and refugees during the Tienanmen
Square massacre in Beijing in 1989.</P>
      <P>Most of the Chinese refugees were first granted an extended stay
of four years and then given permanent residence later.</P>
      <P>Michelle Grattan, an editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, said
the circumstances are not exactly parallel, but the lesson is. In
1993, the Chinese were given permanent residence. There were no other
choice.</P>
      <P>"The same will have to be -- and should be -- done eventually for
the Kosovo people if they cannot go home," she said.</P>
      <P>But Howard said the government planned to allow them a
three-month temporary stay in Australia and the stay can be extended
if the Albanian refugees could not go home.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said ethnic Albanian refugees
will be allowed to stay in private homes if they have sponsors. But
the government is preparing to house most of them in military
facilities where they would be supplied with food, medical support
and other care in addition to shelters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO CONTINUE PURSUING PRAGMATIC DIPLOMACY: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
said on Thursday that Taipei will continue to pursue pragmatic
diplomacy, and expressed the hope that Beijing will not deem this an
attempt at "national division."</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks in a report titled "The current external
relations of the country -- cross-century pragmatic diplomacy" which
he delivered at a general meeting of the National Unification
Council.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taipei cannot accept Beijing's concept of the
ROC's pragmatic diplomacy along with the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations as being a "zero sum" relationship.</P>
      <P>Instead, the foreign minister said, Taipei's pragmatic diplomacy
and its mainland policy "absolutely can be complementary to each
other."</P>
      <P>Hu stated that Taiwan and mainland China are equal political
entities under separate rule, and that both sides are entitled to
international space for their survival until reunification.</P>
      <P>This being the case, he said, Taipei will not alter its policy of
pursuing pragmatic diplomacy, despite the all-out containment efforts
and oppression from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hu criticized Beijing for trying to lure away the ROC's
diplomatic allies, describing it as an obvious attempt to force
Taiwan to start political talks with Beijing, and to reunify with the
mainland under Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister pointed out that pursuing pragmatic
diplomacy is the consensus of the people of Taiwan, and he said he
hoped that Beijing will understand that its relentless oppression of
this pragmatic diplomacy is the source of Taiwan's antipathy toward
Beijing.</P>
      <P>He cited as proof of this a public opinion survey conducted by
the Mainland Affairs Council in October last year, in which about 70
percent of those polled said they were against stopping pragmatic
diplomacy in exchange for goodwill from Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the report, Hu acknowledged that mainland China has been
making efforts to improve its economic and political power, to play
an active role in international affairs, and to increase its military
buildup.</P>
      <P>He said that these developments have not only affected Taiwan's
security and the stability of the Asia-Pacific region, but have also
prompted the United States to formulate new security guidelines with
Japan and to consider introducing the Theater Missile Defense system
to the region.</P>
      <P>Hu said that while pursuing its pragmatic diplomacy, the ROC has
no intention of challenging or creating rivalry with Beijing, and
will not interfere in foreign countries' development of relations
with Beijing, so long as Taiwan's interests are not sacrificed.</P>
      <P>Facing the new century, the foreign minister said the country's
pragmatic diplomacy will continue to put forward and strengthen its
existing traditional political and diplomatic engagements.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that positive efforts will also be given to the
following six areas: 1. economic, trade and investment diplomacy; 2. 
Internet diplomacy; 3. congressional and party diplomacy; 4. academic
and democracy diplomacy; 5. humanitarian diplomacy; and 6. cultural
and sporting diplomacy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>END TO CROSS-STRAIT HOSTILITY TAIWAN'S MAIN CONCERN: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
reaffirmed on Thursday that the termination of cross-strait hostility
and the promotion of security in the Taiwan Strait are the primary
concerns of his government.</P>
      <P>Lien said that any development that runs counter to these
concepts is bound to cause international concern, and noted that a
stable and peaceful development between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is crucial to regional stability and peace.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks at the National Unification Council (NUC)
conference which took place on Thursday.</P>
      <P>He noted that a majority of the people of Taiwan support the
ideas espoused by President Lee Teng-hui at the closing ceremony of
the last NUC conference in July last year.</P>
      <P>The president said at that time that although there will be a
united China in the future, the China of the present is divided and
under separate rule.</P>
      <P>He also said that the democratization of the mainland and
cross-strait development will dictate the process of peaceful
reunification. In addition, he said that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should expand exchanges, and concentrate on cooperation rather
than confrontation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speaking on the same occasion as Lien, Premier Vincent
Siew said that the government has made appropriate arrangements for a
visit to Taiwan this autumn by Wang Daohan, the mainland's top
negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew said that Taiwan welcomes Wang's visit, and hopes that it
will correct the lack of communication across the Taiwan Strait over
the years and open up a mechanism for systematic dialogue.</P>
      <P>But the premier also expressed the hope that Beijing will not set
preconditions for such dialogue.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the dialogue channel between the Straits Exchange
Foundation and its mainland counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, has been operating for years, and
is the only channel authorized by their respective governments for
cross-strait contact.</P>
      <P>He stressed that this dialogue channel should be kept viable and
not neglected or cast aside.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that both before and after Wang's visit,
the two intermediary bodies will continue to consult on issues
concerning the rights of the people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, especially the establishment of cross-strait exchanges, and
the protection of the personal security and investments of Taiwan
businessmen in the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said that more consultation between the two sides will be
better than less consultation, and that it is better to solve
tangible issues pragmatically rather than becoming mired in thorny
political issues.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan would like to increase agricultural and
technological exchanges, and to join forces with the mainland to
combat crime so as to promote mutual trust and create an environment
conducive to reciprocal exchanges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former mainland Chinese public security
official was executed in January in Jilin Province, northeastern
mainland China, for murdering a businessman from Taiwan and others,
according to a mainland Chinese newspaper report on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Anhui Legal Daily reported that Chuang Weihua, a former
public security official from the province's Helung City, was
executed in Helung along with an accomplice, identified as Bu
Huxiong.</P>
      <P>The daily said Chuang met Bu and another accomplice, Fan Dezhung,
in jail while serving a seven-year sentence in 1981. Fan is still at
large, the newspaper said.</P>
      <P>After his release, Chuang managed to find a job with the public
security office in Helung City in 1993, and worked as a deputy
director of the office, doubling as the manager of a subsidiary
office.</P>
      <P>He then hired his former fellow inmates Bu and Fan as assistants,
the daily said.</P>
      <P>On March 23, 1994, Chuang and his two accomplices lured Taiwan
businessman Wu Ching-yu and his four mainland Chinese business
associates to Helung by falsely offering to sell them a batch of
Japan-made motorcycles at an attractive price.</P>
      <P>Chuang and his two associates drugged the five men, bludgeoned
three of them to death, and dumped their bodies in an underground
vault.</P>
      <P>The next day, they escorted the other two to a bank to withdraw
90,000 yuan from the account owned by Wu's company. They were both
later killed.</P>
      <P>Wu's sister in Taiwan wrote a letter to Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation in June of 1994, asking for help to locate her brother,
whereupon the Beijing authorities began to investigate the case.</P>
      <P>However, the case remained open until April, 1996, by which time
Chuang had been promoted to deputy captain of Helung City police
squad.</P>
      <P>Chuang eventually confessed to the five murders and disclosed the
involvement of the two other accomplices in December of 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHIP WITH FPG'S MERCURY-LACED WASTE ENTERS KAOHSIUNG HARBOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ship carrying back mercury-laced waste
belonging to Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) and formerly stored in
Cambodia entered Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan on Friday.</P>
      <P>The ship, Eagle Prosperity, carried the solidified waste in 357
containers and arrived in waters off Kaohsiung Harbor Wednesday to
await approval to enter the harbor.</P>
      <P>After FPG presented a plan to transfer the waste to another
country and posted a bond of NT$50 million (US$1.5 million) to the
Kaohsiung Port Authority, the authorities agreed to allow the ship to
dock and the containers to be temporarily stored in a warehouse.</P>
      <P>But the mercury-laced waste can be stored there for only 60 days,
which means FPG must send the waste to another country within that
period.</P>
      <P>As reports indicated that environmental groups planned to protest
against the mercury-tainted waste's entering the harbor, the agents
responsible for the unloading of the containers said they would speed
up efforts to unload the cargo. Police were also on hand to maintain
order. But no protesters showed up, and the operation went smoothly
without incident.</P>
      <P>The mercury-tainted waste was first shipped from a FPG plant in
Kaohsiung late last year to the southern coastal town of
Sihanoukville, Cambodia, causing panic and chaos among local

    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Yeh Chin-feng on Friday
called for expanded and more intensive cooperation in crime-fighting
judicial regimes across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Only when the mainland and Taiwan actually cooperate in

Exchange Foundation (SEF), on cross-strait jurisprudence exchanges.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who once served in the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), the

said she knows the differences between the legal systems and
practices of Taiwan and the mainland, and the plight of people
involved in legal or judicial controversies across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>She admitted that there are some channels of communication across
the strait, but because the channels are either indirect or erratic,
they have not been conducive to joint crime-fighting efforts by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Affairs Minister
Jason Hu on Friday rebutted mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
analogy between the cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the American
Civil War.</P>
      <P>In his first joint press conference with US President Bill
Clinton at the White House since arriving in Washington, D.C.,
Thursday for an official visit, Zhu said Beijing has repeatedly
stated that mainland China strives for a peaceful reunification of
the motherland, but that it has never renounced the use of force
against Taiwan in this regard.</P>
      <P>Zhu also noted the historical example of US President Abraham
Lincoln, who went to war in the 1860s to keep southern US states from
seceding.</P>
      <P>Responding to Zhu's remarks, President Clinton said, "the facts
of the relationship between Taiwan and China over the last 50 years
are somewhat different than the facts leading up to the American
Civil War, as I am sure that you would all agree."</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Hu said Zhu's drawing an analogy between
cross-strait relations and the American Civil War is illogical and
"embarrassingly awkward."</P>
      <P>Hu said the American Civil War was launched basically over the
rights, freedom and democracy of black people in America. If Beijing
triggers a war in the Taiwan Strait, it would hurt the freedom and
democracy hard sought after by the Chinese in both Taiwan and
mainland China, he added.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on Friday
called for heightened vigilance against a new strain of the fatal
"bird flu" that has struck two children in Hong Kong, saying there
must be across-the-board alertness among Taiwan poultry farms to

      <P>COA officials urged chicken and other poultry farms to make sure
their birds do not come into contact with migratory birds that may
turn out to be the source of the "bird flu" infections.</P>
      <P>In addition to keeping the birds at the farms isolated from
migratory birds, the farms should also prevent their feed from being
exposed to unknown migratory birds, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, COA informed the seven wetland habitats for wild and
migratory birds around the island to watch closely for the arrival of
any affected or ill birds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON-ZHU JOINT STATEMENT ON BEIJING'S WTO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>United States President Bill Clinton
and mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji issued a joint statement on
Beijing's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday
following a summit meeting at the White House.</P>
      <P>In the statement, both Clinton and Zhu committed to instruct
their trade ministers to resume bilateral negotiations in order to
satisfactorily resolve the important remaining issues as soon as
possible in support of the common goal of admission of the People's
Republic of China to the WTO on strong commercial terms in 1999.</P>
      <P>The full text of the statement is as follows:</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the official visit of the Premier of the
Government of the People's Republic of China Premier Zhu Rongji to
the United States, President of the United States William Jefferson
Clinton and Premier Zhu Rongji jointly affirm that China's admission
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is in the interest of the
United States, the People's Republic of China and the global trading
system.</P>
      <P>To that end, they welcome the significant progress made by the
United States and the People's Republic of China toward a strong
agreement based on a balance of rights and obligations. Noting that
agreement has not been reached on some important issues, they commit
to work to resolve these remaining issues through further bilateral
negotiations in order to conclude a strong agreement as the basis for
the accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO.</P>
      <P>President Clinton and Premier Zhu recognize the complexity of WTO
accession negotiations. In this regard, they note that agreement has
been reached on market access for agricultural and industrial goods,
as well as for a wide range of services sectors, as set out in
Attachment 1, but that certain matters remain to be resolved in
banking, including consumer auto finance, as well as securities and
audio visual services.</P>
      <P>They further welcome the conclusion of the Sino-US Agricultural
Cooperation Agreement, especially the resolution of bilateral issues
concerning imports by the People's Republic of China of US citrus,
meat products, and Pacific Northwest wheat, as set out in Attachment
2.</P>
      <P>President Clinton and Premier Zhu note agreement has been reached
on a variety of important rules to be applicable in the WTO,
including ones concerning trading rights, technology transfer and
offsets, state enterprises, and subsidies, as set out in Attachment
3. However, they recognize that certain differences remain to be
resolved on a mechanism to ensure implementation, the duration of
provisions governing dumping and product safeguards, and rules
governing textiles trade.</P>
      <P>President Clinton and Premier Zhu welcome this significant
progress and instruct their trade ministers to resume bilateral
negotiations in order to satisfactorily resolve the important
remaining issues as soon as possible in support of the common goal of
admission of the People's Republic of China to the WTO on strong
commercial terms in 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S WTO BID SHOULD BE UNAFFECTED BY MAINLAND CHINA: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday that
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) should be
treated separately from, and be unaffected by mainland China's entry
bid.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks as he fielded questions in the Legislative
Yuan one day after US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji issued a joint statement on the mainland's bid for
membership in the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang said on the
same day that the chances of Taiwan being allowed to join the WTO are
better this year than last, although some "variables" remain.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that mainland China has made several concessions in
its talks with the United States on its WTO membership, which he said
should help its entry bid.</P>
      <P>Wang said he believes that mainland China will open more of its
market, quicken the pace of its economic reforms, and widen its
economic liberalization, all of which he said will benefit the
mainland, Asia and Taiwan businessmen with operations in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Wang said, he will be happy to see the
mainland gain entry to the WTO.</P>
      <P>On the possible impact on Taiwan of the mainland's WTO entry,
Wang noted that there are big differences between Taiwan and the
mainland in terms of size and population, pointing out that Taiwan
has a population of 22 million, while the mainland represents a
market of 1 billion people. Although Taiwan cannot compare with the
mainland in terms of market size, it can certainly focus on providing
a higher quality market, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu noted that
Taiwan's imports from the United States were 25 percent higher than
the mainland's imports from the same source last year, and added that
this should be the main concern of the United States and its
businessmen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is keeping a close watch on
trade talks between US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji in Washington, D.C., on Friday because the meeting
could have an impact on Australian access to the mainland Chinese
market.</P>
      <P>Australian analysts said the Australian exporters could benefit
from any concessions negotiated by the United States during talks
this week, although Australia has a number of specific interests not
likely to be addressed in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review has reported over recent months
that a number of World Trade Organization (WTO) members have
expressed concerns that mainland China's WTO entry is increasingly
being seen as a bilateral deal between the United States and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>This view was summed up by European Commission Vice President Sir
Leon Brittan, who warned last month that it should not be forgotten
that WTO accession negotiations are a multilateral process and that
no bilateral agreement "can be imposed on other members of the WTO as
a basis for a final accession deal."</P>
      <P>The daily reported there is a considerable overlap between
Australian and US interests in the mainland Chinese market, though
there are also a number of sectors where Australian priorities
diverge from those of the United States.</P>
      <P>The daily cited examples covering those sectors in which the
United States is not a major player in the mainland Chinese market,
including wool, sugar and malting barley.</P>
      <P>Other priorities include ensuring equal treatment of agricultural
products used for similar purposes such as canola.</P>

      <P>Australia has vowed to strongly oppose a
call by Japan to reopen commercial operations for whaling in the
Southern Ocean sanctuary, saying the Japanese demand will only

commercial whaling, adding Australia would oppose the move
vigorously.</P>
      <P>Hill said the Australian government will push for a ban on
whaling in the South Pacific at a meeting scheduled in Grenada on May
24. Australia will move toward a final position of a global sanctuary
for all whales.</P>
      <P>Commercial whaling was closed five years ago but whaling
countries such as Japan and Norway remain adamant to pushing for the

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian Cancer Society said Thursday
that the general incidence of cancer and cancer deaths are down,
although breast, prostate and lung cancer are still exacting a high
toll.</P>
      <P>Nearly 130,000 new cases of cancer are expected in Canada this
year, and more than 63,000 people will die of cancer. By far, the
biggest killer is lung cancer and, not surprisingly, most of the
cases are caused by smoking, according to the society.</P>
      <P>It noted that almost a third of all cancer deaths in men and a
quarter in women are due to lung cancer alone.</P>
      <P>"The lung cancer death toll on Canadians is devastating," said
Dr. Barbara Whylie of the Canadian Cancer Society. "It is all the
more tragic as most lung cancer deaths could have been prevented, as
the vast majority are caused by smoking."</P>
      <P>In 1999 about 12,000 Canadian men will be diagnosed with lung
cancer and 10,600 will die of the disease. For women, approximately
8,500 will be diagnosed with lung cancer and 6,800 will die.</P>
      <P>The society predicted a dramatic increase in cancer rates in the
next decade as the Canadian population, now around 30 million, ages
and grows in size.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTE NOTHING LIKE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 9 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said
on Friday that cross-strait relations cannot be likened in any way to
the confrontation in the American Civil War, since Taiwan and
mainland China are governed by two separate sovereign powers.</P>
      <P>Siew was replying to a question from Legislator Lee Wen-chung of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, who took offense at
remarks made in the United States by mainland Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji about Taiwan, describing them as "provocative."</P>
      <P>At a joint press conference with US President Bill Clinton, Zhu
cited the example of Abraham Lincoln, who went to war in the 1860s to
keep the southern states from seceding from the union, as a defense
for Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew said that every country has its own unique history, and
pointed out that the American Civil War was triggered by separatists
in a united country, a situation which has never occurred in the
Taiwan Strait region.</P>
      <P>There has been no united China since 1949 when the ROC government
was forced to relocate to Taiwan from the mainland after its own
civil war. Since then, two distinct political entities have ruled the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and neither has jurisdiction over the
other, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the method used by Lincoln to settle the separatist
problem in the 1860s can in no way be adapted to settle the
cross-strait dispute, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taipei will invite Zhu to visit the island in the
wake of his "provocative" remarks, Siew said he believes the two
sides should build a systematized channel for dialogue before talking
about high-level visits or exchanges.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that the ROC has been striving for a "win-win"
resolution to the Taipei-Beijing confrontation, and would welcome
leadership visits at the proper time. He also pointed out that
President Lee Teng-hui himself has expressed his willingness to visit
the mainland under the proper circumstances.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES SHOULD BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY: CLINTON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on
Thursday likened the current cross-strait situation to the attempted
secession of the Confederate States of American from the United
States in the 1860s, saying that mainland China should learn from
former US President Abraham Lincoln, who used force to quell the
Confederacy's push for independence.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton, who appeared with Zhu at a joint press
conference in Washington, quickly replied that the situation across
the Taiwan Strait is different from the one that led to the American
Civil War, adding that the United States' position is that the
cross-strait issue should be resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>Following are Zhu's responses to questions on Taiwan, put to him
by a Hong Kong reporter:</P>
      <P>Q: Seven hours before you landed in Andrews Air Force Base
yesterday, President Clinton made a foreign policy speech in which he
mentioned the sending of carriers to the waters in the Taiwan Straits
in March 1996. And he said that that move had helped maintain the
security in the Taiwan Straits. So, in your view, how do you see the
effect of the military capabilities of the United States on the
situation across the Taiwan Straits? And do you think there should be
a timetable for the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan? And do
you wish to pay a visit to Taiwan?</P>
      <P>Zhu: The policy of China on the reunification of the mainland and
Taiwan -- of China -- is a very clear-cut one, and President Jiang
Zemin has already expounded on China's policy in this regard, so I
don't see the need for me to reiterate here.</P>
      <P>Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the policy of
"one country, two systems" -- Hong Kong people administering Hong
Kong; Hong Kong enjoying a high degree of autonomy -- have been fully
implemented, which is a fact there for the people in the entire world
to see.</P>
      <P>And our policy for the reunification of China with Taiwan is more
generous than our policy towards Hong Kong; and that is to say Taiwan
will be allowed to maintain its army. And we are also prepared to let
the head of Taiwan to come to the Central Government to serve as the
deputy head. But as for whether he or she is able to be the head,
then I'm not sure. But I'm afraid he would not get enough votes;
nobody would vote for him.</P>
      <P>On the question of the reunification, the Chinese government has
repeatedly stated that we strive for a peaceful reunification of the
motherland, but we have never undertaken to renounce the use of force
in this regard, because if we were to make such a pledge, make such
an understanding, then I'm afraid Taiwan would be in a perpetual
state of separation from the motherland.</P>
      <P>Just now, in the Oval Office of President Clinton, I saw the
portrait of President Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln, in order to
maintain the unity of the United States and oppose the independence
of the Southern part, he had resorted to the use of force and fought
a war for that, for maintaining the unity of the United States. So I
think President Abraham Lincoln is a model.</P>
      <P>As for whether I am going to visit Taiwan, since none of them
have issued an invitation to me, so how can I go there? And in what
capacity should I go there? I hope you will also help me to think of
this.</P>
      <P>At this point President Clinton intervened: "I think I have to
just say one thing, if I might, since I got zapped by Abraham
Lincoln.</P>
      <P>"First of all, the United States has a 'one China' policy. And I
have reaffirmed that at every opportunity. I do so again today.</P>
      <P>"Secondly, we believe that this matter should be resolved
peacefully.</P>
      <P>"The facts of the relationship between Taiwan and China over the
last 50 years are somewhat different than the facts leading up to the
American Civil War, as I am sure that you would all agree. It does
seem to me that China and Taiwan, apart from the blood ties of being
Chinese, even the native Taiwanese, that they have a lot -- you have
a lot to offer each other, including economic power, but beyond that
as well.</P>
      <P>"And so I hope that we will see a resolution of this. And I think
if the premier is as humorous and clever in Taiwan as he is here, I
think it'd be a good thing for him to go."</P>
      <P>To that, Zhu added: "Would I be beaten black and blue there?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMAN-CHINESE SOCIETY WILL MOVE TO BERLIN IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bonn,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The German-Chinese Society, founded in Bonn
in 1957 for the promotion of understanding between the people of 
Germany and the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan, will move
its office to Berlin in September.</P>
      <P>Over the past 42 years, the German-Chinese Society has dedicated
much effort to promoting the image of the Republic of China and its
people to German society. When the society was founded by Ernst
Majonica, a German parliamentarian between 1950 and 1972, Taiwan was
rarely known by Germans. Majonica and some other members of the
German Parliament at that time believed that the German people should
at least know about Taiwan even though the Republic of China was not
recognized by the German government.</P>
      <P>The society has been a forerunner to establish German political
contacts for Taiwan. Among its more than 200 members, there are quite
a few parliamentarians belonging to different political parties,
business executives and journalists who are keen to know about
developments in Taiwan. These people have built a solid base of
friendship for Taiwan in Germany's political circle.</P>
      <P>Under the initiation of the society, more than 60 German
parliamentarians formed the Bonn-Taipei Parliamentarian Group
(Parlamentarischen Freundeskreise Bonn-Taipei) in 1989. A counterpart
group was formed by members of the Legislative Yuan of the Republic
of China. The parliamentarian groups have served as an important
channel for direct contacts.</P>
      <P>With a new seat in Berlin, the society will continue its
functions in Bonn, while seeking a new orientation in the new
capital. In the meantime, the society's monthly publication "Freies
Asien" will keep the many members staying in the Rhine area informed
about developments in Taiwan and the society's programs.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,   April   8   (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore will be the world's
second-most dominant information economy by the year 2000, surpassing
Sweden and Finland, which are currently ahead.</P>
      <P>Singapore will be right behind the United States, which will
continue to be the world's most powerful information economy then --
as it is now.</P>
      <P>This prediction comes from a new study called the Information
Society Index (ISI), conducted by researcher International Data Corp.
(IDC) and World Times Inc., which specializes in analyzing critical
global issues through The World Paper publication.</P>
      <P>"The US will continue to remain the world's dominant information
economy, but smaller nations such as Singapore are progressing more
quickly than traditional countries such as the United Kingdom, France
and Japan," the study said.</P>
      <P>"The ISI study shows how effective policy translates into
progress and how information technology suppliers can find new
opportunities for growth."</P>
      <P>The study tracked data from 55 countries that collectively
account for 97 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP)
and 99 percent of IT expenditures.</P>
      <P>The research includes forecasts through the year 2002 for 23
variables spanning four infrastructure categories -- information, the
Internet, computer and society.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the top five information economies were, in descending
order, the United States, Sweden, Finland, Singapore and Norway. By
2002, the top five will be the United States, Singapore, Sweden,
Australia and Japan; Finland will drop to eighth place.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hong Kong will move up from 12th in 1998 to 10th in
2002; Taiwan from 21st to 16th; and mainland China from 53rd to 50th
place.</P>
      <P>Among the countries expected to slide in their positions by 2002,
South Korea is expected to fall from 20th to 21st, Malaysia from 34th
to 38th, Thailand from 45th to 48th, the Philippines from 46th to
49th, India from 52nd to 54th and Indonesia from 54th to 55th place.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang revealed on Friday that the island will open even further
to mainland Chinese agricultural goods, following an announcement a
day earlier that imports are to be expanded.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the opening is part of government efforts to
obtain membership of the World Trade Organization. He explained that
Taipei has granted import approval to more than 5,000 items, or 90
percent of mainland China's industrial products.</P>
      <P>In January, Taiwan first opened to the import of 87 items of
mainland Chinese farm products, the first of four market-opening
stages, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Thursday's move represented the second stage of the plan, Wang
said, adding that the third and fourth stages will be implemented in
the near future.</P>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs announced on Thursday that an additional 150 mainland items,
covering corn, wheat, barley, glutinous rice, and fishery products
such as shrimps and clams, have been approved for import.</P>
      <P>The announcement added that this raises the number of mainland
agricultural items allowed to be shipped to Taiwan to 621, or 30
percent of the agricultural items produced there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Council of Agriculture expressed optimism over the
opening, stressing that all the mainland farm goods on the import
list can help the island's agricultural development.</P>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait visits by the leaders
of the two sides can be discussed during the visit to Taiwan by
mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan Wang Daohan, a senior
official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level MAC, noted that
Wang, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), might discuss the matter with his local
counterpart Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that in President Lee Teng-hui's speech delivered
on Thursday at the 14th Plenum of the National Unification Council,
he said he welcomes Wang's visit, and that he hopes the constructive
dialogue conducted last year can be continued, which in turn might
lead to an exchange of visits by cross-strait leaders.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei denied a Japanese
newspaper report that he said Beijing will object to any overseas
visits by the ROC president after his retirement.</P>
      <P>Tang is also deputy director of both the Central Office for
Taiwan Affairs under the Chinese Communist Party, and the Taiwan
Affairs Office under the State Council.</P>
      <P>Hsu, however, refused to accept Tang's explanation, and said that
if the report was indeed unfounded, then Tang should seek
clarification from the newspaper as to why it ran the story.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taipei's mainland policy is based on a pragmatic
method of promoting benign cross-strait relations, and expressed his
hope that the Beijing authorities will exert more effort to the
improvement of cross-strait relations, and less to "impractical"

    <HEADLINE>MERIT OF TRA PROVEN OVER 20 YEARS, SAYS AIT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In accordance with the spirit of the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA), any hostile action against Taiwan will be
considered a threat to the peace and security of East Asia, and a
matter of grave concern to the United States, top US liaison officer
with Taiwan Richard Bush said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The TRA requires the US executive branch to maintain Taiwan's
capability to resist hostile action, so that if there were a threat
to Taiwan, the US president and Congress should consult on how to
deal with it, said Bush, chairman of the board and managing director
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT).</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Free China Journal on the significance
of the TRA legislation and the course of US-ROC relations over the
past 20 years, Bush said the TRA, a domestic US law, has played a key
role in US-ROC relations over the past 20 years in four principal
ways.</P>
      <P>First, the TRA provides a legal basis for the unofficial
relationship between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Second, the TRA provides on the American side an institutional
framework for conducting that relationship, specifically, the AIT,
with its headquarters in Washington, D.C., and offices in Taipei and
Kaohsiung, Bush said.</P>
      <P>Third, the TRA sets forth some statements of policy in a lot of
different areas, not the least of which is human rights. The most
important is probably in the security area, where the TRA reaffirms
the US expectation that the Taiwan Strait issue will be resolved in a
peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>Fourth, the TRA reflects a political commitment on the part of
the Congress, the American public and the US executive branch
concerning our friendship and close ties with the people on Taiwan.
That political commitment is an important reinforcement for the law
itself, Bush added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the TRA has been very successful over the
last 20 years as one element of a larger policy that helped create an
environment in East Asia in which the United States was able to
maintain substantive relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Three other positive things occurred, he went on:</P>
      <P>-- Twenty years of unprecedented peace and prosperity have been
enjoyed;</P>
      <P>-- The people on Taiwan chose to take risks to open up the
political system and move toward the full democracy that they now
enjoy; and</P>
      <P>-- People on Taiwan have been willing to take risks to open up
ties with mainland China and facilitate the economic and human
interdependence that has occurred over the last 12 years.</P>
      <P>On relations among Taiwan, mainland China and the United States,
Bush reiterated that the United States insists that the Taiwan Strait
issue be resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>The United States also believes that dialogue between the two
sides is the best way to reduce tension, improve the atmosphere,
identify areas of cooperation and, hopefully, move toward resolution
of this issue, he noted.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he said, the United States believes that whatever
the results of cross-strait dialogue, they should be the work of the
two sides themselves. "The United States is not going to insert
itself as a mediator. We think that it is better for the two sides
themselves to do it," he added.</P>
      <P>"We're going to be even-handed in that respect. We are not going
to take one side's view over the other's, nor pressure one side over
the other, Bush said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LESS THAN 10 PERCENT OF TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS GET HOSPICE CARE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although more and more people are coming to
accept the concept of hospice care for the terminally ill, it is
estimated that less than 10 percent of such patients get the care
they need because of the limited number of hospital beds.</P>
      <P>The situation was revealed on Friday at a hospice care seminar
sponsored by the Sun Yun-suan Academic Foundation and the Catholic
Sanipax Socio-Medical Service &amp; Education Foundation.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar, Department of Health Director-General
Chan Chi-shean expressed the opinion that better hospice care and
more beds should be the future goals of the medical care industry.</P>
      <P>Lo Chi-chin, a researcher at Academia Sinica, the highest
research institute in Taiwan, noted that research here and overseas
has shown that medical expenses to care for the terminally ill rise
dramatically in the one or two months prior to a patient's death,
which he said highlights the cost-efficiency of hospice care.</P>
      <P>Hospice care is not about "giving up" on patients, but about
providing active medical care that focuses on the easing of the pain
and suffering of patients in the twilight of their lives, the
participants heard.</P>
      <P>Professor Tai Tung-yuan of National Taiwan University noted that
although cancer tops the list of the 10 most common causes of death
in Taiwan, the demands for hospice care are so great that less than
10 percent of sufferers receive such care.</P>
      <P>The DOH estimates that there are 16 hospitals islandwide with a
total of just 216 hospice beds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REITERATES SUPPORT FOR NEW PARAGUAY LEADERSHIP</HEADLINE>

(By Ramon Huang and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Ambassador to Paraguay
Liu Tin-tzu has reiterated the ROC's comprehensive support for the
new Asuncion government led by President Luis Angel Gonzalez Macchi.</P>
      <P>Liu declared the support during a recent meeting with Paraguay's
Foreign Minister, in which he also introduced cooperation programs
between the two nations and offered Taiwan's experience and know-how
to help Paraguay develop its farm products and expand exports.</P>
      <P>Liu said loans that the ROC government has promised to provide or
has offered Paraguay as part of its assistance with the economic
development of the Latin American country will not be withdrawn
because of the leadership change in Paraguay. He stressed the ROC is
Paraguay's ally and partner in the pursuit of national development.</P>
      <P>Gonzalez, a key figure in Paraguay's ruling Colorado Party, took
power in late March after his predecessor Raul Cubas resigned in the
wake of the assassination of his vice president which triggered six
days of bitter rioting.</P>
      <P>Gonzalez was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan in February at
the invitation of the ROC government. The visit, however, was delayed
because of the political unrest.</P>

      <P>The dream of an Australian gold
prospector to become an instant millionaire is rapidly turning into a
nightmare, with the government seeking to confiscate a 25 kg gold
nugget he allegedly smuggled out of Australia.</P>
      <P>The nugget, one of the world's largest, is worth about A$477,000
(US$303,800) by weight value, but it might fetch more than AT$1
million (US$637,000) at an auction scheduled to take place in New
York on June 2.</P>
      <P>Australia's Department of Arts is investigating how the nugget
reached the United States without a permit from the Australian
government. It has confirmed that the unnamed prospector did not
secure a legal export permit to sell the nugget.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman of the department told the Sydney Morning Herald on
Friday that under the federal law on movable cultural heritage, the
nugget will be forfeited if is proved to have been exported
illegally.</P>
      <P>The auction house, Sotheby's, has agreed to cancel the auction if

      <P>The Australian government has demanded
that Yugoslavia return two detained aid workers of CARE Australia,
the country's biggest aid and charity organization.</P>
      <P>The demand was made by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer after
Australia on Friday announced that the first batch of about 300
ethnic Albanian refugees from the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo will
be airlifted to a military barracks near Sydney late next week.</P>
      <P>Downer said the release of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace is more
important than the release of three US soldiers captured by Serb
forces because they were "not participants in the political affairs."</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard said his government would do all it
could to ensure the release of the two CARE workers.</P>
      <P>The two workers went missing on March 31 while trying to cross
the Yugoslavian border into Croatia.</P>
      <P>CARE Australia workers are currently in the refugee camp of

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD HAVE TMD PROTECTION: US ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the United States does not
promote Taiwan independence, Washington should provide Taiwan with
theater missile defense (TMD) protection against the growing missile
threat from mainland China, according to Peter W. Rodman, director of
national security programs at the Nixon Center.</P>
      <P>Rodman noted in the latest issue of "National Review," a
conservative monthly magazine, that mainland China is already
expanding its offensive missile arsenal -- reportedly tripling its
missile deployed against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The senior editor of "National Review" said that mainland China's
growing offensive missile capability is a major change in the
region's balance of power, necessitating an American response. If the
technology exists to defend against these missiles and the United
States flinches from providing it to allies and friends on the front
line, "it will be a severe blow to the confidence of those who have
relied on us for 50 years. Our alliance relations might not survive
it," he said.</P>
      <P>"And if we were to flinch because of Chinese pressure, the
geopolitical implications would be even more profound," he added.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is a particularly sensitive case, "warranting
prudence in how we go about our long-standing policy of helping the
island protect itself against the use of force by Beijing."
Currently, Taiwan is allowed to purchase an upgraded Patriot missile
system, but no more.</P>
      <P>This constraint is artificial. A range of options is available,
from sea-based systems (which could remain in US hands but be
deployed near Taiwan in a crisis) to outright transfer of an advanced
system, Rodman claimed.</P>
      <P>The analyst stressed that "we are not in the business of
promoting Taiwan's independence. But under the Taiwan Relations Act,
we have reserved the right to provide `arms of a defensive
character.' And what could be more defensive than missile defenses?"</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he continued, Beijing's diplomatic effort is
reminiscent of the Soviet bluster against NATO's Euro-missile
deployment in 1983; it should be resisted just as firmly. Whether
concerning Taiwan or some other US friend, Beijing seems to be
saying: "How dare you take steps to defend yourselves against the
weapons with which we now choose to intimidate you"</P>
      <P>"This is not a position that China should seriously expect the
United States to accept," Rodman concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY KEY TO CEMENTING TIES WITH US: ROC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  9 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China should continue
promoting freedom, democracy, human rights, rule of law and equitable
distribution of wealth if it wants to cement its ties with the United
States, the top ROC envoy stationed here said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, ROC representative to the United States, made the
remarks in an interview with CNA in connection with the 20th
anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), the US law governing
exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that substantive ROC-US relations are now in
good shape and stable. In the long run, he said, the ROC should avoid
provoking tension in the Taiwan Strait in order not to add to
America's headaches and problems in the Asian region.</P>
      <P>"As long as the ROC does not take any action that may induce
regional tension, there will not be any problems in ROC-US
relations," Chen said, adding that if Taiwan does take certain
"provocative actions," it would be a bad omen for Taipei-Washington
ties.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis tested US
determination to maintain peace in the strait. "The crisis
highlighted what actions the United States would take when
necessary."</P>
      <P>Mainland China conducted a series of live-fire war games and
missile tests in the Taiwan Strait "on Taiwan's doorstep" in the
run-up to the island's first-ever direct presidential election in
March 1996, prompting the United States to send two aircraft carrier
battle groups to nearby waters to demonstrate its determination to
safeguard peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>Chen said hot debate in the United States following the 1996
crisis led more or less to a conclusion that as long as Taiwan does
not deliberately take any provocative action, its security deserves
serious US concern.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC ambassador to the United States said the Clinton
administration has repeatedly reminded mainland China that
cross-strait issues should be resolved strictly by peaceful means
while also urging Taiwan not to "provoke" Beijing.</P>
      <P>"Americans have unequivocally expressed their stance on the
Taiwan Strait issue," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He agreed with some reports that the United States feels an
urgent need to make its stance "crystal clear" to both sides of the
Taiwan Strait as Taiwan is stepping up preparations for its next
presidential election scheduled for March 2000.</P>
      <P>"I think this is why US President Bill Clinton, in a major policy
speech delivered on April 7, again called on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait not to misunderstand the basic US stance on cross-strait
issues," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As a diplomat, Chen said he should not make public comments on
Taiwan's domestic political developments. Nevertheless, he said he
firmly believes that freedom, democracy, human rights, rule of law
and economic well-being are key elements to shore up substantive
ROC-US relations.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that maintaining domestic political stability and
continuing promoting the above-mentioned values are the right
direction for our future national development," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>The veteran career diplomat pointed out that most Americans
remain unfamiliar with Taiwan issues. "I hope ROC nationals can be
more active in introducing Taiwan to American people when they visit
the United States," he said, adding that when Americans feel as
familiar with Taiwan as they do with Britain or Japan, ROC-US
relations will be far more solid and "worry-free."</P>
      <P>Chen further said he expects that a sub-Cabinet-level ROC-US
economic meeting will continue to be held this year. The
sub-Cabinet-level dialogue was held for the first time in 1995 in
accordance with a 1994 US review of its policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to an understanding reached at that time, a decision
was to be made after the third such meeting as to whether it would be
continued. The two sides had already held three
sub-Cabinet-level meetings as of 1998.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO MANY AMENDMENTS SPOIL CONSTITUTION: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   10   (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Too many amendments to the ROC
constitution will spoil it, warned a scholar in a seminar on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chen-ming, a professor of journalism at Chinese Culture
University, said at a seminar on constitutional revision that the
constitution should be supplemented by precedents and practices that
require time to set up.</P>
      <P>If gaps remain, they do not necessarily need to be bridged by
amendments, said Cheng, adding that legal interpretations might work
instead.</P>
      <P>By amending the constitution too frequently, the government
denies it the chance to take root, he said, even if amendments affect
only a small portion of the document. Moreover, frequent amendments
will result in controversy, especially if no consensus is reached on
amendments before they are approved, he said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has amended its constitution four times
since 1991, and the ruling Kuomintang is pushing for yet another
revision to be made this year.</P>
      <P>Teng Chung-chien, a professor of diplomacy at National Chengchi
University, urged all political parties to stop tinkering with the
constitution. Instead, they should charter a long-term path for the
constitution and solicit public support, Teng said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Lin Cho-shui, a member of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, made a pitch for the party's advocacy
of plebiscites at the seminar.</P>
      <P>Lin said the addition of plebiscites is essential to ensure
constitutional amendments made by the National Assembly conform with
public opinion.</P>
      <P>He claimed there exists a proposal to change the National
Assembly into a gathering of political party representatives. This
makes the addition of plebiscites all the more necessary, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin's view met with opposition from Ho Cheng-sheng, deputy
secretary-general of the New Party.</P>
      <P>Arguing that plebiscites are a political instrument for the DPP
to claim Taiwan independence, Ho said it will lead to suspicion and
controversy.</P>
      <P>Instead, Ho said, the New Party calls for the resumption of
referendum and recall -- authorized under the constitution but
currently frozen.</P>
      <P>Referendum and recall function in much the same way as
plebiscites, while they do not pose the constitutional problems that
plebiscites do, Ho said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATORS LAUNCH HUNGER STRIKE TO PROMOTE REFERENDUM LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 100 activists, including dozens of
lawmakers, participated Saturday in a hunger strike dubbed "410 Fast"
at the front doors of the Legislative Yuan to demonstrate a
consolidated and determined will to push for the legislation of a
public referendum law.</P>
      <P>The activity was led by Legislator Trong Tsai from the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Trong said that the strike will
continue indefinitely until there is progress on the legislation.</P>
      <P>As the strike began, Tsai read a statement in which he urged the
legislature to write a bill authorizing the holding of referendums
into law as soon possible. Taiwan's political development requires
such a law, he said.</P>
      <P>The hunger strike is intended to call public attention to the
issue, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Some of the participants elected to go on a limited hunger
strike, lasting from one to seven days, while 22 others -- among them
Tsai and fellow DPP legislators Sheng Fu-hsiung and Chen Chau-nan --
have vowed to strike indefinitely.</P>
      <P>More than 100 people including Taiwan Independence Party Chairman
Hsu Shih-kai, former Taipei County Magistrate You Ching and Green
Party representative Kuo Cheng-yien are participating in limited
hunger strikes.</P>
      <P>Saturday's activity also included a speech by Professor Lee
Hung-hsi of National Taiwan University and performances by choral
groups.</P>
      <P>A draft referendum bill has already passed its first reading in
the legislature, but it has been stalled because no agreement has
been reached on the bill by the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative Yuan, said Saturday
that he is not optimistic that the referendum bill will be put on the
legislature's agenda for Tuesday. He said he is also doubtful that
the bill will be passed into law.</P>
      <P>Wang has expressed concern over the "410 Fast" event, calling for
attention to be paid to the strikers' health and for discussions
aimed at finding a solution to the referendum issue.</P>
      <P>According to the Republic of China constitution, citizens of the
country have the rights of election, recall, initiative and
referendum. In practice, however, only the right of election has been
frequently exercised, while legislation governing the rights of
initiative and referendum has yet to be passed.</P>
      <P>Some lawmakers have opposed legislation authorizing the holding
of referendums, saying it could become a tool of pro-independence
forces. Others have objected to the legislation on different grounds,
saying Taiwan voters already have the means to make influential
political decisions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTAL MISERY INDEX RISES FURTHER: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's environmental misery index rose
to a four-year high of 77.47 points this year, indicating that the
local living environment has worsened further, according to the
results of a public opinion survey released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,139 adults residing throughout the
island was conducted by the Environmental Quality Protection
Foundation (EQPF) from April 2 through April 5.</P>
      <P>The foundation questioned the randomly selected local residents
about their views on some 20 most common domestic environmental
problems.</P>
      <P>Among the 18 indicators used by the foundation to gauge the
environmental misery index, 15 indicators, including air pollution,
water pollution, garbage disposal, noise pollution, disposal of
deserted cars and motorcycles, foul smell, and ecological problems,
all showed signs of worsening. Only three factors -- wildlife
protection, household waste water treatment and urban vegetation
-- showed signs of improvement.</P>
      <P>According to the latest survey, the overall misery index
reached 77.47 points this year, up 2.1 points from the 1998 level. It
was also the second highest level since the foundation began to
conduct the annual survey five years ago. The first-ever such
survey conducted in 1995 recorded the highest misery index of 78.72
points. In the foundation's measurement system, the higher the
points, the worse the environmental misery.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that river pollution, widespread plastic
containers, vehicle emissions and water pollution were the most
disgusting environmental problems. Waste water and emissions from
factories, mudflow and stray dogs were also cited by many
respondents as the most serious environmental woes.</P>
      <P>EQPF Secretary-General Liu Ming-lung attributed the rise in
this year's environmental misery index to a combination of factors,
including the Formosa Plastic Group's mercury-laced waste issue,
typhoon damage, mudflow and flooding disasters reported over the
past year, as well as slow progress in environment-related
infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>"The government inefficiency in controlling pollution
and improving environmental quality has made more local people feel
uncomfortable and frustrated with their living environment," Liu
noted.</P>
      <P>The same survey found that only 36.8 percent of the respondents
said they are satisfied with the performance of the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), down from last year's
39.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Compared with previous polls, the number of people who are
dissatisfied with the EPA's administration has increased steadily.
The number of respondents who said they believe that many of EPA's
administrative measures are adopted in favor of business interests
has also surged continually, according to survey results.</P>
      <P>On the future development, 36 percent said they expect Taiwan's
general environment to deteriorate further over the next five years;
only 18 percent said they believe the local environment will
improve; 33.3 percent said they think the environment will remain
almost the same.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the latest survey found that 82 percent of those
interviewed said they support the proposal to set up an
environmental police corps under the EPA's jurisdiction; only 8.1
percent voiced opposition to such an idea.</P>
      <P>Sixty-one percent threw support behind the proposal to upgrade
the EPA to the status of a ministry, while 8 percent said they
oppose such a change.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 70 percent gave a thumbs-up to the
proposal to increase government budget for environmental protection
programs; 11.2 percent were opposed to it; and 18.7 percent said
they have no opinion about the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CONSISTENTLY HOSTILE TOWARD TRA: US SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has been consistently hostile
toward the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) since the enactment of the law
on April 10, 1979, Professor June Teufel Dreyer of the University of
Miami said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Dreyer made the remark during the second day of an international
academic seminar titled "International Conference on United
States-Taiwan Relations: 20 Years after the TRA."</P>
      <P>The two-day seminar was held by the Republic of China's Academia
Sinica with some 170 scholars and experts from home and abroad
attending. Twelve papers were presented and discussed during the
seminar.</P>
      <P>Beijing has contended that the TRA, especially its provisions for
arms sales to Taiwan, runs counter to the sprit of both the Shanghai
Communique of February 1972 and the normalization agreement of
December 1978.</P>
      <P>This view is consistent with recently declassified US materials
concerning conversations between then US Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and mainland Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.</P>
      <P>Kissinger told Deng the act could be reviewed after a period of 
time. In essence, this review occurred in the form of a third
communique in August 1982, in which the United States promised to
gradually reduce the quantity and quality of its arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 1982 communique, though never formally repudiated by the
American side, has frequently been ignored or circumvented.</P>
      <P>Beijing has argued that since the TRA is a domestic decision of
the United States, it can have no relevance to mainland China. In
addition to regular and vigorous protests against US actions
consonant with the TRA, mainland China has:</P>
      <P>-- used US desire for certain international arrangements and for
commercial advantage as leverage to gain concessions from Washington;</P>
      <P>-- argued that international agreements outweigh domestic
legislation; and</P>
      <P>-- sought to obtain a fourth communique or other official
statements that more clearly undermine or vitiate the intent of the
TRA.</P>
      <P>Dreyer said that since the enactment of the TRA, every American
administration has affirmed its intention to abide by it. But, as
with all legislation, much depends on the interpretation of its
clauses, she said.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that what constitutes a defensive weapon and
when there is a military imbalance in the Taiwan Strait are matters
on which persons with different ideological proclivities have
disagreed, often heatedly.</P>
      <P>The general trend has been for US presidents to take small steps
to placate Beijing and erode the intent of the TRA, hoping to avoid a
deterioration of relations with mainland China while not going so far
as to inflame domestic opposition, said the professor.</P>
      <P>To date, though, these steps have tended to solidify domestic
opposition, as was most recently exemplified by the strong
congressional reaction to President Bill Clinton's public iteration
of the Three Noes during his visit to mainland China last summer,
Dreyer said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Saturday marked the 104th birthday of one
of Taiwan's most noted writers, Su Hsue-ling, and a birthday
celebration for Su in the southern city of Tainan coincided with the
publication of her collected diaries.</P>
      <P>The celebration took place in the intensive care ward of National
Cheng Kung University Hospital, which Su has called home for a number
of months. President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President Lien Chan both
sent Su birthday cards and presents.</P>
      <P>A number of Su's students and several political and educational
celebrities, including Cheng Kung University President Wung Cheng-yih
and Tainan Mayor Chang Chan-ao, congratulated her in person.</P>
      <P>During a ceremony marking the publication of Su's diaries, Wung
praised her as a remarkable modern woman who lived in a traditional
era in Chinese history. She is also the only living writer to have
been writing at the time of 1919's May Fourth Movement, which marked
the start of a Chinese intellectual revolution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTAL WATCH CENTER TO BECOME OPERATIONAL ON APRIL 17</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A private environmental watch center will
be inaugurated on April 17 to push for improvement in Taiwan's
general living environment.</P>
      <P>The new watch center will be operated by the
Environmental Quality Protection Foundation (EQPF).</P>
      <P>"We have decided to set up the watch center mainly because our
government has failed to take effective measures to curb
environmental pollution and improve environmental quality," EQPF
Secretary-General Liu Ming-lung said.</P>
      <P>Liu said although the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) has been set up for 10 years, the local
environmental misery index has continued rising.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a recent EQPF survey, Taiwan's
environmental misery index surged to a four-year high of 77.47
points this year, up 2.1 points from the 1998 level.</P>
      <P>"The rising index indicated that the local living environment has
worsened further," Liu said.</P>
      <P>In view of the government's inefficiency in protecting local
living environment, Liu said the foundation has decided to pool
resources in the private sector to push for faster progress in local
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Liu outlined the new watch center's four major missions --
overseeing the government's environment-related administration;
assisting victims of environmental pollution in seeking
compensation; filing lawsuits against major environmental polluters;
and providing an environment suitable for living and business
operations.</P>
      <P>Liu further said the center will file its first environmental
lawsuit on April 22 which has been designated Earth Day worldwide.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine government said Saturday a
referendum is not required to ratify the Visiting Forces Agreement
(VFA) between the Philippines and the United States, since the accord
involves only temporary visits by American troops to the country.</P>
      <P>National Security Adviser Alexsander Aguirre said the need for a
referendum as specified under the constitution pertains only to
international agreements involving the permanent basing of foreign
troops and facilities in the Philippines, which clearly, does not
encompass the VFA.</P>
      <P>"The referendum is not needed because the VFA does not involve
permanent military bases," Aguirre said.</P>
      <P>Aguirre reacted to reports that some lawmakers had insisted that
the government should follow a constitutional provision stating the
conduct of military exercises here needs approval of the people
through a national referendum.</P>
      <P>The VFA, an implementing mechanism of the 1951 RP-US Mutual
Defense Treaty (MDT), will serve as the legal framework for the
treatment of American soldiers and military officials, who will visit
the country for limited periods to participate in joint military
exercises with Filipino troops. He said that under this provision,
only the Senate's approval of the accord is needed to ratify the VFA.</P>
      <P>Under the constitution, a two-thirds vote by the 23-member Senate
is needed to ratify the VFA.</P>

      <P>Most residents in the Greater Taipei Area
do not give high marks to city bus service quality, according to the
results of a public opinion survey released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll was conducted by TVBS cable TV company on
April 8-9, shortly after a No. 226 city bus caused the worst traffic
accident in Taipei's history on Thursday. The 15-car pileup resulted
in one death and 38 injuries.</P>
      <P>TVBS interviewed 2,336 randomly selected residents
in the Greater Taipei Area (comprising Taipei city and county), and
collected 817 valid replies.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that 47.7 percent of the respondents said
they are satisfied with the quality of city bus services in the
Greater Taipei Area, while 46.9 percent said they are unhappy with
city bus services.</P>
      <P>Despite Thursday's city bus-triggered serious traffic accident,
80 percent of those interviewed still said they feel it is safe to
take a city bus ride, only 16 percent said they feel riding on a
city bus is unsafe.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 55.5 percent of the respondents are
most dissatisfied with city bus drivers' service quality; 45.2
percent cited slow replacement of old city buses as the most
unsatisfactory factor. Other drawbacks included poor air

      <P>Asked about city bus drivers' bad habits, 43.3 percent said they
are most dissatisfied with the drivers' smoking and betel nut
chewing; followed by speeding, abrupt braking and failing to stop at
the right place.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that motorcycle is the most common

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of the heads of
small- and medium-sized enterprises support former Taiwan provincial
governor James Soong running in the 2000 presidential race, according
to a poll Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Legislator Lai Shih-pao of the opposition
New Party, was made at a time when potential candidates of the ruling
Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party are
gearing up for their presidential campaigns.</P>
      <P>The heads of the small- and medium-sized enterprises were asked
who they would support for president among Vice President Lien Chan,
Soong, former Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian and former chairman of
Democratic Progressive Party Hsu Hsin-liang.</P>
      <P>The poll showed that 58.2 percent would support Soong, followed
by Chen with 20.8 percent. Lien received 19.1 percent, and Hsu 2.9
percent.</P>
      <P>More than half those polled said that they believed Soong will
eventually break with the KMT and run independently, while 27.5
percent said Soong would not do so.</P>
      <P>The poll also found a Soong-Lien ticket (27.8 percent) had
slightly more support than a Lien-Soong ticket (27.3 percent) when the
leaders were asked to name their favorite presidential tandem.</P>
      <P>Some 42 percent of those polled also said that John Chang,
secretary general of the ruling Kuomintang, is most likely to be
chosen as a KMT vice presidential nominee.</P>
      <P>Of DPP supporters, 37.6 percent of those polled said they didn't
know which tandem would be the best ticket. But 32.4 percent said
they support a Chen-Hsu ticket, with 16 percent supporting a Hsu-Chen
ticket.</P>
      <P>Some 53 percent of those polled said that candidates in the 2000
presidential race should first and foremost have vision, followed by
resoluteness, and then caliber.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of those polled said that they do not
believe the 2000 presidential race will be a fair and fraud-free
race.</P>
      <P>Lai, in interpreting the poll, said that the results disprove the
myth that candidates who break with their parties are out, noting the
2,000 volunteers who recently signed up Soong's private office show
the popularity of the former Taiwan provincial governor.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted March 23- April 9, with responding

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Secretary-General John Chang on
Saturday criticized mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's recent
remarks claiming that Beijing would not rule out the use of force
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhu indicated at a White House press conference last Thursday
that for the sake of keeping a territory intact, mainland China may
have to learn from President Abraham Lincoln's Civil War.</P>
      <P>His remarks were interpreted as mainland China's intention of
using force to attain reunification.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former Republic of China foreign minister well versed in
Sino-American affairs, described Zhu's remarks as distorting the
historical event.</P>
      <P>He said that the Civil War was waged to solve the slavery and
racial problems, with its background totally different from the
current cross-Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Zhu's making such a comparison was "quite
improper," adding that if Zhu's idea is widely shared by the Beijing
leadership, "it is really a troublesome and worrisome matter."</P>
      <P>Despite the stiff attitude toward Taiwan, the KMT leader said
that Taipei will continue to follow its existing strategy and to push

    <HEADLINE>80 PERCENT OF PREGNANT TEENAGERS SEEK ABORTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Only about one out of every five
pregnant teenager in Taiwan will give birth, with the remainder
seeking an abortion, a doctor reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chien-tai, president of the Taipei Municipal Hospital for
Women &amp; Children, made the remark while attending a meeting of
obstetrics and gynecologists.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that on average, among 1,000 Taiwan teenagers aged
14-19, 12-14 babies will be born in a year. Among every five teenaged
pregnancies, only about one will result in a birth, with the other
four aborted.</P>
      <P>She noted current regulations stipulate that minors who seek
abortions must have the consent of their legal guardians. But as most
of the country's unwed teenagers do not tell their families about
their pregnancy, they end up seeking an unlawful abortion.</P>
      <P>She said that the situation showed the gulf between current
regulations and the actual situation.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yu-Chyong, an obstetrics and gynecologist, said on the same
occasion that she had encountered one girl who had undergone four
abortions in 18 months. Hsu lamented the fact the teenagers are too
ignorant about sex.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that health authorities should step up the sex
education campaign among teenagers, educating them about the use of
condoms to avoid pregnancy before marriage, as well as to prevent
venereal diseases.</P>
      <P>Chiang suggested that law be amended to lower the age of
adulthood from the existing 20 to 18.</P>
      <P>Hsu echoed her words, asking if an 18-year-old is able to take a
test to get a driver's license, why the same age girl cannot control
the rights to her body? She said that current regulations requiring
teenagers to have the consent of their legal guardians to seek an
abortion is meaningless and only contributes to the number of illegal
abortions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ZHU'S US VISIT NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE BREAKTHROUGH: SEMINAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji's current US visit is not expected to produce a major
breakthrough in bilateral ties, academics attending a Sunday seminar
said. Speaking at a seminar on the impact of Zhu's US trip, some
scholars and experts even opined that Zhu's visit will deteriorate
two-way Beijing-Washington ties. Although Zhu has taken a low profile
during his current US tour, Liang Chung-min, an associate professor
at Fu Jen Catholic University, said the US side has not made any
compromises as a result. Such an outcome has merely buttressed the
differences and conflicts of interest between mainland China and
other western countries, further deteriorating the Beijing-Washington
relationship, he contended.</P>
      <P>Pang Hsi-tang, professor at Tamkang University's Mainland China
Affairs Study Institute, predicted that two-way Beijing-Washington
ties will not turn for the better in the short term, as sharp
differences remain on issues related to Taiwan, Tibet, political
contributions to the US Democratic Party, technology theft and the
US-proposed Theater Missile Defense System for its allies in east
Asia.</P>
      <P>Pang, however, said he believes that the United States'
willingness to support mainland China's entrance into the World Trade
Organization will help Taiwan accelerate its pace to join the
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body as well. But Taiwan will
face a series of complicated issues on cross-strait economic
activities, including the opening of trade, transportation and mail
service links between the two sides and the allowance of mainland
Chinese capital and agricultural and farm product exports to enter
Taiwan, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In addition, Pang said Zhu has demonstrated a more hardline
stance on issues regarding Taiwan than mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, underscoring his threat to use the military to achieve
unification with Taiwan. Zhu's demonstration of his reluctance to
forswear the use of force against Taiwan showed that the Taiwan issue
has become a pressing matter to Beijing, he added.</P>
      <P>Echoing Pang's view, Chinese Culture University Professor Kuo
Chan-li said Zhu's remarks on Thursday in Washington that Beijing
will learn from US President Abraham Lincoln's use of force to keep
the country together as it deals with Taiwan indicated that the
Chinese communist regime is running out of patience with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Such a mood will fuel worries among the people of Taiwan, he
noted, warning that the use of military intimidation to resolve the
Taiwan issue will only create hatred between the younger generations
on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wu Yu-heng, professor with Fu Hsing Kang University, said Zhu
made a big mistake while commenting on the Taiwan issue, but added
that the eloquent mainland Chinese leader's US trip has undoubtedly
helped Beijing to lure US Chinese communities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is
taking a tone-downed posture toward a hunger strike calling for a
constitutional amendment to allow a plebiscite to decide Taiwan's
future and other major issues.</P>
      <P>The indefinite strike was staged in front of the Legislative Yuan
(Parliament) on Saturday by some DPP legislators and some
pro-independence activists.</P>
      <P>Although some DPP lawmakers were among the organizers of the
strike, the DPP leadership has avoided direct involvement, as the
party considers it poor timing to employ such a radical measure
before a presidential election.</P>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, a prospective DPP contender
for next spring's presidential election, has previously stated that a
plebiscite is not necessarily to be written into the constitution or
to be enacted as a law.</P>
      <P>DPP National Assemblyman Chiu Yi-ying admitted that in the eyes
of most people in Taiwan, a plebiscite is undoubtedly aimed at Taiwan
independence, and, therefore, it will deal a blow to Chen Shui-bian's
"new middle road policy."</P>
      <P>Since hunger strike began, the DPP leadership, headed by Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung, has visited the strikers to extend the party's
concern, but has refrained from voicing strong support for their

    <HEADLINE>CANCER CAN BE DETECTED IN BLOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many earlier types of cancer can be
discovered with a small sample of blood, Academia Sinica member Tsao
An-pang announced on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Using 20cc of blood, Tsao is able to detect many types of
cancer cells in areas including the prostate, large intestine, kidney
and pancreas through a special test which yields results in two days.</P>
      <P>Tsao, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
Maryland, explained in a medical conference that due to the special
antibodies or nucleic acids in a cancer cell, he can detect
different types of cancer through a dyeing process and with the help
of a color fluorescent microscope.</P>
      <P>The new testing method is safer and more reliable than
traditional methods, Professor Tsao said adding, it has passed more
than six hundred individual experiments in the United States.</P>
      <P>Professor Tsao announced he will transfer the technology back to
Taiwan and set up a laboratory in six months. The National Taiwan
University Hospital and Taipei's Veterans General Hospital have been
in touch with him on this matter, he added.</P>
      <P>The discovery that malignant tumors can be discovered and treated
in the early stage is a good news for Taiwan, as the country annually
has 30,000 new cancer cases and with 20,000 of those patients
eventually dying.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 11 (CNA): The Australian government has put on
hold its biggest ever airlifting operation for ethnic Albanian
refugees from Macedonia at the request of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>UN High Commissioner for Refugees Ms Sadako Ogata on Saturday
asked Australia, the United States and Canada to halt their plans to
evacuate tens of thousands of Albanian refugees until it was further
assessed that aid funds could be better spent in Europe.</P>
      <P>Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko indicated that his country
could take most of the refugees if other countries offered financial
aid. UN officials are expected to urge Australia, the US, Canada and
other countries to support Albania's efforts to accommodate the
refugees.</P>
      <P>"We have put a pause on the arrangements we were going to
implement, pending further advice from the United Nations," said a
spokesman for Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock.</P>
      <P>He said the Australian government remained ready to help and
staff from the Immigration Department would go to Macedonia to
complete the preparations for the evacuation if the plan returns to
the original one.</P>
      <P>"We would expect Australia would be in a position to move people
within 48 hours of the lifting of such a pause," he added. Australia
estimates the airlifting operations of Albanian refugees would cost
the Howard government about A$40 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON-ZHU JOINT STATEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States and mainland China
issued a joint statement by President Bill Clinton and Premier Zhu
Rongji on Saturday, after a vigorous late Friday night bargain over
the languages and context of the statement.</P>
      <P>As weird and unusual as it seems, this is the second time the
White House had issued such a statement in as many days. The new
version has been significantly abridged from what the White House had
issued on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Zhu said in a banquet here on Friday that the US unilaterally
publicized a list of commitments by mainland China over the market
access and protocol issues of World Trade Organization (WTO). He
showed his displeasure to the Clinton administration by saying that
"they said we have agreed to them, but we don't."</P>
      <P>After a last minute tough bargain over the joint statement before
Zhu's departure to Denver Saturday morning, US and mainland Chinese
negotiators agreed to eliminate any mention of the detailed market
access and protocol appendixes of the statement.</P>
      <P>The key language of the statement has also been changed from both
sides support the "common goal of admission of the People's Republic
of China to the WTO on strong commercial terms in 1999" to "the
United States strongly supports the accession of the People's
Republic of China to the WTO in 1999."</P>
      <P>The full text of the statement is as follows:</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the signing of the Agreement on US-China
Agricultural Cooperation, President Bill Clinton and Premier Zhu
Rongji reaffirmed that the United States and the People's Republic of
China have advanced substantially their common goal of China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>This Agreement and the significant consensus achieved on a broad
range of market access and Protocol issues have further advanced that
goal. President Clinton and Premier Zhu welcome this significant
progress.</P>
      <P>The United States strongly supports the accession of the People's
Republic of China to the WTO in 1999.</P>
      <P>Therefore, President Clinton and Premier Zhu instruct their trade
ministers to continue bilateral negotiations in order to
satisfactorily resolve the important remaining issues and reach
agreement on strong commercial terms as soon as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MA USES CAMPAIGN SUBSIDY TO FORM 2 FOUNDATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has used his
campaign subsidy for mayoral election to form two foundations.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that he garnered 766,377 votes during mayoral elections
last December. Under election and recall laws, the Taipei City
Election Commission reimbursed him NT$30 (US$0.90) for each vote he
won, or a total of more than NT$22 million (US$664,650).</P>
      <P>To make the best use of the money, Ma said, he has decided to
form two foundations. One is a cultural and education foundation,
while the other is a charity foundation.</P>
      <P>Ma said the New Taiwanese Cultural and Education Foundation seeks
to assemble people from all walks of life to pool their wisdom to
promote the study and discussion of public issues in a supra-race and
supra-party manner.</P>
      <P>The popular Taipei mayor said that neither he nor his family will
hold any position in either of the foundations.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the foundations' budgets are meager and that
they will rely heavily on donations in the future. All donations will
be certified by accountants, and the financial operations of the two
foundations will be completely transparent, he said.</P>
      <P>The "New Taiwanese" part of the foundation's name was first
broached by President Lee Teng-hui during the mayoral race, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>The concept received an enthusiastic response from the public,
showing the public's aspiration for racial harmony and social
progress. He said that the foundation seeks to shake off old ideas
and internal rivalry and focus on solidifying the society.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwanese foundation will ask Sun Yun-suan, senior
adviser to the president, to serve as its honorary chairman, while
Shen Chun-shan, former president of National Tsing Hua University,
will be asked to serve as chairman.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The president of the state of Kalmykia,
one of the 21 autonomous republics of the Russian Federation, is
scheduled to arrive in Taiwan next Sunday for a four-day official
visit, sources from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission
(MTAC) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has maintained frequent contacts with Kalmykia in recent
years, and MTAC Chairman Kao Kung-lien visited the Russian state last
year, according to Liu Hsueh-chao, chief secretary of MTAC.</P>
      <P>Kalmykian officials joined overseas Mongol groups to visit Taiwan
last October to attend celebrations marking the Republic of China's
National Day on Oct. 10, said Liu.</P>
      <P>Under an academic agreement that Taiwan and Kalmykia forged in
1991, Kalmykia has sent students of Mongol origin to Taiwan to learn
mandarin Chinese. Each year MTAC offers a scholarship to a Mongol
student from Kalmykia wishing to study mandarin Chinese in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kalmykia borders the Caspian Sea and lies within the Caspian Sea
lowlands. Within its borders is the area where the Volga River feeds
into the sea. It has a population of about 330,000, half of whom are
Mongols, which are present-day descendants of the Mongols who ruled
Russia between 1237 and the late 1400s.</P>
      <P>The country's economy is based mainly on agriculture with
livestock breeding accounting for 77 percent of overall production.
Kalmykia is famous for its Karakul soft wool, hard sought after by
clothing manufacturers worldwide.</P>
      <P>Kalmykia, whose fur, hide, butter, cheese and meat processing
industries are also well-developed, welcomes Taiwan businesses to
invest in the Russian republic, particularly in wool processing, oil
drilling and harbor development, Liu noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former mainland Chinese Vice Minister
of Culture Wang Jifu died in a hospital in Taichung on Monday from
injuries suffered in a severe fall during a tour of a private museum
in central Taiwan six days ago.</P>
      <P>Wang, who arrived in Taiwan on March 31 at the head of a mainland
Chinese cultural delegation, had been in a coma since he was rushed
to Chungshan Medical College Hospital in Taichung after falling down
a flight of stairs on April 6.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the hospital said Wang's condition worsened early
Monday morning, with his heartbeat and blood pressure dropping
abruptly. After 30 minutes of emergency treatment, Wang was
pronounced dead.</P>
      <P>Wang, 71, suffered four skull fractures in addition to brain
hemorrhage during the fatal fall. His index of vital signs was a weak
2 points when he was sent to Chung Shan Hospital, according to
doctors. Fifteen points is standard for a healthy man under normal
conditions.</P>
      <P>Wang's death marks the first major accident ever suffered by a
mainland Chinese visitor in Taiwan since the Republic of China
opened doors to private visits across the Taiwan Strait in 1987.</P>
      <P>Out of humanitarian considerations, the ROC government
already allowed three of Wang's family members and several relevant
mainland people to travel to Taiwan on April 9 to help care for Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang's wife and their son and daughter were in the hospital when
he died at around 3:40 a.m.</P>
      <P>His family said Wang's body will be cremated in Taichung on
Tuesday and that his ashes will be taken back to mainland China later
this month.</P>
      <P>Wang was invited by a local private cultural organization to
visit Taiwan in his capacity as chairman of the China Foundation for
Minority Cultures and Arts. He had been scheduled to leave here for
home on April 8.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, expressed
deep regret over Wang's death.</P>
      <P>Su said he has ordered relevant MAC officials and the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) to assist Wang's family in handling
aftermath. SEF is a quasi-official body authorized by the ROC
government to handle exchanges with mainland China in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Su urged mainland visitors to pay greater attention to their own
safety during their stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The senior mainland policy planner further said the MAC will
demand all mainland private groups intending to visit Taiwan to buy
travel insurance policies for their members. Sources said Wang didn't
buy any travel insurance policy in Taiwan as his tour was handled by
a mainland travel agency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Showing obvious pique about a summit
gone awry, mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji sharply criticized
President Bill Clinton for refusing to approve a proposed deal aimed
at bringing mainland China into a global trading organization,
according to a report in Saturday's Los Angeles Times.</P>
      <P>At a private breakfast with 15 members of Congress, Zhu briefly
abandoned his easygoing manner to complain through a translator that
Clinton "did not have enough courage" to sign an accord backing
mainland China's application to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
because of likely opposition in Congress, according to several people
who attended.</P>
      <P>Zhu, who listened intently to the Americans in English but
responded in Chinese, did not correct his interpreter's translation
of his forceful remark, as he did at other points during the
hour-long meeting at Blair House. Aides said Zhu understands English
better than he speaks it.</P>
      <P>Several participants said they were surprised at Zhu's barbed
words and were disappointed when he appeared to brush aside their own
complaints about mainland China's human rights abuses, alleged spying
and missile proliferation, as well as other disputes that have badly
strained recent ties with Beijing, according to the report.</P>

(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As incomes declined across the region
last year with the deepening economic crisis, Asians actually began
saving more money, according to The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>Some see this as a uniquely Asian phenomenon in contrast to
situations elsewhere, where there would be a higher temptation to
draw down savings to maintain living standards, it said.</P>
      <P>With the exception of Indonesia, where the situation was
complicated with political and ethnic tensions, national savings
rates in other declining economies -- Malaysia, Thailand, the
Philippines and South Korea -- all went up last year, even as the
worst of the region's downturn swept through their economies and
incomes declined.</P>
      <P>Asia's famous reputation for thrift is confirmed by data from
official and International Monetary Fund sources that indicate that
the gross national savings -- money saved by individuals, companies
and the government -- of many Asian countries is anywhere from 30
percent to 50 percent of those countries' respective gross domestic
products for last year, the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
on Monday defended the Ministry of Economic Affairs'(MOEA) plan to
introduce mainland Chinese scientific and technological talent into
Taiwan, saying that the policy will not result in contentiousness in
Taiwan's high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at the Legislative Yuan about a recent MOEA
plan to introduce mainland Chinese high-tech personnel, Wang said the
screening of prospective mainland candidates would be "extremely
severe and vigilant."</P>
      <P>Only a small number of candidates will be approved, and approvals
will be made on a case-by-case basis, he said, adding that this will
ensure that the mainland hirings are added to high-tech areas where
more talent are needed.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Su Huan-chih of Tainan
County said lax government control over inflows of high-tech
personnelfrom the mainland -- for example, allowing mainland Chinese
with only a junior-college- or college-level education to enter
Taiwan -- would deal a blow to the local job market, which is already
faced with an alarming unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>Su, who does not see the proposed influx of mainland high-tech
talent as an answer to Taiwan's bid to upgrade its high-tech
industry, urged the MOEA to be extraordinarily careful when adopting
the plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUNGER STRIKE FOR PLEBISCITE PROVISION WILL CONTINUE, SAYS LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A hunger strike in support of the
establishment of provisions for holding plebiscites entered its third
day Monday, and the strike's organizer said it would continue despite
recent actions by the ruling Kuomintang that appear conciliatory.</P>
      <P>Trong R. Chai, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator
who is leading the strike, said on Monday that the strike would not
end simply because the KMT has agreed to add discussions about the
establishment of provisions to the legislature's agenda.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, the DPP's party whip at the Legislative Yuan,
said the party will not negotiate with the KMT when it is insincere.</P>
      <P>Chang said the DPP would agree to negotiations only if they are
conducive to the final passage for a bill adding plebiscite
provisions to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The DPP will continue to say no to the KMT if the ruling party
aims only to alter the legislature's agenda to include discussions on
the matter and then kill the enactment proposal, Chang said, adding
that he supports the continuation of the hunger strike, which is
currently being staged in front of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP sources monitoring the health of the
strikers, most strikers are weak but still in fair health, and no one
has had to be hospitalized so far.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Secretary-General John Chang called for the
strikers "not to overdo it" after they have made their stance known.
He said hunger strikes are too extreme and threaten to undermine
social stability.</P>
      <P>The secretary-general said the Republic of China is a politically
open society, where different opinions can be voiced from various
channels, and efforts to change the government's policies can be
achieved through amendments to the Constitution and rules of law. It
is unnecessary for people to take such extreme measures as engaging
in hunger strikes, he said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A major military exercise will be held in
late June, military sources said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Military sources made the remarks after Minister of National
Defense Tang Fei, announced in the legislature early in the day that
the Hankuang Exercise will be held as scheduled but will not be a
large-scale exercise.</P>
      <P>Tang, fielding questions from the National Defense Committee of
the Legislative Yuan, said that in view of the changing pattern of
warfare, the military will reduce the number of large-scale exercises
in order not to disrupt the lives of the public and to stop the waste
of manpower and material.</P>
      <P>Military sources said Army General headquarters is now
coordinating the Hankuang Exercise.</P>
      <P>The sources said the Hankuang Exercise will focus on war games
and small-scale live-fire drills for the theater command posts,
adding that the scale, mobilized military personnel and ranking
officials participating will be smaller than in past years.</P>
      <P>The reason behind the scaled-down exercise is to avoid disrupting
the lives of civilians and to ease political and military tensions
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The military sources ignored a question on whether the timing of
late June was chosen in consideration of the autumn visit to Taiwan
of mainland's top negotiator Wang Daohan, saying only that the
exercise will be held to verify the training of the armed forces.</P>
      <P>They said the climate as well as the training progress of
military personnel are most suitable for holding the exercise in June,
adding that there was no special political consideration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>16 ILLEGAL MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS ARRESTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   12   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sixteen illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants were seized off the northern Taiwan coast near Yehliu on
Monday, maritime police said.</P>
      <P>Also arrested were Tung Mu-tsun, skipper of the Suao-based
fishing boat Chinshunchi No. 12 and other crew members aboard the
ship.</P>
      <P>Police said they were tipped off last week that the Chinshunchi
planned to take advantage of rough seas in the Taiwan Strait in
recent days to smuggle mainland people into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Keelung maritime police squad then formed a special task
force to keep close monitoring of suspicious offshore fishing boat
activities.</P>
      <P>During a routine patrol around midnight, maritime police
found that the Chinshunchi was operating in waters three nautical
miles off Yehliu.</P>
      <P>Police then boarded the fishing boat for a spot check and
discovered 16 stowaways from mainland China's Fujian province. After
extensive questioning of Chinshunchi crewmen and mainland stowaways,
police found that the failed human smuggling was jointly organized
by criminal rings on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Police said mainland people intending to sneak into Taiwan were
required to pay 13,000-to-20,000 renmingbi (mainland currency) to
the mainland human smuggling ring which would then purchased
legal "service permits" from mainland China's security offices at a
price of 500 renminbi apiece.</P>
      <P>When the number of prospective mainland applicants reaches a
certain level, the mainland ring would inform its Taiwan partner when
and where it would transport the would-be mainland immigrants. Its
Taiwan partner would then send a speed boat to carry mainland
stowaways from a midpoint in the Taiwan Strait to Taiwan. According
to police, the Taiwan smuggling ring could make 5,000-to-6,000
renminbi by smuggling a mainland resident into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Police said this was the first time that they have discovered
such corporate-style human smuggling operations. Moreover, all the
16 mainland stowaways were wearing Western-style suits and leather
shoes.</P>
      <P>The 16 mainlanders have been sent to an illegal mainland
immigrants detention center in northern Taiwan and will be
repatriated later, while Chinshunchi crewmen have been detained on
charges of violating Taiwan's anti-smuggling law.</P>

      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) is studying the feasibility of cooperating with Japanese and
Philippine companies to set up a naphtha cracker plant in Bataan,
Philippines.</P>
      <P>CPC officials noted that the CPC, PNOC Petrochemical Development
Corp. (PPDC) of the Philippines, and the Itochu Corp. of Japan, signed
a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 1998 to develop, construct and
operate a US$600 million naphtha cracker plant in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said that the company is now studying the
conditions of the proposed plant, including the middle and
down-stream petrochemical plants, land acquisition, environmental
protection, transportation, and other related matters.</P>
      <P>If the plant is built, PPDC will be in charge of the development
of the 530-hectare industrial park in Bataan, CPC will provide the
technology for the naphtha cracker and Itochu will handle marketing.</P>
      <P>The proposed naphtha cracker will annually produce up to 60,000
metric tons of polymer grade ethylene and about 310,000 metric tons
of polymer grade propylene.</P>

      <P>Bangkok, April 12 (CNA): On the eve of the arrival of mainland
Chinese parliamentary leader Li Peng for a six-day official visit, a
Thai media has urged Li to explain the threat the mainland poses to
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the Spratly
Islands.</P>
      <P>The Bangkok Post, a wide-circulation English daily in Thailand,
said in an editorial that it is entirely right that communist China
be called to account for a number of serious violations of
international decency.</P>
      <P>"ASEAN continues to try to convince Beijing to renounce force
in the Spratly Islands. Five of our neighbors and friends have claims
to that confusing archipelago and (mainland) China's threat does not
help any solution," it said.</P>
      <P>The editorial adds that "The Chinese action in Tibet can
charitably be described as merciless."</P>
      <P>Reminding its readers that a 10-year effort to cover up the
Tiananmen massacre continues and that hundreds of Chinese are in jail
simply for attempting to criticize that blood bath, the English
newspaper told Thai readers that Li, who will enjoy the Songkran
festival in Ching Mai April 13-15, is the author of that shameful
butchery.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Li's visit to Thailand properly will draw some protests over
the Tiananmen slaughter." it says, stressing that Thai citizens have
the right to such free speech.</P>
      <P>The Bangkok Post also urged Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpei, in
his forthcoming trip to the Chinese mainland in late April, to

(By Maubo Chang)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 12 (CNA): Australia's strong economic growth is
expected to lose steam later this year as a result of an "investment
recession" triggered by the flagging mining industry and a slowdown in
spending on curing the millennium bug and the Sydney 2000 Olympic
Games, according to a leading research body.</P>
      <P>Access Economics warned that economic growth could fall to only
2.5 percent in fiscal 1999-2000, down sharply from its forecast of
4.3 percent for the current year, which ends on June 30.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review on Monday quoted JP Morgan-New
York as predicting that Australia will be the 24th fastest growing
nation during 2000, down from last year's fourth position.</P>
      <P>The forecast from Access Economics says the Australian
economy will lose steam by the end of this year and early 2000 as a
result of a global economic slowdown, a business investment recession
and a housing sector that will no longer significantly
boosts national demand.</P>
      <P>"Consumer spending will keep roaring for at least another six
months, boosted by the cocktail of real wages, low interest rates,
cheap Asian imports and surging share markets and house prices. And
come late 2000, there is the promised land of one of the largest ever
personal income tax cuts in Australia," the report says.</P>
      <P>"But ... Australia is staring down the barrel of an investment
recession. The long boom in mining investment is ending and that will
be reinforced next year by an easing of investment spending on the
millennium bug and the Olympics," it adds.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei is preparing to participate in the
World Trade Organization's (WTO) new round of talks in the autumn,
according to officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>MOEA officials pointed out Monday that issues concerning
agriculture, services, government purchases, investments, trade and
environment protection, will be included in the new round of
talks.</P>
      <P>As to the framework under which the talks will be conducted,
there is still difference between the American and European camps,
MOEA officials noted.</P>
      <P>The Office of the US Trade Representative announced that the
WTO's 3rd Ministerial Meeting is scheduled to convene on Nov. 30 in
Seattle, Washington, which will be followed by a new round of WTO
talks after the Uruguay Round.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) under the MOEA, deemed that although not a member of the WTO,
Taipei expects to be allowed in the new round of talks. As of Monday,
various departments of the government, including MOEA, and the
Council of Agriculture under the Executive Yuan, are actively
preparing for the talks, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen said the European Union favors a multi-lateral framework of
negotiation, along with Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Hungary, Argentina,
South Korea, Chile, Iceland, and Australia. Additionally, the EU
reached a consensus with Japan recently that the negotiations will be
concluded within three years.</P>
      <P>However, the US and Canada asserted that the new round of talks
should be addressed according to categories, pointed out Chen.</P>
      <P>Most WTO members supported suggestions that each accord reached
under the WTO, should be handled as the top priorities of the next
round of talks.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that the new round of talks will be critical
to Taipei's entry into the WTO and a further opening of markets,
government authorities attached extreme importance to the autumn

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of ROC nationals making
overseas trips registered the first decline in 12 years in 1998,
according to statistics released by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Monday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level agency said ROC nationals made a total of 5.91
million overseas visits in 1998, down 4.1 percent from 1997. It was
the first negative growth since 1987, the agency said.</P>
      <P>ROC travelers to all major tourist destinations dropped last
year except Europe. The number of ROC visitors to Europe increased
4.5 percent in 1998 as compared with the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the rare travel decline to a
combination of factors, including a general domestic economic
slowdown, the depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar against major
foreign currencies, and the implementation of a bi-weekly five-day
work week system which results in a reduction in long holidays.</P>
      <P>DGBAS tallies showed that sightseeing remained the main purpose
of local people's overseas trips, accounting for 80 percent of total
overseas visits.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Asia remained the top travel destination, accounting
for 4.47 million overseas visits or 75.6 percent of the total.
Nevertheless, the ratio of Asia-bound visits to overall overseas
trips fell 14.8 percent from 1991's 90.4 percent.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's per capita national income and the number of
flights to Europe and North and South America increasing steadily,
ROC visitors to those areas have also risen substantially.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan people made 705,000 visits to North and South
America, marking a 1.5-fold growth from the 1991 level.</P>
      <P>Europe has emerged as a new favorite travel destination for ROC
nationals who made a total of 196,000 visits to European countries
in 1998, representing an 8.8-fold increase in seven years' time.</P>
      <P>Thanks to geographic proximity, Hong Kong and Macau have
replaced Japan as the top overseas travel destinations since 1988.
In 1998, Hong Kong and Macau took a 39.3 percent share of total ROC
overseas travelers; Japan came in second, with 11.4 percent; the
United States ranked third, with 9.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan visitors to South Korea has decreased
substantially since the two countries severed diplomatic
ties in 1992. In 1998, Taiwan visitors to South Korea accounted for
a mere 1.5 percent of total ROC overseas holidaymakers,
down from 8.5 percent recorded in 1991.</P>

China Airlines charter flight.</P>
      <P>The delegation consists of 91 members, including government
officials, representatives from charity groups, 26 medical personnel
from the Lu Chu Medical Group, six legislators, 18 reporters and 10
physicians and engineers from the Defense Ministry.</P>
      <P>Peter Cheng, the ROC ambassador to Macedonia, was also scheduled
to go with the delegation to assume his duties in Skopje.</P>
      <P>The relief materials, worth US$2 million and weighing about 12
tons, include medicines, medical appliances, sleeping bags, blankets,
and clothing. In addition, the ROC has also ordered ambulances,
trucks and jeeps from neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>Lee told reporters that about 150,000 refugees have already fled
into Macedonia from neighboring Kosovo Province in Yugoslavia, posing
a heavy burden, which is why the ROC government decided to organize
its "humanitarian mission."</P>
      <P>The ROC established diplomatic relations with Macedonia last
January.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the ROC delegation will set up a field hospital
at a refugee camp, with the 26 Taiwan medical personnel providing
first-aid services to the refugees for two weeks or more.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Defense Ministry personnel are medical and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's people enjoy complete speech and
media freedom, which combined with the island's information
development, make an important international magazine market, said
President Lee on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with a group of foreign
delegate to the 1999 Taipei International Magazine Symposium.</P>
      <P>The symposium is the first international magazine symposium
hosted by Taiwan's magazine industry in 50 years, and this year's
subject is the changes and new opportunities for the magazine market
in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan hosted this year's meeting in order to understand
the international magazine market and to profit from the experience
of renowned magazine editors and managers in the run-up to the 21st
century's age of information.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that Taiwan is a free and democratic country,
which has contributed to the well-rounded development of its media
and offers a diversified choice of magazines. The local magazine
market is very competitive, but in a market-oriented industry, the
future of magazines will be decided by market force, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has plans to develop Taiwan into an
Asian-Pacific media center since it possess a vast Mandarin-language
market, Lee said, adding that the plan's foundation lies in the
country's flourishing media environment and its information
technology.</P>
      <P>Present at the meeting included American Magazine Association
chairman Donald D. Kummerfeld; Roger Black, chairman of the Roger
Black group; Asian Weekly president Jack Maisano; Dieter Filip,
president of market analysis for Germany's Burda magazine group; and
Reader's Digest Chinese-version editor-in-chief Feng Chiang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CALLS FOR CROSS-BORDER COOPERATION TO PROTECT GREEN TURTLES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An international seminar on conservation
of green turtles opened in Taipei on Monday to discuss cross-border
cooperative projects to protect the endangered species.</P>
      <P>Oceanographers and experts in marine ecology from the United
States, Japan, the Philippines, mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia
and the host Republic of China took part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Professor Chen I-chun of National Taiwan Ocean University said at
the opening session that the green turtles which traditionally arrive
on Wangan Island in Taiwan's offshore Penghu County to breed travel
over a very wide area.</P>
      <P>"Satellite tracking shows that green turtles usually migrate to
the continental shelf off mainland China's eastern coast after laying
their eggs on Wangan Island," Chen said, adding that the green
turtles' migratory routes spans from Japan in the north to the South
China Sea in the south.</P>
      <P>Giving a brief introduction to the habits and life-cycle of the
green turtle, He noted that of the thousands of hatchlings which
emerge each year from buried nests on Wangan Island, only a tiny
percentage reach maturity and return to lay their own eggs and repeat
the cycle. Apart from coming ashore to breed, the turtles spend their
entire lives at sea.</P>
      <P>As they must surface to breathe, and can only swim at speeds of
one or two kilometers per hour, Chen said the animals are easy prey
for unscrupulous fishermen.</P>
      <P>Noting that green turtles are a common natural asset of all East
Asian countries, Chen said cross-border cooperation among the
countries in the region is needed to conserve the rare species.</P>
      <P>To this end, the ROC has designated Wangan Island as a green
turtle refuge and breeding ground for nesting green turtles. Wangan
Island is one of the world's few green turtle habitats that remains
largely untouched by human intrusion.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture has also commissioned
National Taiwan Ocean University to conduct a long-term study on the
green turtle, and the university has been tracking the turtles' using
satellite technology since 1994.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA WILL BENEFIT FROM US-MAINLAND TRADE AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 12 (CNA): Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer on
Monday welcomed a trade breakthrough between the United States and
mainland China, predicting Australian exporters will benefit.</P>
      <P>In a news release faxed to the CNA on Monday, Fischer, who also
serves as trade minister, said, "This is good news both for
Australian exporters and the world trading regime. "The deal moves
mainland China a step closer to joining the World Trade Organization,
which if it proceeds, will see the concessions reached in bilateral
negotiations being made available to other countries worldwide,
including Australia," he said.</P>
      <P>"Australia has consistently been very supportive of the
mainland's entry into the WTO on commercially meaningful terms.
China's membership would unlock large additional trade opportunities
for Australia," he said.</P>
      <P>He stressed however that a final outcome on mainland China's
accession to the WTO "will depend on full agreement being reached
with all of China's WTO partners." "These new Chinese offers are of
great potential value to Australian exporters and point the way to
acceptable outcomes for the unresolved trade issues of importance to
Australia, which include access for sugar and wool," Fischer said.</P>
      <P>"I will pursue these outstanding issues when I visit China next
month," he added. Fischer said the trade deal would improve market
access for Australian agricultural products in the Chinese market.
These include wheat, rice and cotton.</P>
      <P>"China has also offered to reduce its agricultural tariffs
dramatically, with most to phase down over 5 years to maximum levels
of around 10 percent to 20 percent," he said. "For example, beef and
pork tariffs would be reduced to 12 percent, tariffs on apples,
pears, grapes, peaches and plums would be reduced to 10 percent,
tariffs on citrus to 12 percent, certain cheeses to 12 percent and
wine to 20 percent. These arrangements will provide much improved and
predictable access to the Chinese market for many key agricultural
products," Fischer said.</P>
      <P>He said two-thirds of mainland China's industrial tariff cuts
would be fully implemented by 2003 with most of the remainder by
2005, down to maximum levels of around 10 percent for most industrial
products, including automobile parts.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said mainland China has offered to participate in
the WTO Information Technology Agreement, which requires the
elimination of tariffs on a range of computer and other high-tech
products.</P>
      <P>"These outcomes will benefit Australian companies involved in
insurance, professional services such as legal services and
accountancy, engineering, education services, telecommunications and
distribution services," Fischer said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO STEP UP ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Sun, a daily newspaper of Hong Kong,
reported Monday that Beijing is to target officials in the higher
echelons of government organizations for anti-corruption
investigation in the next two years.</P>
      <P>The report quoted informed sources in Beijing as saying that
the decision was made when mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
Premier Zu Rongji, and Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), met on April 3 with officials from the Ministry of
Supervision of the State Council, the Commission for Discipline
Inspection of the CPC Central Military Commission, and the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that the anti-corruption efforts are being offset
primarily by resistance from the political, judicial, law, and
disciplinary sectors. The problems caused by "leading officials" of
these sectors must be solved in "the anti-corruption struggle," he
was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"Leading officials" at the provincial and ministerial levels,
and in the law enforcement, procuratorial, judicial, and other related
sectors of the government will soon become the targets of
investigation in the anti-corruption drive. The officials of
mainland China's financial and investment organizations in Hong Kong
and other parts of the world will also be targeted, the report said.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, Zhu acknowledged that the problem of government
corruption is rather serious and said that the central government
will spend more money in fighting financial and economic crimes,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Beijing has long been criticized by the general public for being
able to catch small fry only in the on-going anti-graft campaign, it
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ILLEGAL MIGRANTS BELIEVED PART OF SMUGGLING TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 12 (CNA): The latest group of illegal migrants
landing in New South Wales is possibly part of a people-smuggling
racket from mainland China, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said
on Monday.</P>
      <P>Australian police have so far arrested 54 illegal migrants, up
from 43 detained last week when the government was alerted on the
arrival of boat people, including three Chinese, at the Coffs Harbor
in New South Wales.</P>
      <P>Police believe more than 60 illegal migrants could have landed.</P>
      <P>Ruddock told reporters that it's possible the illegal immigrants
were part of a people-smuggling racket from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, mainland Chinese authorities allowed a group
of Australian police and academics to meet officials from the
mainland's southeast coastal provinces to discuss what is assessed to
be the largest illegal immigration racket in the world.</P>
      <P>Coincidentally, these provinces are also headquarters for much of
mainland China's illicit drug trade, according to the Sydney Morning
Herald.</P>
      <P>In an editorial on Monday, the daily says much of the illicit
immigration racket, together with heroin smuggling, appears to
originate in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The latest group of illegal migrants landed in Australia
undetected just like the earlier group of mainland Chinese boat
people, who landed in Queensland recently without being detected by
the Australian coast guard.</P>
      <P>Ruddock believed the arrival of illegal immigrants will be slowed
by the government's proposed reforms to limit the access of asylum
seekers to judicial review.</P>
      <P>He said Australia must have a system that ensures that unlawful
arrivals are not able to frustrate and delay their removal,
particularly by using endless court actions to do so.</P>
      <P>The editorial says Australia should encourage mainland Chinese
authorities to clamp down on illegal rackets, identify and punish all
operators to help stop the entry of illegal migrants to Australia.</P>
      <P>Australian immigration officials said the 54 illegal migrants
would be questioned whether they paid an international smuggling
syndicate to escape Asia's economic doldrums.</P>
      <P>Immigration experts said the illegal migrants also routinely come
from Vietnam, Indonesia, and some Eastern European countries. Their
main purpose is to seek the good life in Australia, they said.</P>

Australian police disabling potentially dangerous people has helped
reduce violent confrontations with no evident health risks to
either police or suspects, according to a 30-month internal review.</P>
      <P>A review of incidents in which police used the

either gave up or were immediately disabled. However, in at least
half the cases, police suffered minor side effects from secondary
exposure.
 After police used capsicum spray on 192 suspects and 35
animals between April 1996 and October 1998, they found none of those
sprayed suffered severe allergic reactions.</P>
      <P>About 50 percent of those sprayed recovered fully in 30 minutes
or less, 79 percent within 45 minutes, with police adding that none
suffered any medical complications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTIGATING ALLEGED DUMPING BY US DRAM MAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan on Monday decided to investigate
whether dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip makers in the United
States have dumped their products on the island's market.</P>
      <P>The Tariff Committee under the Finance Ministry made the decision
after receiving complaints from the Taiwan Semiconductors
Industry Association (TSIA) on March 12.</P>
      <P>The TSIA said that Taiwan's DRAM market, which accounts for about
14 percent share of the world's DRAM consumption, is open to foreign
competition, and pointed out that over 80 percent of locally used
DRAMs are imported.</P>
      <P>However, it said that local DRAM prices fell 10-fold last year,
resulting in some makers going out of business, and others canceling
expansion plans.</P>
      <P>The association laid the blame on DRAM makers in the United
States who have dumped their products on the local market at prices
46 percent below fair market levels.</P>
      <P>According to local regulations, the Trade Investigation Committee
will primarily determine, within 45 days of being given notice by the
Finance Ministry, whether US DRAMs have harmed local products.</P>
      <P>If the Trade Investigation Committee comes to a positive
conclusion, the Tariff Committee will then conduct a formal
investigation into the dumping charges, and if the conclusion is
positive, will suggest punitive tariffs on US products. This
suggestion will require approval by the Cabinet before it can
formally go into effect.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 12 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local engineering company was accused on
Monday by an opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator
of exploiting its casual workers, a charge denied by company
officials.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Legislator Chien Hsi-kai and workers'
representatives alleged that the RSEA Engineering Corporation forced
casual workers to quit, either by refusing to renew their contracts
or by cutting their salaries by 55 percent in exchange for contract
renewals.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, after more than one thousand contracts were
suspended, 80 percent of which were with aboriginal residents, the
company then made up the labor shortfall with foreign laborers, at a
greatly reduced basic salary. "RSEA benefits foreign laborers at the
expense of local workers" Chien alleged.</P>
      <P>Workers' Representative Lin Shi-chien alleged that RSEA stopped
renewing contracts for workers with the excuse that it was
streamlining its operations, and said that the company should
compensate the workers with severance pay.</P>
      <P>However, RSEA Chief Secretary Chen Ming-chuang, who also attended
the press conference, said the former state-run company was still
streamlining its operations as part of the privatization process, and
added that only around 600 aboriginal residents were under contract
with the company. He also denied they had been dismissed, and
rejected the demand for severance pay.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Council of Labor Affairs, the
annulment of contracts with local workers and replacement with
foreign labors violates the Employment Services Act, which guarantees
equal job opportunities.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that according to existing labor laws, foreign
laborers rather than local workers should be first to go during
economic recession.</P>
      <P>The officials said further classification was necessary to decide
whether the workers fall under the Labor Standards Law's definition
of "casual workers," and added that the council also plans to check
if RSEA has acted unlawfully by employing foreign laborers.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang on Monday reiterated
its opposition to a proposal to enact a plebiscite law to pave the
way for deciding the country's future through plebiscite.</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-ching, executive director of the KMT's Policy
Coordination Committee, issued a two-page statement on Monday evening
to call for enactment of an initiative and referendum law, rather
than the proposed plebiscite law.</P>
      <P>As Article 17 of the nation's Constitution stipulates that "The
people shall have the right of election, recall, initiative and
referendum," he said that there is no need to consider the
controversial plebiscite law.</P>
      <P>Some Democratic Progressive Party legislators and
pro-independence activists have been staging a hunger strike in front
of the Legislative Yuan since Saturday to call for enactment of a
plebiscite law or for the writing of a plebiscite clause into the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>If such a law were to be enacted without any restrictions, the
island's future, and other major policies, would be decided by
plebiscite.</P>
      <P>The KMT statement said that, unlike the plebiscite proposal,
enacting an initiative and referendum law would be in line with the
Constitution, and would not cause unnecessary tension and suspicion
from mainland China and the international community.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a recent survey by the KMT-run Sun Yat-sen Institute
for Policy Research and Development indicated that only 30 percent of
the citizens of Taiwan support the holding of an unconditional
plebiscite.</P>
      <P>Fifty-five percent voiced their support for a plebiscite on
condition that the issue of the country's formal name, and the issue
of self-determination be excluded from the subjects covered by
plebiscite.</P>

      <P>The decision by the largest airplane manufacturer in Central and

comes after extensive lobbying by the Miami Office of Taiwan's China

      <P>Embraer has suggested producing 400 of its 70-seat ERJ-170s, and
200 of its 90-seat ERJ-190s in Taiwan over a period of 20 years.</P>
      <P>With a price tab of US$20 million apiece, such a venture would

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China appreciates and
welcomes the US Senate's passage of two pro-Taiwan resolutions, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-cheng, deputy director of the MOFA's Information and
Cultural Affairs Department, made the statement after the US Senate
on Monday unanimously approved a resolution supporting Taiwan's
proper and meaningful participation in the World Health Organization
(WHO).</P>
      <P>The US Senate also adopted a concurrent resolution urging the
Clinton administration to reaffirm its secuirty commitment to Taiwan
and to push mainland China to renounce the use of force against
Taiwan in connection with the 20th anniversary of the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA), the US law governing exchanges with Taiwan in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The WHO-related Resolution No. 26 is binding to the US executive
branch while the concurrent resolution is non-binding, which only
expresses the Senate's sense.</P>
      <P>The Resolution No. 26 also demands the US secretary of state
present a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before
April 20 detailing how the Clinton administration will help Taiwan
participate in WHO activities when the organization holds its annual
conference in Geneva in May.</P>
      <P>The resolution further requires the secretary of state to
brief the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on possible US measures
to help Taiwan join major international organizations in accordance
with a 1994 US Taiwan policy review.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the two resolutions, Chen said the ROC is grateful
to the US Senate for its generous support for Taiwan's cause.</P>
      <P>Chen echoed the US Senate's call on mainland China to renouce
the use of force against Taiwan, saying that the Senate's call
complies with the ROC's fundamental national policy of resolving all
disputes and problems across the Taiwan Strait by strictly peaceful
means.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the US White House and Congress have on
many occasions urged Beijing authorities to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan, while the ROC government has also repeatedly
called for peaceful solution to cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that mainland authorities will make positive
response to all these appeals," Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SEEKING RUSSIAN HELP FOR CARE WORKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 13 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 13 (CNA): Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer has accused Serbia of making rediculous spying charges against
aid workers while the head of the relief agency CARE Australia is in
Moscow seeking their release.</P>
      <P>Downer on Monday summoned the Yugoslav ambassador to Australia,
telling him Canberra was angry with the "preposterous " accusations 
against Steve Pratt, head of the CARE Australia in Belgrade, spied
for NATO.</P>
      <P>"The accusations against Mr. Pratt are simply preposterous,"
Downer told Yugoslav ambassador Dragan Dragojlovic at an urgent
meeting in Downer's Canberra office.</P>
      <P>Downer insisted Pratt was not a spy and reiterated his demand for
his immediate release and fellow worker Peter Wallace, both of them
now being detained in an unknow place in Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>After meeting with Downer, Dragojlovic indicated that Pratt and
Wallace might not be released until NATO bombings on Yugoslavia
stopped.</P>
      <P>"I'm sure as soon as NATO stops the bombing it will be much
easier to solve this problem," the Yugoslav envoy said.</P>
      <P>Pratt was seen on the Yugoslav television confessing that he was
spying for NATO. He was expressionless when making the deadpan
statement.</P>
      <P>"When I came to Yugoslavia, I performed some intelligence tasks
in this country, using a cover of CARE Australia," Pratt said on the
Yugoslav TV.</P>
      <P>But Pratt's wife -- Samira, who is now in Budapest, said, "For
God's sake, he's not (a spy) -- he's an aid worker."</P>
      <P>Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, now the head of
the CARE Australia, the largest relief agency in Australia, has flown
to Moscow to seek help from Russian leaders to secure the release of
the two aid workers.</P>
      <P>Australian Ambassador to Yugoslavia Chris Lamb was due to start
talks with officials of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry in Belgrade,
trying to secure the release of both Pratt and Wallace. But it is
feared the meetings will be protracted.</P>
      <P>Aid workers from Australia and other countries are becoming
worried that the spying charge against Pratt could have an impact on
their operations.</P>

      <P>Canberra, April 13 (CNA): Alarmed by an increasing influx of
refugees, Australia's Prime Minister John Howard has established a
special task force to investigate a new wave of illegal immigration
following the detention of another group of 59 boat people in Western
Australia on Monday.</P>
      <P>The latest group of illegal migrants was the third from Asia,
mainly from mainland China, within a period of less than two months.
The first group of about 50 people landed near Cairns in Queensland
undetected in March and the second group of 54 refugees landed at the
Coffs Harbor in New South Wales last week.</P>
      <P>The task force will include experts from intelligence, defense,
customs and immigration agencies.</P>
      <P>The latest group of 59 boat people, who landed at Broome in
Western Australia, came from mainland China, according to a
preliminary investigation by the Immigration Department.</P>
      <P>Their arrival forced Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock to
concede that Australia was a target of Chinese "snake heads" who
smuggle illegal immigrants internationally.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Australian Customs Service intercepted and sank an
Indonesian fishing boat off the West Australian coast on Monday after
placing 10 suspected illegal immigrants aboard under guard.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said people-smuggling rackets by air and sea were "big
business."</P>
      <P>West Australian Premier Richard Court has ordered a "beefed up"
defense presence to help check the possibility of a new wave of
illegal migrants from Asia, including mainland China, and other
countries.</P>
      <P>All boat people will be flown to a Port Hedland detention center
in Western Australia where they will be questioned concerning their
purpose of coming to Australia before being deported to countries of
origin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIGNING NON-AGGRESSION PACT IS IMPRACTICAL AT PRESENT STAGE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether a non-aggression pact is to be
signed across the Taiwan Strait will hinge on whether relations
between the two sides become more peaceful and stable, said Premier
Vincent Siew on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that Beijing is still unwilling to
relinquish the option of using force to reclaim Taiwan, Siew noted,
signing a cross-strait non-aggression pact now would be not only
impractical but risky.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remark when he answered questions at the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Siew pointed out that Taipei has long desired to develop a
peaceful and stable relationship with mainland China. That is why a
termination of the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of
the Communist Rebellion was announced by President Lee Teng-hui in
1991, he said, adding that the announcement signified the ROC
government's determination not to use force to achieve national
reunification.</P>
      <P>In response to a legislator's question concerning the
establishment of a cross-strait military mechanism based on mutual
trust, Siew cited a recent speech by President Lee in which he called
for the grounds for mutual trust to be laid. But the Beijing
authorities have not responded to the call.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATO CAN STILL NEGOTIATE WITH MILOSEVIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, April 12 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>NATO can still negotiate a peace agreement
with Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic even though he has been
branded a war criminal, Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien said
Monday.</P>
      <P>"We want all the criminals that have caused the genocide in
Serbia and the neighboring nations to face trials by the
international community," Chretien said at the House of Commons.</P>
      <P>"In the meantime, the government in Belgrade is the one that is
run by Milosevic and that is the government that exists at this
moment in that country. If they want to sign a peace agreement, even
if it is Milosevic, we should take it and if he's a war criminal he
should face the consequences of his actions in an international
court," he added.</P>
      <P>Chretien said there are no plans at this point to send ground
troops into Kosovo to aid displaced ethnic Albanian refugees, despite
words to the contrary last week by his defense minister, Art
Eggleton.</P>
      <P>"There is absolutely no discussion at this time at the
ministerial level of sending troops into Kosovo," said Chretien.</P>
      <P>"This is not something that is on the table and it's not being
considered by the government," he stressed.</P>
      <P>NATO began air strikes against Milosevic's nationalist Serb
government on March 24, sparking a mass ethnic cleansing of the
disputed province of Kosovo. Canada has sent a dozen F-18 fighters to
join the allied bombing efforts.</P>
      <P>A Globe and Mail/CTV/ANgus Reid poll of 1,000 Canadians from
April 8 to 10 shows that six out of ten would support the use of NATO
ground troops if that is the only effective way to stop the massacre
in Kosovo. Thirty-eight percent of those surveyed opposed sending
ground forces under any circumstances.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENTRY INTO WTO DOES NOT NECESSARILY SIGNIFY A WIDE OPEN DOOR: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not necessarily open its
markets widely to mainland China and other member states of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) after its entry into the world trade
regulatory body, said a ranking government official Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
under the Executive Yuan, made the remark in view of the expectation
that both Taipei and Beijing are likely to become full members of the
WTO by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that it will not be necessary for Taiwan to lift its
ban on the "three links" -- direct mail, transport and trade links
across the Taiwan Strait -- after both sides are admitted into the
WTO.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan's entry, stressed Hsu, Taipei's current "no haste,
be patient" policy in terms of Taiwan investment in the mainland
would not likely be affected.</P>
      <P>It is premature to discuss at present whether Taipei would employ
the "exclusion provision" in dealing with mainland China under the
WTO framework, the MAC vice chairman said. He added that it will
depend on whether the implementation of the provision would have any
adverse impact on Taiwan's industries.</P>
      <P>According to WTO regulations, a member is allowed to exclude
another member from open market access under special conditions.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Hsu said, no member would invoke the measure,
because it would result in exclusions by other members.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday that
he hoped the budget for national defense in the future could be
raised to the standard of advanced nations.</P>
      <P>Siew, fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, said the budget
for national defense for the next fiscal year, which will begin July
1, 1999, is too low.</P>
      <P>He noted that the budget for national defense has accounted for
more than 6 percent of the country's gross national product (GNP) in
past years. In recent years, however, the level has fallen, he said,
adding that next year's defense spending accounts for 2.75 percent of
Taiwan's GNP, compared with 3 percent to 3.5 percent in advanced
countries.</P>
      <P>For the sake of national security, Siew asked that the budget for
national defense be raised to a par with advanced nations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman from the Ministry of National Defense said
that the army will complete its conversion training by 2001.</P>
      <P>Kung Feng-ting said that all armed forces are expected to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 13 (CNA): Representatives from Australian
academics, migrants from Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Chinese,
Hong Kong and Indonesia have requested the Howard government to
extend visas for about 20 Chinese Indonesian women victimized during
riots in Jakarta last year.</P>
      <P>The group on Monday went to see Immigration Minister Philip
Ruddock to make a direct request with a petition statement signed by
different Chinese associations in Canberra and Sydney.</P>
      <P>In addition, Australian scholars from different universities,
including the Australian National University, Melbourne University
and Adelaide University, and human rights workers also signed the
petition.</P>
      <P>They called on the Australian government to give "a priority
processing and facilitation of the special protection visa to the
Chinese Indonesia rape victims on grounds of hardship so that they
can remain in Australia for recovery".</P>
      <P>Ruddock on Monday spent about one hour with the representatives
in his office in Canberra. He was sympathetic and explained the
government policy in regard to the handling of such cases.</P>
      <P>The 20 Chinese Indonesian women, who were raped and tortured
during the riots in Jakarta and other cities in Indonesia in May
1998, were given a three-month visa in late 1998.</P>
      <P>None of the victims disclosed their experience to the media out
of fear for their lives and those of relatives still living in
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Januar Achmad, who is an Indonesian health official of Chinese
origin, now making a doctoral study at the Australian National
University, told CNA many migrants from Taiwan, mainland China, Hong
Kong and other Asian countries were very sympathetic with the plight
of Chinese Indonesian women and jointly signed a petition, which was
presented to Ruddock personally so that he could consider extending
the three-month visas.</P>
      <P>Several associations in Sydney have raised considerable funds to
be used for the victims during their stay in Australia.</P>
      <P>"A return to Indonesia in the near future would be extremely
dangerous for the women concerned," Januar said.</P>
      <P>"Australia should not compound this feeling of insecurity by
expelling the Chinese Indonesian (women) who have fled to Australia,"
he added.</P>
      <P>He said Chinese Indonesians were targeted by Indonesian gangs for
systematic looting, murder, burning of homes and businesses and rape
last May. They could face more sufferings during elections for
parliamentarians and the Indonesian president in June and August
respectively, he added.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Sydney Jones of the Asia Division of the Human
Rights Watch, said: "I believe ethnic Chinese in Indonesia have a
valid fear of persecution in Indonesia."</P>
      <P>He said ethnic Chinese are targeted to some extent during any
period of social or political unrest in Indonesia. "This has been the
case since the Dutch colonial administration. But I have never seen
anti-Chinese sentiment as it is today, nor would I have written an
affidavit supporting political asylum simply on the grounds of
ethnicity," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US-TAIWAN-PRC RELATIONS COMPLICATED: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Act stipulates
that the United States cannot allow Taiwan to be invaded by mainland
China, nor can it allow Taiwan's future to be decided solely by
Beijing, stressed an American expert on China Monday.</P>
      <P>John F. Copper, a professor of international studies at Rhodes
College in Tennessee, said that two opposing views of mainland China
have caused a cleavage between the executive and legislative branches
of the US government, and this divide is the most pressing question
facing US foreign policy makers.</P>
      <P>One view is that the United States should regard the People's
Republic of China as a challenge and a threat to American interests
abroad and, consequently, as a present-day or future enemy. The
opposing view holds that the United States should regard mainland
China as both a friend and the key to the United States' fulfilling
its foreign policy objectives and maintaining a peaceful world.</P>
      <P>The United States faces a dilemma over Taiwan, Copper said. The
United States supports democracy around the world, and this is a
central tenet of American foreign policy. The United States was to a
considerable degree responsible for Taiwan's becoming a democracy, he
said. As a result of Taiwan's democratization, its people and
government feel they are entitled to decide the country's future, and
most observers agree, Copper said.</P>
      <P>But this contradicts America's "one China" policy and better
Washington-Beijing relations. This dilemma accounts for the difficult
triangle between Washington and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
added the professor.</P>
      <P>The Tiananmen massacre in 1989 and the Taiwan Strait missile
crisis in 1996 have dramatically changed the US-Taiwan-PRC
relationship, with Taiwan's democratization exacerbating both crises,
said Copper. But Washington still views mainland China as important
because it is a big power that cannot be contained.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, Copper said, the United States cannot
allow Taiwan to be invaded and its future determined by Beijing
without the agreement of the Taiwan people. Taiwan has followed the
model of American democracy, and it cannot be abandoned if America
wants to remain a world leader or a nation with credibility in East
Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan Relations Act is open to interpretation, it
does seem to oblige the United States to protect Taiwan from attacks
against it by force. Even if it does not, he added, Congress would
likely interpret the act this way in the event Taiwan is threatened.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Copper said, Washington can agree to Taiwan's
forging links with mainland China, even permanent political ones. The
United States would also be willing to guarantee that Taiwan does not
come under the control of Japan or any other nation.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it can -- and will -- "warn advocates of Taiwan
independence and perhaps even prevent them from coming to power by
declaring that its security guarantees do not apply if the present or
any future government declares Taiwan independent," he said.</P>
      <P>All of this seems to suggest that the three players in the "China
triangle" espouse positions that are not negotiable. Yet all three
can also make concessions and can probably overcome at least some of
their differences, Copper pointed out.</P>
      <P>"Talks should emphasize areas of agreement. In addition, the
three players need to be patient and seek results over a fairly long
period of time rather than quickly. The alternative to success is not
one to ponder easily," he said.</P>
      <P>Professor Copper was invited by the World Affairs Council in
Dallas, Southern Methodist University and the World Affairs Council
in San Antonio to speak about US relations with both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC UNDECIDED ON ANTI-DUMPING TARIFFS FOR US DRAM MAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has not yet
decided whether to levy anti-dumping tariffs on imported US dynamic
random access memory (DRAM) chips, MOF Vice Minister Yen Ching-chang
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Tariff Committee under the MOF has decided to investigate
whether DRAM makers in the United States have dumped their products
in Taiwan after receiving complaints from the Taiwan Semiconductor
Industry Association (TSIA) on March 12.</P>
      <P>Under the ministry's procedures, the MOF will send official
documents on the case to the Trade Investigation Committee under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs. The committee will then start a 45-day
initial investigation into what damage may have been incurred by
Taiwan's domestic DRAM industry.</P>
      <P>A working group of the Trade Investigation Committee is slated to
hold its first meeting on April 16. In the initial investigation the
group will conduct interviews and hold public hearing to collect
data.</P>
      <P>The group will submit a report to the Trade Investigation
Committee, which will rule on whether US DRAM chips have hurt
Taiwan's semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>If the committee rules no damage has been done, the matter will
be dropped. If the committee rules that Taiwan DRAM makers have been
hurt, it will send its report to the MOF for a two-stage
investigation. The first stage of that investigation will last 75
days and the second, 60 days.</P>
      <P>During that investigation the MOF would decide whether to impose
tentative anti-dumping tariffs.</P>
      <P>If the MOF finds that US DRAM chips have been dumped in the
island's market, it would send official documents to the Trade
Investigation Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
let the committee proceed with a final investigation into what damage
had been incurred by Taiwan's semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>The committee would then make a final determination as to whether
US DRAM chips had indeed caused harm to Taiwan's manufacturers. If it
decides harm had been caused, the MOF would make within 10 days a
determination of whether to levy anti-dumping tariffs. Cabinet
approval would be required, though, before the tariffs could go into
effect.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FIRST TEST-TUBE BABY TURNS 14</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first and also Asia's oldest
test-tube baby will turn 14 on Friday.</P>
      <P>The youngster, identified only by his surname of Chang, is now a
second-grade student at a Taipei junior high school. Like many other
local teenagers, Chang feels great academic pressure and complains
about a shortage of time for athletic and recreational activities.</P>
      <P>Slim of stature and 162 cm tall, Chang is a gentle, polite and
quiet student. He is also diligent, and ranked top of his class last
semester.</P>
      <P>Interviewed recently, he said that his greatest dream is to
become a medical doctor, so that he can "help many other people."</P>
      <P>Chang said he discovered he was a test-tube baby when he was
seven years old.</P>
      <P>"I came to learn of my origin through conversations between my
mother and her friends," Chang recalled, adding that he once looked
up the term "test-tube baby" in an encyclopedia in order to find out
what it means. However, he admitted that he still does not fully know
its meaning.</P>
      <P>Chang said he has never told any of his classmates that he was
born through assisted reproductive technology (ART). "I see no need
to talk about that with my classmates," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang, whose favorite subjects are English and physical
education, and who counts basketball, swimming and cycling as his
preferred sports, said that in any case, he does not feel there is
any difference between him and his peers.</P>
      <P>Chang's mother said that at the time, she had no idea she was to
become the mother of Taiwan's first test-tube baby, and added that
one year after giving birth to her test-tube baby through Cesarean
section, she became pregnant again -- though this time fertilization
occurred naturally.</P>
      <P>The doctor who successfully used ART to help Chang Shu-hui
produce Taiwan's first test-tube baby was Chang Sheng-ping, who is
now chief of the reproductive endocrinology division at Veterans
General Hospital in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chang recalled that he was studying reproductive technology
in the United States when the first ART baby was delivered in Britain
in 1978.</P>
      <P>Under his efforts, the Veterans General Hospital formed an ART
task force in 1984, which managed to create the island's first ART
baby after 41 failed attempts.</P>
      <P>Over the past 14 years, Dr. Chang has helped many women suffering
from endometriosis and tubal occlusion to deliver babies with various
assisted reproductive techniques. A total of 1,300 test-tube babies
have been born with Dr. Chang's assistance over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Other local hospitals began to experiment with ART five or six
years after Veterans General Hospital successfully created its first
test-tube baby.</P>
      <P>According an estimate by Dr. Soong Yung-kuei, chief of the
department of obstetrics and gynecology at Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital, more than 10,000 test-tube babies have been born in Taiwan
over the past 14 years.</P>
      <P>Soong, who concurrently serves as president of the ROC
Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology Society, said with the
maturity of ART techniques in Taiwan, about 800 to 1,000 "test-tube"
babies are born here annually.</P>
      <P>Soong said although progress in ART expertise has helped resolve
nearly all infertility problems here, new worries and problems have
arisen. "Such worries include the birth of ART children
with genetic disorder or diseases, and ethical problems," he noted.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Soong said he is working on an ART white
paper which will detail evolution of reproductive medicine and its
potential risks and problems. The white paper is scheudled to
be unveiled at the turn of the century.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY DRILLS, WAR GAMES SCHEDULED FOR MAY AND JUNE: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Armed Forces are
scheduled to hold a combat drill in mid-May and a tri-forces military
exercise in late June to test its combat preparedness and maintain
its fighting edge, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The drill, code named "Chengkung," will be held on the offshore
island of Penghu in mid-May to examine the combat capability of the
newly created "integrated tank brigade," said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Only about 550 army personnel will take part in the "Chengkung"
drill, which will feature 12 M60A3 tanks, tank support troops, and
various light artillery, including 105 mm cannons.</P>
      <P>The drill, which is scheduled to last for about 20 minutes, will
only be a small-scale test drill, rather than a full display of
weaponry, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Penghu was chosen as the location of the drill
because of the island group's strategic importance, and the fact that
the region is judged by the MND as one of the most likely landing
sites in the event of an invasion by mainland Chinese troops.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also stressed that in order to preserve the area's
unique environment, blank cartridges rather than live ammunition will
be used, while the drill will not involve protected areas where coral
reefs, manmade reefs and seashell beaches are located.</P>
      <P>In regard to the tri-forces war game slated for late June, the
spokesman said the "Hankuang No. 15" exercise, an annual event, will
focus on small-scale live-fire drills for theater command posts.</P>
      <P>The exercise, aimed at testing the defensive capabilities of
Taiwan and Penghu, will also be joined by a newly-created integrated
brigade from Kinmen, an ROC-held frontline post located near mainland
China's coastal province of Fujian, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous "Hankuang" exercises, this year's event will be
small-scale, partly because of the changing patterns of warfare,
partly to avoid disrupting the lives of civilians living in the area,
and partly to ease political and military tension across the Taiwan
Strait, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An internet fair opened on Tuesday at the
Taipei Convention Center to introduce new Internet content and
applications to the island's web surfers.</P>
      <P>The four-day fair, titled "Net '99 Internet Content and Life
Expo," is being sponsored by Chinese Open System Association (COSA)
with the aim of widening net users' applications from mere e-mailing
or information-collecting to a broad range of functions such as
long-distance conferencing, electronic business, and net banking.</P>
      <P>COSA chairman Chang Shan-chen said Internet applications are
becoming more and more popular, and the relationship between people
and the Internet is getting closer and closer.</P>
      <P>However, the most common problem of Internet transmission --
congestion caused by insufficient bandwidth -- is preventing users
from working efficiently, which is why the fair is promoting the
newest broadband Internet system as a solution to the problem, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>The new system uses the cables used for cable television, which
can carry much more information than the telephone wires used at
present, and make the speed of transmission 100 times faster. For
this reason, Chang said, several companies in the industry are
promoting broadband transmission via TV cable.</P>
      <P>Although the broadband system is not widely used, either in
Taiwan or the rest of the world, the high number of local cable TV
subscribers will enable Taiwan to adapt to this new system without
needing to purchase additional facilities required for broadband
transmission, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Apart from the variety of Internet applications, COSA also hopes
attention can be drawn to the issues of privacy on the net, net
crime, net piracy, and regulations to govern the Internet.</P>
      <P>In related news, the results of a survey conducted by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications released on Tuesday
show that most of Taiwan's Internet users are not content with the
limited services and content of government web sites.</P>
      <P>The survey indicated that half of Taiwan's 4 million web surfers
have visited government web sites, and many of the survey respondents
suggested that the broadband system be adopted to improve the problem
of transmission congestion and insufficient content.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GIO CHIEF CALLS FOR PROFESSIONALISM IN MAGAZINE INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's magazine publishers should stress
professionalism, globalization and digitalization in order to cope
with the industry's general international trends, a senior
official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, director-general of the Government Information
Office (GIO), made the call in his speech delivered at the opening
session of a three-day international conference on the magazine
industry, jointly sponsored by the GIO and the Magazine Business
Association of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said local magazine publishers must adjust their concepts
concerning editing, design and management in the face of
ever-increasing competition in the industry.</P>
      <P>In addition to competition from Internet and other media, Chen
said, local magazine publishers also face competition from their
foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>The US-based National Geographic magazine, Japan's Kadokawa
bookstore and the largest German magazine group Burda have all
made inroads into Taiwan's magazine market, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Despite increasing competition, Chen said he remains optimistic
about Taiwan's magazine industry. For one thing, Chen said Taiwan's
magazine readership has continued to grow steadily.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent public survey, Chen said 60 out of every 100
local people aged between 15 and 65 have read magazines every month.
Another survey found that local magazines raked up more than NT$5.58
billion (US$169.1 million) in advertisement bills last year, second
only to newspapers and television.</P>
      <P>"The above figures indicate that there is still ample room for
the local magazine industry to grow," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He encouraged local magazine publishers to take advantage of the
current meeting to exchange views with foreign media executives and
expand their visions in order to upgrade the quality of their
magazines.</P>
      <P>"The government is determined to join forces with local magazine
publishers to develop Taiwan into a Chinese-language magazine
marketing center in Asia," Chen added.</P>
      <P>The ongoing meeting is the first of its kind since the country's
Publishing Law was phased out early this year. The conference is
also the largest in scale ever hosted by Taiwan's magazine industry
in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Eleven noted magazine managers and editors from Japan, the
United States, Germany and France have been invited to speak on
magazine marketing, designing, advertising, editing and Internet
services.</P>
      <P>The foreign guest speakers include Donald D. Kummerfeld, chairman
of the American Magazine Association; Roger Black, chairman of the
Roger Black Group; and Asian Weekly President Jack Maisano.</P>
      <P>A total of 342 local magazine publishers, editors and managers
are taking part in the discussion.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, C. S. Chien, president of the
Magazine Business Association of Taipei, said he is optimistic
about the prospects of the island's magazine industry as Chinese
readers make up a quarter of the 6 billion world population.</P>
      <P>Attracted by the vast potential Chinese readership, many foreign
magazine groups have launched Chinese magazines in Taiwan and
mainland China in recent years, Chien said.</P>
      <P>There are more than 5,800 magazines in Taiwan currently, and
over 450 of them are available on the market, forming the
highest density in the world, Chien added.</P>
      <P>In connection with the meeting, an exhibition of more than 700
periodicals, including 300 domestic and 400 foreign ones, is being
held in Taipei.</P>

      <P>Statistics released by the Bureau of
National Health Insurance (BNHI) on Tuesday reveal that each person
in Taiwan made an average of 15 visits to hospital outpatient
departments in 1998.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that twelve people out of every hundred
were hospitalized last year, far outnumbering American and European
statistics, and pushing up National Health Insurance (NHI)
expenditure every year.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that 79.9 percent of the high treatment patients
were ordinary patients, 8.9 percent were senior citizens over the age
of 65, 7 percent were infants under the age of four, and seriously
ill/injured patients accounted for just 4.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The BNHI said that many cases of abuse of the national health
insurance system were discovered in 1998, including the exchanging of
NHI cards for "other bonuses" at medical institutions, and medical
institutions claiming reimbursement for non-existent hospitalizations
and treatments.</P>
      <P>To ensure the financial integrity and sustainable development of

reimbursement system, strengthen the analysis and examination of
medical records, and provide evaluation and guidance for questionable

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US ambassador to Beijing James
Lilley described as "absurd and skin-deep" the analogy made by
Beijing's Premier Zhu Rongji between the mainland China-Taiwan
conflict and the American Civil War.</P>
      <P>Lilley said Zhu's argument that Beijing will follow US President
Abraham Lincoln's suit and will go to great lengths, even to war, to
keep the nation united, will not sell to the American public.</P>
      <P>Beijing's idea of using force to keep Taiwan from splitting is
"terrible," he said.</P>
      <P>While there were 600,000 soldiers killed in the American Civil
War between 1861 and 1865, a similar war nowadays could claim the
lives of more than 50 million, said Lilley.</P>
      <P>The heavy fatalities a civil war would entail today underlines
what a terrible idea it is of Beijing to resort to force to head off
Taiwan's schism, said Lilley.</P>
      <P>He expressed regret that President Bill Clinton failed to mention
this when Zhu made the remarks in his presence at a joint press
conference at the White House last Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ralph Clough, a Chinese affairs expert at the Johns Hopkins
University, also blasted Zhu's remarks as inappropriate.</P>
      <P>While Beijing claims that it is taking its cue from Lincoln by
threatening force against Taiwan, Clough said that some people in
Taiwan are trying to justify their campaign for Taiwan independence
by likening themselves to activists during the American revolution.</P>
      <P>Clough expressed reservation about both claims, saying that the
vast differences in the historical backgrounds would nullify any
attempt to draw support from history.</P>
      <P>In particular, he said, the American Civil War was triggered by
the moral dispute over the abolishment of slavery, while there is no
similar element in the conflict between Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the analogies of Zhu and the Taiwan separatists
might lead the American people to think seriously about territorial
integrity and people's right to self-determination, Clough said they
will not change the situation dramatically, despite the conflicting
influence they could exercise on US public opinion.</P>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday reiterated
that Taiwan will not rule out the possibility of joining the Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) system proposed by the United States.</P>
      <P>"But this cannot be decided unilaterally by ourselves, nor will
our decision on this issue be affected by the opposition of mainland
China," Siew said while fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan is studying the issues, and will need
to take into account various factors, including defense needs, the
financial burden, and the risk involved.</P>
      <P>He said that mainland China's military buildup, which poses a
great threat to the security of Taiwan, is the main reason for Taiwan
to consider joining the TMD.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Beijing's military development, and whether or not it
will exercise restraint, are two of the most important factors that
will govern Taiwan's eventual decision.</P>
      <P>Before reaching such a decision, Siew added, the nation's
military will also give priority to establishing an effective and
independent air defense capability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HUMANITARIAN MISSION STUCK IN ABU DHABI EN ROUTE TO MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Abu  Dhabi,  April  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China humanitarian aid
mission en route to Macedonia had been stuck at the airport of the
capital of the United Arab Emirates for more than 20 hours as of
Tuesday owing to bad weather conditions.</P>
      <P>After intensive negotiations with NATO headquarters and the
United Nations, which are now in charge of Macedonia's air traffic,
the Taiwan mission was finally given permission to leave for
Macedonia early on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The mission, comprised of representatives and medical personnel
from Taiwan's 17 philanthropic organizations, six legislators, 10
military doctors and engineering corpsmen, and 18 reporters, is
scheduled to arrive in the Macedonian capital of Skopje at around 5
p.m. on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The mission is bringing with it some US$2 million-worth of relief
goods, including sleeping-bags, blankets, sweaters, medicine and
medical equipment.</P>
      <P>To beef up the relief to Macedonia, centered mainly on efforts to
assist Skopje in handling the flood of refugees from the neighboring
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, which currently numbers around
120,000 so far, Taiwan has also purchased ambulances, jeeps and
trucks from other countries in the region.</P>
      <P>Vasil Tupurkovski, the head of Macedonia's reconstruction
organization whose Democratic Alternative Party holds the foreign
affairs, finance and interior ministries in a coalition government,
will receive the ROC relief aid on behalf of Macedonia at a brief
ceremony at the airport, said Vice Foreign Minister David Lee, who is
leading the group.</P>
      <P>Later on Wednesday, the group will formally meet with
Tupurkovski, who spearheaded the campaign to establish formal
relations with Taiwan and is a front-runner in Macedonia's
presidential election slated for later this year, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The 26-strong medical personnel team traveling with the aid group
is planning to establish a field hospital, probably in the Radusa
camp, for at least two weeks and possibly longer.</P>
      <P>The field hospital, to be equipped with an operating theater, two
sets of dentistry equipment, and 20 sets of surgical equipment,
together with some US$300,000-worth of medicine, is expected to
provide treatment for 400 to 500 people daily, according to Liu
Chi-chun, a medical doctor and chairman of the Taiwan Luchu
Association, which routinely provides free medical care to residents
living in rural or mountainous areas of Taiwan.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An economics official said on Tuesday that
appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar is expected in the near future,
contributed by expanded foreign trade surpluses in the first quarter
and an increasing inflow of overseas funds.</P>
      <P>However, K.C. Lee, vice chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said he would prefer a gradual
growth of the local unit's value against the greenback so that local
exporters will not sustain an intolerable impact.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar broke through the 33 barrier on Tuesday, reaching
its highest level in the past 45 days.</P>
      <P>In the first three months of this year, Taiwan's exports posted a
3.5 percent growth compared with the year-earlier level, bringing its
trade surplus to a level in excess of US$2.67 billion, according to
Lee.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, prompted by optimistic sentiment in international
stock markets, the government's financial reforms, and surging
exports, trading in the local stock market has seen 14.3 percent
growth since the end of last year, according to statistics of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>As of the end of March, the total value of listed stocks amounted
to NT$9.3 trillion (US$281.82 billion), up 11 percent from the level
at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The average daily turnover expanded to NT$95.6 billion (US$2.9
billion) in March from January's NT$67.1 billion, while that of the

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESS URGED TO STICK TO SPIRIT OF TRA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  13 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two political analysts in the United
States called on the US Congress to stick to the spirit woven
throughout the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) to ensure Taiwan's
continued existence in peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>In a letter carried in Tuesday's edition of the Washington Times,
Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute
for Public Policy Research, and Edwin J. Feulner Jr., president of
the Heritage Foundation, said that the political transition of the
last two decades would not have taken place in Taiwan without the
safety brought to the island by the guarantee provided by the TRA.</P>
      <P>In a letter to mark the 20th anniversary of the TRA which was
enacted on April 10, 1979, Demuth and Feulner said that US support
for Taiwan in the last two decades has driven the island to change
dramatically. Notably, the liberty has spread from the market to the
ballot box, and has made the island the best and proudest example of
free market and democracy in Asia.</P>
      <P>The recent actions of President Bill Clinton's administration,
however, have cast doubt on Washington's commitment to Taiwan under
the TRA, especially the promise made by Clinton to Beijing in 1998 of
no support for Taiwan independence, or "one China, one Taiwan," or
Taiwan's membership in organizations that require statehood.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Clinton's "three noes" deviates from Washington's
long-standing policy toward Taiwan, the letter urged Congress to rein
in the government by reaffirming Congress' commitment to the island
just as it did in 1979 by altering significantly the draft law of the
TRA submitted by the administration of then-President Jimmy Carter.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 21 million people in Taiwan buy almost twice the
amount of American goods purchased by the 1.2 billion people of
mainland China, the two authors called the island a real but
unappreciated and unrewarding partner of Washington in Asia.</P>
      <P>The two analysts urged Washington to substitute its "three noes"
with a resounding "yes" toward Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,   April   13  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) no longer seems uncompromising in its stance
on seeking independence for the island, said US Rep. Doug Bereuter
(R-Neb.) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Bereuter, chairman of the House Asia and Pacific Subcommittee,
said he thinks this development is a good sign for Taiwan and that he
hopes the DPP made the change in its position after making a
deliberate assessment of Taiwan's interests and of the common wishes
of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a cocktail party marking the 20th anniversary of
the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), Bereuter said he
found in his last visit to Taipei in January that the DPP seemed to
have departed from its staunchly pro-independence position.</P>
      <P>He attributed the policy shift to the DPP's poor showing in
elections last December. He said he hopes that the change was not
because of Beijing's military and political threats but because of a
deliberate consideration of Taiwan's interests and of the wishes of
its people.</P>
      <P>Bereuter, who strongly supports US President Bill Clinton's
policy of engagement with Beijing, has twice visited Taiwan. He was
in Taiwan between the end of March and early April in 1998, just one
year after Beijing launched live-ammunition missile tests off Taiwan,
and at a point when there was no indication that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait would resume dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said he will meet with former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, the
DPP's most likely presidential candidate in elections slated for
2000, when Chen visits Washington, D.C., in late April.</P>
      <P>As for Beijing's increased missile deployment in strategic
locations against Taiwan, Bereuter said he sees no sign that Beijing
has taken steps to reduce the number of missiles deployed, even
though both the US Congress and the Clinton administration have asked
Beijing to do so.</P>

      <P>Marchi made the remarks as mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
was about to visit Canada. Zhu will stop in St. John's, Newfoundland,
Wednesday, before traveling to Ottawa Thursday.</P>
      <P>Canada has played a key role in helping mainland China during its
13-year bid for membership in the WTO, Marchi said. "We don't pretend
to be as big as the United States, but our relationship (with China)
is quite strong, and in engaging the Chinese, we can have an impact."</P>
      <P>He predicted mainland China's accession to the WTO could come by
the time WTO ministers meet in Seattle at the end of November. "I
think it would make ... a lot of sense to issue a new round with the
membership of China included -- that would be my hope and I think
it's a realistic one."</P>
      <P>Mainland China was Canada's fourth-largest trading partner last
year, with two-way trade reaching almost C$10 billion. Canada
exported C$2.1 billion in goods to mainland China in 1998, while
imports were valued at C$7.7 billion.</P>
      <P>About 350 Canadian companies now do business in mainland China,
most of them small and medium-size enterprises. Canada's direct
investment in mainland China rose from C$15 million in 1991 to C$377
million in 1997, most of which is concentrated in the manufacturing
sector.</P>
      <P>Canada's main objective in mainland China has been to encourage
the latter to maintain an open-door policy and to become fully
integrated in global and regional political and economic
institutions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPORT STIMULUS PACKAGE PAYS OFF: BOFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's export stimulus package
has paid off, evident in the 3.5 percent increase in Taiwan's exports
in the first quarter of 1999, a ranking trade official said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports to Japan and South Korea registered the largest
growth of 14.6 percent and 51.7 percent in the first three months of
the year, a sharp contrast to the decrease of 22.2 percent and 37.2
percent, respectively, in outbound shipments to the two countries for
the whole of 1998, according to Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT)
Director-General Chen Ruey-long.</P>
      <P>Since the BOFT adopted the measures last year, the package has
been most effective in boosting exports to Japan and South Korea,
which can be seen in the fact that Taiwan's first-quarter growth
rates in outbound shipments to these two Asian countries were larger
than the two countries' import increase rates posted for the same
three-month period, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The BOFT head also predicted that Taiwan will register a larger
export growth rate in the second quarter, as some Southeast Asian
economies have now bottomed out of the region's financial crisis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE ARCHITECT'S PLAN TO BUILD WORLD'S TALLEST TOWER COLLAPSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 14 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Plans to build the world's tallest tower
in Melbourne have collapsed because of a payment dispute between a
well-known Australian architect and the Victorian government.</P>
      <P>The dispute has shattered architect Bruno Grollo's dreams of
building the US$1.6 billion, 113-story tower. Grollo has refused to
pay nearly US$24 million to the Victorian government for using the
Docklands land near Melbourne Harbor.</P>
      <P>The Docklands Authority on Tuesday unilaterally announced its
termination of the contract with the Grollo family, saying the
termination was the result of Grollo's refusal to meet a financial
condition of the contract for the proposed tower.</P>
      <P>Many have attacked the scale of the project, including Kim Dovey,
an associate professor of architecture and urban design at Melbourne
University. Dovey has described it as an embarrassment to Melbourne
and an enclave for the rich.</P>
      <P>But the building has the support of many high-profile Victorians,
and about 650 people had already paid about US$3,200 each for the 450
apartments in the 560-meter-high tower.</P>
      <P>The Grollo family was advised by its bankers not to pay the money
without receiving a freehold title to the Batman's Hill site.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the authority would not transfer the freehold
title, instead offering to a lease-hold title and a staged release of
the freehold upon construction. This offer was unacceptable to
Grollo's lenders -- mainly banks.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Squashing bugs is getting harder, as
many are developing resistance to antibiotics as a result of doctors
prescribing them too freely, often in response to demands from
patients, according to The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>Researchers have found that a common bug that causes respiratory
tract infections has evolved into a killer in Singapore after
developing resistance to a variety of drugs over the last decade.</P>
      <P>The number of cases of drug-resistant "streptococcus pneumoniae"
has shot up from 2 percent in 1991 to 43 percent in 1997, according
to the most recent study on the subject.</P>
      <P>The killer bug detected by researchers is a common bacteria that
causes respiratory tract infections, sinus problems and ear
infections.</P>
      <P>"It used to be very sensitive to penicillin, but over the years,
we have been seeing resistance to it," said Dr. Ling Moi Lin, a
microbiologist at Singapore General Hospital. "It is also showing
resistance to alternative drugs," she added.</P>
      <P>In some cases, especially those involving the elderly and very
young, the now drug-resistant bug can kill, she said.</P>
      <P>About half of all patients over 60 die when the bacteria is found
in normally sterile places, like the blood and brain, while in
children less than a year old, four in 10 who have the bug die from
it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will play a leading role in
activities next week aimed at preparing the economies of the
Asia-Pacific region for the so-called Millennium Bug (Y2K), Deputy
Prime Minister Tim Fischer said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Pacific Economic Cooperation Council meeting in
Canberra, Fischer said the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
(APEC) had nominated the week beginning April 19 as "Y2K Week." He
said 21 APEC members would conduct a range of activities to
accelerate their readiness to deal with the Y2K problem.</P>
      <P>"Y2K has the potential to cause widespread economic and social
disruption if we don't prepare ourselves properly. This is especially
true in APEC because of its strong regional economic linkages," he
said.</P>
      <P>"In our own case, almost 70 percent of Australia's trade by value
is with the other APEC economies and their level of preparedness for
Y2K, therefore, is of great consequence to us. No economy can isolate
itself from the problems which another economy might experience.
Sales, payments and the provision of services could all be affected,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He said special activities within Australia during Y2K Week would
include a meeting of the Year 2000 National Steering Committee of
federal and state governments and industry representatives, and a
seminar for public service managers on current and emerging legal
issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DELEGATES FROM MORE THAN 20 NATIONS TAKE PART IN PECC MEETINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 14 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council
(PECC) on Wednesday started three days of coordination group and
steering committee meetings with delegates from Taiwan, mainland
China, Hong Kong and 20 other member countries attending in Canberra.</P>
      <P>During the opening ceremony, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim
Fischer praised the contribution of PECC to the Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's work in areas such as competition
policy, trade services and the identification of impediments to trade
and investment in the region.</P>
      <P>He said that APEC needs to keep pressing on with its core
activities of trade liberalization, trade facilitation and economic
and technical cooperation and that PECC has a role to play in all
three areas.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation, which includes Professor Wu Rong-i, head of
the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, is led by Jeffrey Koo, chair
of the Chinese Taipei Committee of the PECC.</P>
      <P>Other participating delegates come from such countries as Brunei
Darussalam, Canada, Chile, mainland China, Colombia, France, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, the United States
and Vietnam. Australian officials are taking part also.</P>
      <P>Fischer emphasized the importance of information technology in
the transformation of international trade as the 21st century draws
near.</P>
      <P>"If there is one area where APEC must ensure that it remains
ahead of the game, it is the subject of today's meeting -- the
information economy," he said.</P>
      <P>"The globalizing forces of information technology are
transforming international trade. But managing these changes and
fully exploiting the opportunities which new technologies offer
requires concerted action," he said.</P>
      <P>He cited the widespread and rapid increase in the use of the
Internet as an example of the information economy, which affects not
only the 23 member countries of PECC and 21 economies of APEC but
also other many countries in the world as well.</P>
      <P>"In 1995, there were a mere 2 million users, today that figure is
300 million," he said.</P>
      <P>Fischer said APEC remains "the cornerstone of our regional trade
policy. Notwithstanding the Asian economic crisis, 50 percent of our
exports still go to East Asia."</P>
      <P>"In times of economic difficulty, APEC's role in promoting trade
becomes all the more important. APEC can build momentum for a new
round of trade negotiations in the World Trade Organization --
negotiations which are crucial for the health of the global economy
as it enters the new millennium," he added.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, PECC Chairman Robert Romulo from the
Philippines said the meetings in Canberra would address a number of
issues, including trade, economic cooperation and financial systems.</P>
      <P>But he said all global commercial activities will undergo a
dramatic change as a result of the wider and rapid use of information
technology, including the Internet.</P>
      <P>"The technological leaps we have made in the past 20 years have
provided us with economic opportunities that were unheard of just a
generation before. The Internet in particular provides us with the
potential to finally break down the barriers of time and space on
economic transaction," he said.</P>
      <P>"It is a simple and powerful vision of the future of business.
Producers and retailers -- regardless of their size -- gain access to
the global market fairly easily, labor cost savings are considerable,
inventory is more easily managed, and the potential for profit
guarantees that market competition will be intense," he said.</P>
      <P>Both Fischer and Romulo stressed the need to regulate the use of
information technology, particularly the Internet, so that the risk
of fraud and other irregularities in global commercial activities can
be reduced.</P>
      <P>Between April 14 and 16, all participants will take part in a
wide range of discussions on trade policy, food and agriculture,
transportation, tourism, telecommunications, information technology,
small and medium enterprises, human resources development and
financial and capital markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-PROFILE FOREIGN FUND MANAGERS VISIT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting high-profile retirement fund
management sector delegation arrived in Taiwan from the United States
on Wednesday for the second leg of an Asian trip aimed at studying
and inspecting the investment environment and Asia's economic trend.</P>
      <P>The 100-member delegation was led by Philip A. Schaefer, chairman
of Pensions 2000 Corp., an investment consultant company that is to
hold a large-scale conference, dubbed "Forward to Asia," in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Schaefer said upon his arrival that the delegation's visit to the
island was motivated by Taiwan's democratization and political
stability, while foreign investment here receives tax privileges.</P>
      <P>Among the delegates are executives and fund managers of several
US government-run and private pension fund trusts, all of which are
listed in the top 100 US pension fund trusts, and all of which manage
a total of more than US$1 trillion-worth of funds.</P>
      <P>The experts, some of whom specialize in high-tech investment and
some of whom are expert in foreign currency trading, will take part
in the two-day conference to gain in-depth knowledge of Taiwan's
economic and financial fundamentals and performance.</P>
      <P>The conference will open in Taipei on Thursday, when President
Lee Teng-hui will give an address on the country's financial and
economic development. Premier Vincent Siew and other high-ranking
economic and financial officials, as well as business tycoons, will
also attend.</P>
      <P>Asked about the conference, Finance Minister Paul Chu said that
it is expected to help Taiwan's globalization in both the economic
and financial fields.</P>
      <P>Unlike individual investors, Chu noted, most of the delegates are
institutional investors dealing with pension funds, who are most
concerned about the economic, financial, and stock-trading
fundamentals of a country, key considerations for long-term
investors.</P>
      <P>These long-term foreign investments, especially those launched by
pension fund trusts, are the key power in the maintenance of stock
market stability, stressed Perng Fai-nan, governor the Central Bank
of China (CBC), at a legislative meeting on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Perng said, the CBC hopes to introduce foreign funds
for long-term investment, which is always the central bank's
consistent policy, he added.</P>
      <P>The conference has already taken place in Seoul, and will be held
in Hong Kong following the Taipei meeting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Organizers of the 1999 Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC) will invite former leaders from Taiwan,
mainland China and other countries to attend a conference in Manila
this October, said the council's chairman.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA at the opening of a meeting of PECC's
coordinating group and standing committee in Canberra, Roberto
Romulo, who was formerly foreign secretary of the Philippines, said
PECC would broaden its scope not only by inviting former leaders of
both sides of the Taiwan Strait to attend an upcoming meeting but
also by inviting some 200 European scholars, business leaders and
former government leaders to take part.</P>
      <P>Present and former government leaders from outside Europe will be
invited as well.</P>
      <P>Aside from President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines and
President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, others on the invitation list
are former Philippine President Fidel Ramos, former Australian Prime
Minister Bob Hawke, former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
and former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun of Thailand.</P>
      <P>Invitations to former leaders of Taiwan and mainland China will
be discussed with Jeffrey Koo, the leader of Taiwan's delegation, and
Koo's mainland Chinese counterpart at PECC's present meeting in
Canberra, Romulo said.</P>
      <P>In addition, about 200 European business leaders, former
government officials and scholars will also be invited to attend the
Manila meeting in October so that PECC can broaden its scope.</P>
      <P>"The purpose of inviting Europeans is to exchange views, because
there is no longer an Asian financial crisis. But it's a global
crisis. Certainly in this area, we have to talk with them in order to
find a global solution to the global problem," he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, PECC members this year will have their first ever
meeting with the secretary-general of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations to discuss how "we can pursue issues of mutually
complementary," Romulo said.</P>
      <P>Since its inception in 1980, PECC has been a unique partnership
of senior individuals from business, government and academic spheres,
who work in a non-official capacity on practical policy issues to
increase trade, investment and economic development in the
Asia-Pacific region, he said.</P>
      <P>Despite issuing invitations to European leaders to attend the
upcoming meeting in Manila, Romulo said PECC would not increase its

    <TEXT>
      <P>The launch of a common Asian currency is a
good idea worthy of further study, Central Bank of China (CBC)
Governor Perng Fai-nan said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Perng's remark was made in response to a lawmaker's question at
the Legislative Yuan, which was holding its third plenary session of
the Financial Committee.</P>
      <P>In view of the success of the euro, the single currency launched
by the European Union, the promotion of a common currency in Asia
should have a bright prospect, said Chen Sheng-hung of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) during the interpellation.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his hope that the CBC will take action to promote
the idea.</P>
      <P>The CBC governor said that the launch of an "Asian dollar" would
be better promoted by a giant economy, so that the move would be more
forceful and effective.</P>
      <P>There are three prerequisites for the promotion of a single Asian
currency, Perng said. They are: Participating members should all be
democratic free nations; all members should adopt a market-oriented
economic system; and all members should have a low financial deficit
and low inflation.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the CBC will do its best to promote the idea,
and propose it in international venues, in the hope that a common
understanding can be established among the economies of Asia.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should devise a proper way to
handle its industrial waste given the island's dense population, a
Control Yuan member said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ma Yi-kung, who is also an active environmental protection
advocate, made the call after concluding a weeklong fact-finding
visit to the city of Westmoreland in southern California, where
Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) had planned to dispose of some
2,700 tons of mercury-tainted waste.</P>
      <P>The industrial waste, originally buried at a landfill in
Cambodia, was shipped out by FPG late last month after local
residents discovered the substance was toxic.</P>
      <P>FPG, Taiwan's largest petrochemical firm, later applied to
transport the waste to Westmoreland, but strong public opposition
forced the US Environmental Protection Agency to revoke FPG's
disposal permit.</P>
      <P>The mercury-tainted waste is currently being stored at Taiwan's
southern Kaohsiung Port.</P>
      <P>Ma blasted FPG for inadequate handling of the waste, pointing out
that even though Westmoreland is a desolate desert area usually used
by the US Navy for bombing exercises, it was still unwilling to take
the substance.</P>
      <P>Ma, who brought back a pile of documents from the United States,
said the US Environmental Protection Agency decided to revoke its
permit for FPG's application citing concern that the toxic waste may
pollute nearby environments while being transported to Westmoreland
from either a port of entry on the East or West coast.</P>
      <P>FPG's mercury-contaminated waste, though already solidified, will
change into a damaging chemical substance when exposed to a windy or
rainy climate, Ma added.</P>
      <P>Ma urged relevant authorities to properly address the issue of
Taiwan's toxic waste, as at least another 22,000 tons of industrial
waste is being poorly handled in southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Perng made the remark at a Legislative Yuan joint committee
meeting of finance and budget in response to legislators' questions
on speculation that the CBC is planning to reduce bank reserve
requirements in order to boost the money supply in the stock market.</P>
      <P>This would help certain Kuomintang-owned companies to recoup some
of their stock market losses of last year. These companies reportedly
lost a total of as much as NT$10 billion.</P>
      <P>Perng categorically denied the rumor, saying that the CBC will
only consider cutting the bank reserve ratios when foreign exchange
rates and prices are stable but banks' money supply is insufficent.
He assured the legislators that no rushed or partial decision on the
matter will be made.</P>
      <P>Compared to the global trend of adjusting bank reserve ratios
downward, Taiwan's weighted average bank reserve ratios of 6.41
percent put Taiwan at the top of the global list in this regard.
Luckily, Taiwan's substantial bank reserve ratios of 4.48 percent
mean the island's banks can remain competitive, said Perng.</P>
      <P>Concerning legislator's charges that the CBC made use of the
reduction of bank reserve ratios to profit banks, especially those
whose fundamentals are weak, at the expense of bank customers, Perng
denied the accusation, stressing that the CBC acts in the best
interests of the nation, and that the only reason to adjust the
ratios would be to strengthen the competitiveness of the country's
banks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER MEETS WITH SALVADORAN VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew met
on Wednesday with Vice President-elect Lic Carlos Quintanilla
Schmidt, and told him that hard work and a well-formed system are the
foundations of the ROC's successful development.</P>
      <P>Schmidt, who is visiting Taiwan at the behest of Salvadoran
President-elect Francisco Flores, said the main purpose of his trip
is to learn from the ROC's successful development and to expand and
enhance cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Siew responded that Taiwan would be glad to share its experience
with its Central American ally and is keen to promote further ties
and cooperative plans.</P>
      <P>Taiwan went through a period of poverty and great hardship after
its retrocession to the ROC government from Japanese rule in 1945,
but the government's land reforms and a series of four-year
development plans revitalized the economy, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic development has been hailed all over the world
as the "Taiwan experience," Siew went on, adding that Taiwan has also
managed to maintain its agricultural development as it has
transformed into an industrial power.</P>
      <P>Small and medium-sized enterprises have been the backbone of the
ROC's economic development, and have played a pivotal role in its
economic growth, the premier pointed out.</P>
      <P>Siew also praised the success of Schmidt's Nationalist Republican
Alliance in the Salvadoran presidential elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY IS TAIWAN'S BEST SHIELD AGAINST BEIJING THREAT: JANE'S</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democracy is Taiwan's best shield against
the threat from mainalnd China, the authoritative Jane's Defense
Review monthly said in its April issue.</P>
      <P>A fast-looming issue now is Taiwan's presidential election in
March 2000, which could have a significant impact on security issues
across the Taiwan Strait, said the article written by Mark Daly, the
magazine's editor-in-chief.</P>
      <P>"One danger is that sheer political and economic frustration in
Taiwan could be reflected in next year's election results," he
continued.</P>
      <P>Mainland China and Taiwan have co-existed for almost 50 years, in
part because of the latter's very careful handling of the
independence issue, and because of the US role in providing arms and
defensive support to Taiwan, Daly said.</P>
      <P>At stake is the deeply sensitive issue of independence from
mainland China, an issue which Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has
skillfully finessed.</P>
      <P>The declared KMT policy is peaceful reunification with the
mainland -- a political objective so distant as to be invisible --
which nevertheless has provided the basis for mostly peaceful
co-existence. That delicate status quo has been under particular
pressure over the last decade, he continued.</P>
      <P>The missile crisis of 1996 caused Taiwan a US$23 billion flight
of capital, which has left a deep wound. Yet Taiwan switched from a
one-party state to democracy without any economic or political
breakdown, the article said.</P>
      <P>There are signs that the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) may be softening its independence line, and that its
"trigger-happy" image is unfounded.</P>
      <P>"I feel that judging from what opposition leaders have been
saying, they are becoming more sensible, a little more rational. I
don't see a great danger of Taiwan doing something unilateral towards
China," the article quoted Dr. Hung-mao Tien, president of the
Institute for Policy Research, an independent think-tank, as saying.</P>
      <P>A US Department of Defense report tabled to Congress last
February as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Appropriation Bill, says:
"By 2005 Taipei will posses a qualitative edge over Beijing in terms
of significant weapons and equipment," citing the ROC air force's
300-plus fourth-generation fighters as an example.</P>
      <P>For the most part Taiwan is satisfied with its air defenses, but
the Patriot PAC-2S offers only limited tactical missile defense,
which leads back to the thorny Theater Missile Defense (TMD) debate,
the article continued.</P>
      <P>While there is a growing feeling in Taiwan that the invasion
threat is increasingly unlikely, mainland China's ambitions to build
a blue-water navy could pose a strategic threat to Taiwan, it noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's greatest naval weakness lies in its inability to acquire
submarines. The state-owned Chung-Shan Institute of Science and
Technology has benefited to some extent from technology transfers
from the United States, but its independent capabilities are
considerable, it continued.</P>
      <P>Beijing has said in recent years that "Chinese should not kill
Chinese." Some in Taiwan say that is mere propaganda -- China was
blighted by wars and rebellions for half of this century -- but there
are strong reasons on both sides for making sure that this does not
recur, the article said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DESERTED BABIES REEL IN SPRING CHILL (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Spring is often described as the season of
romance, a time to foster love and life. But with local society
becoming increasingly open regarding sex, spring has also become a
peak season for deserted babies.</P>
      <P>No exact figures on Taiwan's deserted newborns or toddlers are
currently available, but behind each abandoned child lies a story of
misfortune and social plight.</P>
      <P>The issue of deserted babies has long existed in Taiwan. In the
past, abandoned children were seen as products of a poor, backward
society. Ironically, even though Taiwan has by now evolved from an
agricultural backwater to an affluent economic powerhouse, the issue
remains alive and has even got worse.</P>
      <P>A few days ago, Liao Hui-ying, a social worker at the private
Chungyi children's home, took charge of a newborn who had been
discarded in the arcade of a skyscraper in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hugging the tiny baby, Liao said that all the children in the
Chungyi residence need a hug, as well as other people's care and
concern.</P>
      <P>"I always feel joyful every time I take an abandoned child back
to Chungyi. All the children here were nameless, unwelcome lives when
they were born. They would not have an identity or a temporary home
if they were not sent here," Liao said.</P>
      <P>A score of young children crawl on the wooden floor. Those who
bear a middle name of "Yu" were abandoned at birth. In a corner of
the room stands a small bed in which several babies are sleeping
serenely. Their angelic faces make people forget the misfortune which
led to their presence here.</P>
      <P>The Chungyi children's home specializes in providing shelter for
deserted babies, runaways and abused children. It was set up by Liu
Teh-chen, a great-granddaughter of Liu Ming-chuan, the first governor
of Taiwan during the imperial Ching dynasty.</P>
      <P>Initially, Liu used her family assets to support the children's
home. But in recent years, the Chungyi residence has relied mainly on
private donations to maintain its operations.</P>
      <P>Raising abandoned babies is usually costlier than rearing older
children because baby formula and diapers are so expensive. However,
present Chungyi President Kao Ming-chu stressed that no matter how
severe its financial straits, the organization has consistently given
top priority to the care of deserted babies.</P>
      <P>Without a comprehensive checking and reporting system, it is
difficult to calculate the number of babies which are abandoned in
Taiwan. According to unofficial tallies by another local children's
welfare group -- the Child Welfare Legal Foundation (CWLF) -- a total
of 313 abandoned babies were discovered in 1992 alone. The number
declined to 75 last year.</P>
      <P>Although the figures show a downward trend, welfare organizations
are skeptical of the statistics. A CWLF executive pointed out that as
many cases go unreported, and because some of the babies are
illegally adopted, it is no easy task to compile an exact figure of
the island's abandoned infants.</P>
      <P>A CWLF analysis of 57 deserted babies discovered in six cities
and counties around the island last year indicated that 37 percent of
them were dumped in the spring and 27 percent in the winter.</P>
      <P>In terms of age, more than half of the babies were discarded less
than one month after birth, and nearly 80 percent of them were aged
under six months.</P>
      <P>Yang Tsuai-chin, a member of the Taipei Women's Police Corps,
said several of the abandoned infants she handled in recent months
still had their umbilical cords attached when they were found.</P>
      <P>Yang said abandoned babies are most commonly discovered at
hospitals, parks, on sidewalks and overpasses. Other likely places
include restaurants, lavatories, school campuses, staircases, phone
booths, and even garbage dumps.</P>
      <P>Some of these helpless children are taken directly to police
stations, while many others are left by their mothers in hospitals.
In most cases, the mothers use aliases and other false data when
checking into the hospital, making it heard to trace them when they
flee after giving birth.

    <HEADLINE>DESERTED BABIES (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to government regulations concerning the handling of
deserted babies, such kids cannot be transferred privately. Any
members of the general public who discover an abandoned baby must
hand the child over to the police, who must inform the bureau of
social affairs of the local government.</P>
      <P>The deserted baby will then be sent to a hospital for a physical
checkup. "Due to a lack of proper care or medical treatment, many
abandoned children are usually very weak when they are found," Yang
said, adding that while some babies may look healthy, they are often
later found to have been infected.</P>
      <P>Following the physical checkup and any necessary medical
treatment, the child is sent temporarily to either a public or a
private children's welfare institute. In the following six-month
period, police and other relevant public agencies attempt to find the
parents.</P>
      <P>If no one comes forward to claim the child during the grace
period, the welfare organization must file an application with the
district court to become the child's legal guardians. The
organizations can also look for a suitable individual or family to
adopt the child.</P>
      <P>In the past, people have tended to think that handicapped
children are most likely to be discarded. However, a CWLF study of
455 abandoned infants showed that nearly 85 percent of them were
normal and healthy.</P>
      <P>Kao said several other social factors also need to be considered.</P>
      <P>"Many children living in Chungyi are very curious about their
origins," Kao said. "They hope to know who their parents are. Some of
them have told me that if the opportunity presents itself, they would
ask what kinds of difficulties or hardships prompted their parents to
abandon them."</P>
      <P>Noting that every child is entitled to know his or her origin and
past, Kao said she believes that people who are aware of their own
family background will have greater confidence in their own lives.</P>
      <P>"However, as it is usually very difficult to find out their birth
parents, their origins have often become forever riddles," Kao said.</P>
      <P>Lee Chao-jung, chief of the CWLF's research and development
division, said complicated social problems are to blame for the
deserted baby issue.</P>
      <P>"The CWLF once discovered a criminal ring which either stole
infants or abducted young children and then sold them as abandoned
children," Lee said, adding that the institute also had found that
some people disguised themselves as philanthropists to take charge of
deserted children, but later sent the children to work in factories
and pocketed the wages earned by the helpless child laborers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said, the number of newborns discarded by legal
and illegal foreign workers here has also been increasing steadily,
adding to the pressure on local children's welfare organizations
which lack the funds and trained manpower to take care of the rapidly
increasing number of deserted babies.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that the problem of deserted babies has also
highlighted the adverse impact of the increasingly lax attitude
toward sex among local teens.</P>
      <P>"As a result of dramatic changes in social values, local
adolescents now pursue passion rather than true love, and pre-marital
sex has become all too common among them, leading to increases in the
number of unmarried mothers and deserted babies," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-teh, a CWLF social worker in charge of adoption affairs,
said that about 50 percent of adopted children handled by the CWLF
were born to unmarried mothers. Other factors that prompt parents to
have their children legally adopted by other families include
marriage breakups and family financial problems.</P>
      <P>"The reasons behind a parental decision to have children adopted
by other families may also shed light on the plight facing those who
discard their newborns or young children," Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the first few years following his joining the CWLF team, Lin
said he thought people who discard their children are cold-blooded
monsters.</P>
      <P>"But after years of work, I can now look at the issue from a more
compassionate and sympathetic perspective," Lin said, adding that the
birth parents of many abandoned or adopted children are plagued by
hardships unimaginable to others.</P>
      <P>Lin further said that the high percentage of deserted babies born
to unmarried mothers implies another increasingly serious social
problem that deserves concern -- the plight of unmarried teenage
mothers. (This story is credited to the China Times reporter Ms. Lin

(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A cocktail reception was held on
Capitol Hill on Tuesday to mark the 20th anniversary of the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA), the US law enacted on April 10, 1979 to
regulate exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Many US lawmakers from both the Senate and the House of
Representatives, including Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), president
pro tempore (temporary president) of the Senate, attended the
reception at the Mansfield Room.</P>
      <P>During the reception, Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), chairman of
the House International Relations Committee, and Sen. Frank H.
Murkowski (R-Alaska), presented three meaningful souvenirs to Stephen
Chen, ROC representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>The souvenirs were framed Senate and House resolutions
reaffirming their commitment to upholding the TRA and supporting
Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Senate majority leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) said Taiwan has set a model for democratization and
economic development and that Congress supports sustained close
US-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>Rep. Gilman said the TRA has played an important role in
preserving and promoting ROC-US relations over the past two decades
and is also crucial to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Gilman went on to say that US Congress hopes the TRA will
continue contributing to peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Strait
issue.</P>
      <P>It is regretful that mainland China still refuses to renounce
the use of force against Taiwan, Gilman said, adding that the United
States is delighted to see Taiwan evolve into a mature democracy and
hopes Taiwan will continue serving as a model for mainland China and
other East Asian countries to promote the development of democracy,
human rights and rule of law.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative Chen said Taiwan is a faithful US ally in
the pursuit of their common ideals of democracy and market economy.
This partnership will be further expanded in economic, political,
cultural and security fields in the years ahead, the de facto ROC
ambassador added.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard Bush said
the TRA has provided a legal framework for US-Taiwan relations over
the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The TRA has also underscored the US determination to safeguard
peace in the Taiwan Strait and security of the people of Taiwan,
Bush said.</P>
      <P>The top US liaison officer with Taiwan further said that the TRA
reflects the US executive branch and Congress' commitment to Taiwan
people's well-being.</P>
      <P>The TRA, coupled with Taiwan's vitality, ingenuity and
strong confidence in its future, has enabled Taiwan to become a
prosperous democracy and a good member of the international
community, Bush added.</P>
      <P>American lawmakers present at the reception also included
William V. Roth, Jr. (R-Del.), chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee; Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee; and Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-Neb.), chairman of the House
Asia and Pacific Subcommittee.</P>
      <P>Lester L. Wolff, a retired congressman who played a key role in
the TRA's legislation, former AIT Taipei Office Director James
Lilley, and scores of congressional staff members also attended the

      <P>Many of them will take part in a seminar on the TRA to be held

      <P>A mission consisting of 12 Taiwan major
semi-conductor producers will hold seminars in Tokyo and Osaka in the
coming days to seek cooperation with their Japanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>An official with the Taipei-based China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) said that the seminars are designed to
provide opportunities for Taiwan and Japanese manufacturers to
cooperate in production and sale strategies.</P>
      <P>Last year, a similar seminar held in Tokyo, attracted some 350
representatives from 200 Japanese semi-conductor makers.</P>
      <P>This year, the Tokyo seminar will be held at the Tokyo
International Convention Center on April 15-16, and in Osaka on April
19-20.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Min-chiu, leader of the Taiwan mission, Taiwan's
IC production last year totaled US$9.7 billion, down 3.5 percent from
the preceding year. He estimated this year's output will reach
US$11.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Wu said that cooperation with Taiwan manufacturers would offer
Japanese IC manufacturers several advantages including geographical
convenience, high productivity, high competitiveness, and an 
internationally-recognized quality.</P>
      <P>The 12 Taiwan companies participating in the seminars account for
45 percent of Taiwan's total IC production.</P>
      <P>The semi-official CETRA set up an International Sourcing Center
(ISC) in 1997 to help foreign manufacturers cooperate with Taiwan
makers. So far, more than 200 foreign companies have entered
into projects with Taiwan producers through ISC arrangements.</P>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's navy will soon resume the
construction of its eighth Perry-class frigate, said the China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC), the shipyard commissioned to build the
missile-guided frigate.</P>
      <P>The navy began the "Kuang Hua No. 1 Project" in 1989, contracting
the state-run CSBC to build eight frigates modeled on the US
Perry-class frigate. So far the navy has taken delivery of seven such
frigates.</P>
      <P>Construction of the eighth frigate, which was originally
scheduled to be completed in October of this year, was suspended
to an insufficient budget.</P>
      <P>The CSBC said that it recently reached an agreement with the Navy
on the issue and the construction of the eighth and last Perry-class
frigate will begin in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>With a displacement of 4,200 tons, each Perry-class frigate is
equipped with advanced radar, artillery, torpedoes,
surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles as well as
anti-submarine helicopters. Each frigate costs NT$7 billion (US$2.12
billion).</P>
      <P>The military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology
will handle the installation and integration of all weaponry systems

    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton said on
Wednesday that the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) is instrumental in
strengthening relations between the Republic of China and the United
States as well as in preserving peace and stability in Asia.</P>
      <P>Clinton made the statement in a written congratulatory message
to a conference marking the 20th anniversary of the TRA, the US law
governing relations with Taiwan in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Clinton's message was read by Christopher C. DeMuth,
president of the American Enterprise Institute, which co-sponsored
the forum with the Heritage Foundation.</P>
      <P>Clinton said in his message that America's continued success and
stability depend in part on its ability to foster intercultural
dialogue and understanding and forge productive international
relationships.</P>
      <P>Based on this spirit of cooperation and community, Clinton said,
the United States and Taiwan continue to enjoy strong bonds of
friendship that have promoted the two countries' well-being,
broadened their people's cultural horizons, and offered promising
opportunities for economic growth.</P>
      <P>Clinton went on to say that the TRA has been instrumental in
strengthening those bridges of friendship and in preserving peace
and stability in Asia.</P>
      <P>"As we celebrate this landmark legislation, I applaud your
long-standing dedication to strengthening Taiwan-American
cooperation and to exploring our common goals for the future,"
Clinton said, adding that the trust and fellowship fostered through
concerted efforts of both sides offer a vital opportunity for
realizing a future of continued prosperity and lasting peace.</P>
      <P>The full text of Clinton's message reads:</P>
      <P>"Warm greetings to all those gathered in our nation's capital to
mark the 20th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"In this era of sweeping global change, it is more important

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY HARDWARE NOT SOLUTION TO CROSS-STRAIT DIFFERENCES: SHIRK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 15 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for East Asia Susan Shirk on Wednesday urged both sides of the Taiwan
Strait not to over-emphasize a military build-up, but should foster
dialogue to solve their differences.</P>
      <P>Although the United States is considering providing a missile
defense to Taiwan based on standards of other defensive weapon sales,
the Clinton administration calls for both sides of the Taiwan Strait
to address differences through dialogue, Shirk said during a luncheon
here marking the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>"Neither the People's Republic of China nor Taiwan would be
served by an over emphasis on military hardware while neglecting the
art of statesmanship," she noted.</P>
      <P>"From the PRC's perspective, it should think twice about whether
developing or upgrading any one type of weapon system will contribute
to the PRC's security, or conversely, whether it might actually
detract from that security by fostering tension, anxiety, political
instability or an arms build up in the region," she said.</P>
      <P>"At the heart of this calculation is the reality that the PRC
cannot expect to pursue its defense policy in a vacuum. Its decisions
on military modernization will generate responses from other actors,"
she said.</P>
      <P>"Or, as Secretary Albright said recently in Beijing: Nothing
would better serve China's interest than using its developing
dialogue with Taiwan to build mutual confidence and reduce the
perceived need for missiles or a missile defense," Shirk added.</P>
      <P>From Taiwan's perspective, she said, the TRA's continuing
guarantee that Taiwan will not lack a defensive capability enhances
Taiwan's confidence and counterbalances anxieties over the PRC's 
military capability.</P>
      <P>"There has been a lot of attention focused on a potential US
theater missile defense for Taiwan. This is premature," she noted.</P>
      <P>"A high-altitude TMD is still in development and is therefore not
going to be provided to anyone in the immediate future," she added.</P>
      <P>"Down the road, as with our consideration of sales of other
defensive capabilities, our decisions on the provision of any sort of
missile defense will be based on an assessment of Taiwan's legitimate
defense needs."</P>
      <P>"As we consider these needs, we will certainly take into account
the security situation in the Strait, including PRC deployments, the
pace and scope of dialogue between the PRC and Taiwan, and the
overall regional security picture," she said.</P>
      <P>"In this age of highly sophisticated weaponry, I think we are all
sometimes prone to equate security with military capability," she
said, adding that a durable peace will rest less on arms than success
in addressing differences through dialogue on a mutually acceptable
basis.</P>
      <P>"Thus, whereas missiles and missile defense systems ultimately
cannot in themselves secure peace and prosperity, dialogue and
creative compromise can do so," she added.</P>
      <P>She emphasized one aspect of the Clinton administration's policy
that is firm and unchanging, saying that the administration continues
to insist that cross-strait differences be resolved peacefully, as
demonstrated in March 1996, when President Clinton ordered US
carriers to the waters near Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Our belief is that dialogue between the PRC and Taiwan fosters
an atmosphere in which tensions are reduced, misperceptions can be
clarified, and common ground can be explored," Shirk said.</P>
      <P>The exchange of visits under the SEF/ARATS framework, currently
rich in symbolism but nascent in substance, has the potential to
contribute to a peaceful resolution of difficult substantive
differences, she continued.</P>
      <P>She said the US administration has great confidence in the
creativity of the people on Taiwan and the people on the mainland to
give the dialogue real meanings.</P>
      <P>"Imaginative thinking within this dialogue might result in new
understandings or confidence building measures on any number of
difficult topics. But only the participants on both sides of the
strait can craft the specific solutions that balance their interests
while addressing their most pressing concerns," she said.</P>
      <P>Shirk's speech during the luncheon was also her testimony on the
"TRA at 20" before the House International Relations Committee,
Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, in the afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MUST INCREASE MILITARY COOPERATION WITH TAIPEI: HELMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  14 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States must take steps to
increase its military cooperation with Taipei and provide the country
with a means of self-defense, Jesse Helms, chairman of Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The United States also must make clear to Beijing in no uncertain
terms that the United States considers peace in the Taiwan Strait,
and the preservation of Taiwan's democratic, free market system to be
a vital national security interest of the United States, Helms said.</P>
      <P>Helms made the remarks at the "Conference on the 20th Anniversary
of the Taiwan Relations Act" co-sponsored by the Heritage Foundation
and the American Enterprise Institute.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) declares that "the President and
the Congress shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense
articles and services based solely upon their judgment of the needs
of Taiwan," Helms said, adding that, in other words, Beijing's point
of view does not count.</P>
      <P>In 1982, President Ronald Reagan signed the "August Communique"
with Beijing in which he agreed to limit and gradually reduce US arms
sales to Taiwan. Ever since the communique, Beijing has been
browbeating the United States to cut arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Today, sensing the Clinton administration's boundless desire to
appease them, the Chinese communists are ramping up the pressure as
never before, Helms said.</P>
      <P>Just last summer, President Bill Clinton caved in to Beijing's
"three noes" demand. Helms said he is fearful that US arms sales to
Taiwan be sacrificed next.</P>
      <P>"I have introduced the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act to ensure
people in Taiwan will have the equipment to maintain self-defense
capabilities, by prohibiting any and all politically motivated
reductions in arms sales to Taiwan pursuant to 1982 communique, and
by authorizing the sale of a broad array of defense weaponry to
Taiwan," Helms said.</P>
      <P>Helms (Rep. NC) said the TRA calls for the United States to
maintain a capacity to resist any resort to force or coercion that
jeopardizes Taiwan. But this is difficult if the United States does
not train, plan or communicate with Taiwan's military, he said.</P>
      <P>The Senate heavyweight said the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
will change this by increasing Taiwan participation at US defense
colleges, enhancing military exchanges, establishing direct
communication between the two nation's militaries and authorizing the
US executive branch to approve the sale of defense weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 77-year-old senator said, "For years we have been told by Red
China's apologists that our insistence on democracy and human rights
in China is a form of cultural imperialism. 'Asian values,' we are
told, are different from 'Western values.' Chinese people, we are
lectured, don't care about democracy and freedom -- 'Asian values'
place order above freedom."</P>
      <P>He said, however, the Republic of China on Taiwan has laid waste
to that "Asian values" nonsense in the process of transferring from a
society under martial law to a vibrant, multi-party democracy, with a
spirited opposition, a free press and a flourishing civil society.</P>
      <P>Helms presented the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act on March 24.
The act has not yet been given a screening agenda. It is believed
that a final edition of the act will have to be significantly amended
because many articles in Helms' version violate the current US
position on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD INCLUDE TAIWAN IN TMD: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 14 (CNA): The United States should provide
Taiwan with theater missile defense systems or equipment to maintain
a capacity to defend against a military threat from mainland China,
according to US China experts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Kurt Campbell
told a conference on the 20th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) that the United States is encouraged by cross-Strait dialogue
and that it is in the US national interest to maintain peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration is committed to providing Taiwan with
necessary defensive arms in accordance with the TRA, said Campbell,
adding that although it is not known how much patience Beijing has to
seek a peaceful resolution, time is on Taiwan's side.</P>
      <P>Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies, at Johns Hopkins University, noted that Taiwan
is the most important human rights issue in US-China relations and,
therefore, it's important to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons,
including a theater missile defense, in the face of a growing missile
threat from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wolfowitz said Taiwan is not an obstacle to better US-China
relations, it is an opportunity for the United States to preserve
human rights for the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Richard Fisher, director of the Asian Studies Center at the
Heritage Foundation, agreed that the US should continue to sell
Taiwan defensive arms in order to prevent war in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan requires defensive weapons because the People's Liberation
Army is modernizing its military and missile forces, attempting to
exercise political pressures on Taiwan and force the island to accept
its terms for peaceful reunification, said the policy analyst.</P>
      <P>Fisher added that the US should provide Taiwan with submarines,
which are defensive in character, and other technical superiority to
maintain a cross-strait balance of air power, as well as a theater
missile defense system to defend against Chinese missiles.</P>
      <P>While expanding military exchange programs with mainland China,
the United States should also try to balance the situation by
changing its currently very restrictive military exchanges with
Taiwan, added Fisher.</P>
      <P>US Navy Adm. Eric McVadon said the United States should redouble
its effort to persuade Beijing that use of missiles against Taiwan
will harm China the most.</P>
      <P>McVadon also suggested that leaders on both sides exchange visits
for better mutual understanding, and that Beijing set a realistic
timetable for mainland reforms, instead of a timetable for
reunification, because the whole world is hoping to see a change
towards democratization.

      <P>Canberra, April 15 (CNA): Australia has expressed its concern
over the six-year imprisonment sentence given to Malaysia's former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said: "I
understand that Anwar Ibrahim's defense team will lodge an appeal in
the next few days against the verdict and will also seek Anwar's
release on bail pending an appeal."</P>
      <P>"I understand that the appeal is likely to reflect criticism
already made by Anwar Ibrahim's defense team -- namely concerning the
conduct of the trial and concerns about possible judicial bias in
favor of the prosecution," he said.</P>
      <P>But Downer declined to make further comments, fearing that it
could anger the Malaysian government under Prime Minister Mahathir,
who severed ties with former Prime Minister Paul Keating after
Keating called Mahathir "recalcitrant" for refusing to attend the
APEC leaders' meeting in Seattle in 1993.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard and Downer have since held talks with
Mahathir and recovered considerable ties with that country.</P>
      <P>"The Australian government made clear its hope and expectation
that the trial would be conducted in accordance with the principles
of natural justice, due process and the rule of law. We would
hope that these principles applied in the appeals process," Downer
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's Premier Zhu Rongji
arrived in St. John's, Newfoundland, to a cool reception Wednesday,
the first stop of his six-day visit to Canada.</P>
      <P>Conspicuous among those absent from the reception line was the
mayor of the capital city, Andy Wells. To protest China's human
rights record, Wells forwent a tradition of presenting Zhu with the
keys to the city.</P>
      <P>"This Chinese leader should be informed that if you wish to trade
and do business with Canada, we expect you to start substantially
improving your human-rights record," said Wells.</P>
      <P>The mayor stressed, "We are a democratic society. We don't like a
government that oppresses, tortures, murders, incarcerates, locks up
citizens, and commits all sorts of heinous crime against their (own)
people."</P>
      <P>Human-rights groups in St. John's also protested Zhu's visit. But
the Canada-Tibet Committee's plan to fly the Tibetan flag over City
Hall while Zhu visits was abruptly scrapped.</P>
      <P>James Pilgrim, a spokesperson for the committee, said the group
was trying to draw attention to China's worsening human-rights
record. The flag plan was first endorsed by Wells, who later changed
his mind.</P>
      <P>The mayor explained that he was warned by contacts in the
business community that if the flag was not lowered, Zhu would cancel
his trip to Canada.</P>
      <P>Still, Wells said, "It's just one small protest to remind the
Canadian government that not all Canadians support shameless
pandering to China for business contracts."</P>
      <P>Canada's Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said Canada will play a key
role in helping China with its bid for the World Trade Organization
membership. Marchi will meet with Zhu Thursday in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>China was Canada's fourth largest trading partner last year,
according to the Foreign Affairs Department, with two-way trade
reaching almost C$10 billion.</P>
      <P>Canadian activists want their Prime Minister Jean Chretien to
raise human rights matters with the Chinese leader.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week the Canadian chapter of Amnesty International
made a plea. Its executive secretary Roger Clark said, "At a time

around the world, it really behooves the Canadian leadership to make
strong public statements to the visiting premier."</P>

should press Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji for information about the
safety and whereabouts of the nine-year-old Gendhun Choekyi Nyima,
the 11th Panchen Lama of Tibet, also known as the world's youngest

with him again on Friday in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>The Panchen Lama will celebrate his tenth birthday on April 25,
1999 and will begin his fourth year of incommunicado detention on May
17. Although Chinese authorities have admitted holding the boy, no
international observer has been able to see him and there is no
evidence that he is still alive.</P>
      <P>The child was detained with his family in 1995, only days after
the Dalai Lama announced his recognition in a centuries old
tradition.</P>
      <P>"No amount of international pressure seems to be enough for the
Chinese to free this innocent child," said Thubten Samdup, president
of the Canada Tibet Committee.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese believe our government will sacrifice its values in
order to access their market and Tibet's vast mineral resources. It's
time we showed them otherwise by taking a principled position on this
issue," Samdup added.</P>
      <P>An international postcard campaign is underway demanding that
authorities free the Panchen Lama. Tibetan protesters will attempt to
deliver the cards to Zhu when he visits Toronto late Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TYCOONS WELCOME VISIT BY PENSIONS 2000 FUND MANAGERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visit to Taiwan by delegates of Pensions
2000 Corp. of the United States was favorably received Thursday by
business and capital executives in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., described the arrival in Taiwan of the 100-strong
US retirement fund executives and managers as "remarkably
significant."</P>
      <P>Chang, who himself has pursued advanced studies and worked in the
United States for years, said most American fund managers seek to
make only long-term stock market investments, adding that such a
mentality is needed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Their visit here, mainly to inspect the Taiwan stock market and
assess its investment potential, will eventually help enrich the
capital gains of the local bourse, and will help rectify undesirable
practices in the market as well," he said.</P>
      <P>Benny Hu, president of China Development Industrial Bank Inc.,
said Pensions 2000, which includes some of the United States' top-100
government-run and privately run pension fund trusts, has been
financially influential in many countries.</P>
      <P>Hu, who has experience cooperating with such pension fund trusts,
said that once a fund decides to invest in a certain market, it
usually stays in the market for a long time and has a positive impact
on the market's growth.</P>
      <P>Hu is currently attending a two-day Pensions 2000 conference --
dubbed "Access to Asia" -- in Taipei that began Thursday and ends
Friday. He spoke at the event Thursday on relations between Taiwan's
capital market and high-tech development.</P>
      <P>With a high caliber workforce, a healthy capital market, strong
entrepreneurial capabilities, tax privileges and commendable
technological creativity, Taiwan is capable of becoming a gateway to
high-tech investment in Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>Eric Tong-sheng Wu, chairman of Taiwan Security Co. and a deputy
of the National Assembly, said the holding of the Pensions 2000
Conference in Taipei will help improve the image of the Taiwan stock
market among institutional fund operators and managers from abroad.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in the past, the presence of foreign capital in
Taiwan and Hong Kong varied greatly. If Pensions 2000 Corp., which
currently manages about US$1 trillion in funds, were to consider
investing only 1 percent of its funds in the Taiwan stock market, the
local bourse would get a real shot in the arm, he added.</P>
      <P>During their stay in Taiwan, the Pensions 2000 delegates -- most
of them executives and fund managers of public and private fund
trusts in the United States who are either specialized in high-tech
investment or experts in foreign currency trading -- are expected to
gain an in-depth knowledge of Taiwan's economic fundamentals and of
the performance of the island's financial sector, including the stock
market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
on Thursday said that Taiwan will provide incentives for foreign
investments, without any undue restrictions, in hopes of developing
the island into a regional financial center in Asia.</P>
      <P>Lee revealed the plan in a written address to the opening of the
"Access to Asia" conference in Taipei, attended by a delegation
organized by consultancy Pensions 2000 and comprising nearly 100
managers and executives of foreign investment funds. The delegation
has come to Taiwan to learn about its stock market and financial
sector.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the delegation, through its fact-finding visit, may
come to recognize that Taiwan presents "a unique perspective toward a
better understanding of investing successfully in the Pacific Rim."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Republic of China, like many other
developed economies, is well prepared to enter the next millennium.
It is willing to continue to strengthen Taiwan's financial role in
the region and to serve as a proactive player in helping Asia's
economy to fully recover.</P>
      <P>To reach that goal, Lee said, many measures aimed at economic and
financial reform have been enacted, including ones to further develop
technology-based industries, to improve Taiwan's system of higher
education, to strengthen environmental protection and to gain entry
into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Lee said he welcomes investment in Taiwan by members of the
visiting Pensions 2000 delegation, saying their investments would
create a long-term tie between the Republic of China and the United
States.</P>
      <P>The delegation, headed by Pensions 2000 Corp. Chairman Philip
Schaefer, arrived in Taiwan Wednesday for a two-day conference and to
study the island's financial and economic sectors. The funds the
delegates represent manage some US$1 trillion in assets.</P>
      <P>As pension funds seek to provide safe and stable returns for
members, pension fund managers are generally more conservative than
those who manage other types of investment funds, local stock brokers
said. If the visiting US fund managers were to invest in Taiwan's
stock market, it would help to improve the market's stability, they
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) on Thursday lauded Taiwan for its efforts
to eradicate commercial piracy.</P>
      <P>The de facto US embassy in Taiwan's recognition came after local
law enforcement officers cracked two companies in the central Taiwan
county of Taichung, which allegedly had counterfeited American
and Japanese brand-named golf equipment.</P>
      <P>Under the command of the Taichung Prosecutor's Office,
Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau agents cracked the two golf
equipment counterfeiting companies on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement officers confiscated a large amount of
phony golf clubs and parts, worth an estimated NT$200 million
(US$6.06 million) in market value.</P>
      <P>The heads of the two companies, identified as Liu Tai-chi and
Chang Chu-ping, were charged with violating the country's trademark
law. After extensive questioning, the duo were released on NT$100,000
and NT$80,000 bails, respectively, late Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>Concerned about the anti-counterfeiting operations, the AIT sent
staff members to the Taichung Prosecutor's Office Wednesday evening
to collect first-hand information about the case.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing appreciation of Taiwan's efforts to
eradicate commercial piracy, the AIT officials also urged local law
enforcement authorities to continue their anti-counterfeiting
crusade in order to protect legitimate rights and interests of
genuine manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The newly seized counterfeit goods, including both finished and
semi-finished golf equipment, carried such American labels as
Callaway, S-Yard, Honma, Fila and Spalding, as well as Japanese brand
Mizuno.</P>
      <P>Genuine golf equipment of these brands can fetch hundreds of
thousands of New Taiwan dollars per set or even a million NT
dollars, but a counterfeit set was sold for NT$20,000 to NT$40,000.
AIT officials said such practice has seriously affected American
companies' rights and interests.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on
Thursday expressed regret over the failure by its mainland Chinese
counterpart to help arrange for one of its senior officials to visit
mainland China.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Wu Hsin-hsing said another SEF
deputy secretary-general, Chang Liang-jen, was originally scheduled
to leave for mainland China on April 15 to take part in a golf
tournament to be sponsored by Fuzhou- and Gueilin-based Taiwan
businessmen.</P>
      <P>SEF faxed a message to the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on April 6, asking it to
help arrange for Chang's visit, Wu said. "However, Chang's scheduled
departure date has now already passed, but we still have not received
any response from ARATS. We regret this and are concerned about the
incident," Wu said.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to substantiate the four-point consensus
reached between the two intermediary bodies during a high-profile
meeting of SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS President Wang Daohan
last October, Wu said, SEF has never hesitated to help arrange for
ARATS staff members and mainland officials in charge of Taiwan
affairs at various levels to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu urged ARATS to faithfully abide by the four-point consensus
reached at the Koo-Wang meeting, which requires SEF and ARATS to work
together to boost bilateral exchanges and constructive interaction
based on the principle of reciprocity.</P>
      <P>As for possible reasons behind Beijing's rejection of Chang's
application to visit, Wu said mainland China often regards SEF-ARATS
interaction from a political perspective.</P>
      <P>Wu said ARATS has also not yet responded to SEF's proposal that
Jan Jyh-horng, also an SEF deputy secretary-general, lead a
delegation of officials to Beijing to discuss details concerning a
planned visit to Taiwan by ARATS President Wang this autumn.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pensions 2000, which manages a combined
total of US$8 trillion worth of pension funds, is looking forward to
increasing investment in Taiwan's stock market, said Pensions 2000
Corp. Chairman Philip Schaefer on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a two-day Pensions 2000 conference, dubbed "Access to
Asia," which opened Thursday in Taipei, Schaefer said that as various
Pensions 2000 fund trusts are managed and operated by different
experts, it is hard for him to speculate exactly how much Pensions
2000 will invest in the Taiwan bourse in the near future.</P>
      <P>He is positive, however, that Pensions 2000 will increase its
investment in Taiwan's bourse after it gains a better understanding
of the island's economic fundamentals and stock market development,
Schaefer said.</P>
      <P>With its outstanding economic performance, high education
standards and political stability, Taiwan is an area that Pensions
2000 could not afford to ignore when it organized its "Access to
Asia" investment-seeking roadshow, Schaefer noted.</P>
      <P>He said Pensions 2000, which includes both private pension funds
and funds run by city and state governments, is looking for long-term
investment opportunities, not speculative ones. Funds in the group
have invested across the United State, Europe and the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>An "Access to Asia" seminar has already taken place in Seoul, and
another will be held in Hong Kong following the Taipei gathering.
Through the seminars Pensions 2000 members hope to further their
understanding of regional markets, and the information obtained
during the seminars will be used by the group for reference when
making decisions on fresh investments, he said.</P>
      <P>Schaefer said the seminar will help those trusts and funds that
have already invested in Taiwan to further understand Taiwan's
economic fabric, and it will help those who are unfamiliar with
Taiwan's investment climate to obtain first-hand information.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui offered congratulations via a written
message on the opening of the seminar, touted as the biggest seminar
on foreign capital ever held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ranking Republic of China officials, including Economic Affairs
Minister Wang Chih-kang and Schive Chi, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, were
invited to deliver speeches during the opening session of the
seminar.</P>
      <P>About 100 senior executive and managers of US, Canada and
European funds, who represent more than US$1 trillion, are attending

promote cross-strait relations in the meantime, said the head of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>Minister Wang Chih-kang said in a written speech delivered at the
"Access to Asia" conference now being held in Taipei that improving
the domestic economy and promoting international cooperation will be
the basis of Taiwan's economic and trade policy.</P>
      <P>The conference, sponsored by Pensions 2000, is being attended by
115 representatives and managers of US and Canadian pension funds.
They arrived from Seoul to take part in the second leg of a series of
seminars designed to familiarize them with the capital markets and
economies of South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that a stable cross-strait relationship is
crucial to foreign investment in Taiwan, Taipei will certainly follow
a policy that will ensure stable economic and trade development
between the two sides, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>The economics minister indicated that Taipei hopes to enter the
WTO before the organization holds its next round of trade talks next
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has concluded bilateral negotiations with the 26 WTO
members that requested such negotiations. To date, only Canada and
Hong Kong have not signed a formal agreement with Taiwan, observed
Wang, adding that he hopes the agreements can be completed by May.</P>
      <P>Improving Taiwan's domestic economy is one of the main ways in
which the MOEA hopes to attract foreign investment to Taiwan, and the
ministry is working to improve Taiwan's investment environment and
strengthen the management capacity of Taiwan enterprises, he said.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Macedonian trade delegation called on
the Ministry of Economic Affairs on Thursday to seek trade
opportunities for the Balkan nation's Almako liquor.</P>
      <P>Received by Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu, Ivan Cvetkovski,
chairman of Macedonia's main Almako liquor factory, expressed the
factory's willingness to export Almako liquor to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation also hope that Taiwan businessmen will
set up banks and buy buildings to be used as trade centers in
Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Lin said Almako liquor is the best in Macedonia, although bottles
for the liquor are made outside the country. Because of the liquor's
quality and its high production costs, it is the most expensive
liquor in Macedonia, he said.</P>
      <P>Costs could be lowered -- and the liquor made more competitive on
the Taiwan market -- if it were brought into Taiwan in barrels and
bottled locally. Talks on the matter are underway between the Taiwan
Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau and the Almako liquor factory's
Cvetkovski.</P>
      <P>As for the prospect of Taiwan businessmen buying buildings in
Macedonia for use as trade centers, Lin said the matter must be
further evaluated.</P>
      <P>Lin said Macedonia's banking sector is underdeveloped and that
while the idea of Taiwan banks entering into joint ventures with
Macedonian banks is worth consideration, it may be more convenient
for Taiwan banks to set up branches there.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15  (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's semiconductor godfather said
Thursday that Taiwan must encourage innovation and ingenuity to
maintain its mrket niches and sustain its economic growth.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corp. (TSMC), made the call in a speech delivered at National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>Chang said vision, values and strategy are the three pillars of
business management.</P>
      <P>Chang said a company must have visions to inpire innovation and
stimulate corporate growth.</P>
      <P>Noting that innovation is the smartest business strategy, Chang
said local companies must invest more in research and development
(R&amp;D) to sustain development.</P>
      <P>As small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone
of Taiwan's industry, most Taiwan companies pay little attention to
cultivate their own corporate culture.</P>
      <P>Chang said in most cases, only large-sized enterprises can
afford to support R&amp;D projects to nurture new inventions. As
Taiwan lacks large-sized and globalized companies, it lags
behind in technological development.</P>
      <P>Chang said SMEs are usually conservative and prefer to copy
successful technology and management strategy invented by advanced
countries.</P>
      <P>"We must drop this kind of mentality. Otherwise, we can never
become a true leader in any high-tech fields," Chang
stressed.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that visions can be changed once every four to
five years, but values should never be changed. "As for strategy, it
is key to business success. And the wisest strategy is innovation."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN COMMENTS ON TRA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the implementation of the
Taiwan Relations Act has been successful over the past two decades,
the relations it seeks to govern can never replace diplomatic
relations, a Republic of China spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, director-general of the Government Information
Office, made the remarks when he attended a conference marking the
20th anniversary of the TRA, which defines the framework of relations
between the Republic of China and the United States in the absence of
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Chen, speaking at a conference co-sponsored by the Heritage
Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.,
said the ambiguity in the TRA, which was enacted in 1979, has
provided flexibility. Nevertheless, the act also has inherent
drawbacks, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the TRA states that the United States will not
accept a forcible invasion of Taiwan by mainland China, but it does
not explicitly state how the United States would respond if Beijing
uses force.</P>
      <P>Chen, speaking of the deficiencies of the TRA, noted that the US
government, bowing under pressure from mainland China, has restricted
arms sales to Taiwan and stated that it will not support Taiwan's
entry into international organizations in which statehood is a
requirement.</P>
      <P>He said the US moves go against the spirit of the TRA and have to
do with the ambiguity in the language of the TRA.</P>
      <P>Chen said that no matter how good the language of the TRA is, the
relations it seek to govern can never replace diplomatic relations.
The United States' six-point statement in 1982 and its 1994 Taiwan
policy review were necessary but insufficient, he said.</P>
      <P>The United States has not agreed to hold prior consultations with
mainland China on arms sales to the Republic of China. The United
States will not play any mediation role between Taipei and Beijing.
The United States has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations Act.
The United States has not altered its position regarding sovereignty
over Taiwan, and the United States will not exert pressure on Taiwan
to negotiate with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that when the Taiwan Relations Act was first
enacted, nobody thought Taiwan would become fully democratic in such
a short period of time.</P>
      <P>Some believe that Taiwan's democratization is a step toward
independence and have claimed Taiwan is a troublemaker, he said. He
stressed that Taiwan's move toward democracy has been in the interest
of the United States and its values.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he is basically positive in regard to the results
of the TRA, saying that the US law has been unique, pragmatic,
flexible, elastic and continuous.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, debate over the enactment of a plebiscite law in
Taiwan has also spread to the conference, with Chen and Parris Chang,
who is also taking part in the conference, at adds with each other.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Legislative Yuan is currently discussing what
is the best way to implement referendum rights, adding that he does
not think that plebiscites would be in the best interests of the
people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said plebiscites are not the only option, and that in deciding
whether to implement them, the sensitivity of relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait need to be considered.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unfriendly remarks about Taiwan by
mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji have brought rebukes from several
legislators in Taipei, who suggested the cancellation of a visit this
autumn by the mainland's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi faced the wrath of
the lawmakers on a Thursday meeting, where he also faced argument
over the government's mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>The legislators were angry with Zhu's refusal to renounce the use
of force against Taiwan, and irritated by Zhu's using the example of
the American civil war as an analogy during his visit to the United
States earlier this month.</P>
      <P>There is no sign of any goodwill toward Taipei on the part of
Beijing, said Hou Huei-hsien, as he asked Su how Taiwan can extend a
warm welcome in the face of mainland China's cold shoulder. Instead,
he said, Taiwan should refuse a planned visit by Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait,
the intermediary body founded by Beijing to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Su said although he agreed with Hou's observation, the government
regards exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as an
important factor which can help the promotion of better cross-strait
relations. Therefore, Wang will be welcomed, and it is hoped that his
visit will give him a better understanding of Taiwan, Su said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the MAC will not manage cross-strait affairs in
an emotional manner, and noted that the council has mapped out a
blueprint for the resolution of cross-strait disputes, and is trying
to turn it into a reality.</P>

States would provide Taiwan with a Theater Missile Defense (TMD)
system, but he said Taiwan may be forced to beef up its defense
capabilities in the face of growing military threats, particularly
missile threats, from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen said the TMD system, which is still in development, is only
one of several weapons systems that Taiwan may consider acquiring,
adding that any such acquisition would, of course, be up to the
government of the United States to decide.</P>
      <P>What matters most to the ROC government is how to guard Taiwan's
security and how to protect its people from mainland Chinese threats,
Chen noted, adding that Taiwan will seek defensive capabilities that
can adequately protect the island's existence and secure sustainable
development.</P>
      <P>If mainland China persists in threatening Taiwan, then Taiwan
will consider the US-proposed TMD system, as well as other defensive
systems. This position is reasonable and one to which both the United
States and Taiwan should agree, he said.</P>
      <P>In response to a question regarding Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), Chen noted that Taiwan has completed
bilateral and multilateral consultations with 26 WTO member states
with only Canada and Hong Kong not yet having signed a formal
agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Further progress on Taiwan's WTO entry is expected in the near
future, he said.</P>
      <P>As to the contested Spratly island chain, Chen said the Republic
of China has always claimed sovereignty over the island group in the
South China Sea, but it has also insisted that disputes over the
island chain's sovereignty be resolved peacefully by all the
countries that have laid claim to the islands. Taiwan has also called
for the joint exploration of natural resources in the region, he
said.</P>
      <P>He also reiterated Taiwan's opposition to its exclusion from most
international organizations, despite its economic and political
development.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's exclusion is due mainly to Beijing's
"concerted and sustained efforts" to thwart the development of
official relations between Taiwan and the international community.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the state of cross-strait relations, Chen said
Taiwan is looking forward to a visit to Taiwan this fall by Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait. He said the visit would be conducive to
rebuilding mutual trust between the two sides of the strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASTE BATTERIES TO BE RECYCLED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Waste batteries should be recycled from
Nov. 1, a senior official with the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Shen Chih-hsiu, an EPA specialist, made the statement at a
public hearing called by opposition Legislator Fan Hsun-lu.</P>
      <P>Shen said the EPA has decided to serve a public notice in May
calling for an all-out recycling of waste batteries. "We'll give
local companies a six-month grace period during which time they can
carefully calculate how much money is needed to recycle waste
batteries and incorporate it into their operational costs."</P>
      <P>After the grace period expires, Shen said, recycling waste
batteries will become mandatory for local companies.</P>
      <P>Shen also outlined the EPA's goals, including that the
monthly recycling rate will reach 25 percent of the total by the
end of 2000.</P>
      <P>"By then, we also hope 6,000 waste batteries collecting points
can be established and construction of a recycling plant will get
underway," Shen noted.</P>
      <P>As most ordinary members of the public do not understand which
kinds of batteries must be recycled, waste battery recycling does
not operate smoothly at the moment.</P>
      <P>Shen said the EPA is scheduled to call a meeting on April 29 to
discuss effective measures to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Legislator Fan said in addition
to traditional batteries, Taiwan is expected to see the phase-out of
more than 1 million old-fashioned mobile phone hand sets this year.</P>
      <P>"As most batteries installed in old-styled hand sets contain
such heavy metals as nickel and cadmium, the dumped old hand sets
will pose a great potential threat to our environment," Fan noted.</P>
      <P>Quoting unofficial tallies, Fan said one out of every four Taiwan
people now owns a cellular phone. According to Fan's estimate,
a total of 16.29 million waste batteries from cellular phones will
scatter at various corners of the island by the end of June.</P>
      <P>"How to effectively collect all these batteries for recycling has
become a serious problem," the lawmaker from the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party warned.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-lung, secretary-general of the Environmental Quality
Protection Foundation, blasted the EPA for failing to efficiently
use the billions of dollars of recycling funds collected in recent
years to improve garbage and waste battery recycling.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that the EPA use its recycling funds to encourage
local companies to adopt more effective measures to collect waste
batteries.</P>
      <P>Liu also urged the EPA to adopt a BOT (build-operate-transfer)
system to allow private investment in the construction of a waste
battery recycling plant. Under the BOT scheme, private investors
will carry out construction and operate the plant in a set period,
after which the plant will be turned to government control.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The worst of the economic downturn in
Asia is over, but the region still needs a stable US economy to fully
recover, a senior leader of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) in
Canberra on Thursday, ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino said
all ASEAN countries except Indonesia would grow this year, while
inflation rates would fall. But the world's largest economy -- the
United States -- was crucial to economic growth in Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>"It would affect rather severely the chances of a recovery in the
region if a downturn (in the United States) was to occur," he said.</P>
      <P>He said weakness in the Japanese economy, exchange rate
misalignment among major currencies and uncertainty in regard to
external financial flows also posed risks.</P>
      <P>"We hope we're through the worst. There are signs that the
recovery will begin this year, but there are ponderable challenges,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that cooperation among Asian governments has improved.</P>
      <P>"ASEAN governments have begun to inform one another about their
internal policies and reforms and have exchanged views on them," he

    <HEADLINE>INDIDER SEES RAISING OF TIBETAN FLAG AS ZHU'S FAILURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, April 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The raising of Tibet's flag in St. John's,
Newfoundland, nearly led to the cancellation of a visit there by
mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.</P>
      <P>"It was at our request that Mayor Andy Wells raised the flag of
Tibet yesterday," a spokesman for the Canada Tibet Committee told the
Central News Agency on Thursday.</P>
      <P>James Pilgrim said his group's intention in raising the flag was
threefold:</P>
      <P>--To call for the suspension of bilateral dialogue between Canada
and mainland China until its accountability and effectiveness can be
improved;</P>
      <P>--To remind Canadians about Canada's impending decision as to
whether it should sponsor a resolution at the United Nations in late
April condemning mainland China's human rights abuses; and</P>
      <P>--To call particular attention to the Panchen Lama, the world's
youngest political prisoner.</P>
      <P>"Please note that we did not call for the isolation of, nor
economic sanctions against, China. Our intention was to demand that
cooperation be carried out in such a way that human rights and
economic development will develop hand-in-hand," Pilgrim said.</P>
      <P>The flag raising was intended as "a peaceful, symbolic sign of
protest," he stressed. But the visiting mainland took exception to
the gesture, and seemed to consider the act even more insulting than
the hundreds of protesters they have encountered on every leg of
their journey in North America, he said.</P>
      <P>The flag was lowered Wednesday at about 4 p.m., following threats
by Zhu to cancel the trip to St. John's. Pressure from within the
Newfoundland business community was a factor as well, he said.</P>
      <P>"The Canada Tibet Committee strongly objects to the demands made
by the Chinese delegation. We regard them as a sign of
over-sensitivity and a diplomatic failure on their part," he said.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, a demonstration was planned outside Hotel
Newfoundland, where Zhu was scheduled to meet with federal and
provincial politicians. Pilgrim said that although the demonstration
had not been organized by the Canada Tibet Committee, it still
planned to take part.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT NATO ACTIONS:</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia on Thursday flatly rejected a
Yugoslav demand that Canberra stop supporting US-led NATO bombings of
Yugoslavia if it wants to achieve the release of two Australian aid
workers now being held by Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>In response to media reports on the demand from the Yugoslav
Foreign Ministry, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia
"will never give in to any threat and blackmail" and will insist on
the release of the two aid workers -- Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace.
The two are being held on charges of spying, though Downer said the
charges are groundless and untrue.</P>
      <P>Australia is a strong supporter of the bombings, said Downer,
adding that Canberra will never agree with the ethnic cleansing
campaign now being launched by Serbian troops in Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>Earlier Downer told reporters that he had sent a letter to UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, asking him to help secure the release
of the two workers, who are now under detention in an unknown place
in Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said the two workers have become Yugoslavia's
pawns, as the alliance intensifies its bombing campaign.</P>
      <P>"Yugoslavia is trying its best to get the bombings suspended and
it appears willing to bargain it with the possible release of the two
aid workers," one analyst said, adding, "But it is impossible
Belgrade would succeed because they have to stop the ethnic cleansing
campaign against Albanians first and then resettle them back where
they originate."</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 23 member countries of the Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) on Friday announced it would push
for the admission of Chinese Taipei, mainland China, Russia and
Vietnam to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>At a news conference immediately after the conclusion of a
three-day PECC standing committee meeting in Canberra, the tripartite
organization of business, government and academic officials issued a
statement saying PECC members "attach the highest importance to
accession into the WTO of all PECC economies which are now in the
process of acceding, namely, Russia, Chinese Taipei, Vietnam and most
especially China."</P>
      <P>"At this time, when many economies in Asia are undergoing deep
and wide-ranging structural reforms, it is imperative that they (the
four nations) get fully integrated into the rules-based trading
system, charged with promoting and maintaining free and open trade
and investments, under the auspices of the WTO," the statement said.</P>
      <P>PECC's standing committee will present its statement to a meeting
of trade ministers of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
member states in June.</P>
      <P>The statement said the committee supports the idea that all APEC
member states should use an upcoming APEC leaders' meeting in
Auckland in September to confirm their final support for the WTO
entry of mainland China, Taiwan, Russia, Vietnam.</P>
      <P>In addition, PECC successfully broadened its scope at the meeting
by reaching an agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations under which the two bodies have agreed to work together in
the future.</P>
      <P>"We are delighted to see the results of this meeting because PECC
will play a constructive role in pushing the world trade," PECC

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN BLASTED FOR REMARKS ABOUT PLEBISCITE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang was blasted Friday by other DPP
members for recent remarks on plebiscites and Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>During a television interview on Thursday, Hsu, who has shown a
strong interest in making a presidential bid, said that while he
agrees plebiscites are a fundamental right, a vote on independence
could "bring disaster" upon Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Trong Chai, a DPP legislator and the leader of a pro-plebiscite
hunger strike that entered its seventh day Friday in front of the
Legislative Yuan, said it is improper and unthinkable that Hsu could
have made such remarks.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Plebiscite Action Committee rebuked Hsu in a formal
statement on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-shen, deputy executive chief of the committee said the
ruling Kuomintang's argument that a plebiscite on independence is
tantamount to military action against Taiwan by Beijing is
"shamefully disgraceful."</P>
      <P>That Hsu has adopted the same position is regrettable, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that the current hunger strike is only one way of
increasing Taiwan people's awareness of the issue and their support
for plebiscites.</P>
      <P>The last thing that the pro-plebiscite activists would like to
see is a dispute between the camps of Hsu and Chen Shui-bian, the
DPP's most likely presidential candidate in the elections slated for
2000, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang Chin-hai, a DPP National Assembly deputy, was
hospitalized Thursday, the sixth day of the activity. Twenty-three
other DPP legislators and pro-plebiscite hunger strikers continued
the strike on Friday, although the health of some is deteriorating,
according to doctors monitoring the group.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung, who has taken part in the strike
since the first day, said he has lost 5 kilograms so far. In
addition, his blood pressure has become unstable and he is suffering
from periodic blackouts, he said.</P>
      <P>To keep up his strength, Shen said he has maintained a "turtle"
rest position for most of the time over the past several days.</P>
      <P>The strike need not continue until all participants are
hospitalized for it to be successful, he said, adding that he will
end his strike when he feels he cannot sustain it any longer. He said
he is opposed to the idea that the hunger strikers should continue
the strike until the last moment as if running a relay race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIER FORECASTS ROC 1999 ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE AT 4.97 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institute for Economic
Research (CIER) on Friday forecast the Republic of China's 1999
economic growth rate to be 4.97 percent, up 0.05 percentage points
from the figure the institute forecast in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>The institute cautioned, however, that there are three variables
that could affect growth -- the most important being the performance
of the US economy. An economic slowdown in the United States would
result in a global recession, which could substantially lower the
ROC's economic growth this year.</P>
      <P>CIER said that if the US stock market experiences a significant
downturn, ROC exports in the second, third and fourth quarters would
all likely decrease by NT$10 billion, which would result in economic
growth this year of only 4.16 percent.</P>
      <P>Another variable that affect growth is the degree to which
investments by domestic manufacturers lag behind schedule.</P>
      <P>The third variable is the pace of East Asia's economic recovery.
If the region recovers faster than expected, it would likely result
in increased regional trade, which could lift the ROC's exports to
Asia in the second, third and fourth quarters by NT$3 billion per
quarter. If that were to happen, the ROC's economic growth in 1999
could rise to as much as 5.2 percent, CIER said.</P>
      <P>CIER also forecast that the New Taiwan dollar would trade at an
average level of 33.03 to the US dollar in 1999, while it predicted
the nation's consumer price index would grow 2.01 percent in 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICY ANALYST MARKS TRA ANNIVERSARY WITH CALL FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To honor American commitments made
under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), the US Congress and the Clinton
administration should strive to enhance Taiwan's freedom and security
by urging mainland China to renounce the use of force against Taiwan
and by selling Taiwan missile defense systems and technology,
according to an American expert.</P>
      <P>Stephen Yates, senior policy analyst at the Asian Studies Center
of the Heritage Foundation, wrote in a background piece that for 20
years the TRA has provided a security umbrella that has facilitated
Taiwan's impressive economic expansion and democratization. To
protect these gains and to continue to faithfully implement the TRA,
the United States should do several things, he said.</P>
      <P>First, the United States should urge mainland China to renounce
the use of force against Taiwan. This is consistent with the United
States' long-standing insistence that Taiwan's future be determined
by peaceful means, he said.</P>
      <P>Second, the United States should sell Taiwan missile defense
systems and technology. Considering mainland China's provocative
military exercises and its tests of nuclear-capable missiles near
Taiwan in 1995 and 1996, and mainland China's increased deployment of
missiles near Taiwan, providing assistance for Taiwan's missile
defense is "both appropriate and consistent with the TRA," said the
policy analyst.</P>
      <P>Third, the United States should actively support Taiwan's
membership in international organizations. With a strong economy and
vibrant democracy, Taiwan is clearly prepared to make significant
contributions to the international community through institutions
involved in trade, economic development and humanitarian assistance,
Yates said.</P>
      <P>Finally, the United States should promote Taiwan's democracy in
mainland China and abroad. Consistent with its interest in human
rights in Taiwan, the United States must properly recognize and
reward the Taiwan people for their success in establishing a
democracy. One way to do this is to "treat Taiwan's leaders
officially with the respect appropriate to duly elected
representatives of a thriving democracy," noted Yates.</P>
      <P>He said it is up to Congress to keep America committed to the
simple goals of the Taiwan Relations Act -- to deter aggression by
the mainland, to promote economic freedom and to protect the human
rights of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Ronald Reagan described American commitments under the TRA as a
"moral obligation" to a long-time friend and ally. The United States
"must do all it can to help the democratic people of Taiwan to live
free from military coercion and to guarantee Taiwan's ability to make
an appropriate contribution to global institutions that promote peace
and prosperity," wrote Yates.</P>
      <P>The analyst concluded that "The Taiwan Relations Act is an
example of American foreign policy at its best. There is no better
way to mark the 20th anniversary of its enactment than to reaffirm
the US commitment to its honorable goals and to restore clarity and

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PINEAPPLE EXPORTS TO JAPAN RISING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chunghsing  Village,  central  Taiwan,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's
pineapple exports to Japan are expected to top 150,000 kilograms, or
15,000 cartons, this year, about twice the amount exported last year,
the Taiwan provincial government reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>This year's estimate is still far short, however, of the 1
million kilograms exported in 1989.</P>
      <P>After a nearly decade-long hiatus, Taiwan pineapple farmers
finally managed to resume in 1998 exports to Japan of the unique
species of pineapple that was developed by the Taiwan Agricultural
Research Institute more than a decade ago, officials from the
provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry (DAF) said.</P>
      <P>The export of Taiwan's "Tai Nung No. 4" pineapple to Japan began
in late March and is expected to be completed before the end of
April.</P>
      <P>According to DAF officials, Tai Nung No. 4 pineapples taste much
sweeter and are smaller than the ordinary "Smooth Kaiying" species
found in most pineapple-producing countries. In addition, its meat is
more yellow and its texture and fibers are much finer and more tender
than those of the "Smooth Kaiying," they noted.</P>
      <P>Another noticeable difference is the pineapple's skin. Tai Nung
No. 4 pineapples can be peeled easily by hand, which makes
consumption much easier and more pleasant, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan pineapple farmers, which are centered in southern Taiwan,
exported a combined volume of 57,750 kilograms, or 5,775 10-kilogram
cartons, of Tai Nung No. 4 pineapples to Japan last year -- the first
time Taiwan had exported pineapples to Japan since the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to export Tai Nung No. 4 pineapples to Japan around
1986, soon after the species was developed. Exports rose by leaps and
bounds, and in 1989 about 1 million kilograms were exported to Japan.</P>
      <P>But poor quality control, cut-throat competition and a lack of
systematic contract production led to a nearly 10-year period in
which hardly any pineapples were exported to Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also exports other fresh fruits, including mangoes, lichee
and bananas, to Japan, with bananas remaining the biggest export,
totaling about 5 million 12-kilogram cartons each year, according to
DAF officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APPLICATION OF TRA IN NEW CIRCUMSTANCES DISCUSSED (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  15 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has to consider in
advance American obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act to
changing strategic and technological circumstances so as to minimize
misunderstanding or miscalculation on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits, according to an expert on Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Gerrit Gong, director of the Asian Studies Program at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), testified Wednesday
before the House International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the
Pacific that the United States has six anchor interests in
cross-strait relations, including its interpretation and application
of the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>The first interest, he said, is to help preserve an equilibrium
of confidence so that those on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can
determine the pace and scope of their mutual interaction peacefully.</P>
      <P>It is the United States' position that both sides should
peacefully determine what is mutually acceptable to them, free from
coercive pressure from the other side or from the United States, he
said. The United States should reject any challenge to the status quo
by force, and discourage Taiwan independence, while leaving it to
Beijing and Taipei to create the positive conditions necessary to
entice peaceful unification, explained Gong.</P>
      <P>It is also in the interests of the United States to maintain
Taipei and Beijing's responsibility for their continued dynamic
balancing of cooperation and competition, and not to allow
responsibility for cross-strait peace and communication to be shifted
to Washington for restraint or adjudication.</P>
      <P>Although competition will continue between Taipei and Beijing, it
is in the United States' interests to build margins of safety, not
simply limits of tension, said Gong.</P>
      <P>The third anchor interest is seeing a constructive and authorized
direct dialogue between Taipei and Beijing that deals directly with
the differences between them. He suggested such direct communication
come through multiple channels and at multiple levels.</P>
      <P>Gong noted that there is an important role for "Track II"
dialogue convened and facilitated by institutions such as CSIS. But
there is also a need for consistent, confirmed, authoritative
messages between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait if cross-strait
trust and confidence are to be built on a solid foundation.</P>
      <P>The United States' fourth interest is to encourage other
Asia-Pacific countries publicly to state their interest in regional
peace, security and stability.</P>
      <P>Gong noted that this does not mean other countries should take
sides in what they may see as a Chinese political issue. But there is
a danger to all the region if non-peaceful means are employed to
resolve questioned borders, territorial lines or other disputes.
While formal collective security agreements have yet to be developed
in the Asia-Pacific region, emerging regional institutions should
perceive a collective interest in the peaceful resolution of
disputes, including issues touching concerns of sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Fifth, it is in the United States' interest to maintain a working
executive and Congressional consensus on US-mainland China-Taiwan
relations. Particularly in the last two years of a second
presidential term, the importance of maintaining a working consensus
on trilateral relations may be directly proportional to the
difficulty of its achievement, according to the Asia expert.</P>
      <P>A healthy discussion of the alternative merits of different
policy approaches is a hallmark of US democracy, but it is not in the
United States' interests for domestic politics in Washington to
become the dispute resolution mechanism for issues better resolved
directly by involved parties, said Gong.</P>
      <P>The United States' sixth interest is the advance consideration of
the application of the Taiwan Relations Act in circumstances changed
by evolving strategic developments.

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  15 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>He said that important to maintaining an equilibrium of
confidence are accurate mutual assessments of intent and capability
by Beijing, Taipei and Washington. These assessments would come as
part of the process of ongoing adjustment to the mutual understanding
of what and how the TRA applies in circumstances changed by ongoing
strategic developments.</P>
      <P>For example, Gong said, new developments in information warfare
and aspects of the revolution in military affairs require ongoing
efforts to fulfill US obligations under the TRA. In particular, as
air, land, sea, space and the electromagnetic spectrum are brought
together in new strategic combinations, situations could well arise
in which vital centers of national security gravity for Taiwan could
come under attack without visibly triggering the TRA.</P>
      <P>Indeed, he added, new combinations of familiar and emerging
strategies (such as a mainland air-borne blockade of Taiwan by
missile-carrying planes) must be analyzed within the parameters of
the three joint communiques and the TRA to forestall any
misunderstandings about where and how the TRA might apply within the
context of new technologies and strategies or their applications.</P>
      <P>Gong noted that new patterns of cooperative engagement
capability; issues in regard to new definitions of theater, front
lines, etc.; questions regarding effective political presence; and
many other emerging issues will shape the nature of competition and
conflict in ways that will require constantly updated discussions of
US interests in cross-strait applications of the TRA so as to
minimize misunderstanding or miscalculation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JEFFEREY KOO SEES TAIWAN RISING SPACE FROM PECC-ASEAN COOPERATION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 16 (CNA): The initial cooperation between
the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will give Taiwan more chances to make
friends in the region, the leader of the Chinese Taipei Committee of
PECC said on Friday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA in Canberra, Jeffrey Koo said it
would be very "helpful" for Taiwan after PECC and ASEAN members forge
a cooperation because Taipei could better improve its relations with
the countries in the region.</P>
      <P>PECC this year invited ASEAN's secretary general Rodolfo Severino
to make a speech in which he called for a cooperation between ASEAN
and PECC to resolve their problems. PECC chairman Roberto Romulo
responded positively by asking ASEAN to take part in all PECC
meetings in the future, setting the initial cooperation between the
two organizations.</P>
      <P>"We are glad to see such development between PECC and ASEAN
and hope to foster better ties between Taiwan and all ASEAN member
countries in the future," Koo said.</P>
      <P>During te three-day Standing Committee meeting of the PECC in
Canberra, about 90 delegates from Taiwan, mainland China, Canada,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand,
Russia, Vietnam, Indonesia and South Korea, discussed a wide range of
issues, including trade policy, transportation, telecommunications,
agriculture, energy and above all, the information technology .</P>
      <P>Roberto Romulo told the CNA that he would like to see the role of
PECC rises so that it could promote not only global trade, but also
trade liberalization as set forth by the APEC leaders meeting in
Bogor, Indonesia in 1993.</P>
      <P>Under the Bogor declaration, trade liberalization is set by 2010
for developed economies of the APEC forum and 2020 for developing
countries.</P>
      <P>Romulo said the target would be reached despite the Asian
financial and economic crisis, which started in Thailand, and then
spread to other Asian countries, and then to other countries in the
world.</P>
      <P>He said trade protectionism should be prevented with all means
and trade liberalization would only lead to a better world in the
future.</P>
      <P>During the three-day meeting, the only country that boycotted the
PECC meeting was the United States, which had dispute with the
organizers when it was asked to pay the due fees, worth more than
US$300,000.</P>
      <P>The US National Committee of the PECC was unable to make the
payment and sought to boycott the Canberra meeting this year. But the
presence of the US is very important in any future PECC meetings, Koo
said.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid similar cases in the future, the Japanese
delegates suggested that the selection of the chair of a national
committee be made very carefully in the future in order not to repeat
the present mistake.</P>

      <P>Canberra, April 16 (CNA): Bill Gates is the current guru in
information industry, but increasing numbers of players in the IT are
of Chinese born, and most likely Taiwanese would become tomorrow's
hero, according to a report by the Australian Financial Review on
Friday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Taipei, the daily's correspondent Rowan
Callick reported tomorrow's high-tech hero would not be Bill Gate or
other Westerners, but instead could be Chinese-born.
 "And most likely, he would come from Taiwan," the daily said.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that it is Taiwan's vibrant, deep and broad
high-tech sector, the third biggest in the world after the United
States and Japan, that has driven its economy through and beyond the
Asian turmoil.</P>
      <P>Callick said that apart from Australia economy and mainland
China, Taiwan is the only economy in the region to have kept growing.</P>
      <P>He said the beating heart of its high-tech sector is the Hsinchu
Science-based Park, where 259 companies, 48 of them foreign --
two-thirds of which are American -- and employs 71,000 people, half
of them women, are taking the lead in the high-tech industry in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Along with Hsinchu, there are also other new parks and the Taipei
government assures these companies of rapid customs clearance and
even more attractively, exempts components in exports from tax in
addition to a five-year tax holiday.</P>
      <P>The government also offers special guarantee to protect
intellectual property rights and it continues to develop the nearby
educational institutions that feed the Hsinchu park's R &amp; D
departments.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Taiwan produces more than 60 percent of the
world's motherboards, more than half of its image scanners, mice and
monitors, and 30 percent each of its interface cards and notebook
PCs.</P>
      <P>The report occupies the whole page with a five-column headline:
"Taiwan's Beating Heart." The report said Taiwan was able to recruit
those talents, who mostly received their education from the US and
work at the Silicon Valley in California. These experts have to
travel between Taiwan and California and make the island country of
22 million a leading producer and exporter of high-tech products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has decided to set
up a field hospital at the Stenokvec refugee camp in Macedonia to
provide medical services for ethnic Albanians from neighboring
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Foreign Minister David Lee, who is heading a delegation
of officials, social workers, volunteers and medical personnel on a
humanitarian visit to Macedonia, announced the decision here on
Thursday after reaching a consensus with representatives of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the international
relief group CARE.</P>
      <P>Lee said medical service is the most important part of the ROC's
humanitarian assistance to ethnic Albanian refugees in Macedonia,
adding that the ROC medical service team will stay in Stenokvec for
two to three weeks.</P>
      <P>"After the period expires, We'll decide whether to extend the
service based on the practical situation and the Macedonian
government's request," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee further said the ROC will seek feasible ways to help improve
communications services in refugee camps in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation arrived in Macedonia on Wednesday, bringing
with it US$2 million worth of relief goods, including foods,
clothing, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, blankets and many
other daily necessities.</P>
      <P>Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov said on Thursday
that the ROC delegation has offered enormous assistance for the
refugees.</P>
      <P>"This is a proof that the development of relations and

first resident envoy to the ROC. Modanu, who speaks fluent Chinese,
will leave for Taipei soon to arrange for the opening of the

      <P>For his part, ROC Vice Foreign Minister Lee said his mission
represents a symbol of the sympathies of the 21 million Taiwan people

      <P>The Republic of China is willing to
consider assisting in reconstruction of Kosovo, a war-torn Yugoslav
province neighboring the ROC ally of Macedonia, ROC Vice Foreign
Minister David Lee said here on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee arrived in Skopje earlier this week at the head of a
90-member delegation to offer humanitarian aid to a large number of
ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Lee told a news conference here that the ROC has not received
any request for providing shelter to ethnic Albanian refugees. "We
think it is better for the Albanian refugees to stay in countries or
areas close to their homeland."</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC has so far offered some US$5 million in cash
donations, medical equipment, foods, clothing and other daily
necessities to help relieve ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo.</P>
      <P>This is the first time in the ROC's diplomatic history that
Taiwan has sent a large group of medical professionals and
volunteers to take part in overseas humanitarian relief work.</P>
      <P>Lee presided over the inaugural ceremony for a field hospital
established with the ROC's assistance at the Stenkovec refugee camp
in Macedonia. Stenkovec is the largest refugee camp in Macedonia,
sheltering about 25,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Twenty-six medical professionals and dozens of volunteers from

    <HEADLINE>NO POLITICAL HIGH RISK IN TAIWAN INVESTMENTS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investing in Taiwan is not politically
risky, even though next year the country will hold a presidential
election while facing lingering cross-strait relation issues, said
Tien Hung-mao, president of the Institute for National Policy
Research, on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tien's remark, was made during the second day of a two-day
seminar dubbed "Access to Asia." The seminar is sponsored by the
Pensions 2000 Corp. of the United States.</P>
      <P>Tien pointed out that most Taiwan voters are treading a middle of
the road line, meaning that even if the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) were to gain power, they would not
declare independence.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democratization process during the past 10 years has
been peaceful and stable, with of the few violent confrontations that
occurred in other countries during their experience with democracy,
said Tien.</P>
      <P>He also introduced to the 100-plus US retirement fund executives
and managers, the various political parties in Taiwan, as well as the
political intentions of the presidential hopefuls in the forthcoming
election.</P>
      <P>On the issues regarding cross-strait relations, which most of the
foreign fund trusts managers were concerned about, Tien stressed that
both Taipei and Beijing have learned a lesson from the missile crisis
across the Taiwan Strait in 1996, thus eliminating a repeat
occurrence.</P>
      <P>Toeing a moderate line to avoid being considered as partisan or
radical has become the trend for modern Taiwan presidential hopefuls
as that is the voters choice, remarked Tien.</P>
      <P>Therefore, leaders of the opposition party, either former Taipei
mayor Chen Shui-bian who is widely believed to be the DPP's
presidential candidate for the 2000 election, or Hsu Hsin-liang, the
DPP's former chairman and other presidential hopeful, are
both adjusting their political stances, the scholar further analyzed.</P>
      <P>If the DPP won the presidential election, it would not declare
Taiwan's independence, as that would be an excuse for the Chinese
mainland to assault Taiwan, Tien observed. He assured his audience
not to worry about that possibility.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S WTO BID SURPASSES M'LAND'S: BOFT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Board of Foreign Trade director Chen
Ruey-long said on Friday that Taiwan is making far more progress in
gaining entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) than mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Despite the concessions made by mainland Premier Zhu Rongji
during his US visit resulting in great progress for a mainland WTO
entry bid, Taiwan's preparations and progress is superior, Chen
insisted.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement at a public hearing held by legislator
Chin Huei-chu at the Legislative Yuan concerning Taiwan's reaction to
Zhu's US visit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's grounds for WTO entry bid are clear and its application
should not be hampered by political factors as long as it meets WTO
requirements, said Chen.</P>
      <P>"We will insist the WTO handle Taiwan's bid separately from that
of the mainland's," noted Chen.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-shun, Director of North America Affairs Dept. under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pointed out that he believed Taiwan will
remain an important trade partner to the US despite the mainland's
opening of markets. The result would be that trade between Taiwan and
the US is likely to be partially replaced by US trade with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Professor of international trade Chiang Cheng-tze from Soochow
University indicated that the government should assist Taiwan
enterprises in strengthening their competitiveness to survive the
challenges to be brought by Taiwan's entry into the WTO.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew said in the Legislative Yuan that
the government would seriously weigh the issue on opening direct
trade, postal and transportation, the so-called "three links" with
mainland China if the two economies were to be admitted into the
global economic organization at the same time.</P>
      <P>Answering questions raised by legislators, Siew said there was no
specific schedule for Taiwan's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>Regarding imported agricultural products, Chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture Pong Tzuo-kuei said import
duties will be slashed from the present 20 percent to 14 percent once
Taiwan is admitted and then to 12 percent the next year.</P>
      <P>Yet farmers' interests will be protected as the government will
set quotas for sensitive products such as rice and garlic, said Pong.

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CAUTIOUS ABOUT FIVE-DAY WORK WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday that a
proposal to fully implement a five-day work week in the government
sector needs further study and evaluation to avoid a negative impact
on the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>Siew said the proposed measure will have a far-reaching impact on
other sectors. He argued that the issue must be fully assessed before
the legislature moves to approve the proposal.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while fielding questions at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the three major political parties -- the ruling
Kuomintang, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party and the New
Party -- reached consensus earlier in the day on amending current
laws to allow the full implementation of the scheme beginning on Jan.
1, 2000.</P>
      <P>The five-day work week scheme is not compulsory in Taiwan at
present, and each sector is free to decide how many days its workers
can be off during a week in order to maintain a competitive edge.
Public servants have enjoyed the treatment twice a month since early
last year.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD),
Taiwan's highest economic planning agency, said the full
implementation of the five-day work week scheme should be realized
step by step, and that the right time should be when Taiwan's
per-capita income hits US$20,000.</P>
      <P>According to a CEPD analysis, Taiwan's economic growth will drop
by 0.09 percent for each additional day off by workers, and wage
costs will increase by 0.35 percent as a result. In other words, the
full implementation of the five-day work week scheme will bring
Taiwan's economy down 1.2 percent annually as it produces an
additional 13 holidays every year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the business community, including the Chinese National
Federation of Industries and the ROC General Chamber of Commerce
(GCC), have voiced strong opposition to the plan citing concern over
a persistent domestic financial crisis and a serious labor shortage.</P>
      <P>GCC Chairman Wang You-theng said the scheme cannot be applied
rashly at a time when Taiwan is seeking to upgrade its
international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>GCC Deputy Secretary-General Y. H. Kuo said the 140 business
groups belonging to the GCC all oppose the legislature's plan to
promote the full five-day work week scheme.</P>
      <P>Kuo stressed that the lawmakers should have discussed the issue
with the private sector rather than moving directly toward an
amendment because a full implementation will increase the pressure
on local industries which are still battling the Asian financial
crisis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US  SAID  PRESSING TAIWAN FOR OPENING HEAVY MOTORCYCLE MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
Lin Yi-fu said on Friday that Taiwan will take appropriate measures
to deal with a possible US demand that Taiwan allows imports of
US-made 150 c.c. and other heavy motorcycles.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports of US-made heavy motorcycles were not inlcuded
in the agenda of the bilateral negotiations on the island's bid to
enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) which concluded early last
year.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on reports that the US is pressing Taiwan
to open up its heavy motorcycle markets, Lin said that the US did
made the demand before, but has not repeated it in recent talks with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wishes to begin multilateral WTO negotiations in May,
during which, Lin said, the US may raise the issue again.</P>
      <P>Lin said MOEA is considering the feasibility of allowing the
heavy motorcycle imports beginning July 1 of next year, January 1,
2001 or two years after the ROC enters the WTO.</P>
      <P>The ROC government will put out feelers concerning trade issues
that other WTO member countries might raise through the ROC's
representative offices abroad.</P>
      <P>The opening up of heavy motorcycle imports involves questions
such as the Environmental Protection Administration's exhaust
standards, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lin added that if the US were to repeat the demand, related
government agencies would need to hold cross-agency meetings to
discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>If the ROC were to open up motorcycle imports to the US, other
WTO member countries might also be allowed to export their
motorcycles into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's motorcycle industry hopes the government will come up
with a specific timetable so they can bring forth counter solutions.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Council of Agriculture (COA) on
Friday passed a regulation stating that owners of pet dogs must
register with the authorities.</P>
      <P>According to the system, dog owners are obliged to pay NT$4,800
(US$146) for each registration, with a discount -- NT$1,200
(US$36.53) for each ligated pet dog, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>The registration is a one-time payment, they explained.</P>
      <P>The COA officials noted that as soon as the system is put into
effect those who refuse to follow will be fined from NT$2,000 to
NT$10,000 per report.</P>
      <P>The registration process includes implanting an identification
chip, establishing a household file and issuing a pet ID. If the
owner losses the pet, a report must be filed with the pet
administration within five days. A heavy punishment will be imposed
on owners who abandon their pets deliberately.</P>
      <P>The COA officials noted that the registration system will
initially only cover dogs, with cats to be included in the next
stage.</P>
      <P>There are now some one million pet dogs in Taiwan, COA statistics
show. In the first year of the act, about 200,000 pet dogs are
expected to be recorded, the COA said.</P>

      <P>Mainland China should heed calls for a
quick, peaceful and diplomatic solution to the problem in the South
China Sea and refrain from taking steps that increase tension in the
area, Malacanang said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a press statement, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said
however, there has been no official information that mainland China
intends to build up its military capability in the disputed area.</P>
      <P>"The Philippines has not been officially informed of any security
estimates by foreign governments regarding the intention of mainland
China vis-a-vis the South China Sea," Barican said.</P>
      <P>He said the policy of the Philippine government is still to
pursue peaceful efforts on a bilateral as well as multilateral basis
in resolving the territorial dispute.</P>
      <P>Quoting Pentagon sources, a newspaper reported Friday that
mainland China intends to expand its military presence in the
Spratlys within the next five years and develop Mischief Reef as its
command headquarters and control facility for air and naval forces.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has constructed permanent structures at Mischief
Reef, which is within the 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone
of the Philippines. The Philippines calls the disputed reef
Panganiban Reef</P>
      <P>Barican said any attempt by any party to increase the military
tension in the disputed islands would have grave repercussions in the
region. "The South China Sea is a major international waterway and
there are several claimant countries in the area," he said.</P>
      <P>The Spratlys are claimed wholly or in part by mainland China, the

      <P>The Philippines fared better than its
neighbors in parrying the effects of the Asian financial crisis that
battered the region starting in mid-1997, according to a survey
sponsored by the World Bank and published by Asiaweek in its April
16, 1999.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was conducted by national economic agencies and
business associations, covered 3,710 business firms, the bulk of
which are engaged in manufacturing. Of these companies, 816 are in
Indonesia, 814 in Malaysia, 659 in Thailand, 857 in South Korea, and
564 in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Salient points of the survey were released Friday to Malacanang
reporters by Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that among the five countries, Indonesia was
worst hit in production capacity decline, with production falling by
21 percent between 1996 to 1998.</P>
      <P>The Philippines suffered the least, with a capacity contraction
of 9 percent, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>On liquidity problems, only one third of the companies reported
any major problems in cover interest payments and operational costs
with cash flow.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the Philippines reported the fewest
liquidity problems, 23.3 percent. The Philippines likewise had the
second lowest number of illiquid (39.1 percent) and insolvent (6.1
percent) companies.</P>
      <P>As to the impact of lower revenues on liquidity, three quarters
of the companies surveyed cited lower revenues as a significant cause
of their liquidity problems.</P>
      <P>In this respect, according to the survey, the Philippines was the
second least hit at 67.5 percent, with Thailand as the worst hit at
81.0 percent.</P>
      <P>In an accompanying article, Asiaweek quoted secretary Benjamin
Diokno of the Department of Budget and Management as saying that the
Philippines expects to register a growth of 3 percent in gross
national product (GNP) this year.

prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and that it also serves as a
shield to deter potential regional conflicts.</P>
      <P>Chuang said the next round of bilateral fishery discussions will
be conducted in Taipei since the last round was held in Tokyo last
November. But he added that the two sides have yet to set a precise
date.</P>
      <P>Despite the lack of formal diplomatic relations, Taiwan maintains
very close trade relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports to Japan totaled US$2.71 billion in the first
quarter of 1999, up 14.5 percent from the same period a year ago,
while Japanese imports to Taiwan hit US$6.82 billion during the same
three months, down 3.5 percent on an annual basis, leaving
Taiwan with a trade deficit of US$4.11 billion, down 12 percent from
the corresponding period in 1998.</P>
      <P>ROC trade officials stationed in the Tokyo representative office
estimated that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan will drop by about
10 percent for the whole of 1999 from last year's level of US$17.8
billion based on the figure posted in the first three month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China (ROC) President Lee
Teng-hui is more than willing to meet Wang Daohan, the Chairman of
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), said an official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the MAC, said that President Lee
would act as a personal guide for Wang during his visit to the island
in the fall.</P>
      <P>Sheu made the remarks in response to a report by the local United
Daily News on Friday that Wang told the Hong Kong-based
Chinese-language Yazhou Zhoukan (Asia Weekly) that he would like to
see President Lee during his proposed trip.</P>
      <P>Wang's interview will be published in the latest edition of
Yazhou Zhoukan, said the United Daily News.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of ARATS'
Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), told the
Legislative Yuan on Friday that Beijing's delay in confirming a date
for Wang's visit jeopardizes the arrangement of his Taiwan
schedule.</P>
      <P>Political leaders usually have their schedule of events set
months in advance, and it will be hard to arrange extra meetings on

      <P>In a unrelated development, ARATS politely denied the SEF's
demand to negotiate on several issues on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a response to the SEF's April 2 letter, ARATS stalled the
SEF's demand to send Jan to Beijing in April for negotiations on
cooperation in stopping crime and smuggling across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOTS OF DEBATES NEEDED BEFORE FIVE-DAY WORK WEEK IMPLEMENTED: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A great deal of debate is needed before a
five-day work week program can be fully implemented in the government
sector, and both those for and against the idea have voiced strong
opinions on the matter.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers from the New Party (NP) and the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) reached a consensus Friday, pushing for the
full implementation of a five-day work week in the government sector
beginning Jan. 1, 2000.</P>
      <P>Almost all related agencies of the administration voiced
opposition to a quick implementation of the program.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said the program will have a far-reaching
impact on all sectors involved, adding that it should not be carried
out impetuously before national and social conditions mature.</P>
      <P>Wei Chi-lin, director-general of the Central Personnel
Administration, said an impetuous implementation of the program will
further aggravate unemployment in Taiwan, which is currently poised
for a rebound.</P>
      <P>Wei said he believes the five-day work week is a correct
direction and a world trend, but a hasty implementation on Jan. 1,
2000 is tantamount to "killing the hen for its eggs."</P>
      <P>He said he is also opposed to making a timetable for its
implementation, saying that the program's start should be decided by
the market, rather than by the government.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yin Chi-ming said that with
Taiwan's overall international competitiveness and domestic
productivity not yet having reached the standards of a developed
country, the full-scale implementation of a five-day work week would
only result in domestic businesses' relocating overseas.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said that if the five-day work week is fully implemented next
year, the number of holidays will increase by 14 days to 111 days,
making the Republic of China the nation with the most holidays in the
world.</P>
      <P>The CEPD official said Taiwan's economic growth would drop by
0.09 percent for each additional day workers have off, while wages
would increase by 0.35 percent. In other words, the full
implementation of a five-day work week program will bring Taiwan's
economy down 1.26 percent annually as it produces an additional 14
holidays every year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the nationwide Chinese National Federation of
Industries, which has 140 industrial associations around Taiwan as
its members, voiced strong opposition to hasty implementation of the
program, saying that the program, aimed at cutting the average weekly
working hours from the current 44 to 40, is poised to increase the
businesses' personnel costs by 10 percent to 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Hsin Ping-lung, a senior researcher at the Chung-Hua Institute
for Economic Research, a private economic think-tank, said that
Japan's experience with the implementation of a five-day work week
has shown that while wages do increase initially, they are eventually
offset by increases in work efficiency and a higher degree of
automation.</P>
      <P>Newly released statistics from the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) indicate that Taiwan people spent a
total of NT$71.8 billion (US$2.17 billion) on leisure activities in
1998 -- a year in which the government sector began following a work
schedule that contained two five-day work weeks per month.</P>
      <P>Spending on leisure activities in 1998 was 7.5 percent higher
than in 1996 and 2.9 percent higher than in 1997. The amount spent on
movies in Taiwan grew by a whopping 18.5 percent in 1998 compared
with 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition, the statistics also showed that visits to Taiwan's
110 major tourist attractions increased 3.6 percent in 1998 to 66.77
million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the occupancy rates of Taiwan's tourist hotels rose by
24.5 percent in 1998 to 2.44 million guests.</P>
      <P>All the rising figures represent increased revenues and expansion
in the domestic service and travel industries, DGBAS officials noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HUMANITARIAN RELIEF MISSION RETURNS FROM MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    April    17   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ROC humanitarian relief
delegation returned to Taipei on Saturday after a visit to Macedonia
to express concern and offer assistance to ethnic Albanian refugees
from neighboring war-torn Yugoslav province of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Lee, who headed the delegation, said
the group has satisfactorily completed its mission of assisting
Kosovar refugees and the ROC ally of Macedonia.</P>
      <P>During its three-day stay in Macedonia, Lee said, the delegation
also met with many Macedonian officials to discuss feasible ways to
further boost bilateral friendship and cooperation.</P>
      <P>A 27-member medical team, composed of medical professionals and
volunteers, still stay in Macedonia to operate a field hospital
donated by the Republic of China. The field hospital is installed at
the Strenkovec refugee camp, which shelter about 25,000 Kosovar
refugees.</P>
      <P>Lee said even though the group only made a brief stay in
Macedonia, its visit still attracted much attention from Macedonian
people.</P>
      <P>Lee himself gave interviews to many news organizations,
including Macedonian television stations, Japan's Kyodo news agency
and Associated Press, during his stay in Macedonia to explain to the
international community the ROC's humanitarian relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Lee told the foreign press that the ROC has so far not received
any request for sheltering ethnic Albanian refugees, but he added
that the ROC is willing to consider assisting in reconstruction of
Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Lee said the medical team will stay in Macedonia for two to
three weeks. Asked whether the ROC government will launch another
round of humanitarian assistance to Kosovar refugees, Lee said it
won't be decided until Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski
makes an official visit to Taiwan in May.</P>
      <P>Georgievski is expected to sigh three economic cooperation and
investment protection agreements with Taiwan during his upcoming
visit.</P>
      <P>The ROC has so far offered about US$5 million in cash donations,
medical equipment, foods, clothing and other daily necessities to
help Kosovar refugees in Macedonia. The ROC forged formal diplomatic
ties with the Balkan state in January this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the six legislators who took part in the humanitarian
relief journey, issued a joint statement upon their return, saying
that the ROC should work even harder to boost trade, economic,
educational, cultural, tourist and medical exchanges with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macedonia's political and social situation remains
stable despite the influx of a large amount of Kosovar refugees, the
lawmakers said Macedonia welcomes ROC investments to help revitalize
its economy.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers from both ruling and opposition parties said they
will push the Legislative Yuan to set up a special panel to boost
relations with Macedonian parliamentarians.</P>

      <P>The remaining issues will be dealt with by officials of the two
countries in Beijing before the end of April, Zhu said. Chretien
wants to keep the momentum going so both governments can conclude
negotiations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Before Zhu's visit to Canada, officials from the two nations
reached agreement on market access for agricultural and industrial
goods, including a number of chemicals, minerals and farm products.</P>
      <P>The two countries also agreed that mainland China's management of

    <HEADLINE>BREAKTHROUGH IN CANCER DETECTION AND TREATMENT REPORTED (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US-based researcher who has made a
breakthrough in cancer treatment has reported that his new treatment
targets only specific cancer cells and spares normal cells.</P>
      <P>Paul O.P. Ts'o, an academician of Academia Sinica, the highest
research institute in Taiwan, reported the breakthrough at the fourth
Taiwan Joint Cancer Conference held at Veterans General Hospital in
Taipei on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ts'o, a professor at Johns Hopkins University in the United
States, noted that current anti-cancer drugs kill normal cells as
well as cancer cells, which results in damaging side effects for
cancer patients.</P>
      <P>But Ts'o's method uses a specific ligand, or carrier, that can
identify the receptors of particular cancer cells and attack them,
cutting to the minimum the drug's toxicity and side effects.</P>
      <P>Ts'o has begun to develop anti-hepatitis and anti-hepatoma drugs,
using specific ligand that carry the drugs to the liver, pass
through the receptors of the liver cell membrane and enter into the
liver cell itself. By doing so it suppresses the production of
specific genes or enzymes that might influence the growth of diseases
or drug resistance.</P>
      <P>He said that he has conducted animal trials of these new
treatment approaches in the United States and has obtained very
positive results so far. The absorption of anti-cancer drugs into the
livers of mice was enhanced by three to four fold with ligand as
compared with the anti-cancer drugs without ligand.</P>
      <P>He said that he is now planning to conduct trials on large
animals, and will then monitor the effects of different drugs and
different carriers or ligands.</P>
      <P>He also announced the development of a procedure that allows
researchers to separate and identify the origins of particular cancer
cells within the blood. With the assistance of his colleagues in
America, he has developed a procedure that relies on multiple tumor
markers and automated microscopes to obtain valuable cancer
information that cannot be obtained through other means.</P>
      <P>He said that the method offers an alternative, non-invasive means
of early detection of distant metastasis, such as prostate cancer,
stomach cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer.</P>
      <P>This method has been developed in the United States and is
currently under clinical observation by major cancer centers and
institutes to obtain enough clinical data for commercialization, he
reported.</P>
      <P>He pointed out the deficiencies of traditional diagnostic
methods, saying that tumors that can be detected by X-rays or other
imaging instruments already contain millions of cancer cells, while
available tests on certain tumor markers within the blood are not
always accurate.</P>
      <P>The most reliable diagnosis is to conduct a biopsy of the suspect
tissue or organ, but this method usually requires surgery, except in
the case of the cervical smears examined to detect cervical cancer,
he said.</P>
      <P>Faced with the difficulty of early detection, Ts'o has worked
with several medical schools and cancer centers in the United States
to develop an automated microscope that separates and identifies
cancer cells circulating within the bloodstream. With the microscope,
the presence of as few as 500 to 1,000 cancer cells in the blood can
be detected.</P>
      <P>He said that the method should be very useful for types of cancer
that are difficult to diagnose in their early stages, such as
pancreatic, ovarian, lung, stomach and prostate cancer.</P>
      <P>Other types of cancer, such as breast cancer, can be detected
using traditional methods of detection, so the new method will not
necessarily be any better than traditional ones. But this method will
offer physicians an powerful follow-up or monitoring tool to check
for the recurrence of cancer in an area that has recently undergone
treatment.</P>
      <P>Ts'o said that his method could be useful in three areas: early
detection of cancer; checking for the recurrence of cancer soon after
a patient has undergone surgery or radiotherapy; and the assessment
of anti-cancer drug efficacy. If a drug does not have a sufficient
therapeutic effect, it can be changed for another type of drug,
enabling physicians to ensure that the drugs are not used
incorrectly, that the correct dosage of the drugs are given and that
no resistance to the drugs can develop.

      <P>He noted that the procedure is currently available in the United

can be obtained within two days. Ts'o also said he is contemplating
introducing the new detection technology to Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>Ts'o said that early detection of cancer has been made possible
through the development of the automated microscope, which he
recently learned has won the Computerworld Smithsonian Award of 1999.</P>

golf tournament, which includes several competitions in the southern
mainland Chinese cities of Fuzhou and Guilin, beginning April 15.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS are intermediary bodies authorized by the
Republic of China government and Beijing to handle exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait in the absence of formal contacts between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>A brief reply was finally received Friday, after the start of the
tournament. Although ARATS in its reply did not explicitly deny Chang
permission to enter the mainland, it did say the Guilin competition
had been canceled because "nobody registered to enter the contest"
and that the golf tournament was an "interior" activity among Taiwan
business people in mainland China.</P>
      <P>But after checking with the sponsors of the tournament, SEF
officials learned that the competitions in both Fuzhou and Guilin
were being held as scheduled, SEF officials said.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow called the
reply unbelievable, saying that it was regrettable that ARATS has
boycotted cross-strait exchanges with political measures.</P>
      <P>Shi also said he is increasingly worried about the welfare of
Taiwan business people operating in mainland China, adding that they
could face the threat of a "red terror."</P>
      <P>SEF again called for ARATS to respect the four points of
agreement reached by both sides during a meeting between SEF Chairman
C.F. Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan in Shanghai last year. One of
the agreements was that both agencies would help each other in
arranging for visits by SEF and ARATS personnel to the other side as
a way of improving relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASHINGTON URGED TO HELP TAIWAN'S ENTRY INTO WORLD FINANCIAL BODIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fredrick Chien, president of the
Control Yuan of the Republic of China, urged Washington on Friday to
assist Taiwan's entry into international organizations, especially
financial ones.</P>
      <P>Ever since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) by the
US Congress 20 years ago in April 1979, relations between Taipei and
Washington have experienced twists and turns, said Chien.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, however, the US government has taken the TRA
rather seriously, though Washington needs to play a more active role
in helping Taiwan to participate in international financial
organizations, he said.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks when he attended a meeting with reporters
from the Chinese-language news media in Washington. The US
government's executive branch also mentioned this point when it
reviewed its China policy several years ago, added Chien.</P>
      <P>The former minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China
still holds that the level of Taiwan's mainland policy is ranked
higher than its foreign policy.</P>
      <P>There are priorities in foreign policy that are not likely to
have a direct impact on the welfare and security of the Taiwan people
-- whether they are performed well or not, explained Chien. But a
wrong step or direction in Taiwan's mainland policy could result in
an irrational response from Beijing that would harm Taiwan people's
safety and well-being, he added.</P>
      <P>As to reports indicating that proposals have been made that both
sides of the Taiwan Strait reach a non-aggression agreement prior to
final reunification, Chien noted that such an agreement could be
termed as either a transitional or provisional agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's largest opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
has become more rational in recent years, and its stance on many
issues has become closer to that of the ruling Kuomintang, observed
Chien.</P>
      <P>He concluded his conversion with the Chinese reporters by calling
on overseas Chinese to support the Republic of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TO KEEP CLOSE WATCH ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES: AIT CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  16  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will keep a close
watch on the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait in
the months ahead, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman
Richard Bush said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The top American liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of
official diplomatic ties made the statement at a seminar marking the
20th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), the US law
governing substantive relations with Taiwan. The two-day seminar was
held at the Flutcher School of Law and Diplomacy in suburban Boston.</P>
      <P>Bush said in his speech, titled the US role in the Taiwan Strait
issue, that the United States looks forward to see the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait develop a practical, constructive engagement
formula and framework to reduce tension.</P>
      <P>Bush reiterated the five US basic stances on cross-strait issues:
cross-strait problems should be resolved by peaceful means; the two
sides should conduct constructive dialogue to mend differences;
cross-strait issues should be resolved by Chinese people themselves
as the United States will not act as a go-between; the United States
will deal with cross-strait dialogue with an impartial attitude; and
cross-strait agreements should be acceptable to both sides of the
strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States believes the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can cultivate a good atmosphere and mutual trust with
their wisdom to improve bilateral relations, Bush said reducing
cross-strait tension is the first step to the long haul of resolving
bilateral disputes.</P>
      <P>But went on to say that the United Strait also insists that any
solution to cross-strait disputes must be approved by the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Shaw Yu-ming, deputy
secretary-general of the Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang, said
Taiwan's democratic achievements indicate that Chinese people can
enjoy democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>"We believe Taiwan's achievements can inspire mainland China's
democratic evolution," Shaw stressed, adding that he hopes the United
States will use every possible opportunity to convince mainland
authorities to undertake democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>Shaw also urged the United States to continue faithfully
implementing the Taiwan Relations Act in order to safeguard Taiwan's
security and democratic way of life.</P>
      <P>"We also hope the United States will discourage mainland China
from engaging in an arms race with Taiwan, assist mainland China in
economic development and instill democratic ideals among mainland
youths," Shaw said, adding that he believes these efforts will be
conducive to maintain mainland China's stability and peaceful
evolution.</P>
      <P>The seminar was moderated by Alan Wachman, a professor at the
Flutcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Former AIT Chairman Nat Bellocchi and more than 20 scholars and
experts from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the United States
took part in the seminar.</P>
      <P>The participants will discuss issues related to Taiwan's
security on Saturday.

    <HEADLINE>TWO PASSPORT FORGERY RINGS BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
on Saturday announced the successful crack of two passport forgery
rings and the arrest of several key suspects involved in the two
cases.</P>
      <P>One of the forgery case, which involved cross-border human
smuggling operations, was busted by the CIB's International
Criminal Affairs Division, while the other was handled by the
bureau's Fourth Investigation Corps.</P>
      <P>The International Criminal Affairs Division said it was tipped
off that a Taiwan-based cross-border human smuggling ring had often
offered high prices to purchase the Republic of China's identity (ID)
cards in Taipei City and Taipei County in recent months.</P>
      <P>The ring allegedly would replace photos on the purchased ID
cards with mainland Chinese people's photos and then commissioned
several large travel services in Taipei to apply for ROC passports
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>With the legally acquired passports, the ring then applied for
visas to Japan and the United States. Afterwards, the ring would
sent all related travel documents to its accomplices in mainland
China's Fujian province by DHL express delivery.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese human smuggling ring then used all those
papers to send prospective mainland migrants to Japan and the United
States via Camboida, Vietnam and Thailand.</P>
      <P>After weeks of monitoring and tracking, CIB agents managed to
detect that the Taiwan ring was operated by Wang Chuan-chen
nicknamed "little Hung."</P>
      <P>CIB agents arrested Wang when he showed up to pick up passports
at a travel agency in Taipei Friday afternoon. They also confiscated
two passports with Japan and US visas as well as several tampered or
falsified ID cards and other documents.</P>
      <P>Wang, 44, confessed to police that he began last June to collude
with two mainland men in mainland China's Fujian province in
conducting illegal cross-border human smuggling by tampering or
forging the ROC's ID cards and other documents. Each passport could
fetch NT$150,000 to NT$200,000. Wang said he had made more than NT$1
million through such operations over the past year.</P>
      <P>In the second case, Chen Jung-teh, 50, was accused of having
stolen ROC passports and sent them to a Singaporean man, nickname
Lao Wong, in Thailand.</P>
      <P>According to CIB officials, Lao Wong would then tamper with
those ROC passports which Chen would sell to prospective mainland
migrants through the assistance mainland China-based human smuggling
rings.</P>
      <P>Chen allegedly could earn US$15,000 by sending each mainland
migrant to Australia or Canada via Thailand or the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Chen allegedly had also tempted several staff members at local
travel agencies to help him secure ROC passports by illegal means.</P>
      <P>CIB investigations show that two large passport theft cases
reported at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taiwan's main
gateway, in July 1998 and January 1999, respectively, were related
to Chen's ring.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said they will make further investigations into
the case in order to arrest other accomplices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTEND FOR BIGGER SHARE OF NATIONAL REVENUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The heads of 21 cities and counties locked
horns with the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung Saturday in a meeting
called by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to discuss the disbursement
of revenue by the central government to local governments.</P>
      <P>Both Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh of the Democratic Progress Party (DPP)
expressed their objections to proposed reductions in the size of
their appropriations from the central government.</P>
      <P>Each year the central government distributes money to city and
county governments, as well as to the special municipalities of
Taipei and Kaohsiung. The funds are obtained through a variety of
taxes and in accordance with a complicated formula.</P>
      <P>Of the amount distributed, 82 percent goes to the special
municipalities and to city and county governments. Twelve percent is
given directly to Taiwan townships, and the central government keeps
for itself the remaining 6 percent.</P>
      <P>The MOF usually gives 47 percent of the amount earmarked for
distribution to the cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung. But this year the
ministry proposed reducing that amount to 41 percent, though no final
decision has been made.</P>
      <P>The proposed reductions for the two municipalities would result
in 41 percent of the revenue to be dispersed going to Taipei and
Kaohsiung and 41 percent to the 21 city and county governments.</P>
      <P>Ma said the proposed reductions would result in a shortage of
NT$10.8 billion in the Taipei City budget. He said it would be
difficult to fill in the gap because the budget plan has already been
prepared and submitted to the city council for debate.</P>
      <P>He accused the central government of pulling the rug out from
under him and reneging on a promise not to cut its financial support
for the city.</P>
      <P>Without the NT$10.8 billion, Ma said, he can hardly deliver on
some of his campaign promises. He accused the central government of
trying to preempt him from fulfilling his promises by cutting off
Taipei's financial means because of his "gentle manner" toward the
authorities.</P>
      <P>He asked during the meeting whether the same thing would have
been done to his predecessor, DPP member Chen Shui-bien. While mayor,
Chen was known for taking a tough line toward the central government,
which is dominated by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh, whose Kaohsiung City government would face a
shortage of NT$3.8 billion under the proposed reductions, suggested
the central government dip into the 6 percent it keeps for itself
rather than "rob Peter to pay Paul."</P>
      <P>The government should dig into its own pocket rather than pit
Taipei and Kaohsiung cities against other local governments, he said.
Hsieh also called the central government to allow local governments,
including Kaohsiung City, to raise their own income by issuing
lotteries.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Paul Chiu rejected Hsieh's suggestion that
the central government should disburse some of the amount it keeps
for itself, saying the central government's 6-percent share is
reserved for emergency use.</P>
      <P>The finance minister called on Ma and Hsieh to take into account
the cash-starved counties and cities under the provincial government,
some of which are so poor that they cannot produce a budget before an
April deadline.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the gap between the two municipalities and the city and
county governments needs to be narrowed.</P>
      <P>Chiu's opinion was supported by the city and county heads present
at the meeting. Some even demanded that they receive 62 percent of
the funds to be dispersed and the municipalities, 20 percent.</P>
      <P>No conclusion was reached during the meeting, which Chiu said
would be the final one with local government heads. He said his
ministry would work out a formula and present it to the Cabinet for a
final decision.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  16 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan would be glad to see mainland
China admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO), but the
applications of Taipei and Beijing for WTO membership should not be
linked together, a government spokesman said in Chicago Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the East Asian Studies
Center of Chicago University, Chen Chien-jen, director general of the
Government Information Office, said WTO membership for Beijing may
help open the mainland Chinese market to the products of the United
States, Taiwan, and other countries in the world.</P>
      <P>Both Taipei and Beijing have applied for admission to the WTO.
Taipei has refuted Beijing's claim that Taiwan should not join the
trade organization before mainland China. Taiwan believes it is
better qualified for WTO membership than mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen told the seminar that their applications are not related in
any way, and should be processed separately.</P>
      <P>The seminar was held on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of
the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>Chen also said in the seminar that the TRA is a unique US law,
which has contributed greatly to the maintenance of stability and
peace in the Asian Pacific area.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the law was prompted by the US decision to
switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing on Jan. 1,
1979. The act was passed by US Congress in March, 1979 and signed
into law by former US President Jimmy Carter in the next month.</P>
      <P>The TRA provides a solid legal foundation for the development of
substantive relations between Taiwan and the United States, Chen
added.</P>

      <P>An academic survey on the sexual culture

all of those surveyed have heard dirty jokes, though boys have more
often told them than girls.</P>
      <P>Lee Lan, a professor of public health at National Taiwan
University interviewed 10 student groups in their first year at San
Ming Junior High School in Taipei last year on issues related to sex.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of the 1,500 students polled said they have
told dirty jokes, with 67 percent of the boys and 57 percent of the
girls saying they have told such jokes.</P>
      <P>Most of the jokes they reported hearing came from their
classmates, while teachers, comic books, TV programs, newspapers and
the Internet were also cited as sources. Some teachers tell the jokes
to enliven their classes, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Most of the boys surveyed said they enjoyed hearing dirty jokes,
though a few said they were disgusted by them. Most of the girls
interviewed said they would laugh if the jokes were funny.</P>
      <P>The survey also revealed that students who tell dirty jokes tend
to be popular, and it found that junior-high-school students in
Taipei are exposed to an environment filled with sexual-related
information.</P>
      <P>Thirty-eight percent of those interviewed, or 50 percent of the
boys and 32 percent of the girls, said they have come into contact
with "erotic products," such as pornographic videos and magazines.</P>
      <P>But boys usually said it was entirely by accident that they did
so, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Those surveyed said the products typically came in the form of
television shows, videotapes, comic books, magazines, movies, video
compact discs (VCDs) and the Internet, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The survey also revealed that 4.8 percent of the

      <P>Taiwan's semi-conductor industry has
started showing signs of recovery as the global economic climate for
the industry gradually resumes, sources reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Influenced by the recovery, downstream industries of the
semi-conductor industry such as wafer packing and IC lead frame
manufacturing also received more orders amid expanded market demand.</P>
      <P>Several IC lead frame producing companies showed negative figures
in their account books for the first quarter of this year, a
consequence of last year's economic recession. Yet these companies
are planning to adjust prices upward by 5 percent as demand is buoyed
by a recovering economy and the price move is accepted by IC lead
frame buyers.</P>
      <P>All the companies surveyed anticipate earning a profit or at
least not incurring a serious deficit in 1999.</P>
      <P>Apart from the revitalized semi-conductor market, some IC lead
frame producing companies also are seeking an increase in corporate
capital to expand productivity.</P>
      <P>Due to Taiwan companies' efficiency and quality in wafer OEM

corporations such as MII and Sumitomo, are planning to set up IC
lead frame manufacturing companies in Taiwan to enhance

    <HEADLINE>QUAYLE WARNS BEIJING AGAINST USE OF FORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 17 (CNA): Former United States (US) Vice
President Dan Quayle said Saturday that it would be a serious mistake
on the part of the People's Republic of China to make a military
invasion on Taiwan. But he did not say whether he would commit
American forces to defend Taiwan if he were president.</P>
      <P>When asked on the CNN program "Evans, Novak, Hunt &amp; Shields"
whether he would be willing to commit American forces if the PRC
threatened Taiwan, the recently announced candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination replied that "I have told the
Chinese, privately -- and they know my views on that, if I become
president. And they know that it would be a serious mistake on their
part if....."</P>
      <P>Co-host Al Hunt then said: "And you would commit American
forces."</P>
      <P>Quayle responded that "I am saying it would be a serious mistake
on the PRC's part to have a military invasion of Taiwan. The PRC is
concerned about Taiwan declaring independence. I am not encouraging
Taiwan to declare independence, I don't think that they should
declare independence.</P>
      <P>"But Taiwan is a democratic entity, they have an independence
party, that independence party might take over someday, and there is
a hypothetical possibility that they might declare independence.</P>
      <P>"It would not be wise on their part, but that the PRC has got to
realize that the dispute between the PRC and Taiwan will be resolved
peacefully. You have to say that quietly, firmly, and they have to
understand that you mean business," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanhile, the former vice president still does not think Beijing
should be admitted to the World Trade Organization now.</P>
      <P>When asked would he also deny the PRC permanent most favored
nation trading status, Quayle said he thinks that the United States
has to deal with this issue on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>"China is not ready for the WTO. They may be someday, and someday
we'd like to have them there because we'd like to have a mediation of
trade disputes, but they clearly are not ready, and it would take a
waiver, as you well know, of Jackson-Vanning (clause of banning free
trade with several Communist countries) and the Congress before they
could be admitted to the WTO," said Quayle.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the United States should not give the PRC
permanent MFN status, adding that "I believe that this should be
reviewed on an annual basis because we have a real challenge with
China, and the challenge with China is on a number of fronts, not
just on human rights."</P>
      <P>"The religious persecution issue is serious. The proliferation
issue, the proliferation of technology, high technology, technology
that can be used with weapons of mass destruction to Pakistan, to
Iran and some other nations that raise grave concerns with us, and
also we have the very sensitive issue of Taiwan. The PRC clearly has
its sights on Taiwan. Taiwan is now ready for the admission to World
Trade Organization," said Quayle.</P>
      <P>The latest USA Today/CNN Gallup poll of Republicans' choice for
the presidential nomination shows that Quayle ranked third with seven
percent of support, lagging far behind Texas Governor George W. Bush,
with 53 percent, and former Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole, 16
percent. But Quayle remains confident that he will defeat Vice
President Al Gore, the favorite Democratic candidate, to win the 2000
presidential election.

    <HEADLINE>HELMS' BILL WILL AFFECT CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 17 (CNA): The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
recently introduced by US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms (R-NC) is a very serious bill and will cause far-reaching
changes in the cross-strait situation, said an American China expert
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Robert G. Sutter, a senior specialist in International Politics,
Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade Division of the Congressional
Research Service, told a conference on Chinese studies here that the
Act will effectively deal with a situation in which the security of
Taiwan is threatened due to the imbalance of military power across
the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Even if this bill does not win support from the Clinton
administration, Washington will have to take some appropriate
measures in response to the threat against Taiwan, said Sutter.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act will require enhanced
military exchanges between the US and Taiwan, and ensure that the ROC
has the necessary equipment to maintain her defense, prohibit any
politically motivated reductions in arms sales, and authorize the
sale of a broad array of defense articles, including missile defense
systems, satellite early warning data, diesel submarines and advanced
air-to-air missiles.</P>
      <P>The specialist noted that although the Kosovo crisis might
distract the Congressional attention from the Clinton
administration's China policy, just as the Congress shelved the China
issue for about seven months during the Persian Gulf War, the issue
will last longer and could be used by the Republicans to attack Vice
President Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, Sutter said the outlook is not for a
consensus between the Congress and the administration on the US-China
policy since its critics remain active due to PRC behavior. The
Republican-dominated Congress may continue to press for a tougher US
policy towards Beijing, but he does not believe critics will be able
to rupture the relationship.</P>
      <P>Professor Kao Ying-mao of Brown University pointed out that there
seems to be a tremendous confidence crisis across the Taiwan Strait,
and Taiwan will not enter into political negotiations with mainland
China unless the safety and security of Taiwan are guaranteed by the
United States. Thus, he said, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
co-sponsored by Helms and Sen. Robert Toricelli (D-NJ) in late March,
is very important.</P>
      <P>David Laux, president of the USA-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council,
said the people of the United States and the world do not fully
understand the strength and importance of Taiwan's economy. In fact,
Taiwan is America's 7th largest trading partner and 70 percent of its
huge foreign exchange reserves are held in US dollars, so Taiwan is
very important to the United States.</P>
      <P>The former Taipei Office managing director of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) believed that after helping Taiwan to join
the World Trade Organization, the United States would try to assist
Taiwan in its bid to re-enter such international financial
institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>David Dean, adviser to Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation for
International Scholarly Exchange, said 20 years after its enactment,
the Taiwan Relations Act is still a viable and important American law
protecting Taiwan's security. And the United States will
continue to strive for balanced relations with both sides of the
Strait, leaving the two sides to resolve their differences by
peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Charles Cross and James Lilley, the other two former managing
directors of the AIT Taipei Office, also spoke of their experiences
in establishing strong security, trade and other substantive
relations between the US and Taiwan after President Jimmy Carter
derecognized Taipei in 1979.</P>
      <P>More than 100 scholars and experts in Chinese studies from Taiwan
and the US attended the two-day conference and held other panel
discussions on current problems and future prospects of
Taiwan-mainland China relations, economic development and social
changes in Taiwan, development in mainland China from 1949-1999, as
well as various related subjects.

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA IS TARGET OF HUMAN SMUGGLERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 18 (CNA): Australia, often called the "lucky
country," is a growing target of human smuggling operations
originating in southern mainland China.</P>
      <P>The latest arrivals of illegal migrants in Australia from Fijian
has caused alarm for the Federal and State governments because they
were undetected by Coast watch patrols until they entered remote
towns.</P>
      <P>They were detained after Australian residents near Cairns in
Queensland, Hoffs Harbor in New South Wales and Broome in Western
Australia alerted police, who made the arrests and sent them to a
detention center in Western Australia for questioning and
identification.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard has vowed to heighten surveillance
along Australia's 37,000 km coastal areas.</P>
      <P>Howard admitted that Australia is vulnerable to illegal boatloads
of immigrants because "this is a very big country with a very big
coastline."</P>
      <P>"We have to be realistic about what can be achieved. But I assure
the Australian people that we'll leave no stone unturned to give
ourselves the best surveillance system we can afford," he said.</P>
      <P>But Howard and his Defense Minister John Moore declined to use
the military to crack down on any future illegal migrants, despite
calls by the premiers of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.</P>
      <P>So far at least 100 refugees from Fijian have been detained and
police are looking for more refugees, who may still be at large after
landing in different places over the past two months.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said many of these refugees
were the victims of "snakeheads" operators, who charged each of them
US$25,000-35,000 for the illegal odyssey.</P>
      <P>All these refugees share the same dream of earning lots of money
in their new country so that they could pay back their huge debt,
build houses and lead a better life in mainland China in the future.</P>
      <P>Australia is increasingly a magnet for boat people from Fujian,
the center of mainland China's trade in illegal human cargo,
according to a report by the Australian.</P>
      <P>The daily reported smuggling rings have spirited away a
generation of men and women from villages of coastal China because
the rewards of sneaking into a foreign country are too tempting to
resist.</P>
      <P>It reported money sent back to Fujian province, the capital of
mainland China's illegal emigration industry, is fueling a building
boom and transforming the lives of people who, less than a decade
ago, relied on the soil for their subsistence.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Mark Craig, a risk-management consultant and an
expert in Asian organized crime from Queensland, as saying that
triads who once specialized in heroin dealing are turning to illegal
immigration as a lower-risk source of income.</P>
      <P>He said the outbound traffic in human cargo has been gathering
strength and voracity, run by powerful criminals, known locally as
snakeheads with links to triads that dominate Chinatowns around the
world.</P>
      <P>Young Fujianese will pay upwards of up to US$35,000 for a stake
in the riches offered by countries where, they are told, the streets
are paved with gold.</P>
      <P>Craig estimated the illicit human smuggling trade to the United
States alone at US$3.5 billion a year. He said he has since 1994
publicly warned about the potential for a similar exodus to
Australia.</P>
      <P>Craig, who organized a five-member delegation to visit Fujian
last November, said evidence of smuggling from Fujian has been well
documented in the United States since 1980.</P>

    <HEADLINE>20 PERCENT DECIDED ON PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 22 percent of eligible Taiwan voters
have decided whom to vote for in the 2000 presidential election,
according to a new poll published on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by a poll center at the commission of the
Television Society of the Republic of China, also found that nearly
39 percent of the surveyed are in favor of a specific candidate for
president.</P>
      <P>Among the 39 percent, more than half of them said a major event,
or the exposure of a candidate's impropriety would cause them to
change their minds, while over 30 percent said that they would switch
their support if they are not satisfied with a political platform.</P>
      <P>Amid speculation in local newspapers about who will run together
with whom, the poll showed that nearly 65 percent will continue their
support for a presidential candidate even if they disagree with his
running mate.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 46 percent believe the 2000 presidential
election will be a race between the ruling Kuomintang and the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>On whether the candidates from the third party or without party
affiliation could win, only 15 percent of the polled said yes, while
nearly 64 percent said no. The remaining 21 percent either said they
don't know or didn't answer.</P>
      <P>Professor Pao Chung-ho of National Taiwan University said the
figures show the crucial role party affiliation still plays in
Taiwan presidential elections.</P>
      <P>But other factors, such as the domestic financial situation and
cross-strait relations, which could affect the national interest,
also play a role, Pao said.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted by random calls to eligible voters April
12-13. Effective samples received totaled 1,227 with a margin of
error of 2.8 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A report on national competitiveness
compiled by the International Institute for Management Development
(IMD) ranked Taiwan 18th among 46 countries, sources reported on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan dropped from last year's 16th position to this year's
18th, illustrating the impact of the regional economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Among all 47 countries, the United States ranked at the top of
the list, followed by Asia's Singapore and North Europe's Finland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, mainland China declined from last year's 24th spot to
29th, South Korea, dropped for the fifth consecutive year, to the
38th position from last year's 35th. Indonesia was down to 46th from
40th.</P>
      <P>Russia stayed in the bottom of list while Slovenia, which was
listed for the first time, also ranked 46th.</P>
      <P>In response, Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said that the setbacks for most
Asian countries best illustrated the serious impact of the Asian
economic turmoil.</P>
      <P>Among the comparison items on the IMD list, Taiwan showed
backwardness in business administration, economic power, its
financial system and technological power. Schive said the results
could be attributed to serious loopholes in the financial system and
business administration.</P>
      <P>IMD's report faithfully reflected Taiwan's shortcomings, said
Schive.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in terms of internationalization, infrastructure,
government efficiency and human resources, Taiwan progressed
according to the list. He said the progress was due to the government
aggressively opening its telecommunication markets and promoting
privatization as well as government re-engineering.

Office was opened to the public on Sunday, and despite rainy Taipei
weather, many people were drawn to the normally closed-off office.</P>
      <P>The eighty-year old stately building is situated in downtown
Taipei, and is the symbol of the ROC's highest ruling body.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office has retained a sense of far-off mystery
to the people since Taiwan's age of martial rule when it was closed
to the public. After the martial law was lifted, the Presidential
Office first offered public tours in 1995.</P>
      <P>The bronze statues of President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President
Lien Chan in the hall drew the most crowds as people were eager to
take pictures with the busts.</P>
      <P>As visitors followed the tour route, they saw the President's
office, the reception room, and the Chiehshou Hall, where important
festivities and meetings are held. The north and south courts outside
the building also offered great views.</P>
      <P>The visitors were impressed by the interior of the Presidential
Office, and most thought it was fortunate that ROC leaders had such
wonderful surroundings in which to lead the nation.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office has been opened to the public on several
occasions in the past, resulting in Sunday's somewhat diminished
numbers compared to previous occasions.</P>
      <P>But the visitors were still excited to see the once-forbidden
grounds of the President's office, and thought the experience was
educational and historical.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dueling demonstrators jeered and cheered
mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's arrival in Calgary
Saturday, the Canadian Press said.</P>
      <P>More than 200 people waited for the Chinese premier at a downtown
hotel. A police barricade separated protesters waving Tibetan flags
and shouting "Rongji go home" from supporters who held mainland
Chinese flags and yelled words of welcome, according to the report.</P>
      <P>"He's a leader who cares about the lives and the living standards
of Chinese people so he's doing a lot for Chinese people," it quoted
supporter Sam Chen.</P>
      <P>But Nima Dorjee of the Tibet-Canada committee said Canada should
be ashamed for rolling out the red carpet for Zhu. He was angry that
Calgary Mayor Al Duerr gave Zhu a white hat when he arrived at the
airport.</P>
      <P>"To me the symbol of the white hat is no longer that of peace,
it's no longer that of honor -- it is one that is given to despots
and dictators now," Dorjee was quoted.</P>
      <P>After Tibet's failed 1949 uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai
Lama and 120,000 followers fled their Himalayan homes for what has
become a lifelong exile. Mainland China annexed Tibet after the
revolt.</P>
      <P>Duerr said critics are making too much of the white hat
presentation. "I have never intended for the white hat to be a
political statement. It's a symbol of our hospitality and that's it."</P>
      <P>Zhu attended a dinner with Justice Minister Anne McLellan
Saturday evening. He toured a biotechnology facility before going to
a reception hosted by Alberta Premier Ralph Klein.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The folk deity
Matsu, Goddess of the Sea, left from the Tachia Chenlankung Temple in
Taichung at the start of an eight-day trip to four counties on Sunday.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 worshippers throughout the island will escort
the goddess Matsu on the 280-kilometer tour. The goddess will visit
59 temples in Taichung, Changhua, Yunlin and Chiayi Counties.</P>
      <P>Political figures did not miss the chance to pray to the goddess
and to solicit support from the worshippers.</P>
      <P>The four prospective contenders in next spring's presidential
election, Vice President Lien Chan (Kuomintang), former Taiwan Gov.
James Soong (KMT), former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Hsu
Hsin-liang, and former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian (DPP), were among
the hundreds of thousands of worshippers seeing the goddess off.</P>
      <P>Other prominent political figures in attendance included Taiwan
Gov. Chao Shou-po, Taichung County Magistrate Liao Yung-lai, Taichung
Mayor Chang Wen-ying, and Chiayi Magistrate Lee Ya-ching.</P>
      <P>The Tachia Goddess of the Sea usually makes a patrol trip to
neighboring counties once a year to offer blessings for worshippers,
resulting in a large cultural event throughout central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the customary practice, three firecrackers
were ignited before Matsu left the Chenlankung Temple. They were
ignited respectively by former Taiwan Gov. Soong, Chenlankung Temple
Chairman Yen Ching-piao, and Chen Chi, representative of the
worshippers.</P>
      <P>The four prospective presidential contenders attracted special
attention from the worshippers, and they took advantage of the
opportunity to spell out their political ideals.</P>
      <P>Soong, who is critical of mainstream KMT leadership, told the
media at the temple that the vigorous development of religious
activities implied the people's desire for political cleanness and
stability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK MIDDLE CLASS SUFFERING: ACADEMICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,   central   Taiwan,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore, April 18 (CNA): Hong Kong has become a contentious
society rife with all sorts of highly-vocal interest groups, each
with its own agenda, said two senior Singapore academics.</P>
      <P>"Fanned by a free and sometimes wild press, some interest groups
have become very vocal and assertive," said a report written
jointly by East Asian Institute head Wang Gungwu and research
director John Wong.</P>
      <P>They warned that the worst-affected group would be the middle
class, being the least organized and most divided.</P>
      <P>"As political anxiety over the handover subsided after 1997, the
politics of identity have given way to potential class conflict,"
they noted.</P>
      <P>Before the handover, politics of identity dominated debate in the
British colony, with a clear divide between the "pro-China" and the
"pro-democracy" camps.</P>
      <P>However, after the handover, class struggle has dominated
politics in the Special Administrative Region (SAR), said the report,
a copy of which was obtained by The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>The regional economic crisis, it noted further sharpened class
conflicts among organized labor, business interests and the middle
class.</P>
      <P>"Little organized and badly divided, the middle is set to lose
out," the two academics predicted.</P>
      <P>But they clarified that this did not mean Hong Kong is in a
"state of disarray".</P>
      <P>"People are still highly pragmatic and socially mobile, and life
is still organized around the practical aspects of making money,"
they said.</P>
      <P>The point to be made was that when a deeply-divided society is in
crisis, it is difficult for its government to mobilize political and
social consensus or introduce tough policies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the SAR faces a double challenge: It not only has to
stay competitive as a global city, but it also has to fulfill its
long-term strategic need of staying relevant to mainland China.</P>
      <P>"If Hong Kong were to slowly deteriorate into just another
Chinese city, its very survival would be at stake," the paper said.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the territory has developed a viable economic
symbiosis with southern mainland, which will grow more important
after the current recession.</P>
      <P>This generates the impetus inevitably for closer political and
social integration with mainland.</P>
      <P>Yet, under the principle of "one country, two systems" , Hong
Kong's institutional structure is not required to evolve to
accommodate mainland's.</P>
      <P>But the SAR was also not supposed to develop its own political
identity.</P>
      <P>"Hence, this is a dilemma for Hong Kong," the report said.</P>
      <P>Same bed, different dreams. This Chinese saying may reflect the
acceptable position for mainland and Hong Kong today. But it is a
serious problem which must be tackled in time or a political crisis
might develop, said a Wang Gungwu and John Wong.</P>
      <P>While Hong Kong continues to enjoy a thriving economic symbiosis
with mainland, the issue of how long it can keep a political and
social distance has to be resolved.</P>
      <P>"Clearly the matter cannot wait for 50 years. The next generation
of leaders of both China and Hong Kong will have to start tackling
the problem of 'tougchuang yimeng," they said.</P>
      <P>Most of Hong Kong's residents are apparently happy with their
status quo, expressing little desire to see an earlier convergence of
the two systems.</P>
      <P>Eventually, they must accept the mainland and learn how to live
with it, the writers said, adding, "The question of Hong Kong's
future political and social integration with China remains the most
intractable part of the post-colonial transition for Hong Kong. There
is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how this will exactly come
about, in as much as China itself is also in a dynamic process of
political and social change."</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA DENIES OFFERING ADDITIONAL 'DOWN PAYMENT' TO AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on Monday
denied that it has agreed to offer additional "down payment" to
Australia in exchange for his support of the Republic of China's bid
to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council was responding to a United Daily News
report that Taiwan's has quietly decided to offer additional import
quotas for Australian farm goods as a "down payment" for its WTO
accession. In addition, the report said, Taiwan will also offer
similar "down payment" to Canada.</P>
      <P>"The report is not true," COA Chairman Peng Tso-kwei said,
adding that the COA has no plans to make further concessions on the
"down payment" issue.</P>
      <P>The "down payment" refers to preferential import quotas offered
by a WTO membership applicant to a specific WTO member economy for a
specific product before the applicant's formal entry to the
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>COA officials said the ROC has already paid much price in its
bilateral negotiations with 26 WTO contracting parties concerning
terms for its WTO accession.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that Taiwan has offered "down payments"
to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Argentina,
Chile, Japan and South Korea, allowing a specified amount of some of
their agricultural products to enter the Taiwan market before
Taiwan's WTO admission.</P>
      <P>For instance, Australia is eligible to export to Taiwan 2,400
tons of apples, 600 tons of tangerines and 1,000 tons of peaches and
plums annually.</P>
      <P>COA officials said Australia indeed asked for additional
agricultural import quotas and new quotas for its livestock and
poultry early this year. Australia demanded that its annual import
quotas for apples, tangerines and peaches/plums be raised to 4,800
tons, 5,000 tons and 3,000 tons, respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials said, New Zealand has also requested
for doubling the annual import quotas for its apples and
peaches/plums. New Zealand currently can export 8,000 tons of apples
and 500 tons of plums/peaches to Taiwan a year.</P>
      <P>Canada has been pressuring Taiwan to open its doors to Canadian
livestock and poultry ever since the ROC agreed early last year to
allow imports of 10,000 tons of chickens, 7,500 tons of pork bellies
and 12,500 pork and beef offals from the United States annually
prior to its WTO entry.</P>
      <P>"Despite strong pressure from Canada, the COA has no intention
to compromise on this issue," a senior COA official said, adding
that unless higher level of government authorities make a different
decision based on other considerations, the COA will not budge from
its stance.</P>
      <P>In related news, local press report said Chen Ruey-long,
director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, will travel to the
United States in the next few days to look into the possible impact
on Taiwan of recent Washington-Beijing negotiations over
terms for mainland China's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Bilateral Mainland China-US WTO negotiations reportedly made
breakthroughs during mainland Premier Zhu Rongji' recent US trip.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD HEAD COMMENTS ON IMD'S RANKING OF TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Swiss-based organization that ranked
Taiwan as the world's 18th-most competitive country has faithfully
reflected the advantages and weaknesses of the island's economic
situation, an economics official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, made the remarks after the International Institute for
Management Development (IMD) gave Taiwan the No. 18 spot, down from
No. 16 last year, in its 1999 World Competitive Yearbook.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan moved down two notches, Chiang said he was
glad to see the government's efforts over the past year have borne
fruit, and that the government has identified Taiwan's problems and
is prepared to address them.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that of the 17 countries ranked above Taiwan, 12 --
including the United States and various European countries -- have
not been affected by the fallout from the Asian financial storm.
Except for Singapore, which retained its second-place ranking from
last year, all Asian countries have fallen in the survey.</P>
      <P>Of the 47 economies examined in the survey, the United States was
No. 1, while Taiwan was fourth among Asian countries, behind
second-place Singapore; Hong Kong, which placed seventh; and Japan,
which placed 16th.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the main reason for Taiwan's slip was that the IMD
conducted the survey during the first quarter of the year, when
Taiwan's economy was at its lowest point. In addition, Taiwan was
being rocked at that time by a series of financial crises suffered by
several enterprises. These developments affected foreign
manufacturers' views about Taiwan's economic situation, he said.</P>
      <P>The IMD's rankings seek to indicate the ability of a nation to
provide an environment that sustains the competitiveness of
enterprises. The study covers more than 250 criteria groups under
eight competitiveness input factors: the domestic economy,
internationalization, government, finance, infrastructure,
management, science and technology, and people.</P>
      <P>Assessing Taiwan's performance, Chiang said there has been marked
improvement in areas that have been targeted as major shortcomings in
past years. In terms of government efficiency, Taiwan moved up three
notches to 11th, and in infrastructure it moved up five notches to
21st. This year Taiwan was ranked 27th in terms of
internationalization and 15th in terms of its people.</P>
      <P>Chiang acknowledged, however, that in the wake of the region's
financial storm, Taiwan's economic growth spiraled down each quarter
last year. As a result it dropped to 12th in terms of its domestic
economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's rankings in the areas of financial systems, enterprise
management, and science and technology also dropped, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the government needs to step up its efforts to
monitor and regulate financial institutes and enterprises, as well as
continue to promote economic recovery. These goals are reflected in
the CEPD's tactics to strengthen economic fundamentals and expand
domestic demand, he said.</P>
      <P>The nation also needs to continue to push its Asian-Pacific
operations hub project and government restructuring to promote
continued internationalization and improved government efficiency,
Chiang said.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the MOE is calling for all members of society
to join a nationwide drive to sweep gangland influences out of
Taiwan's schools.</P>
      <P>Yang was bombarded by accounts from legislators of students being
bullied in school by gangland figures or being forced to do jobs
outside school that the legislators considered improper for students.</P>
      <P>According to the legislators, some students have had sand
sprinkled into their boxed lunches by fellow classmates who demand
money in order to let the students eat in peace in the future. The
legislators hinted that the sand-sprinkling bullies have been trained
by the underworld.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some junior-high-school students have been forced by
gangsters to take part in weddings as flower boys and girls, and some
high-school students have been forced to attend funerals, acting as a
family members of the deceased, the legislators said.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai Ming-shien said
gangs have wielded influence on school campuses for about three
years. He urged the MOE to come up with concrete and immediate
measures to help eradicate organized crime in schools.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Chu Li-lun urged the MOE to help establish
mid-way homes to accommodate youngsters who are either led astray by
"bad people" or who suffer from behavioral problems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Tsai-shun, director of the Taipei County
government's Bureau of Education, said Yang Chin-cheng, a figure
affiliated with the underground "Chu Lien" Clan, was arrested Sunday
by police in Sanchung, Taipei County, for inducing junior- and
senior-high-school students to join the clan.</P>
      <P>Once students joined the clan, they were trained to dun debts,
sell goods, or rig public projects, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Some 66 students in Taipei County have reportedly joined the "Chu
Lien" Clan.</P>
      <P>According to authorities at San Ho Junior High School in
Sanchung, a student at the school surnamed Tsai was instructed by a
gang to recruit new members from within the school. He is known to
have provided the names of six students he thought would be suitable,
although none were found to have participated in any illegal
activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO EXPRESS CONCERN OVER VIOLENCE IN E. TIMOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard will contact
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie this week to express Australia's
grave concern over rising violence in East Timor, where at least 30
civilians have been killed by pro-Indonesian militias, which have the
tacit backing of Indonesia's military.</P>
      <P>Howard will either write or telephone Habibie, asking him to
stamp out further violence by militias in East Timor.</P>
      <P>In his sharpest condemnation yet of Jakarta, Howard blamed the
Indonesian military and its arming of the militias for the violence.</P>
      <P>"You have to wonder whether these pro-integration militia men are
getting some kind of permissive response from the Indonesian army,"
Howard told Australia's Channel Nine TV Network on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer was even more explicit, saying
both the Indonesian government and the armed forces had "clearly
failed" to maintain law and order and protect the people of East
Timor from militia leaders.</P>
      <P>"It is imperative that the armed forces begin the process of
disarming the militias and that those responsible for the violence
and killings be brought to account," he said. The federal Cabinet on
Monday will hold a meeting to discuss the issue and Australia's
options in attempting to persuade the Indonesian government to crack
down on the violence in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said the sudden upsurge of violence appears
calculated to disrupt fresh talks on East Timor's future at the
United Nations in New York. The violence has threatened to derail
plans for a UN-sponsored July ballot aimed at paving the way for a
settlement of the 23-year-old conflict over Indonesian rule of the
territory.</P>

(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong has become a contentious
society rife with all sorts of highly-vocal interest groups, each
with its own agenda, said two senior Singapore academics.</P>
      <P>"Fanned by a free and sometimes-wild press, some interest groups
have also become very vocal and assertive," said a report written
jointly by East Asian Institute head Wang Gungwu and research
director John Wong.</P>
      <P>They warned that Hong Kong's middle class may be most affected,
being the territory's least organized and most divided group.</P>
      <P>"As political anxiety over the handover subsided after 1997, the
politics of identity have given way to potential class conflict,"
they noted.</P>
      <P>Before the handover, politics of identity dominated debate in the
British colony, with a clear divide between the " pro-China" and the
"pro-democracy" camps.</P>
      <P>But, after the handover, class struggle dominated politics in the
Special Administrative Region, said the report, a copy of which was
obtained by The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>Although they said the region's economic crisis further sharpened
conflicts between organized labor, business interests and the middle
class, they said they do not see Hong Kong in a "state of disarray,"
as some sociologists have suggested.</P>
      <P>"People are still highly pragmatic and socially mobile, and life
is still organized around the practical aspects of making money,"
they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Noted Harvard economist Jeffery Sachs
is "on the whole, optimistic" about crisis-hit Asia's return to
economic growth, especially in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>"The region is moving beyond the panic stage and is poised for
the start of economic recovery," he said in a paper titled "The Asian
Crisis: What happened and what is to be done, released over the
weekend in Geneva.</P>
      <P>"However, the pace of recovery is still open to question because
of uncertainties about the cleanup of debt and long-term
institutional reforms," he added.</P>
      <P>Among the other provisos mentioned: The United States and Europe
must ensure there is sufficient liquidity in the world's financial
markets by cutting interest rates, as necessary, and also keep their
domestic markets open to imports.</P>
      <P>Overall, Sachs argued that the current "crisis greatly overstates
the weakness of Asia and the collapse is not really justified by any
fundamental weakness."</P>
      <P>He forecasts that just as the collapse of Asian economies
occurred faster than expected, the recovery will also be faster than

      <P>The threat of the millennium bug -- Y2K
-- is much less serious to mainland China than are problems in its
economic and political sectors, including surging unemployment, a
deflating economy and the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square

      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, Rowan Callicks of The Australian
Financial Review noted that there are about 20 million computers in
mainland China, a country with 1.2 billion people.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the Y2K problem is far less serious than
mainland China's surge in unemployment in provincial centers, the
10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Other
concerns that outweigh Y2K are economic deflation and environmental
disintegration.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Y2K has not appeared on many radar

      <P>A Y2K working group within mainland China's Ministry of

concerned about the Y2K threat.</P>
      <P>But Y2K may be less troublesome to mainland China than to other

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first professional commercial
aircraft maintenance personnel training institute will be
inaugurated in Taipei on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>China Institute of Technology and Commerce (CITC) said on Monday
that the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has agreed to its
application for setting up an aircraft maintenance personnel
training center.</P>
      <P>A CITC spokesman said the CAA will present a certificate to the
institute in the Taipei suburb of Nankang on Tuesday for the
establishment of the special training department.</P>
      <P>"The CAA has conducted five stages of inspection of our
facilities, faculty, training programs and management operations
before it finally agrees to issue the certification," the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that aircraft maintenance is instrumental to flight
safety, the spokesman said the CITC will dedicate itself to the
upgrading of aircraft maintenance services in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Up to date, basic training for aircraft maintenance personnel is
offered by local airline companies. With the rapid development of
aviation technology, aircraft maintenance personnel requires
professional expertise in various fields, ranging from computer,
electronics and communications to automated control and composite
materials.</P>
      <P>Against this background, it has become increasingly difficult
for airline companies to offer comprehensive training programs for
maintenance personnel. As a result, advanced Western countries have
allowed the establishment of professional training institutes to
train qualified maintenance manpower under the supervision of
civil aviation authorities.</P>
      <P>To catch up with this general world trend, the CAA has decided
to encourage private investment in aircraft maintenance manpower
cultivation.</P>
      <P>The CITC filed its application on Dec. 31, 1997. After two years
of preparations, the institute finally passed the CAA's inspection.</P>
      <P>The institute plans to recruit graduates of colleges or senior
high vocational schools in related fields for intensive professional
training. Each student must receive at least 1,900 hours of
professional aircraft maintenance training. After graduation, the
student can take part in qualification tests sponsored by the CAA.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said two other organizations -- the state-run
Aviation Industry Development Corp., Taiwan's only aircraft
manufacturer, and Hsinhsing Senior High Vocation School -- have also
filed applications for setting up aircraft maintenance technicians
training centers.</P>

      <P>Canberra, April 19 (CNA): The Taipei-based International
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) will open its second branch in
Australia on Tuesday to provide banking services to migrants from
Taiwan and other overseas Chinese, ICBC president Wang Shue-sheng
said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Wang said the new branch in Brisbane
will provide services, including lending and accepting deposits to
Taiwanese migrants, particularly businessmen, to facilitate doing
business and building new homes.</P>
      <P>The ICBC set up its first banking operation in Sydney, which a
few years ago was allowed by the Australian government to become a
branch office.</P>
      <P>"There are quite a lot of Taiwanese businessmen and migrants in
Brisbane and other cities in Queensland. Our new branch includes a
Mandarin-speaking staff to eliminate language barriers," Wang said.</P>
      <P>In addition to banking services in Brisbane and Sydney, Wang said
his two Australian branches will provide business information and
investment opportunities in Taiwan so that Taiwanese migrants can
conduct business with their counterparts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said the two branches would provide loans to Taiwanese
migrants, migrants from other countries and Australian businessmen
for different fields of investment.</P>
      <P>"We hope we can help our migrants and other clients to increase
their business aside from their investment projects," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ICBC has set up 20 branches in the United States,
Canada, Japan, the Philippines, Colombia, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, Vietnam, the Netherlands, France and Australia.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to set up branches in other cities or countries

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Shun-fa known as "Bean Curd Papa" was
honored by Premier Vincent Siew Monday for donating blood 495 times
over 20 years.</P>
      <P>Tsai, 52, began to donate blood some 20 years ago after his
sister described him as a "fatty". She told him he should "release
some blood" to seek a physical balance. He said he donated the first
time out of curiosity.</P>
      <P>Once he became a blood donor, Tsai made a a regular donation
every 14 days.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung-based bean-curb merchant, said he donates routinely
and the donations are not interrupted when he travels. "I donate
whenever I am every 14th day," he said. Consequently, he has become
an "old friend" at Taiwan's six major blood donation centers.</P>
      <P>Tsai's admirers say that his heart is more tender than his
bean curd, which is renowned in the Pingtung area for having a
heavenly tasty.</P>
      <P>Before the citation ceremony, Tsai told reporters that blood
donation is rewarding, "particularly when you're informed that your
blood has saved a life." He added that he would continue as long as
he is able.</P>
      <P>The citation ceremony was held Monday to mark the 25th founding
of the Blood Service Foundation of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Foundation President Lin Kuo-sin said the amount of donated blood
collected by the foundation has grown from 3,000 bags in 1974 to 1.79
million bags in 1998, thanks to donors who gave blood to strangers.</P>
      <P>Lin described the philanthropic deed of blood donation as the
most successful social movement in Taiwan. He said that blood
donation has made Taiwan great.</P>
      <P>Lin quoted statistics to say that with 1.79 million bags donated
in 1998, Taiwan's per capita blood donation ratio reached 8.21
percent, much higher than the percentages in neighboring South Korea,
Hong Kong and Malaysia. There is room, however, for local residents
to improve as Japan and the United States average 10 percent, he
added.</P>

      <P>In a news conference in Canberra on Monday afternoon, Howard said
he phoned Habibie on Monday and both leaders agreed to hold an urgent
meeting in Bali within the next 10 days. Canberra has accused the
Indonesian army (ABRI) of failing to curb a series of massacres in
the former Portuguese colony.</P>
      <P>Howard said he told Habibie the latest killings in Dili, capital
of East Timor, will damage Indonesia's international image and he
asked his counterpart to help prevent further killings. Habibie
agreed, Howard said.</P>
      <P>Howard on Monday accused ABRI of "turning a blind eye" on
pro-integration militias, while they were shooting at least 30
civilians, causing chaos in the territory.</P>
      <P>East Timorese migrants in Australia held a series of

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER REPORTS ON TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is
making efforts to assist and guide domestic industries in the areas
of telecommunication, micro-electronics, energy resources and
environment protection, as well as bio-medicine, said the head of
MOEA on Monday.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang, reported on Taiwan's economic
development and its global deployment of high-technology industries
in the next century, at the monthly meeting in the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>In light of technology globalization, the minister encouraged
domestic banks to establish branch offices overseas to provide a
global net of financial services.</P>
      <P>Wang's strategy proposals included promoting the rise of new
industries, an overall stimulation of research activities, satisfying
demands of private investments and entry into international economic
and trade organizations.</P>
      <P>Wang observed that advanced technologies contributed a lot to
Taiwan's economic development. For instance, he said, the total
production value of the semi-conductor sector, totaled NT$281.8
billion last year, or 180 percent growth within five years,
accounting for 3.45 percent of the international market, and Taiwan's
IC production ranked 5th in the world. Taiwan's telecommunication
industry ranked 3rd in the world, the MOEA head added.</P>
      <P>Wang deemed that the future development pattern of Taiwan's
economy must be associated with the global deployment of enterprises.
In other words, factors to be taken into consideration include, where
can commodities be produced with low added value, where to produce
commodities of high added value, the right location to conduct
research work, and the right place to establish management
headquarters.</P>
      <P>The MOEA hopes to retain the latter three items in Taiwan, Wang
noted.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that high-tech industries are increasing in
number, the long-term development of the sector is a challenge for
Taiwan, remarked Wang.</P>
      <P>In a era of high-tech and network economies, said Wang,
establishing a telecommunication environment can be achieved by
accelerating the building of a telecommunication network, Wang
concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MACEDONIAN PRIME MINISTER TO ARRIVE ON MAY 2 FOR 6-DAY VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   19   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on May 2 for a six-day
official visit, Vice Foreign Minister David Lee said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement in a report to the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>Georgievski's visit has twice been postponed because of the
influx into Macedonia of a large number of ethnic Albanian refugees
from the war-torn neighboring Yugoslav province of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Kosovar situation will not worsen so that
Georgievski will be able to visit Taiwan as scheduled this time,"
said Lee, who just returned from a visit to Macedonia to
offer humanitarian assistance to Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>Lee said Georgievski himself also hopes to visit Taiwan as early
as possible to meet with senior ROC officials and sign three
bilateral agreements to facilitate future investment and economic
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC humanitarian relief delegation had attracted
extensive media coverage during its stay in Macedonia last week.
"The group's activities have impressed Macedonian people and help
boost friendship between our two countries," he noted.</P>
      <P>A 26-member ROC group, composed of medical professionals and
volunteers, is operating a field hospital at Stenkovec, the largest
Kosovar refugee camp in Macedonia, to offer medical services to
ethnic Albanians.</P>
      <P>Lee said the medical team will stay in Macedonia for two to
three weeks. If necessary, the team may stay even longer, depending
on the practical needs and the Macedonian government's stance.</P>
      <P>The ROC has so far offered some US$7.5 million in cash,
pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and various relief goods to
Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>As of early April, about 140,000 ethnic Albanians had fled their
Kosovar homeland and entered Macedonia. The influx of the large
number of refugees has had a strong impact on the Macedonian
economy. In the past, 20 percent of Macedonian exports went to
Yugoslavia. The outbreak of the Kosovo crisis has seriously
disrupted Macedonia's industrial production and exports.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drawn up several
proposals for a third round of aid to Macedonia. Nevertheless, he
said if the ROC decides to offer new aid to Macedonia, the
assistance will be offered in cooperation with the international
community. "We'll not make a final decision until after the
development in the Balkans has become more clear," added Lee.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China forged formal diplomatic ties with
Macedonia in January this year.</P>
      <P>Lee left for the United States Monday evening to chair a meeting
of ROC diplomats stationed in North America.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) ranked
first in nine of the 18 graduate school categories in the "Best
Graduate School Survey" held by Common Wealth magazine.</P>
      <P>To help college students and people interested in seeking higher
education better understand Taiwan's graduate schools, the magazine's
annual special edition "Jobs &amp; You" chose 18 categories of graduate
studies. The categories had the largest number of students enrolled
and similar departments were found in at least ten universities.</P>
      <P>Common Wealth interviewed college deans, department directors and
three senior professors and experts to provide mutual academic
reputation critiques.</P>
      <P>The magazine also collated data on each department's full-time
teaching faculty, classes, funding, acceptance rate, registration
rate, published dissertations and honorary awards received to compile
three indicators: teaching resources, research ability and student
identification.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that NTU ranked first in the Chinese
literature, foreign literature, economics, accounting, law,
chemistry, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and civil
engineering graduate programs.</P>
      <P>National Tsinghua University (NTHU), which emphasizes development
research, ranked first in mathematics, physics, statistics and
chemical engineering.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows an intensified competitiveness in popular
subjects such as business administration and electrical engineering.</P>
      <P>While the National Chengchi University (NCCU) ranked first in its
School of Business Administration, it was closely followed by NTU and
the National Sun Yat-sen University.</P>
      <P>NTU's School of Electrical Engineering won the highest acclaim in
its category, but NTHU and the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU),
with their proximity to the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,
have the advantage of offering both academics and practical business
experience.</P>
      <P>Schools of statistics, business administration and education were
the hardest to enter with acceptance rates all under ten percent. The
schools of statistics, was the most difficult with a meager 5 percent
acceptance rate of graduate school applicants.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A two-day work meeting for
the North American units of the Republic of China's Government
Information Office (GIO) was held at Monterey, California on Saturday
and Sunday.</P>
      <P>The meeting, presided over by GIO Director General Chen
Chien-jen, decided to push for international understanding
concerning Taiwan in three areas: Taiwan's economic prosperity and democratic development;
Taiwan's pursuit of a stable and peaceful relationship with mainland
China; Taiwan's determination to step up international cooperation
and participation.</P>
      <P>The GIO director general told CNA that Taiwan's presidential
election next spring will be also a major theme of the GIO in
promoting the country.</P>
      <P>At the work meeting, attended by the chiefs of the 11 GIO units
in North America, Chen said that promoting international
understanding is a long-term, all-out and multi-level task.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that they will take the initiative and
seize opportunities to let the international community understand
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's recent
remarks on the American Civil War provided a good chance for Taiwan
to promote international understanding.</P>
      <P>Zhu hinted at a White House press conference recently
that Beijing might consider learning from President Abraham Lincoln
and use military force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that during his visits to major American
news organizations during his current US trip, he explained to them
that President Lincoln had become a great historical figure because
of his pursuit of human rights, equality, and liberty, not because of
the Civil War.</P>
      <P>The GIO chief described the work meeting as a success and is
considering holding the gathering annually. Chen has concluded his US
trip and will leave for Taipei on Monday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   19   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "electric powered motorcycle
development plan" approved by the Executive Yuan last March has been
successfully carried out as a total of 3,500 electric power
motorcycles have been sold since the plan's approval, sources
reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
said that only a limited number of companies developed electric power
motorcycles in the past due to a lack of battery and drive
technologies.</P>
      <P>However, due to an expanding market and government backing, more
than five types of electric bikes have been launched with more coming
on the market, the EPA added.</P>
      <P>Under government regulations, a minimum of NT$12,000 subsidy will
be granted for each purchase of an electric power motorcycle. The
fuel tax can also be exempted.</P>
      <P>This subsidy makes the price almost equivalent to that of a
fuel-powered motorcycle while maintaning the pollution-free edge.</P>
      <P>The EPA pushed consumers to buy the environmental friendly
transportation devises by offering an additional subsidy of NT$2,000
for each of those who retire their old fuel-powered bikes
produced before 1992 while buying an electric-powered one.</P>
      <P>Regarding the concern that the power for electric power
motorcycle is insufficient, the EPA recommended riding less than 20
kilometers per day.

    <HEADLINE>IMF ADDED TO ASIAN CRISIS: SACHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   19   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore, April 19 (CNA): The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
"actually contributed to the financial panic that helped to bring
down the Asian economies", according to Harvard University economist
Jeffery Sachs.</P>
      <P>Launching yet another scathing attack on the IMF, Dr. Sachs, the
director of Harvard's Institute for International Development, said
its performance had "left much to be desired".</P>
      <P>A long-time IMF critic, the Harvard don argued that the external
supervision of the fund's activities had to be increased and
improved.</P>
      <P>"This requires the decision-making process within the IMF to be
more transparent and more democratized to include a larger number of
developing countries," he said in a paper released in Geneva over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>Advocating floating of exchange rates as the norm for the global
monetary system, he warned that the IMF "cannot, and should not, be
either the international lender of last resort or the international
deposit insurance agency".</P>
      <P>In January, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer
suggested the fund formalize and expand its role as lender of last
resort to rescue governments which fall prey to abrupt shifts in
capital flows.</P>
      <P>Dismissing this idea, Dr. Sachs said the new global monetary
system should instead "establish regional monetary bodies and an
international bankruptcy court to speed up international debt
restructuring".</P>
      <P>International bailouts ought to be redesigned in light of the
"failure of the first IMF programs" for Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>"There should be ways to "bail in" rather than bail out foreign
creditors. For example, debt relief, "standstills" for existing debt
and priority payments for new loans should all be standard features
of rescue packages," Sachs said.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's largest silicon chips maker,
Intel, will be facing the challenge of an allied group of more than
10 electronic and semiconductor manufacturers preparing to push into
the Intel-dominated memory chipset market.</P>
      <P>The low-cost PC 133/266 chipsets will be the main weapon of the
group, headed by the Taipei County-based Very Innovative Architecture
(VIA) Technologies Inc.</P>
      <P>VIA Technologies held a workshop on the PC 133/266 and the
manufacturing standards of memory chipsets in Taipei on Monday.
Attendees were representatives from relevant businesses including
Micron, NEC-Taiwan, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Samsung, Siemens,
Hyundai, Toshiba and Hewlett Packard-Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the meeting the manufacturers supported VIA's development
of the PC133 memory chipset for personal computers (PC). VIA
officials said the low-cost product will help them tap into the
current market trend for low-cost PCs.</P>
      <P>They are pinning their hopes that the PC133 can compete with
Intels' RAMBus in the world PC market. The new generation of Intel
memory chips all allow quick calculations.</P>
      <P>However, VIA officials said, the manufacturing cost of RAMBus is
much higher than that of the previous generation of Intel products --
a fact that will cause Intel to demand a higher price from contracted
makers before transmitting its RAMBus technology.</P>
      <P>VIA Technologies is Taiwan's largest integrated circuit designer
and maker, with NT$2 billion (US$60.98 million) in capital.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legal affairs section under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) on Monday
passed a set of new rules that will enable police to evict
aircraft passengers.</P>
      <P>There have been incidents in the past, where some
passengers refused to leave an aircraft in protest against a flight
delay or poor airline service.</P>
      <P>Such moves affected the operations of the airline, the airport, 
as well as the country's image.</P>
      <P>In order to solve the problem, in 1977 the MOTC's
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) held meetings with consumer
groups and the airline industry to work out procedures for settling
passenger disputes.</P>
      <P>The newly-formulated rules, to be formally announced within two
weeks, will provide a legal basis for airport police to evict
aircraft-occupying passengers.</P>
      <P>According to the new rules, if a domestic flight is delayed over
15 minutes, an international flight more than 30 minutes, or the
flight is diverted from its scheduled destination, the passengers
should be informed of the reasons.</P>
      <P>If the interests of the passengers are affected, the airlines are
required to provide necessary communication, beverages, meals,
accommodations, medical aid, transfer service and other transport
means free of charge.</P>
      <P>If passengers refuse to leave the aircraft, the airlines can
notify local CAA personnel and the airport police to help solve the
dispute.</P>
      <P>If the passengers insist on staying on the aircraft, the new
rules empower the airlines to ask the airport police to evict them
with the consent of local CAA personnel.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan (Cabinet) on Monday
made concessions to the cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung over revenue
allocation for fiscal 2000, agreeing to give 47 percent of revenues
to the country's two major cities.</P>
      <P>Because of financial difficulties, the Executive Yuan initially
intended to decrease the allocation to 41 percent from
originally-promised 47 percent.</P>
      <P>That proposal prompted Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh to strongly criticize the Executive Yuan for
several days because their budget plans had already been submitted to
their respective City Councils for review.</P>
      <P>Facing the unexpected political storm, Premier Vincent Siew met
with Mayor Ma on Monday morning and told him that the Cabinet would
honor its original promise of giving 47 percent of the revenue to both
Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According to that promise, Taipei and Kaohsiung will get NT$83.1
billion and NT$29.3 billion respectively.</P>
      <P>The remaining counties and cities will get NT$154 billion,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei on Monday said that recent remarks
by mainland's top negotiator with Taiwan on the "one China" issue
shows that Beijing has intentionally negated the existence of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman and secretary general of the Strait
Exchange Foundation (SEF), was referring to the so-called 86-word
"new interpretation of the 'one China' policy" by Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>"They (Wang's remarks) not only denied the existence of the
Republic of China, but also has tolled the knell for the nation," Shi
said.</P>
      <P>Wang said in a recent media interview that "there is only one
China in the world, Taiwan is part of it....., both sides should make
efforts to negotiate, on an equal footing, the unification of China ,
and that Taiwan's political status should be discussed by both sides
under the framework of one China."</P>
      <P>Both the SEF and ARATS are intermediary organizations authorized
by Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle cross-strait exchanges
in the absence of formal contacts.</P>
      <P>Shi said that compared to Wang's previous remarks on the same
issue, the recent statement "contains nothing new, and even
backtracks".</P>
      <P>Wang told a visiting pro-unification group from Taiwan in
Shanghai last year that " 'one China' refers neither to the Republic
of China nor to the People's Republic of China. Rather, it's a
unified China."</P>
      <P>Shi said that since the "one China" issue has become the most
serious barrier to cross-strait talks, he has suggested that both
Taipei and Beijing follow the agreement reached between them earlier
that each side be allowed to have their own interpretation of "one
China".</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING-CLAIMED 'ONE CHINA' NON-EXISTENT AT MOMENT: PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui said on
Tuesday that the Beijing-claimed "one China" is non-existent at the
moment.</P>
      <P>President Lee made the statement while meeting with a delegation
of columnists and journalists from Central and South America.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Republic of China is a sovereign independent
state, Lee said the ROC can never accept Beijing's "one China"
principle which regards the People's Republic of China as the central
government and downgrades the ROC as a local government.</P>
      <P>"The reality is that two equal political entities now exist on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait," Lee noted, adding that the ROC
has successfully developed a new Chinese culture through its
political and economic reforms as well as its ingestion of essence
of Western culture.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that what the ROC pursues is a China unified
under the principles of freedom, democracy and equitable distribution
of wealth.</P>
      <P>"Against this background, only when mainland China changes its
system to narrow our gap can China's unification be gradually
realized," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC has set up a National Unification Council to
promote China's unification, Lee said "one China" will exist only
when the two sides of the Taiwan Strait unify under freedom and
democracy.</P>
      <P>Touching on the Taiwan Strait issue, Lee said the strait has
become a "public asset" in the international community as three to
four vessels from different countries sail in the Taiwan Strait
everyday. Therefore, the president said the future of the Taiwan
Strait cannot be decided by any single country and that the
ROC hopes to maintain peace and stability in the strait.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of force
against Taiwan, Lee said freedom and democracy are the most
effective weapons.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China's live-fire military exercises and missile tests
in the run-up to the ROC's first-ever presidential election in 1996
have proved that hegemonic, militant actions were unwise and of no
avail," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Lee said, the ROC will further substantiate its
democratic reforms by promoting judicial, educational and spiritual
reforms in addition to boosting the development of such high-tech
industries as electronics, information and biotechnology.</P>
      <P>Turning to relations with Latin American countries, Lee said
Taiwan has been a major market for Latin American products as it
has usually incurred deficits in its trade with Latin American
countries. Based on its pragmatic diplomacy, Lee said, the ROC is
more than willing to develop trade and economic relations with Latin
American countries no matter whether they maintain formal diplomatic
ties with Taiwan or not.</P>
      <P>The Latin American delegation includes many influential
columnists and journalists from Central and South American countries,
including Panama, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Peru,
Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and
Venezuela.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ZHU TO FACE HUMAN RIGHTS QUESTIONS AGAIN IN B.C.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, April 19 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji was on
the last leg of his Canadian visit Monday, a visit where he's
encountered protesters at nearly every stage.</P>
      <P>The Chinese entourage arrived at Victoria, B.C., late Sunday
evening. There were no protesters to meet Zhu when he arrived about
an hour behind schedule at Victoria Airport.</P>
      <P>B.C. Premier Glen Clark said he will broach the subject of human
rights when he meets with the Chinese premier Monday.</P>
      <P>Clark said he will appeal to Zhu's image as a great Chinese
reformer and suggest that "to encourage trade with the West they have
to make progress in the human rights field as well."</P>
      <P>Pro-Tibet groups are planning a demonstration outside a luncheon
set for Tuesday at Vancouver's Trade and Convention Center. The
Canada Tibet Committee said it's protesting China's human rights
record.</P>
      <P>Clark's high profile on the Chinese human rights issue contrasts
that of his Alberta and Ontario counterparts. Neither Ralph Klein nor
Mike Harris raised the issue with Zhu, concentrating their talks
instead on promoting bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>The difference might have been caused by the party colors of the
three premiers: Clark heads the New Democratic Party while Klein and
Harris are Tories. It also shows an irony that leftist politicians
are more concerned about human rights than right-wingers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT PRESENTS SCENARIOS OF CHINESE NUCLEAR BUILDUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, April 19 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 19 (CNA): Deployment of missile defense
systems in Japan or Taiwan, coupled with Indian nuclear and missile
deployments, could spark a worst-case scenario, in which Beijing
could embark on an aggressive, accelerated nuclear weapon buildup and
reverse many of the international arms control commitments it made in
recent years, according to a new study to be published later this
month.</P>
      <P>Ming Zhang, author of the study titled "China's Changing Nuclear
Posture: Reactions to the South Asian Nuclear Tests," however, said
this scenario is remote, "firstly because Chinese scientists really
doubt whether India has a nuclear capability in hand and secondly
because it will take many years before the United States and Taiwan
actually deploy a missile defense system."</P>
      <P>Even in the worst-case scenario, Zhang said "China has no
intention of reaching nuclear parity with the United States or
Russia. That's a misperception in the United States that as
Washington and Moscow build down their arsenals, that Beijing will be
building up to proportionate levels."</P>
      <P>The China-born scholar with close ties to mainland
Chinese political, arms control and military officials told the
Washington-published "Defense News" weekly that "This will not
happen, even under the most dire international developments, because
the Chinese leadership will not permit themselves to spend (into
bankruptcy)."</P>
      <P>Zhang wrote in the study that "It is hard to imagine that China
would do nothing if India deployed a significant number of nuclear
weapons or targeted nuclear weapons at China." He also refuted
oft-stated Indian claims that Beijing has already deployed nuclear
weapons in Tibet, insisting that China's long-range missiles can
reach India from far outside Tibet.</P>
      <P>Zhang noted, however, that "After India's nuclear tests,
it seems likely that China will deploy nuclear weapons in Tibet to
strengthen its defense against India. At 4,000 meters above sea level
and facing down on India, the Tibet plateau is ideal for weapon
deployment."</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said India's nuclear tests in May 1998,
coupled with recent test launches of an extended-range ballistic
missile capable of striking most targets in mainland China, could
prompt enhancements to Beijing's nuclear launch sites in bordering
provinces of Gansu, Qinghai and Yunnan.</P>
      <P>The deployment of nuclear weapons along mainland China's eastern
border is the first of three scenarios Zhang details in the study, to
be published later this month by the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace here.</P>
      <P>But Zhang said the most likely option for China in the next five
years is a continuation of the status qua, in which Beijing is slowly
modernizing its strategic force with DF-31 and DF-41 solid-fueled,
road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles; second-generation
nuclear submarines capable of launching 12 JL-2, multi-warhead
intercontinental missiles; and modest upgrades to its strategic
bomber force.</P>
      <P>Mainland China likely will maintain its estimated 450-warhead
arsenal through 2005 or possibly 2010, replacing obsolete warheads
with newer, more reliable ones, according to Zhang.</P>
      <P>However, he warned that events in India, Taiwan and the United
States involving Washington's military presence in the region could
prompt what he calls a worst-case scenario, in which Beijing could
embark on an aggressive, accelerated nuclear weapons buildup.</P>
      <P>His worst-case scenario also includes Beijing's refusal to
ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, circumvention of the
Missile Technology Control Regime, and a reversal of support for the
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</P>
      <P>"China's commitment to the international nonproliferation regime
is strong, but not irreversible," Zhang wrote.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 19 (CNA): Taiwan's economic growth rate is
expected to remain roughly the same in 1999 as in 1998, but is
expected to increase to 6.3 percent in 2000, the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The ADB, in an annual report on Asia's economic outlook issued
from here and its Manila headquarters, said Taiwan's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to rise 4.9 percent. It's a slightly
downward revision from last November's forecast of 5.2 percent.</P>
      <P>GDP growth rate for Taiwan in 2000 is expected to be over 6
percent, said the report. It's the best among the newly
industrialized Asian economies, namely Hong Kong, Singapore, South
Korea and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This increase is largely predicated upon a boost to domestic
demand through government spending on several large-scale
infrastructure projects," the ADB said.</P>
      <P>The projects include a US$13.4 billion high-speed railway
project and extensive housing construction.</P>
      <P>As a result, the ADB said, the fiscal deficit will remain high
at 6.4 percent and 6.3 percent of GDP in 1999 and 2000 respectively.</P>
      <P>Regarding Taiwan's monetary policy, the ADB said that "with
prudent financial regulations in place", Taiwan's looser monetary
stance should prevent a credit crunch in the next few years.</P>
      <P>The ADB said Taiwan consumer price inflation was likely to be
a mere 1.9 percent in 1999 with a rise to 2.6 percent in 2000.</P>
      <P>Exports are expected to experience "robust growth" in 1999 and
2000. The current account will show a surplus of $7.8 billion in
2000, the ADB said, but gave no forecast for 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE THAN HALF OF TAIWAN STREET STALLS PULL IN NT$1 MILLION A YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of the stalls on Taiwan's
streets bring in more than NT$1 million (US$30,770) a year, an
investigation by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) showed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>There are nearly 390,500 street vendors in Taiwan, with an
average of 1.5 working at each stall, and employment at such stalls
accounts for 4.2 percent of total employment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>There is one street vendor for every 33 male workers and one for
every 17 female workers, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The total turnover of Taiwan's street vendors amounted to
NT$392.62 billion (US$12.08 billion) last year, and 142,617 stalls --
or 54.17 percent of the total number -- brought in more than NT$1
million each.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS estimated that a vendor could earn an average of
NT$36,000 (US$1,108) per month, or NT$5,000 (US$154) more than an
average factory worker.</P>
      <P>As a result, street vendors are reluctant to change jobs. The
DGBAS investigation revealed that only 17.28 percent of Taiwan's
street vendors said they are thinking of leaving their jobs, and most
said they were hoping they would be paid NT$36,000 (US$1,108) a month
if they were to switch jobs.</P>
      <P>Most manufacturing companies, however, are willing to pay workers
a maximum of NT$27,000 (US$830) per month. Officials said this means
the chances of Taiwan's street vendors abandoning their life on the
street are slim.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA SAYS NO REDUCTION IN PROPOSED DOG REGISTRATION FEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said on
Tuesday that it is not considering a reduction in the proposed fee
for dog registration.</P>
      <P>The COA was responding to public criticism that the one-time
registration fee of up to NT$4,800 (US$147) is too high.</P>
      <P>The officials said the proposed fee is lower than those of other
nations and that there is no reason for a reduction. They said they
would introduce an educational campaign to cushion opposition.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that in line with the animal protection law,
they are now working on a draft regulation that requires the
registration of pet dogs in an attempt to reduce the number of strays
on the island. Under the proposed regulations, dog owners must
register their dogs' birth and death with authorities.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed registration process, dogs would receive
identification chip implants, while owners would be given a
registration certificates with their names, the name of their dog and
a unique identification number that each dog would be assigned. If
the pet goes missing, owners would need to report the animal's
disappearance to the pet administration within five days.</P>
      <P>For dogs that have been sterilized, the cost of registration
would be between NT$800 and NT$1,000 (US$24.60 and US$30.76). For
unsterilized dogs, the cost could run as high as NT$4,000.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that compared with the United States, Japan
and mainland China, Taiwan's proposed registration fee is low.</P>
      <P>They noted that each dog registration in mainland China costs

    <HEADLINE>MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE LIVE ALONE IN TAIWAN: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of elderly people living alone
in Taiwan has increased more than one third in seven years, according
to a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that the number of elderly people, aged 65 or
older, who lived alone increased from 10 percent in 1989 to 10.8
percent in 1996, but the number of those who lived with spouse only
rose from 12.5 percent to 17 percent, an increase of more than one
third, or some 90,000 people, during the same period.</P>
      <P>In 1996, one out of every ten elderly people lived alone, while
two out of every ten lived only with their spouse, according to the
survey made by the Taiwan Provincial Family Planning Research
Institute. Only about half of the elderly people lived with their
married children.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior and the
Department of Health also indicated that in 1996, 32.7 percent of
Taiwan's gray-haired population lived alone or with their espouse.
Most people in Asia prefer living with their children in old age.</P>
      <P>The survey also pointed out that people with higher education
tend to live alone in old age. Of the elderly people living alone or
with their spouse, the percentage for primary school graduates and
illiterates are 20 percent and 40 percent higher respectively than the
percentage of high school graduates.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 68 percent of Taiwan's elderly people
receive financial assistance from their children or relatives, down
12.5 percent from the 1989 level. Currently, about one third, down
from 50 percent of seven years ago, of Taiwan's elderly citizens
depend on their children for living. Twenty five percent of them said
they have "economic difficulties."</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's elderly people are becoming more lonely,
situations of elderly women on the island are even worse, according
to the survey. Despite the fact that there are still more old male
citizens who live alone than their female counterparts, elderly women
are generally at a disadvantage in health, leisure, and finance.</P>
      <P>Over the past seven years, the number of elderly women who
received economic aid from their children or relatives has declined
more quickly than that of men.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA'S CONGLOMERATES FACE 'MERGE OR PERISH' CHOICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   April   20   (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Western giants are forging
mega-mergers to become bigger in their multinational operations,
Asia's family-owned conglomerates are ill-equipped and ill-prepared
to face the challenge and problem in a time of rising globalization.</P>
      <P>In an article titled "Merge or Perish," Geoff Hiscock, business
editor of The Australian, said the colossal mergers of Daimler and
Chrysler, of British Petroleum and Amoco and of Vodafone and Air
Touch show that Asian conglomerates are lagging behind when it comes
to merger mania.</P>
      <P>He said that this raise the question of how well Asia's
family-controlled conglomerates will be able to compete globally,
given that many of them lack the cash and the management systems to
build brands and distribution networks outside the region.</P>
      <P>He quoted Rob Hogarth, a Melbourne-based head of KPMG's Asian
business group, as saying that for an Asian conglomerate to be
"globalization ready," it must meet three key conditions: It must
have a proper capital base, the ability to compete without recourse
to local favors, and some involvement with a multinational through a
joint venture or technology transfer.</P>
      <P>Hiscock said only a few conglomerates can do that in Asia. The
best of them are Japanese and Korean companies -- namely Sony,
Toyota, Honda, Canon, LG and Samsung. These are among the few
companies that have the scale, quality or price advantages to go head
to head with the world's best.</P>
      <P>Other companies that are capable of competing are Acer of Taiwan
and Singapore Airlines, he said.</P>
      <P>Other well-known conglomerates in Asia -- including Indonesia's
Salim Group and Thailand's CP Group -- have found themselves
vulnerable as a consequence of the Asian economic downturn and the
pressures of globalization, he noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Navy General Headquarters (NGH)
confirmed on Tuesday that it plans to purchase an amphibious ship
from the United States in the new fiscal year, which starts on July
1, 1999.</P>
      <P>Lei Kuang-shu, an NGH department chief, was responding to a local
newspaper report that the ROC Navy will take delivery of a retiring
US amphibious vessel in October to upgrade its ability to defend
outlying islands against possible attack by communist China.</P>
      <P>Lei said the Navy is working on details concerning the delivery
of the ship. However, Lei would not divulge any details, saying a
bilateral agreement prohibits the Navy from revealing when the ship
will be delivered and returns to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported on Monday that the Navy will
purchase the USS Pensacola, a 14,000-ton amphibious ship to be
retired in the near future after 28 years of service in the US Navy.</P>
      <P>Quoting unidentified military sources, the paper said the USS
Pensacola is capable of transporting up to 50 amphibious vehicles
and has deck space for several helicopters and would be instrumental
to reinforcing and resupplying the Republic of China-held outlying
islands in case they came under attack.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-held outlying islands include Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu,
Tungyin, Wuchiu, Pratas and Taiping Island, one of the Spratly
islands. Many of those outlying islands are closer to rival mainland
China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The paper said the Pensacola would replace the ROC Navy's World
War II-era amphibious vessels, some of which have been in service
with the navy for 50 years, twice the usual service life of naval
vessels.</P>
      <P>The Pensacola, also known as LSD-38, based at Norfolk, Virginia,
has been deployed in the Adriatic Sea with a detachment of US
Marines since the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began last month.</P>
      <P>The Pensacola has been designed for rapid action with
transportation of helicopters, gunship, and 1,150 combat troops with
artillery, tanks and light armored vehicles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI HOPES MAINLAND CHINA WILL OPEN MORE HARBORS FOR TRANSSHIPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the second anniversary of the opening
of direct offshore cross-strait transshipment services was marked on
Monday, Taipei authorities expressed their hope that more harbors in
the Chinese mainland would be opened for transshipment operations.</P>
      <P>The development of cross-strait transshipments occurred against a
backdrop of uneventful relations between Taipei and Beijing, said
officials of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC).</P>
      <P>The MOTC drafted in May 1996 measures for the establishment of a
direct offshore cross-strait transshipment service, and business
operations began on April 19, 1997. The service connects Taiwan's
Kaohsiung Harbor and the mainland harbors in Fuzhou and Xiamen. But
all cargo sent to those ports must be shipped to another destination
without clearing customs.</P>
      <P>A total of 11 shipping companies were permitted to operate direct
offshore cross-strait transshipment services in the past two years,
and together they transshipped 400,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent
units), according to MOTC statistics.</P>
      <P>The increased volume of cargo being handled at Kaohsiung Harbor
is partly the result of the cross-strait transshipment business, said
MOTC officials.</P>
      <P>Starting in late 1997, the MOTC even allowed ships traveling
across the strait to dock directly at the transshipment centers
before they traveled to a third area or country.</P>
      <P>The MOTC officials said they hoped mainland China would open
other important harbors, such as those in as Guangzhou, Dalian,
Shanghai, Qingdao and Tianjin. Meanwhile, Taiwan is ready to open its
harbors in Taichung and Keelung to transshipment services, they said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taipei Chen Shui-bian paid
visits to four major American think tanks in Washington, D.C. on
Monday as part of his efforts to allay US policy advisers'
suspicions about his attitude toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is widely believed to seek Taiwan's main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) nomination to run in the
island's next presidential election, met with the think tanks'
senior executives and Asian and China affairs experts.</P>
      <P>The four think tanks were the American Enterprise Institute, the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Peace Institute
and the Heritage Foundation.</P>
      <P>During the meetings, Chen had explained in detail his own views
and the DPP's stances on issues related to Taiwan's future and its
relations with rival mainland China.</P>
      <P>After extensive talks with Chen, many US China hands said they
feel that Chen has tried hard to expel American opinion leaders'
suspicions about his and the DPP's stances on cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The DPP has advocated the legislation of a plebiscite law to
allow Taiwan people to decide the island's future status and Chen
used to be seen as a pro-Taiwan independence activist.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Washington, D.C. on Sunday for a three-day
visit as part of his global "journey of learning" aimed at promoting
his presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Chen also met with former US Ambassador to mainland China James
Lilley on Monday. Lilley, who also once served the top US envoy
stationed in Taipei in the absence of official diplomatic ties,
said after his talks with Chen that he feels that Chen has
demonstrated a responsible attitude toward Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>"Even though some DPP members advocate a constitutional
amendment to legalize plebiscite, Chen told me he does not think
Taiwan will pass such a constitutional amendment this year," Lilley
said.</P>
      <P>Lilley recalled that when he met with Chen in Washington, D.C.
in January 1998, Chen projected a moderate image. "My impression
about Chen has not changed after Monday's talks," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen will also visit New York and Los Angeles before ending his
current US trip.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) announced Tuesday an immediate temporary ban on the import of
horses, pigs and dogs from Australia and of dogs from Malaysia to
prevent the Nipha virus from invading Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The COA's animal and plant quarantine agency invited related
government agencies to a recent animal quarantine meeting, at which

      <P>Previously the council issued bans on cow, goat, horse and hog

      <P>The Republic of China's Defense Ministry
confirmed a local newspaper report on Tuesday that the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) will conduct large-scale exercises between July
and September.</P>
      <P>Ministry spokesman Kung Huan-ting noted that the PLA usually
carries out regiment- or division-wide joint maneuvers during the
three-month period.</P>
      <P>He said this year's live-fire combat exercises are expected to be
held in the northwestern, northern and southwestern sections of
mainland China, with the focus to be on the testing of new high-tech
weapons and equipment.</P>
      <P>The ROC armed forces plan to conduct "Chengkung Performance
Exercises" and "Hankuang Exercises" in May and June this year.</P>
      <P>Kung stressed that the two exercises are designed to review the
results of the training of Taiwan's new-generation forces, and have
nothing to do with countering PLA plans.</P>
      <P>According to the newspaper report, the PLA will conduct live-fire
war games and test-fire newly developed cruise missiles between May

      <P>The Philippine government justified on
Tuesday its rejection of a planned visit by Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, saying that such a visit would not contribute to stability
in the region.</P>
      <P>Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the planned personal
visit by President Lee would adversely affect not only
Philippine-mainland China relations but also Taiwan's relationship
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Monday, the Republic of China government in Taipei had
denied wire service reports that Lee was planning to visit the
Philippines this month to receive an honorary degree from Filipino
alumni of Cornell University. "I've never heard of such a thing,"
said Lin Bih-jaw, deputy secretary-general to the president, when
queried by the press.</P>
      <P>In Manila, foreign affairs sources said the Philippine government
decided not to grant a visa for Lee to make the personal visit. This
was confirmed by Barican, who stressed that the decision was reached
after careful deliberations within the Cabinet. The spokesman also
acknowledged that Beijing had raised the issue with Manila at several
levels.</P>
      <P>Philippine foreign affairs officials have expressed concern that

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People with severe brain damage stand a
much better chance of improving if they receive proper and heavy
treatment within the first three months of their injuries, said
neurosurgeons at Taipei's Chenhsin Medical Center.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chia-hsin suffered severe brain damage after being involved
in a car accident one year ago. But Chiu regained consciousness after
being treated for hydrocephalus at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The hospital was also able to successfully treat a 60-year-old
patient with a brain tumor. After undergoing treatment, the woman was
able to move her fingers and distinguish between some objects. She
was also able to identify family members.</P>
      <P>Before the woman was sent to Chenhsin, her family had been
reluctant to subject her to further treatment, as she had been in a
coma since last October, and her family had given up hope.</P>
      <P>But the hospital's neurosurgery team persuaded the woman's family
to let them operate.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by its two successes, doctors at Chenhsin Medical
Center said all severely brain-damaged people have the right to
receive treatment, especially since their families' financial burdens
are lessened by national health insurance subsidies.</P>
      <P>They defined severely brain-damaged people as those who are awake
but unable to idenfity people, places or objects. Such people can
sleep, chew and form facial expressions, though they cannot
communiate with other people or express thoughts or feelings.</P>
      <P>Doctors said people with brain damage stand a much better chance
of recovering if they receive treatment within the first three months
of their injuries. Patients who are not treated within the first year
of their injuries stand only a 2 percent chance of regaining
consciousness, doctors stressed.</P>
      <P>Whether such patients can regain consciousness depends on factors
such as their age and the type of injury they have. Younger people,
and those whose brain damage is the result of external brain
injuries, brain tumors and hydrocephalus stand a greater chance of
regaining consciousness after undergoing treatment, said doctors.</P>
      <P>But those people whose injuries are caused by paralysis, poison,
or damaged or atrophied brain nerves are unlikely to recover, doctors
added.</P>
      <P>No matter what their age or type of injury, people with brain
damage are unlikely to experience a full recovery, doctors said,
adding that such people will likely require lifelong rehabilitation.</P>

Slobodan Milosevic.</P>
      <P>Six legislators threw their support behind the campaign, and
signed a "declaration on helping Kosovo refugees." Some legislators
also agreed to donate one day's worth of salary to the campaign.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for World Vision Taiwan said that each life-saving
package costs NT$2,000 (US$60.60), and that members of the public
wishing to support the campaign can remit donations through the
postal remittance service, or alternatively can call the "hungry
hotline" on (02)2585-6300.</P>
      <P>Shao quoted UNHCR statistics which show that about 36,000 Kosovo
refugees have fled to Albania, 130,000 to Macedonia, and another
7,300 to Montenegro, and that the number is growing.</P>
      <P>He added that the life-saving packages will be sent to those most
in need as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China Foreign Ministry has already begun
providing assistance to Kosovo refugees in Macedonia, sending a
plane-load of relief materials last week.</P>
      <P>A field hospital operated by physicians from Taiwan's Luchuhui
Society, a private charity group, is already established in
Macedonia, providing medical services to about 300 refugees each day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI  REJECTS SEOUL CALLS FOR RESUMPTION OF RECIPROCAL FRUIT TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Council of Agriculture (COA) on
Tuesday rejected a call from South Korea for a resumption of
reciprocal trade in fruit between the two countries, the council
announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Seoul has asked Taipei through its representative office in
Taipei to restore the reciprocal trade agreement reached at a
bilateral ministerial meeting in 1985, under which each country
undertook to purchase equal value fruit from the other.</P>
      <P>The deal was suspended by Taipei in 1997 on the grounds that
Seoul failed to fulfill its obligations under the pact, resulting in
a heavy trade deficit against Taiwan which hit US$24.42 million in
1998 alone.</P>
      <P>The Korean Mission in Taipei said that South Korea's agriculture
sector has suffered great losses because Taiwan closed its market to
South Korean apples and pears.</P>
      <P>The COA said that because of South Korea's failure to live up to
it's side of the agreement, it will not consider restoring the pact.</P>
      <P>However, COA Chairman Peng Tso-kui said that once Taiwan becomes
a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), South Korean apples
and pears will once again have easy market access to Taiwan under WTO
terms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUNGER STRIKE FOR PLEBISCITE ENDS IN FAILURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 11-day-old hunger strike dubbed the
"410 fast" came to an end on Tuesday without achieving its goal of
pressing for legislation of a plebiscite law.</P>
      <P>A promised discussion of the issue slated for Tuesday's
parliamentary session resulted in a vote to shelve the plebiscite
bill, an official move signaling the legislature's refusal to concede
to the hunger strikers' tactics.</P>
      <P>The campaign organizers said that they had to call off the hunger
strike for the sake of the 23 strikers' lives, but stressed that
their determination and resolve has not softened.</P>
      <P>In a joint statement, they reiterated the need for a plebiscite
law to ensure the right of the people of Taiwan to
self-determination, and said they will take further action in the
future to achieve their end.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, a front-man for the hunger strikers, who included DPP
lawmakers and independence activists, said at the beginning of the
fast last Saturday that they are convinced "a plebiscite can be the
best solution to problem of Taiwan's sovereignty," and could also
serve to decide the country's major policy decisions.</P>
      <P>However, the ruling Kuomintang did not agree and nor did the New
Party, which opposes Taiwan independence. The hunger strikers were
also blasted for trying to push through their plebiscite proposal
without the common agreement of the majority.</P>

qualities."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER DENIES REPORT ON MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei on Wednesday
denied a US media report that the Republic of China plans to develop
medium-range missiles.</P>
      <P>Tang was commenting on a Washington-based Defense News report
that the conditions for Taiwan to deploy medium-range missile has
gradually ripened.</P>
      <P>Tang said he was surprised by the report, stressing that the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) has no such a plan.</P>
      <P>Tang said the US defense weekly apparently has reached its
conclusion after interviewing some Taiwan politicians from both the
ruling and opposition parties about the development and deployment of
medium-range missiles.</P>
      <P>"Those opinions only represented their personal views, not the
defense ministry's established policy," Tang said.</P>
      <P>The minister said he understands that the issues related to
develop and deploy various defensive and strategic weapons,
including medium-range missiles, have been widely discussed in local
society.</P>
      <P>"Opinions expressed in those discussions mainly reflect personal
views," Tang said, adding that the MND currently has no plans to
develop medium-range missiles. "The deployment of medium-range
missiles has not yet formed part of our policy," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US AMBASSADOR SAYS US MUST WATCH BEIJING'S MISSILE MANEUVERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 20 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the United States lets the mainland
Chinese know that there would be no missile defense in the western
Pacific, they will build more missiles "because it will give them
leverage to force Taiwan to the negotiating table on their terms,"
according to James Lilley, former US ambassador to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lilley, however, said during a Senate Foreign Relations
Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday that the United States should not get
into a real contest with the mainland Chinese now over theater
missile defense systems.</P>
      <P>When the United States sent its carriers to waters near Taiwan in
March 1996, it could have led to a disaster, he said, adding that he
believes it is essential to establish an understanding with Taiwan
about future contingencies and planning to deal with those
contingencies. "This is the sort of soft war you can carry out ...
without really challenging the (US-PRC) relationship," he said.</P>
      <P>Lilley said decisions about whether the United States should
build its Aegis-class destroyers into a theater missile defense
system to defend Taiwan and whether the United States should sell
Taiwan the destroyers to participate in the system need not be made
for some time.</P>
      <P>But if mainland China continues to increase its missile capacity,
"then you look at the TMD as an integral part of an overall
anti-missile system that you develop in that area," he said.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the United States should be concerned about
reports that Beijing may be pursuing the development of multiple
independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV), but he does not
think there is anything the United States can do about it, except
tighten security at Los Alamos and other national weapons
laboratories.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese have been after MIRV for a long time, Lilley
said. Former Defense Secretary William Perry has said Beijing may
have succeeded in trying to get the SS-18, a solid-fuel missile with
MIRV capability, from the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>He said one of the most specious arguments made by the mainland
Chinese apologists is that theater missile defense will force them to
get MIRV. But the mainland Chinese are determined to get MIRV because
it is in their national interests. And they can use theater missile
defense as an excuse, and "have Americans run around parroting their
line."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lilley noted that in mainland Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji's US visit the whole strategic-military arrangement was
downplayed, and even President Bill Clinton neglected to use the term
"constructive strategic partnership," in both his foreign policy
address and his joint press conference with Zhu, "because anybody
knows a strategic partnership does not exist. It is a word game."</P>
      <P>He added that the mainland Chinese are against NATO expansion;
they are against the United States' position in Kosovo; they are
against the Japanese-American security treaty, which is the
cornerstone of the United States' strategy in Asia; they are against
the United States' position on Taiwan; and they sometimes have not
been helpful toward the United States' position on North Korea.</P>
      <P>Of mainland China, Lilley said: "It should be a country that goes
by international rules of trade, rule of law across the board,
expands its electoral base, opens up its system and deals with its
problems on its periphery in a peaceful way. And I think this is what
we should aim for."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US DEFENSE SECRETARY SUPPORTS TMD SYSTEM IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is more reluctant than
Russia to see the United States develop and deploy a missile defense
system in the western Pacific because "it would deny to them the
capability to use their missile forces against Japan, Taiwan, Korea
and the like," said former US Defense Secretary James Schlesinger
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He told a Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee hearing on
missile threats to the United States that Washington has to make
clear to the mainland Chinese that it is necessary for the United
States to deploy missile defenses that would protect US bases in the
Pacific, "not only from our own interests but from the standpoint of
the overall security and stability in Asia."</P>
      <P>Schlesinger said the United States should also inform the
mainland Chinese that the areas the United States would protect would
include Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>But he noted: "The delicate problem is the subject of Taiwan. I
think that that is a subject on which the least said, the better;
that we ought to continue to reiterate that, indeed, the United
States' policy, as it has been since 1972, is a one-China policy;
that we continue to believe that the PRC (People's Republic of China)
and the Republic of China will work out their differences
peacefully."</P>
      <P>"The Chinese will understand that we -- particularly if we deploy
the Aegis system -- have the capability of providing a missile
defense for Taiwan, but I do not think we should ever say that. The
Chinese would regard it not only as a threat but interference, as
they say, in their domestic affairs," the former director of the
Central Intelligence Agency said.</P>
      <P>Since the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prevents the use of
theater missile defenses in a national missile defense mode, "we need
to modify the treaty to permit a minimum number of (missile defense)
sites, but sufficient to protect the continental United States as
well as Alaska and Hawaii" against potential missile attacks by such
"rogue nations" as Iran, Iraq and North Korea, which are hostile to
the United States, said Schlesinger.</P>
      <P>But if the Russians are unwilling to agree to such a deployment,
"then I think that we have no alternative but to move towards
abrogation" of the ABM Treaty," he said.</P>

      <P>Department officials attributed Taiwan's increased exports to
America in February to the fact that the island's exports have begun
to gain momentum since earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's purchases from the United States have not
increased. This has resulted in a trade surplus that has grown
significantly during the first two months of this year.</P>
      <P>In all, the United States suffered a deficit of US$19.5 billion
in the trade of commercial goods and services in February, up 15.6
percent from January. February's deficit was a single-month record
high. Wall Street analysts had predicted a deficit of US$14.4 billion
to US$17.6 billion, according to Department officials.</P>
      <P>The United States' US$4.62 billion trade deficit with mainland
China in February was one of its largest, and it was 32.2 percent
higher than its trade deficit with the mainland in February 1998.</P>
      <P>Department of Commerce statistics showed that for every US$1 in
goods that the United States exported to mainland China, the Chinese
mainland exported US$5.90 worth of goods to the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPLORATION BID OF PRATAS ISLANDS URGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars and Kaohsiung city councilors
attending a Wednesday seminar here voiced strong support for the city
authorities' intent to develop the Pratas Islands in the South China
Sea.</P>
      <P>In a seminar called by Kaohsiung City Councilor Chen Yun-lung, Hu
Jien-tzu, director of National Sun Yat-sen University's water rescues
study institute, opined that development of the Pratas Islands should
center on the protection of its marine ecology.</P>
      <P>Under the precondition, he said, the Kaohsiung City Government's
exploration activities will help crack down on illegal fishing
operations on nearby waters, thus buttressing the Republic of China's
sovereignty over the islands.</P>
      <P>Hu called on Kaohsiung City councilors to back the municipal
authorities' idea to set up a bureau on managing and
developing marine resources, and urged marine police to cooperate
with the Ministry of National Defense to jointly maintain order and
sweep illegal activities near the Pratas Islands.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-liang, head of the Kaohsiung City's Urban Development
Bureau, said Mayor Frank Hsieh has instructed relevant agencies to
form a task force to study the feasibility of exploration and
management of the Pratas Islands.</P>
      <P>In February 1990, the Executive Yuan authorized the Kaohsiung
City Government to trustee the Pratas Islands. In addition to a
Fishermen Service Center, the Kaohsiung municipal authorities
maintain no other facilities there.</P>
      <P>Echoing Hu's view, Lee Chan-jung, a researcher with the National
Museum of Marine Biology Aquarium, said that as much as 98 percent
of the coral reefs near the Pratas Islands have been destroyed in
recent years by mainland Chinese and Hong Kong fishermen who
illegally poached there.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent investigation by the cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture and the Kaohsiung City Government, Lee pointed out that
about half of the 137 categories of coral reefs there have
disappeared.</P>
      <P>He stressed that marine ecology near the Pratas Islands must be
first restored before the authorities take moves to develop the
island.</P>
      <P>Since the Business Management Committee under the ruling
Kuomintang revealed early this month its interest in developing the
Pratas Islands into a tourism spot, the islands have become a hot
discussion topic recently.
 Kaohsiung Mayor Hsieh also announced on Tuesday that he will lead
an inspection delegation to the island in late April or early May to
assess the possibility of working out a marine tourist route from
Taiwan to the island.</P>

      <P>Mirth and laughter reverberated in the new
building housing the ruling Kuomintang when scores of children joined
their parents on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The children, many of them in primary schools or kindergartens,
took part in the first-ever "bring children to the office" activities
sponsored by the KMT's Central Committee.</P>
      <P>John Chang, KMT secretary general, welcomed the young guests,
saying that the day was planned to give them an understanding of
their parents' working enviroment, enhance their relationship with
their parents, as well as learn the work ethics of their parents'
profession.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that "bring your daughter to the office" was first
introduced in the United States, with the hope that young girls would
avoid the gender gap through working side by side their mothers,
while upgrading their working skills.</P>
      <P>Chang noted the campaign has since received an enthusiastic
response in the US and that both sons and daughters now join their
parents at the office.</P>
      <P>He urged the Executive Yuan to follow suit and set April 23 as a
"Children and Parents Day" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>KMT officials led the children on a tour of the new building,
explaining the duties of the KMT party workers. They also arranged a
mini-concert and other entertainment programs for the children so
that they could learn how a political party operates through
playing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Huang Chu-wen
said he believed larceny crimes can be lowered by 20 percent in a
year's time as long as people cooperate with the police, sources
reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remark in a morning radio program, adding that he
was confident and determined to prevent serious criminal events from
happening.</P>
      <P>Driven by public's strong fear and resentment to the increasing
of theft cases, police have since January been actively working to
stop larceny. Huang added that statistics compiled by the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) show that cases of reported theft during January
and February fell 12.92 percent compared to the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>To cheer up and honor the police for their hard work, the
minister and the Director-General of the National Police
Administration Ting Yuan-chin will visit the island's major police
stations. By doing so, they believe the country's police will work
harder and the public's confidence in the nation's security will
return.</P>
      <P>Regarding the problem of long unsolved cases, Huang said he
has instructed the administration to keep investigating every
unsolved case.</P>
      <P>Huang also urged judges to hand down harsher penalties to
those found guilty of larceny, specially to repeated violators.

    <HEADLINE>HABIBIE CLOSES IN ON NOMINATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore, April 21 (CNA): Indonesia's ruling Golkar party
appears all but certain to be nominating Dr. B.J. Habibie as its
presidential candidate with the armed forces (Abri) chief, General
Wiranto, as his running mate.</P>
      <P>Ministerial sources told The Straits Times that while several
Golkar elders and regional representatives have decided since January
to back the incumbent for a five-year term, they are not making
their decision public until after the party's leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>The party also decided to have a slate of four other
candidates "as part of the 'wayang' and to democratize the whole
process", said a Cabinet minister who is a Golkar executive member.</P>
      <P>He said, "Technically, it is not correct to say Habibie is the
sole candidate. He is the leading candidate among others the party
has chosen. But informally, a large number of us have already made
up our minds that he should continue to be president. "</P>
      <P>He added that the choice of Gen. Wiranto as Vice-President was
more Habibie's personal preference than a party decision.</P>
      <P>"Habibie is voluble. Wiranto is calm and steady. They'll made a
good combination," he said.</P>
      <P>He said a number of factors were in favor of the German-trained
engineer, despite the handicap of his past association with former
president Suharto.</P>
      <P>The most critical was that State Secretary Akbar Tand-kung, who
is also a leading contender for the presidency, had thrown his weight
behind Habibie.</P>
      <P>Akbar has extensive grassroots links with organizations like
the Indonesian Muslim Student's Association and ties with party
branches in several provinces.</P>
      <P>"Given the circumstances and lack of support that former
president Suharto would have otherwise got from the military, Habibie
has done quite a good job of maneuvering different groups and winning
over the support of key individuals," he said.</P>
      <P>Another factor was that Habibie has the support of most of the
Golkar regional representatives outside Java, particularly in eastern
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>"They see him as a non-Javanese, and this is something very
appealing for people who went through 32 years under a Javanese
president," said the source.</P>
      <P>"There is also a sense that Habibie, if he is allowed to stay on,
would be able to continue with the reform process he has started."</P>
      <P>Analysts said that while Habibie is strong in provinces outside
Java, there are doubts over how much support he would get in Java -
the political heartland of Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet source admitted that there were difficulties,
especially in East Java, which he described as "the Achilles heel of
Golkar and Habibie".</P>
      <P>Support for Ms. Megawati Sukarnoputri, the chairman of the
Indoneisa Democratic Party (PDI-Perjuangan), and the enigmatic Mr.
Abdurrahman Wahid of the Nadhlatul Ulama, are strong in these areas.</P>
      <P>Besides this, there is a real challenge in Golkar from a small
group of urban-based intellectuals, like Marzuki Darusman, the head
of the party faction in Parliament.</P>
      <P>Political observers said that while Habibie "stood the best
chance of being nominated," Mr. Akbar had "a 20 to 30 percent
possibility", given his own strong backing within the party.</P>
      <P>Said a source who attended a party meeting in Jakarta last wee,:
"Akbar will back Habibie for personal reasons. But problems will
arise if Akbar's supporters go against the wishes of their leader and
reject Habibie at the upcoming leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>"The issue here is whether Akbar will get them to toe the line to
back Habibie or ride on their support and go for the throne himself.
We can never discount the latter possibility."

      <P>A group of ROC military doctors will
leave for Macedonia next week to offer humanitarian medical services
to ethnic Albanian refugees from the war-torn neighboring Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, a foreign affairs official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsiang-pu, director of the European Affairs Department of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), said he has consulted with
the Ministry of National Defense on the dispatch of military medical
professionals to Macedonia to replace a voluntary medical team
organized by the Luchu Hui, a private local philanthropic
organization.</P>
      <P>"The Defense Ministry has agreed to send a military medical team
to Macedonia to offer humanitarian relief services to Kosovar
refugees," Liu said, adding that the military medical team will stay
in Macedonia for one month.</P>
      <P>Liu said the military medical team will be composed of doctors
in general medicine, surgery, family medicine, obstetrics-gynecology
and dentistry.</P>
      <P>"The military doctors will leave for Macedonia in several groups
starting Monday," Liu said, adding that the MOFA will also ask local
public health authorities to send medical personnel to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Liu further said the ministry will decide whether to send
additional personnel and continue medical services to Kosovar
refugees two weeks before the military medical team's one-month
tenure expires.</P>
      <P>The Luchu Hui-organized voluntary medical team has operated a
field hospital at the Stenkovec refugee camp on the outskirts of the
Macedonian capital of Skopje for 10 days. The hospital offers
medical services to an average of 300 outpatients a day.</P>
      <P>Liu said as an Israel-operated field hospital in the area will
end its services soon, the workload for the Luchu Hui hospital is
expected to become even heavier.</P>
      <P>About 12 Luchu Hui doctors will continue to stay in Stenkovec,
the largest refugee camp in Macedonia, to offer medical services to
Kosovar refugees, while the other 14 Luchu team members will
leave Macedonia for home via Zurich on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China forged formal diplomatic ties with
Macedonia in January this year. The ROC has so far offered about

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS CONCERN ABOUT FOREIGN  LABORERS  IN HSINCHU IND. PARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators on Thursday expressed concern
about the large number of foreign laborers in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislators made the criticism after reviewing the park's
operation budget during a legislative committee.</P>
      <P>Su Huan-chih of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party said
that nearly 5,000 foreign laborers in the park pose a threat to the
local workers.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that the government has provided various incentives
to the manufacturers in the park, and the employment of large number
of cheap foreign laborers affects the employment opportunities of
local workers, a situation he said runs against the principle of
social justice.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to review the situation, adding that
labor cost in high-tech industries is not high and there should be no
need for cheap foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Feng Ting-kuo of the New Party asked the National Science Council
(NSC) to set a limitation on employing foreign laborers in the
industrial park so that local workers take precedence over foreign
ones.</P>
      <P>Feng noted that unemployment in Taiwan is serious and that park
manufacturers are only trying to save money by employing foreign
laborers.</P>
      <P>NSC Chairman Huang Chen-tai said that Hsinchu park currently
employs 72,000 workers. Among them more than 4,700 are foreign
workers. He noted that currently there are three shifts in the park's
plants, with the graveyard shift the most difficult to fill,
therefore most foreign laborers work that shift.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he agreed with Feng that local workers should
take precedence over foreign workers, but it is also true that the
plants have difficulty in recruiting workers for the graveyard shift.</P>
      <P>Huang said that NSC will study the issue further.</P>

      <P>Visiting President Kirsan Nikolayevich
Ilyumzhinov of the Kalmykia Republic on Thursday met with Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and expressed interest in creating sisterhood ties
between the Russian state and Taipei.</P>
      <P>Kalmykia, one of the 21 autonomous republics of the Russian
Federation, is the only Lamaist state in Europe. The country located
off the Caspian Sea has a population of 330,000.</P>
      <P>During the meeting with Ma, Ilyumzhinov presented Ma a blue silk
Hata to show his respect.</P>
      <P>Ma welcomed Ilyumzhinov and said he will seriously consider the
sisterhood ties proposal.</P>
      <P>Ma could not hide his surprise over the youth of Ilyumzhinov, 36
years old.</P>
      <P>Ilyumzhinov, who speaks fluent English, told Ma that he is
preparing to run in the Russian Federation presidential race slated
for June 2000. Ma wished Ilyumzhinov success and jokingly asked him
not to forget to send Taipei an invitation to the inauguration.</P>
      <P>Ilyumzhinov said Lamaists, or Tibetan Buddhists in his country
had been harshly treated during the Russian rule and that many
Lamaist temples had been dismantled. He has seen to it that 15
Lamaist temples have been rebuilt since taking office, he noted.</P>
      <P>Ilyumzhinov, meanwhile, urged Taiwan businesses to invest in
Kalmykia, where livestock and the oil industry are the main sources
of income for its people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has no plans to build a
third science-based industrial park, Huang Chen-tai, chairman of the
National Science Council, said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks while fielding questions during a
legislative committee.</P>
      <P>Legislators said that the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park,
the second industrial park following the Hsinchu park, still is
experiencing problems and therefore the government should not
consider building a similar park at this time.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the building of a third park will depend on a
lot of conditions, which he said included foreign and domestic
economic conditions and the manufacturers' assessment of the
prospective development of their industries.</P>
      <P>Huang said that if the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park turns
out to have excellent results, and high-tech manufacturers experience
difficulty in acquiring land for expansion, then it would be prudent
to consider building a third park.</P>
      <P>The Tainan industrial park currently has a sixty percent

    <HEADLINE>MAOIST INDOCTRINATION MAKES A COMEBACK IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong, April 22(CNA): Mainland China's propaganda tsars have
recently revived the Maoist ideological indoctrination campaign to
face a series of highly sensitive anniversaries this year, the
Hong Kong Standard reported today.</P>
      <P>The Cultural Revolution-style political sessions have also
recently made a comeback in the offices of party organs and
government agencies, the report said.</P>
      <P>Using a central leadership decision to launch a rectification
campaign earlier this year, the party's propaganda department has
recently asked all party cells within government agencies and army
units to resume their regular political sessions, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>The move, it added, marks the implementation of the decree by
President and party chief Jiang Ze-min on the so-called "three talks"
to strengthen ideology in officialdom.</P>
      <P>Jiang has recently asked cadres to "talk more about politics,
about morality and about learning".</P>
      <P>Using Jiang's instruction, the party Central Committee's
Propaganda Department has issued internal documents ordering party
cells in central agencies to resume the Maoist-style ideological
indoctrination campaign of "criticism and self-criticism".</P>
      <P>Propaganda tsar Ding Guan-gan has asked cadres to conduct e
 "face-to-face and back-to-back" indoctrination during the
political sessions, the report quoted sources as saying.</P>
      <P>"Face-to-face" refers to the practice of criticizing each other
by party members, while "back-to-back" means self-criticism.</P>
      <P>The sources said it was the most intense ideological
indoctrination campaign since 1989.</P>
      <P>Liberal officials reportedly said the conservatives were using
the leadership's concerns about a string of politically sensitive
anniversaries to upgrade the leftist campaign to consolidate their
power base.</P>
      <P>The mainland has seen several sensitive anniversaries pass
quietly. March marked the 10th anniversary of imposition of martial
law in the Tibetan capital Lhasa and the 40th anniversary of Tibet's
god-king, the Dalai Lama, fleeing his Himalayan homeland to exile in
India after an abortive uprising against communist rule.</P>
      <P>Last week also marked the 20th anniversary of the Communist Party
decision to crush the Democracy Wall movement in the same month. It
was also the 10th anniversary of the death of reform-minded Communist
Party general secretary Hu Yaobang, whose death sparked student-led
demonstrations for democracy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 22 (CNA): Australia's chicken meat industry is
waging an uphill battle to contain an outbreak of a virulent mutation
of Newcastle disease as the number of slaughtered birds surged to 1.5
million.</P>
      <P>The outbreak, which the industry described as different from that
of the endemic virus in mainland China and Hong Kong years ago, is
the worst-ever in Australia's chicken meat industry.</P>
      <P>While the slaughtering of birds continues the disease has spread
to 30 farms from the original three farms in the Mangrove Mountain
Ridge area in New South Wales.</P>
      <P>The 1.5 million slaughtered birds account for only a fraction of
the 300 million birds processed each year with a gross value of
about US$790 million. The industry employs more than 16,000 people
across Australia.</P>
      <P>The sources from the industry said the disease does not present a
health risk to consumers.</P>
      <P>Australia's chicken meat exports, mainly to Asian and European
countries, have grown steadily in recent years with sales totaling
about US$32 million in fiscal 1997-98, according to the industry

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 21 (CNA): Mainland China obtained at least
basic design information on several US nuclear weapons including the
W88 miniaturized nuclear warhead and neutron bomb, and its weapons
technical advances were due partly to espionage, according to a
Central Intelligence Agency report submitted to the US Congress
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CIA Director George Tenet also briefed congressional
intelligence committees Wednesday on the intelligence report
assessing the implications of mainland China's acquisition of US
nuclear secrets.</P>
      <P>Unclassified findings of the CIA report noted that the full
extent of weapons information acquired by Beijing could not be
determined and it is not sure whether any weapon design documentation
or blueprints were obtained. It was not known whether China had
shared with other countries classified nuclear weapons information it
obtained from the United States.</P>
      <P>But US intelligence officials believed that mainland
China probably used US design information as reference for its own
weapons development program, instead of duplicating American weapon
designs, said the report.</P>
      <P>It confirmed that mainland China obtained at least basic design
information on several US nuclear weapons, including the Trident II
W88 nuclear warhead, as well as information on a variety of American
weapon design concepts and features, including those of the neutron
bomb.</P>
      <P>The CIA report said Beijing has had the capability to develop a
multiple nuclear warhead system for its intercontinental ballistic
missiles for many years, but it has not done so. The US secrets
it acquired might help Beijing develop a multiple nuclear warhead for
a future mobile missile.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's weapons technical advances were due not only to
espionage, but also to contact with scientists from other countries
including the United States, conferences, publications, media
disclosures, declassified US weapons information and to Beijing's own
research, added the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S UNFRIENDLY GESTURES UNDERMINE CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's repeated, unfriendly gestures
toward Taiwan are not conducive to improving ties between Taiwan and
mainland China, said Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Lin
Chung-ping on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taipei has been consistent in its position on welcoming
a visit to Taiwan by Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and mainland China's top
negotiator with Taiwan. And Taipei has proposed that officials from
its Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) visit the mainland to make
preparations for the visit, he added.</P>
      <P>Lin discounted a recent report by the pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily
"Wen Wei Po" which said that Taipei has been turning a deaf ear to
Beijing's calls for preparatory arrangements for a SEF-ARATS
dialogue. He also rejected claims SEF has not responded to ARATS'
proposals to jointly organize cross-strait forums and seminars.</P>
      <P>The "Wen Wei Po" report also quoted ARATS officials as saying
that it is meaningless and inappropriate for SEF to send any of its
officials to the mainland now for talks on Wang's proposed Taiwan
visit since SEF has been reluctant to cooperate with ARATS on efforts
to improve exchanges between the two intermediary bodies.</P>
      <P>Lin said Beijing's high-handed attitude toward Taipei will only
boomerang, adding that the more Beijing attempts to pressure Taiwan,
the more alienated Taiwan's people will feel from mainland China.</P>
      <P>If Beijing is indeed serious in its intention to communicate with
Taipei, it should not attach preconditions to talks between the two
sides, as it has in the past and continues to do now, Lin said.
Instead, Beijing should try to win the hearts and minds of the people
living in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said Beijing is a master at attempting to manipulate
cross-strait talks by attaching preconditions and by raising the
stakes. Beijing has taken a tougher stance toward Taiwan since the
third quarter of last year, he said, adding that the change in
attitude came at a time when mainland China seemed unable to hold its
currency to a stable 8-1 ratio against the US dollar, when economic
reforms were slowing down and when social unrest was on the rise.</P>

      <P>Washington, April 21 (CNA): Members of the visiting
Legislative Yuan delegation from Taipei were told Wednesday by US
Congressional leaders that the recent visit of mainland Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji to Washington has not caused any damage to the
interests of Taiwan, and that the US remains committed to the safety
and security of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>House Republican Whip Tom Delay (R-TX) told Yao Eng-chi, leader
of the delegation, that Taiwan's national interests have not been
compromised due to Zhu's visit, and that things would go smoothly if
both Taipei and Beijing can join the WTO at the same time, although
Taiwan is more qualified than mainland China to enter the world trade
body.</P>
      <P>Delay said the United States remains committed to providing
Taiwan with weapons necessary for its safety and security.</P>
      <P>Sen. Craig Thomas (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, also said that US
congressional support for Taiwan has not diminished, and that the US
will continue to help Taiwan defend itself.</P>
      <P>Thomas said he has a hunch that Washington will reach an
agreement with Beijing on the latter's admission to the WTO within
this year. He expressed the hope that Taiwan will be able to enter
the WTO at the same time.</P>
      <P>The senator also expressed the hope that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait will resolve their differences peacefully over time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN, MAINLAND CHINA TREMBLE AS SMALLER NATIONS START TO RECOVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 22 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The economies of both Japan and mainland
China are starting to tremble as the smaller economies of Thailand
and South Korea are beginning to recover, according to The Australian
Financial Review on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Asia business editor Peter Hartcher in an analytical article
titled "When Strong Nations Start to Tremble" reported that Thailand
is expected achieve zero-percent growth while South Korea's economy
will grow by 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Hartcher said the real Asian economic crisis is slow and not
necessarily obvious, though much bigger in scale and more severe in
its consequences.</P>
      <P>"This crisis is less like a volcano and more like continental
drift -- you don't necessarily notice it as it's unfolding, but
eventually it rearranges the world," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the economies of both Japan and mainland China dominate
Asia's economic landscape. Japan now accounts for fully 70 percent of
the economy of Asia, while mainland China accounts for another 15
percent.</P>
      <P>The difference between the two big Asian economic powers from the
smaller ones is that Japan and mainland China do not depend on the
rest of the world to finance their economies, because both countries
run large current account surpluses, giving them relative immunity
from the whims of foreign investors.</P>
      <P>But if the two economies should begin to falter as smaller
economies begin to recover, it could have a serious effect on Asia's
economic future, according to the paper.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average number of hours worked per
week in Taiwan's non-agricultural sector stood at 44 last year, down
0.8 hours from the preceding year, according to the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>DGBAS statistics released on Thursday indicated that compared
with 10 years ago, the average number of hours worked per week has
fallen by 2.7 hours.</P>
      <P>The decrease was mainly attributed to the introduction of a
bi-monthly five-day work week by the government and some other
private enterprises last year.</P>
      <P>In the manufacturing sector, Taiwan's work week averaged 45.7
hours in 1998, higher than Hong Kong's 43.8 hours, but lower than
Singapore's 49.5 hours and South Korea's 47.8 hours.</P>
      <P>The average work week for American and European workers last year

    <HEADLINE>WATCH CENTER FILES CITIZEN'S SUITS AGAINST 5 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly formed Taiwan Watch Center
filed "citizen's suits" against five local-level governments on
Thursday in protest of their failure to take effective measures to
improve air quality.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that such a suit has been filed with the
Administrative Court since an amendment bill to the Air Pollution
Control Law cleared the legislature last year. The revised anti-air
pollution law legalizes the "citizen's suit" system for the first
time in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-lung, secretary-general of the Environmental Quality
Protection Foundation (EQPF) said the Taiwan Watch Center has filed
the suits as part of the celebrations of the 29th anniversary of
World Earth Day, which fell on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Watch Center was formed by the EQPF earlier this
month to oversee government enforcement of all environment-related
laws or regulations as well as detect Taiwan's environmental woes.</P>
      <P>The "citizen's suits" were filed against the Taipei County
Government, the Hsichu County Government, the Taichung City
Government, the Taichung County Government and the Yunlin County
Government for different reasons, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei County Government, the Taichung county Government and
the Taichung City Government were sued mainly because garbage
incinerators have emitted excessive amounts of poisonous dioxin for
many years.</P>
      <P>Liu said the three local-level governments should
immediately draw up concrete measures to reduce their dioxin
emissions to meet standard levels scheduled to take effect in
2001.</P>
      <P>The "citizen's suit" against the Hsinchu County Government was
filed in response to complaints from county residents that Ta-An
Aluminum Co. has consistently emitted smelly exhaust fumes.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Hsinchu County Government should ordered the
company to suspend operations and should not allow the company to
resume operations until its air pollution control facilities have
been improved to meet government requirements for exhaust emissions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Yunlin County Government was sued because two
major gravel factories in the county have not installed any
air-pollution control facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the new anti-air pollution law, the relevant local
governments should adopt effective measures to improve the air
pollution situation within 60 days after the Administrative Court
metes out a verdict.</P>
      <P>Liu said if the five county and city governments fail to take
actions, their chiefs and related government officials will face
charges of dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>Liu said the introduction of the "citizen's suit" is expected to
gradually change the direction of domestic environmental protection
drives. "If environmental officials at various levels fail to
strictly enforce environmental protection laws and regulations, they
will likely have to spend most of their time in courtrooms rather
than in their offices."</P>
      <P>In related news, more than 30 legislators from both ruling and
opposition parties have thrown their support behind a draft bill
calling for inclusion of the "citizen's suit" provisions to all
environment-related laws or statues.</P>
      <P>At present, only the anti-air pollution law has "citizen's suit"
provisions.</P>
      <P>"We hope all other environmental laws, such as the environmental
impact evaluation statue, the anti-water pollution law, the noise
control law, the toxic waste disposal law and the hazardous chemicals
disposal law, will include the 'citizen's suit' provisions to push
government authorities to tighten law enforcement and thus improve
our living environment," said Legislator Chao Yung-ching, who
initiated the amendment of the anti-air pollution law to introduce
the "citizen's suit" system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian
stressed the importance of safeguarding Taiwan's security in a
speech delivered to a Washington-based Taiwanese association on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is widely believed to seek the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) nomination to run in Taiwan's
next presidential election, said those in power are obligated to
avoid unnecessary sacrifice of lives and financial losses.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's persistent military threat, Chen
said Taiwan should tread the "middle of the road" to avoid an
outright confrontation with communist China and ensure the island's
sustained development and dignity.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has advocated a new "middle of the road" concept
with an aim to curb an outbreak of any ethnic conflicts on the
island while pursuing "composite security" in military, economic,
political, social and energy fields as well as Taiwan's security
under regional and global strategy.</P>
      <P>As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait lack mutual trust, chen
said he looks forward to see the two sides establish a military
dialogue mechanism to boost transparency in military information.</P>
      <P>Under such a mechanism, Chen said, the two sides can inform each
other of their military exercise plans and exchange visits by their
military officials.</P>
      <P>The DPP has been widely seen as a pro-Taiwan independence party.
During his three-day visit to the US capital, Chen has tried hard to
allay US policymakers and advisors' suspicion of his party's stances
on relations across the Taiwan Strait and on Taiwan's future status.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that both the DPP and he himself will respect the
common wish of Taiwan people concerning the island's future.</P>
      <P>Over the past three days, Chen has met with seven senators and
five congressmen as well as China hands with five noted
Washington-based think tanks. Chen is also believed to have met with
several American officials in charge of Asian-Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>During those meetings, Chen reportedly has repeatedly expressed
his concern about Taiwan's security, urging his American hosts to
continue supporting legislative bills related to Taiwan's security
and well-being. Chen reportedly also has exchanged views with his
American hosts on Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization
and the feasibility of the island's participation in the US-proposed
theater missile defense (TMD) system.</P>
      <P>Chen said his Washington visit is mainly aimed at increasing
mutual understanding and getting rid of misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived here on Sunday and he will travel to New York on
Thursday to continue his "journey of learning" designed to boost his
presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Chen's global "journey of learning" already took him to Japan,
South Korea and Mongolia to increase his contact with foreign
politicians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC PROSPECT INDICATOR SHOWS YELLOW-BLUE LIGHT FOR MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In light of a better export performance
and a continuing infusion of public investments, Taiwan's economic
prospect indicator showed a yellow-blue light again for March,
according to government figures.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is
scheduled to publish next Tuesday its economic prospect indicator for
March 1999. Taiwan's composite economic indicator for March is
expected to score a figure between 17 and 18, which is about the same
figure as in the previous month.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the economic prospect indicator is ahead of
actual economic performance by one month. A yellow-blue light for
March together with no breakthrough in Taiwan's composite economic
performance means that the economic situation in April will be much
the same as it was in February.</P>
      <P>In other words, Taiwan's economy has not bottomed out and begun
recovering yet. A resurgence is expected to be evident after May,
when a stable economic upturn will be seen in both Taiwan's economy
and in those of its Southeast Asian neighbors, said CEPD officials.</P>
      <P>Southeast Asian countries will increase their imports from Taiwan
after their economies experience a stable resurgence. In addition,
the United States' economy is expected to remain robust, at least for
the near future, and this will also benefit Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic performance has also been helped by the
Executive Yuan's program to expand domestic demand. With an inflow of
private investment, including the construction of a high-speed
railway and a power plant, economic recovery in Taiwan is certain,
CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>As for the CEPD's individual indicators, the industrial product
index's annual growth rate rose to 7.9 percent, resulting in a green
light; the growth rate in exports after clearing customs rose to 8.5
percent, resulting in a green light; and annual growth rate in new
orders for manufacturers may rise by 6 to 10 percent, resulting in
another green light.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's product inventory rate is expected to weigh in at 68
percent to 72 percent, resulting in a yellow-blue light,
non-agricultural employment is expected to increase 1 percent to 2
percent, while its indicator light will remain unchanged.</P>

(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew
rejected on Thursday a prediction by the International Monetary Fund
that the ROC's economy would grow this year by less than 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew made the remarks after the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) presented a report to the
Executive Yuan on its plan to strengthen Taiwan's economic structure.</P>
      <P>Siew pointed out first-quarter indicators show that Taiwan's
economy is recovering, while the Statistics Department of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has published a report on nine
main economic indicators that also contain signs of economic
recovery.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's recent economic indicators -- including those for
exports, industrial production, investments and the wholesale price
index -- have all demonstrated constant gains, and plans to expand
domestic demand have been carried out, Siew said, adding that are all
signs of economic revival.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Statistics Department also presented a report on nine
major indicators of the ROC's economic condition, including exports
that have cleared customs and the stock market. According to the
indicators, Taiwan's economy is now in the midst of a gradual
upswing, and this year's economic growth picture looks positive.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics, the annual growth rate of
customs-clearing exports this year was 3.5 percent, much higher than
original predictions of minus 5.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Export orders grew from minus 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter
of last year to 2.7 percent in the first quarter of 1999, while the
annual growth rate of industrial production has returned to last
year's standard level of more than 5 percent.</P>
      <P>In view of this year's economic growth, Taiwan's leading
semiconductor companies -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and
United Microelectronics Corp. -- have each added a NT$10 billion
investment and have a predicted annual growth of 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of companies that went out of business in January was
down more than 10 percent -- the first time in 12 months that the
figure has declined.</P>
      <P>The Statistics Department pointed out that the local bourse
finished at 7,474 points on Wednesday, an increase of 2,052 points,
or a 38 percent, from its Feb. 5 level of 5,422 points. Meanwhile,
daily turnover has advanced from NT$55 billion to NT$149.10 billion,
which is another sign of a reviving economy.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United Nations is planning an
emergency peacekeeping mission despite a peace deal reached between
warring factions in East Timor after the visit of Indonesian armed
forces chief Gen. Wiranto.</P>
      <P>The Security Council has discussed the weekend's bloody rampage
by Indonesian-sponsored militias in the former Portuguese colony in
which at least 30 Timorese civilians and some pro-independence
supporters were gunned down.</P>
      <P>The Timorese political factions -- pro-independence and
pro-integration groups -- on Wednesday signed a peace accord at a
meeting brokered by Wiranto and Dili's Bishop Carlos Belo. But the
hasty truce did not mention any surrender of arms between the warring
factions.</P>
      <P>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked that plans for a
peacekeeping mission be developed in case violence in East Timor
increases.</P>
      <P>Political analysts and officials in Australia and other Western
countries are unsure how long the truce will last as the
UN-supervised vote to decide the future of East Timor in July draws
near.</P>
      <P>Indonesian President B.J. Habibie still insists that security in
the territory is solely his country's concern, meaning Indonesian
armed forces and police will continue to be stationed in East Timor
even after autonomy is ensured in the July voting.</P>
      <P>Under the UN plan, Australia is expected to play a significant
role in sending a peacekeeping force to East Timor if warring
factions resume their fighting and if pro-integration militias resume
their bloody rampage in Dili and other cities, analysts said.</P>
      <P>But senior UN officials said the peacekeeping troops would not
fight the militias. Instead they would be used to maintain order
either with the aid of Indonesian troops or in their absence.</P>
      <P>Annan would first need to win Habibie's approval before the UN
peacekeeping troops are sent to East Timor.</P>
      <P>"So far, that agreement is not there, but we have to prepare for
the possibility that the situation descends into complete chaos and
Indonesia changes its mind on UN support," one senior UN official
said.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
received visiting Russian scholar Alexander Yakovlev on Thursday, and
exchanged views with him on political and economic reforms.</P>
      <P>Lee explained Taiwan's constitutional reforms of the past decade,
including the abolishment of the Period of National Mobilization for
Suppression of the Communist Rebellion, and the lifting of a ban on
publishing newspapers and forming political parties.</P>
      <P>He told Yakovlev that the ROC president is now elected by popular
vote, and that the country can now be described as a completely
democratic country.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the people of Taiwan have overcome their past
sorrows, and are now leading happy lives.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC government is focusing its attention on judicial,
education and spiritual reforms, with the aim of developing the
island into a modern and civilized country.</P>
      <P>Yakovlev said that Russia has not yet found the proper direction
for its reforms, which is why his country's reforms have failed to
produce satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>Addressing the subject of nationalism, Yakovlev said he has
written articles to express his opposition to nationalism, but added
that his view is not accepted by the Russian authorities.</P>
      <P>Lee said that during peacetime, there is no need to incite
nationalism, but pointed out that mainland China has been encouraging
nationalism with the intention of countering the world's big powers.</P>
      <P>He described the Beijing move as "quite dangerous" and "unwise."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's computer giant Acer and the
world's largest business software designer, Computer Associates, on
 hursday inaugurated a joint venture to produce business software in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Acer Chairman Stan Shih, and Computer Associates' Chairman
Charles B. Wang signed a memorandum on the as-yet unnamed joint

      <P>During the ceremony, Shih said that he hopes the new venture will
change the perception of the island as a hardware rather than
software manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's third-largest semiconductor maker, but
ranks only 23th in terms of software manufacture, said Shih.</P>
      <P>The primary stage of the joint venture will see software designed
by Computer Associates brought into Taiwan, and the long term, will
focus on the development of financial management software for local
small- and medium-sized businesses.</P>
      <P>They will also cooperate with an accounting firm to design a
computerized accounting system for local small- and medium-sized
firms which is intended to run on a computer specially manufactured

    <TEXT>
      <P>The families of three crew members killed
in a Daily Air helicopter crash on Wednesday will each receive
compensation of NT$10.2 million, a Daily Air executive said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Three hours after the bodies of the three crew were found at the
crash scene in a mountainous area near the town of Juifang, Taipei
County, an anonymous Daily Air executive said that the families of
the dead pilot, co-pilot and a third crew member will get the same
compensation as three other Daily Air crewmen who died in a similar
helicopter crash last year.</P>
      <P>Daily Air tried on Thursday afternoon to help the families of the
dead get to the crash scene, but gave up as night fell on the rugged
mountainous area.</P>
      <P>A company executive said that they will take the families to the
scene by helicopter on Friday.</P>
      <P>Although the remains of the three crew members, as well as the
cockpit voice recorder, have already been found, the rescue crew was
ordered to leave them untouched pending on-site examinations by
prosecutors and coroners.</P>
      <P>Daily Air flight B5550 took off from Taipei's Sungshan Airport at
10:18 a.m. on Wednesday. Bound for the eastern city of Taitung, the
chopper was to provide an air link between Taitung and Orchid Island,
which lies to the east of the southeastern city.</P>
      <P>Air controllers at Sungshan lost contact with flight B5550 about
10 minutes after takeoff, and a search helicopter spotted the
wreckage of the craft at the top of a 757-meter hilltop on Thursday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>The accident has raised concern among legislators over the
airworthiness and safety record of Daily Air, which has now lost two
helicopters in as many years.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-lang called on the Civil Aeronautics
Administration on Thursday to ground the airline pending
comprehensive safety checks.</P>

      <P>The Science, Technology and Information

forbid the under-construction Tainan Science-based Park from
employing foreign workers.</P>
      <P>The committee also adopted a resolution requiring the Hsinchu

labor force from the current 6.5 percent to 3 percent within two
years.</P>
      <P>Despite lobbying efforts by the National Science Council (NSC),

the opposition Democratic Progressive Party and the New Party.</P>
      <P>A shocked NSC Chairman Hwang Jenn-tai said that he would respect

resolutions only if they comply with related laws.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Governor Perng
Fai-nan said on Thursday that local banks should seek mergers with
foreign banks and cultivate more talent in their workforces to
achieve genuine globalization.</P>
      <P>The CBC governor made the call while delivering a keynote speech
at a seminar on the Asian financial crisis and restructuring of the
shattered economies of the regions in the wake of the crisis.</P>
      <P>Perng suggested that local banks jointly set up holding companies
as a way of merging with foreign banks overseas. Under such a
scenario, Taiwan-based banks would be able to extend their clientele
from Taiwan businessmen abroad to local enterprises and individuals,
he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Asia's economic recovery, Perng said he believes that
the worst of the region's financial woes have already passed.</P>
      <P>Turning to the recent influx of foreign capital into Taiwan,
Perng said the infusion of foreign funds has contributed noticeably

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO AX TARIFFS BEFORE ENTERING WTO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to make a major,
across-the-board cut in its import tariffs in preparation for its
admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO), sources from the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The MOF will amend relevant statutes before September to ax
import tariffs on 8,100 categories of commodities and goods from
abroad. The cuts will be the largest ever in Taiwan's import history,
MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>The cuts will cost Taiwan an estimated NT$22.4 billion (US$683
million) in tariff revenues in the first year after its WTO
admission, and a cumulative loss of NT$48.2 billion (US$1.47 billion)
in the first four years after its admission, said Liu Rong-chu,
director of the MOF's Department of Customs Administration.</P>
      <P>The tariff reductions are also poised to lower Taiwan's average
weighted import tariff from its current level of 8.25 percent to 7.55
percent in the first year after its WTO admission. The largest tariff
reductions will be in the area of agricultural products, where
tariffs are slated to be reduced from a 1997 average of 15.12 percent
to 8.71 percent.</P>
      <P>Reductions of the average weighted tariff on agricultural
products would amount to 35.58 percent if a comparison were made
between 1994 and 2004 tariff levels, Liu said.</P>
      <P>As a result of the reductions, Taiwan's chicken, beef, citrus and
grapes are expected to sustain the greatest impact with increased
imports, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the average weighted tariff on imported industrial
products will fall by 0.68 percent to 3.96 percent in the first year
after Taiwan's WTO admission, he added.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan has completed bilateral consultations with the 26
WTO member countries that have asked for such talks, and other
related talks and agreements necessary before Taiwan is admitted into
the world trade regulatory body are expected to conclude before long.</P>
      <P>Mainland China promised to make a major concession in regard to
its import tariffs during Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United
States in early April. That promise has helped push forward mainland
China and Taiwan's bid to join the WTO, Liu said, adding that he is
optimistic that Taiwan will be admitted before the end of this year.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic violence is no longer a family
affair, with the establishment of the Domestic Violence Prevention
and Control Committee under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI),
Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said on Friday.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony marking the committee's inception, Huang said the
organization would serve as a government arm for intervening in cases
of domestic violence and abuse. Previously there was no legal
authority for such intervention, he noted.</P>
      <P>With the implementation of the Domestic Violence Prevention and
Control Law late last year and the creation of the new committee, law
enforcement agencies will no longer be barred from households in
which violence and abuse are occurring, he said.</P>
      <P>The committee, with 21 contracted commissioners, will commit
itself to accomplishing 10 major tasks in the following year,
including the improvement of relevant statutes in regard to the
prevention and control of domestic violence, the establishment of a
nationwide domestic violence prevention and control system and the
creation of an alarm mechanism and an information databank, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said, the MOI will ask the governments of
Taipei, Kaohsiung and other cities and counties around the island to
establish similar centers to help control domestic abuse and to
eradicate domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Taiwan society has recently witnessed an increase in domestic
violence, including cases of children murdering their parents and
parents abusing their children.</P>
      <P>On Friday, another such case was reported, as a man was charged
with killing his 69-year-old mother with a fruit knife before
attempting to commit suicide. The man, who survived his
self-inflicted knife wounds, said he killed his mother because of a
quarrel over an inheritance, according to police.</P>
      <P>A recent survey showed that between 11.7 percent and 35 percent
of Taiwan's women are living under the threat of domestic violence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US LAWMAKERS WRITE PRESIDENT LEE ON TRA ANNIVERSARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 50 US senators jointly
sent a letter to President Lee Teng-hui on the 20th anniversary of
the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) to reaffirm US
commitment to the security and well being of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, presented a copy of the letter Wednesday to Vice
President Yao Eng-chi of the Legislative Yuan, when he and 10
other legislators visited the Senate.</P>
      <P>Among those who signed the letter were Senate majority leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.); Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Judiciary
Committee; Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), chairman of the Energy
Committee; and Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.</P>
      <P>More than 100 members of the US House of Representatives also
wrote a similar letter to President Lee.</P>
      <P>In March, 1979 the US Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act
and President Jimmy Carter signed it into law in the following month.
The law, which provides a legal basis for the continuation of US
relationship with Taiwan after the switch of diplomatic recognition
from Taipei to Beijing on Jan. 1, 1979 , "represents the continued
commitment of the American people to preserve a vital relationship
with a long-standing ally," wrote the senators.</P>
      <P>They noted that 20 years ago, no one could have predicted how
successful this relationship would be. Over the past two decades,
Taiwan has established an extraordinary record as a prosperous
democracy.</P>
      <P>Economically, Taiwan has grown to become the world's 15th-largest
trading country and the seventh-largest trading partner of the United
States. "Taiwan now shares its well-deserved prosperity with other
nations through a variety of official and unofficial assistance
programs," added the letter.</P>
      <P>Politically, the senators continued, Taiwan has become a
full-fledged democracy. Today the people on Taiwan enjoy the full
exercise of political freedom, including freedom of speech, freedom
of the press and the freedom to organize political parties. "Taiwan
serves as the model of democracy in a region of the world very much
in need of a good example."</P>
      <P>"The people of Taiwan deserve the credit for these
accomplishments, but it has been the Taiwan Relations Act that has
allowed the United States to stand side by side with our friends on
Taiwan as they have overcome numerous challenges and met with
unprecedented success. We salute you and the people of Taiwan for
your perseverance and your creativity in working with the United
States through the unique diplomatic mechanism which is the Taiwan
Relations Act," they wrote.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan Relations Act provides a special role for the Senate
of the United States. For that reason, we are especially pleased and
honored to extend our congratulations for a successful two decades of
cooperation. As we continue to cooperate in the years ahead, please
be reassured of our commitment so effectively expressed in the Taiwan
Relations Act to the security, and the social and economic well being
of Taiwan," said the senators.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu will leave
for the Marshall Islands on April 29 for a three-day visit aimed
at further boosting relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>This will be Hu's first visit to the Marshall Islands since the
Republic of China forged formal diplomatic ties with the North
Pacific island nation last November.</P>
      <P>Hu will head a large delegation, composed of legislators from
various political parties, officials in charge of tourist, fishery
and investment affairs, industry and business executives, and
journalists, on his good-will visit.</P>
      <P>During his stay there, Hu will attend a ceremony marking the 20th
anniversary of the establishment of the Marshall Islands'
constitutional autonomous government on May 1.</P>
      <P>Hu will also meet with Marshall Islands President Imata Kabua,
Foreign Minister Phillip Muller and other senior officials to
exchange views on matters of mutual concern, including feasible ways
to promote bilateral cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>On May 1, Hu will sign agreements with relevant Marshall Islands
officials on the promotion and protection of investment in each
other's countries as well as on the exemption of double taxation on
investors.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hu will attend a ground-breaking ceremony for

      <P>George Jin-gou Chang, director of the East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a news
conference on Friday that the donation is aimed at helping the
Marshall Islands boost its tourist industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING STALLING OVER ARATS CHIEF VISIT: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is delaying a visit of
Taiwan officials to arrange for a visit to Taiwan of the mainland's
top negotiator with Taiwan, to the great disappointment of the
Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), who recently returned from an April 8-15 visit to the United
States, said on Friday that it seems that mainland China wants to
delay the trip and that the US shares the opinion that mainland China
is stalling Wang's visit.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that Taiwan has suggested to the mainland that Jan
Jyn-horng, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), lead a delegation to visit the mainland to exchange
views on matters related to Wang's visit.</P>
      <P>But he said that the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), the SEF's Beijing-based counterpart, replied last
week only that it is preparing for Wang's visit, and would like to
invite SEF officials "at an appropriate time."</P>
      <P>Lin noted that when SEF Chairman Koo Cheng-fu visited the
mainland in October, Wang promised to visit Taiwan in spring this
year.</P>
      <P>Lin said the SEF had therefore planned to expect Wang in the
spring. During deputy secretary general-level talks between the SEF
and ARATS on March 18, the SEF invited Wang to visit Taiwan on April
29, or the sixth anniversary of the Koo-Wang talks in Singapore which
helped establish the framework of cross-strait dialogue after a
hiatus of nearly five decades.</P>
      <P>But according to Lin, ARATS denied any agreement on a spring
visit had been made, and suggested instead an autumn date.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the SEF believes Wang's visit will be more
significant if related discussions and arrangements can be completed
before his arrival in Taiwan, and urged the mainland to consider the
proposal seriously.</P>
      <P>Touching on mainland China's claim that the so-called "Taiwan
issue" cannot be postponed indefinitely, Lin said that the attitude
is not conducive to positive cross-Taiwan Strait development, and
added that during his recent meetings with US officials, they agreed
with his views.</P>
      <P>Lin further said that the mainland has long realized that the
Taiwan issue is a long-term, complex and difficult one, and that it
will be impossible to achieve unification in the short term, or to
deal with it by force.</P>
      <P>Lin also revealed that Taiwan has proposed a military mutual
trust mechanism to the mainland, which has been rejected by Beijing.
He noted that Taiwan hopes that there will be positive cross-strait
exchanges, including exchanges of military personnel, exchanges of
information on military exercises and more transparency with regard
to military buildups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABANDONMENT OF BABY GIRLS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The abandonment of baby girls by parents
in mainland China is becoming a serious problem, and a former
minister has called for society to address the issue, as the
government seems unable to cope with, according to a report in The
Australian.</P>
      <P>Beijing correspondent Lynne O'Donnell quoted Peng Peiyun, a
former minister of family planning who is now a vice chairman of the
national legislature, as making the call in the government's official
mouthpiece, The People's Daily. She said mainland orphanages were
overflowing and unable to cope with the increasing number of
daughters being given up by parents preferring sons, who can carry on
the family name.</P>
      <P>Swelling orphanages are just the tip of the larger problem of
females being treated as commodities in mainland China, Peng said.
There is also a burgeoning market of young women who are kidnapped
and then sold into virtual slavery in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that in all its various guises, the abuse of
mainland Chinese females is a modern manifestation of an archaic
penchant of Chinese families to produce boys.</P>
      <P>Peng said the number of daughters being abandoned has increased
rapidly in recent years, while mainland social organizations are
ill-equipped to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>In mainland orphanages, abandoned children -- mostly girls or
children with disabilities -- now outnumber orphans. "The issue of
abandoned babies has already become a social problem that cannot be
ignored," she said.</P>
      <P>The issue of abandonment is extremely sensitive in mainland
China, particularly as it highlights widespread disregard for
population control policies outside carefully supervised cities. But
local officials can often be bribed to turn a blind eye to violations
of the country's official one-child policy, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MARCH JOBLESS RATE AT SINGLE-MONTH HIGH SINCE 1983</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate stood at 2.84
percent in March, the highest jobless level for that month since
1983, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>Due to the economic slowdown, and the seasonal factor -- which
sees employees quitting their jobs and seeking new ones after the
Chinese Lunar New Year, which usually falls in February -- both the
unemployment and the broadly-defined jobless rate in March shot up to
a new high, while the labor participation rate dropped to a new low,
DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The broadly-defined jobless rate hit a record high of 4.37
percent in March. This rate refers to the unemployment rate plus long
term unemployed who are not seeking employment. In this sector,
152,000 were out of a job in March, 5,000 more than the figure posted
for February, and a 16-year March record.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of people who lost their jobs in March
because of workplace closure or business downsizing totaled 97,000,
3,000 more than the February figure, and a new March record since
1983, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>On average, the labor participation rate was 57.52 percent in
March, the lowest March level since 1982. The labor participation
rate is the ratio of the working population to the population aged 15
and over.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said they expected the unemployment rate to fall
in April and May when the seasonal factor is traditionally at a
minimum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada was annoyed Thursday by US
officials airing an airborne combat video mistakenly identified as
being Canadian in origin.</P>
      <P>The video, taken from an attacking aircraft, centers on what NATO
said is a Yugoslav army barracks surrounded by civilian buildings. A
"smart" bomb then hits the target, destroying it.</P>
      <P>Ottawa immediately denied the video was made by Canadian CF-18
fighter jets, as claimed by the Pentagon. US officials later admitted
they had made a mistake; the attacking planes were from another,
unidentified NATO country.</P>
      <P>Canada considers it a breach of security to reveal the names of
countries responsible for specific attacks.</P>
      <P>"NATO guidelines are in fact not to divulge who has released
weaponry," Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton said. "That's what
we follow and that's what we believe to be the proper thing to do."</P>
      <P>Canada has "a small pilot community, and we don't want them
exposed to harassment or security problems" as a result of "being
identified with any specific attack," Eggleton said.</P>
      <P>It does not seem that Canada will formally protest the tape's
release. According to Eggleton, Canadian officials were in "contact"

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A police briefing on city crime on Friday
told Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou that the rotten social order of
Taiwan's largest city is improving.</P>
      <P>Police statistics reveal that more than 7,500 crimes of theft and
robbery were reported in Taipei in the first three months of this
year, down 800 cases from the same period of last year. 5,200 of the
crimes consisted of motorcycle theft.</P>
      <P>In terms of violent crimes such as homicide, assault and battery,
176 cases were reported during the three-month period, 130 of which,
along with several similar previously unsolved cases were dealt with,
according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Although the general crime rate declined, police said robberies
still accounted for a major part of all the criminal activities that
have threatened the lives and property of the city's residents. Most
of these robberies were in the form of pedestrians being robbed by
motorists, the police reported.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Ma said that despite the evidence
showing a significant decrease in crime, he believes that the real
indicator of whether social order has improved comes from public
opinion.</P>
      <P>Only when Taipei's citizens really have a sense of safety can
social order be regarded as having improved, said Ma.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the demands of the mayor, the Taipei City Police
Headquarters (TCPH) has formulated a package of anti-crime strategies
including establishing systems of community policing, neighborhood
watches, and crime prevention, TCPH officers said.</P>
      <P>The strategies are designed to prevent crime, a key move in the
maintenance of social order, and a special task force with this

    <HEADLINE>ADB WARNS OF RISKS AMID SIGNS OF RECOVERY IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) made an
optimistic projection of Asia's economic outlook for 1999 but also
warned of "many, many risks" in its forecast.</P>
      <P>"Most of the severely affected economies (in Asia) show signs of
recovery, but the economic sectors do continue to deteriorate," said
the bank's vice president, Peter Sullivan. He forecast Asia's economy
will grow an average of 4.4 percent this year, up from last year's
2.6 percent.</P>
      <P>During a speech at the National Press Club, Sullivan cited poor
performance in the banking sector last year as one of the risks that
could impede reforms in Asia. Unrecoverable loans, which account for
20 percent to 35 percent of sector portfolios in Indonesia, Malaysia
and Thailand, displaced strong financial reform programs, he said.</P>
      <P>Financial flows into the region are uncertain, Sullivan
continued. He cited a prediction by the World Bank of further
reductions in capital flows and of a more prolonged crisis in
developing countries worldwide.</P>
      <P>At the corporate level, these uncertainties make forecasting
returns on investments difficult, he said. Conservative investment
strategies therefore are likely to continue to restrain flows over
the medium term, he added.</P>
      <P>Another risk factor is the high degree to which today's global
market is interconnected. Sullivan said the examples of Brazil and
Russia, which have affected Asia's prospects, indicates that any
unexpected slowdown in North America, Europe or Japan would reduce
the chances of Asian economies increasing their exports and would
further stall recovery.</P>
      <P>Finally, he said the ADB's upbeat forecast assumes that Asian
countries will press on with their own domestic reform efforts. That
looks likely, "but it depends on political and social stability and
continued commitment to reform," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The human cost and environmental degradation are also worth
policy makers' attention, he said. Rising unemployment, growth in the
ranks of the poor and nearly poor, inflation that has bitten into
real income and shrinking government budgets that include cutbacks on
social services have all taken their toll, he said.</P>
      <P>In rural areas, problems have been complicated by environmental
disruption through increased deforestation and over fishing, he
noted.</P>
      <P>In Indonesia, school enrollment has sharply fallen, and if not
reversed, the trend could create a lost generation of poorly educated
workers. "That will hold back future growth," he warned.</P>

      <P>Singapore is putting in place a scheme
to help developing countries cope with the Y2K computer bug,
Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan said at the
opening of a Y2K symposium on Thursday.</P>
      <P>From the middle of this year, training will be provided free of
charge to any developing country in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum which wants it.</P>
      <P>Lee said it might already be too late for organizations to look
for technical Y2K solutions, and that participants could be thinking
about sharing plans to deal with domestic and cross-boarder problems.</P>
      <P>Such planning would also reassure the public and avoid
unnecessary panic, he said.</P>
      <P>The two-day APEC Y2K symposium was focused on the cross-border
impact of the millennium bug in key sectors such as
telecommunications, financial services, customs, transportation and
energy, as well as examining problems unique to small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It is being attended by more than
300 representatives from the 21 APEC countries.</P>
      <P>Singapore expects all its key government systems and service
providers to be Y2K-ready within the next 60 days, and all government
agencies are finalizing contingency plans in case of unexpected
disruptions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAGAZINES CLOSED DOWN BEFORE "TIANANMEN ANNIVERSARY"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Beijing regime has shut down two
liberal publications and has prohibited cadres from publicly
expressing dissent in new measures aimed at stifling dissent ahead of
the sensitive June 4 Tiananmen Square anniversary, the Hong Kong
Standard reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Another measure requires police permission for gatherings of more
than 20 people, the report revealed.</P>
      <P>It quoted a Beijing source as saying that the authorities had
ordered the closure of two liberal magazines -- the Guanchawencong,
(Observers' Digest) and Sansipinglun (Commentaries of the Three
Thoughts).</P>
      <P>Both magazines are regarded as a forum for liberal scholars to
discuss various social issues.</P>
      <P>The Guanchawencong is a publication of the state-run Economic
Daily.</P>
      <P>The Jiangxi-based Sansipinglun is an outspoken publication that
addresses science and social issues.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the closures are aimed at eradicating
"unlawful publications."</P>
      <P>It noted that the authorities were usually "lenient" toward these
publications, which are enthusiastic in discussing social issues but
stop short of touching sensitive subjects, such as the June 4
crackdown.</P>
      <P>The report said the ban would be enforced only in the run-up to
the June 4 anniversary and would be lifted in late summer when the
country celebrates its 50th anniversary in a relatively festive
political atmosphere.</P>
      <P>"Apart from the closure of the magazines, a punitive system has
also been established to prevent party cadres from publicly voicing
dissent during the sensitive period around June," the report quoted
another source in Beijing as saying.</P>
      <P>According to an order from the central leadership, cadres face
immediate dismissal from their posts for public statements of
dissent. The order applies to all party organs and government
offices, universities, think-tanks and other semiofficial
institutions, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA PREMIER'S US VISIT WILL NOT AFFECT TAIWAN'S INTERESTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting parliamentary group from
the Republic of China said here on Thursday that mainland Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji's recent US visit has not affected Taiwan's
national interests.</P>
      <P>The delegation, headed by Legislative Yuan Vice President Yao
Eng-chi, was composed of 11 legislators of different political
stripes.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Chih-hui, a member of the ruling Kuomintang, told
a news conference at the Taipei Representative Office in Washington,
D.C. that the delegation reached its conclusion after meeting with
several congressional leaders, think tank researchers and officials
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the office of the US
Trade Representative.</P>
      <P>"After a two-day stay in Washington, D.C., we have reached the
conclusion that Zhu's just-concluded US visit has neither undermined
US commitment to Taiwan nor affected Taiwan's bid to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO)," Shen said.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that American officials had told the ROC
delegation that the United States expects to complete bilateral talks
with mainland China on terms for Beijing's WTO accession within the
next few weeks.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's WTO membership, Shen quoted American officials as
saying that the United States will join forces with the 15-member
European Union and Japan to push for Taipei and Beijing's
simultaneous WTO entry.</P>
      <P>Shen said this was the first time since its inauguration early
this year that the ROC's Fourth Legislative Yuan has formed a group
to visit the United States.</P>
      <P>"This is mainly because we are concerned about possible adverse
impact on Taiwan's security as a result of Zhu's US visit," Shen
noted, adding that after extensive talks with American officials and
lawmakers, the delegation members believe that US determination to
maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait has remained
unchanged and its support for Taiwan's WTO bid has also not been
weakened simply because of Zhu's visit.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Shen said she does not think that Taiwan will be
able to join the WTO ahead of mainland China. "Because of political
factors, the most likely scenario is that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait are admitted to the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body
simultaneously," she predicted.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
keeping a close watch on the situation in Indonesia as the Southeast
Asian country will hold a parliamentary election on June 7, a senior
ministry official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>George Jin-gou Chang, director of the MOFA's East Asian and
Pacific Affairs Department, made the statement at the ministry's
routine weekly news conference.</P>
      <P>Chang said with the election day approaching, the Indonesian
situation has shown signs of increasing tension.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC government is concerned about the
security of Taiwan business people and their families there, Chang
said the MOFA and the ROC representative office in Indonesia have
both been closely monitoring developments there.</P>
      <P>Chang said Lin Shui-chi, new ROC representative to Indonesia,
signed a memorandum of understanding with the Bandung police
chief earlier this month on intensified protection of ROC
expatriates' security. Bundung, a booming city in western Java, is a
major Taiwan investment destination.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC representative office has issued a warning to
ROC expatriates residing in the Bandung area, urging them to
heighten alert in order to protect their own safety.</P>
      <P>Anti-ethnic Chinese riots broke out in many Indonesian cities
last year, forcing the ROC to evacuate its expatriates from that
country at one point.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC representative office in Jakarta has made an
overall review of its previous emergency relief measures and will
make necessary improvements.</P>
      <P>"The representative office has kept close contact with Taiwan
trade associations in various Indonesian cities or areas as well as
forges cordial ties with Indonesian law enforcement
authorities and other related agencies," Chang noted.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Indonesian situation generally remains
stable at the moment, except for some remote areas where sporadic
religious and ethnic conflicts have been reported.</P>
      <P>If the situation there gets worse, Chang said the MOFA will call
an inter-ministerial meeting to work out feasible measures to cope
with the situation and ensure safety of all ROC nationals residing
in Indonesia.</P>

      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu
said on Friday that only 4,491 import items will be subjected to a
large cut of customs rates after Taiwan joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while reporting on the government's pace in
negotiations with WTO members seeking to enter the Geneva-based
world trade regulatory body to a Legislative Yuan committee.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside local media reports that customs rates on about
8,100 import items will be reduced following Taiwan's admission to
the WTO, Lin said, deducting those import items whose customs rates
have been already cut and those whose import duties need not to be
adjusted, only 4,491 items are covered in that area. Over 3,400 of
the 4,491 items are industrial goods, while the rest are agricultural
products, he added.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Vice Chairman Ling Shiang-nung said
the Taiwan's agricultural sector will suffer an estimated loss worth
NT$34 billion (US$1.02 billion) in the first year after Taiwan is
admitted to the WTO, and that the figure may rise to NT$54 billion in
the sixth year. Products such as beef, chicken, grapes and oranges 
will be hardest hit, he added.</P>
      <P>In a bid to minimize the impact of the WTO's membership on the
Taiwan agricultural sector, Ling revealed that COA has allocated
NT$21 billion in fund with an aim to help local farmers tide over the
difficult time.</P>

      <P>The Technology and Information Committee of the Legislative Yuan
passed a resolution Thursday requesting the National Science Council
(NSC) to establish a quota for the employment of non-high-tech
personnel, and to ban the employment of foreigners in the Tainan SIP.</P>
      <P>The resolution was passed on the grounds that the SIP
manufacturers are subsidized by the government. In a supplementary
resolution, the committee demanded the Hsinchu SIP cut its foreign
labor to 3 percent from the present 6.5 percent within two years.</P>
      <P>However, NSC Chairman C.T. Huang cautioned the Legislative
committee's resolution might violate current law.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said the question of whether there should be a ban
or a quota for foreign laborers in the SIP, should be assessed by the
foreign labor policy evaluation sub-committee of the Legislature. The
evaluation sub-committee should take all factors into consideration
prior to making a final decision. Factors involved are: domestic
unemployment, economic development prospects and the condition of
demand and supply for laborers in various sectors.</P>
      <P>Such a decision, remarked officials, pertains to government
policy. If a quota were placed on a particular sector, the issue of
fairness must be discussed.</P>
      <P>High-tech industries are permitted to employ foreign labor if
they have investment of more than NT$200 million, officials pointed
out, adding that the government is now considering upgrading the
threshold to NT$500 million.</P>

      <P>State-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. inaugurated a
phalaenopsis plant in Costa Rica on Friday, with scores of ranking
Costa Rican government officials attending the ceremony.</P>
      <P>First-phase construction of the five-hectare compound was already
completed, and completion of the second-phase construction is slated
for June. The plant is expected to begin commercial production in
2001, with an estimated business turnover of NT$55 million (US$1.67
million) every year.</P>
      <P>The Taisugar's Costa Rica phalaenopsis plant is the second of its
kind abroad following the opening of a similar one in Vancouver,
which was set up to meet the demand from the north American market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL PREFERS TO KEEP TAIWAN'S STATUS QUO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
will maintain the status quo of Taiwan even it prevails in the 2000
presidential election, said Chen Shui-bian, the DPP's former Taipei
City mayor on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a seminar with faculty and students at Columbia University,
the front-runner for DPP's presidential nomination played down the
possibility that Taiwan would change its approach toward Beijing if
the pro-independence DPP becomes the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Chen said the DPP, even if it wins the presidency, would rather
keep the status quo than upset it.</P>
      <P>Citing as proof the election in 1991 for the entire parliament's
seats as well as the first popular presidential election in 1996,
Chen said that Taiwan is a sovereign state rather than a part of the
People's Republic of China as Beijing claims.</P>
      <P>In order to quiet fears that the DPP would campaign to force a
plebiscite over Taiwan independence, Chen said the odds are against a
plebiscite given the lack of consensus among the political parties.</P>
      <P>However, he claimed that any disruption of Taiwan's status quo,
from a declaration of independence to Beijing's annexation of the
island with force, should be done only with the sanction of the
general public, adding that a plebiscite is a way to seek public
opinion. However, he said whether a plebiscite should be used to
fathom the people's political willingness needs more study.</P>
      <P>As to an "interim accord" between Taipei and Beijing, which was
called for by a US official, Chen said the exact meaning is far from
clear and the distrust between Taipei and Beijing at this
time preempts any mediation efforts.</P>
      <P>Even the US advocacy of "Beijing not attacking Taiwan as long as
Taiwan doesn't declare independence" is a vague idea filled with
uncertainty, said Chen.</P>
      <P>"Is Taiwan's presidential election a step on the path to
independence? Was President Lee Teng-hui's US trip in 1995 a move
betraying his attempt to split the motherland as Beijing claimed?"
asked Chen.</P>
      <P>Noting that according to a US Defense Department report, Beijing
is expected to deploy 600 missiles across the Taiwan Strait by the
year 2005, Chen said he doubted this conforms with the "no attack
against Taiwan" concept.</P>
      <P>Agreeing that normalizing Taipei-Beijing ties is a desirable
goal, Chen said a breakthrough in direct postal, transportation and
trade links is possible if both Taiwan and mainland China are
admitted into the World Trade Organization this year, as membership
will oblige both countries to open markets to each other and will
therefore place Taipei and Beijing on a course of normalization.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from the audience, Chen painstakingly
explained that Taipei-Beijing ties are neither an international nor a
domestic relationship. They are something not defined by
conventional political science.</P>
      <P>Thursday's seminar included China experts Professor Andrew J.
Nathan and Donald S. Zagovia, professors of political science at
Columbia University.</P>
      <P>Chen made a pitch for his "new central line", referring to a
shift toward the center of the political spectrum from the DPP's
previous extreme idea of pressing for Taiwan independence during a
speech at the Taiwan Association.</P>
      <P>Although he has not yet officially declared himself a candidate
for DPP's nomination, Chen is expected to eventually be the party's
standard bearer in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>His dominance over the field of DPP's presidential aspirants has
virtually denied former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin-liang any chance.</P>
      <P>Hsu has hinted that he might quit the party and run as an
independent candidate if not nominated by DPP.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's speech to about 800 Taiwanese in New York, Chen
urged Hsu not to pull out of the DPP. Chen said the party can
ill-afford a division in trying to win the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Praising Hsu's contribution to the party and to the island's
democratization, Chen also called for party supporters to join him in
asking Hsu to remain in the party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIMITATIONS ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN BOURSE TO BE LIFTED IN 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Mandy Wang &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will lift its limitation on
foreign investment in its bourse by 2000 to bring itself into
compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) requirements, said a
Taiwan economics officer on Friday.</P>
      <P>Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said at a "Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and Trade
Forum" that since 1996 Taiwan has been gradually easing restrictions
on foreign investment in its stock market.</P>
      <P>Although existing rules restrict a single foreign investor's
stake in a publicly listed firm to no more than 50 percent of its
equity, in practice, foreigner ownership rarely exceeds 30 percent,
said Schive.</P>
      <P>To bring the island in line with the WTO criterion, however,
Taiwan authorities are expected to lift the 50-percent ceiling on
overseas investors, a move bound to draw more foreign capital into
Taiwan's booming stock market, said Schive.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong branch office of Taipei's Far East Trade Service
Inc. called the one-day forum to provide a platform for business
leaders of Taiwan and Hong Kong to exchange views.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism from local bankers that Taiwan
discriminates against Hong Kong banks by allowing only one of them to
operate in Taiwan, Schive said it is because of Taipei's policy of
shutting out banks with capital from mainland China.</P>
      <P>This policy, however, has not impeded financial transactions
between Taiwan and Hong Kong, as most of the 46 foreign banks
operating in Taiwan also have branch offices in Hong Kong. These
branches serve as a financial conduit between Taiwan and Hong Kong,
said Schive.</P>
      <P>There are currently 13 Taiwan-based banks doing business in Hong
Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTHER COMPLETING SON'S WISH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>She has walked the streets, staged sit-ins
and gone on hunger strikes, all for the sake of pushing for
compulsory auto liability insurance to save others from suffering the
tragedy that she has endured.</P>
      <P>Fifty-seven-year-old Ke Tsai Yu-chiung, known affectionately as
Mama Ke, was a quiet homemaker in the southern Taiwan city of Tainan
before her son, a graduate school student, was killed in a car
accident in 1989.</P>
      <P>After a seven-year campaign to push for a modicum of legal
protection for victims of traffic mishaps in Taiwan, Mama Ke is now
able to rest easy, knowing that a compulsory automobile liability
insurance (CALI) bill cleared the legislative floor in late 1996 and
went into effect last year.</P>
      <P>With the passage of the bill, Mama Ke is now devoting herself to
completing the education her son had no chance to finish, even though
the task could take 10 years or longer.</P>
      <P>Having received only limited formal education, Mama Ke has
enrolled in a night school in Tainan, where she is studying at the
junior-high-school level. She envisions going on to earn a
high-school diploma and then embarking on university- and
graduate-level studies.</P>
      <P>"Although the prospective studies will be extremely hard,
particularly when I proceed to the later stage, I'm determined to do
it just as I did in calling for the enactment of CALI," the energetic
mother said.</P>
      <P>"I am determined and inspired, because I know my son is with me,"
she added.</P>
      <P>The CALI bill is based on concept of no-fault liability and
guarantees cash compensation to accident victims and their families
within 10 days of an accident.</P>
      <P>The bill requires all automobile owners, including those of
private and commercial cars, as well as cargo and passenger transport
vehicles, to be covered by liability insurance, the premiums for
which amount to about US$2.5 billion annually in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The law also stipulates that a certain amount of money be put
aside from the premiums collected to establish a "special subsidy
fund" to provide immediate compensation to victims and their families
under special circumstances including hit-and-run accidents,
accidents caused by uninsured drivers and accidents in which the
party responsible cannot afford to provide compensation.</P>
      <P>After CALI had been in effect for more than one year, Taiwan's 10
million motorcycles were added to the list of vehicles whose drivers
must carry liability insurance.</P>
      <P>In the first seven years after her son's death, Mama Ke devoted
herself and her scant finances to campaigning for CALI's passage. Her
son was killed after his motorcycle was hit by a semitrailer truck,
and she received only NT$300,000 (US$9,150) in compensation from the
truck driver.</P>
      <P>Mama Ke recalled that she was so heartbroken over her son's death
that she lost 10 kilograms in the first week after the accident. She
said she became obsessed with a single thought -- revenge -- until
seven days after the accident, when her son appeared to her in a
dream and advised her to seek not retribution but "legislation."</P>
      <P>Owing to her lack of formal education, she had to contact Tunghai
University, where her son had been studying, to find out what,
exactly, the term "legislation" meant. Immediately after being told
about the legislative process, she embarked on her seven-year
campaign.</P>
      <P>During her long years of struggle, Mama Ke said she received not
one dollar from society or the government. She maintained an office
in Taipei, at which she worked during the week, while returning to
Tainan each weekend. She and her aides met with families of traffic
accident victims islandwide as part of her efforts to promote the
legislation.</P>
      <P>She sold an apartment and spent the savings she had put aside for
her son's education to support her activities during the seven-year
campaign.</P>
      <P>In early 1996, she staged sit-ins in front of the Kuomintang's
sprawling headquarters on Taipei's Jen-Ai Road for 33 consecutive
weeks.</P>
      <P>Her persistence finally won her a chance to meet the ruling
party's chairman, Lee Teng-hui, who is also president of the Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>Lee, whose only son died more than a decade ago, told Mama
 Ke that he understood her feelings of loss, and assured her that he 
fully supported CALI legislation and would ask the KMT's legislative 
 caucus to push for the early passage of the statute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO MANY ABORIGINAL PEOPLE BEHIND BARS IN CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's highest court said Friday there
are too many people behind bars in the country and far too many of
them are aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court of Canada made the unprecedented comments when
it criticized judges for not taking into account the special
circumstances of aboriginal people before sentencing them to prison.</P>
      <P>In a ruling, the Supreme Court rejected an aboriginal woman's
appeal for her three-year sentence after she was convicted of
stabbing her husband to death.</P>
      <P>But the ruling also criticized lower court judges for relying too
heavily on jail terms when dealing with aboriginal offenders.</P>
      <P>It said judges must respect a new section of the Criminal Code
that requires more emphasis on alternatives, such as community
healing and victim-offender reconciliation, which are a traditional
part of aboriginal culture.</P>
      <P>Across Canada, lawyers and judges have been awaiting the decision
hoping it would provide some guidance on how to correctly interpret
the Criminal Code amendment.</P>
      <P>The court also said that there are too many Canadians in jail,
calling Canada a "world leader in putting people in prison."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PANCHEN LAMA TO MARK 10TH BIRTHDAY IN DETENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  23  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gendhun Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Panchen
Lama of Tibet and the world's youngest political prisoner, will
spend his 10th birthday on April 25.</P>
      <P>He will not spend the day playing with friends. Instead he will
spend it alone in an unknown mainland Chinese detention center.</P>
      <P>Gendhun Choekyi Nyima was taken forcibly from his home on May 17,
1995, when he was only 6 years old. He and his family have been held
by mainland Chinese authorities ever since. Their whereabouts
remains unknown, and there is no evidence that the boy or his
parents are still alive. The ensuing controversy has resulted in over
80 arrests inside Tibet.</P>
      <P>Last week in Toronto, mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji claimed
that mainland China is a country "ruled on the basis of law."</P>
      <P>"What kind of law imprisons a child for political reasons?" asked
Thubten Samdup, president of the Canada Tibet Committee Friday.</P>
      <P>"Even if there was a legitimate reason to detain him, then why
hasn't he been charged, or given an attorney? Why haven't any
international observers been given an opportunity to see him? This is
not rule on the basis of law," Samdup added.</P>
      <P>Tibetans around the world and across Canada will commemorate the
birthday by holding vigils, rallies and cultural events. On the
Panchen Lama's birthday, the Canada Tibet Committee will launch a new
website, designed specifically for children.</P>
      <P>The site includes background information, games, puzzles, artwork
and more. The website is located at www.tibet.ca/panchenlama.</P>
      <P>Canadians have joined an international postcard campaign directed
at President Jiang Zemin and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
Mary Robinson.</P>
      <P>The birthday campaigns are designed to pressure the government of
mainland China to allow independent observers access to the Panchen
Lama.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLOUD GATE CHOREOGRAPHER LIN HWAI-MIN'S GERMAN ENCOUNTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bonn,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Hwai-min loves the music of Johann
Sebastian Bach -- especially the tranquility of his "Six Suites for
Solo Cello." He also loves tai chi, with its slow motions and
calmness, which stimulate the flow of inner energy in the human body.</P>
      <P>Inspired by Bach and tai chi, the world-renowned choreographer
created "Moon Water," a metaphysical exploration that will be staged
at the Deutsche Oper Berlin from August 13 to 15 and which will
highlight a summer cultural program in Berlin. The performance comes
at the invitation of the cultural forum "Berlindballett."</P>
      <P>Meeting the German press in Berlin, Lin spoke of his German
experience through a literary and musical approach, and of the
numerous performance tours he and his "Cloud Gate Dance Theater" have
made through Europe.</P>
      <P>The choreographer said that Bach's solo cello suites were the
only choice for his lyrical piece "Moon Water," which depicts the
relationship between appearance and essence, effort and
effortlessness, and man and woman. Many may find such a combination
crazy, "but I have no other choice," said Lin.</P>
      <P>The August performances will be the European premiere of "Moon
Water," but many European art critics have already praised the work,
which premiered in Taipei in November 1998.</P>
      <P>The German daily "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" wrote of the
piece that "Johann Sebastian Bach virtually entered Asia though Cloud
Gate," while the magazine "Ballet International" said, "There is
nothing this season to compare with its sublime beauty."</P>
      <P>"Der Tagesspiegel," a Berlin daily, once wrote, "Lin Hwai-min
blends the East and the West into a third world of his own." Lin
himself believes that most people in Taiwan are just like him,
constantly facing a blend of East and West that has worn away the
boundary between the two.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Aspirin can save the lives of elderly
people undergoing major operations, and it is also effective as
preventive medication for heart attacks and stroke, according to new
medical research.</P>
      <P>The research involved some 13,000 people, most of them elderly,
who underwent hip surgery in Australia, New Zealand and Britain. The
study showed aspirin's blood-thinning properties reduce blood clots
in arteries. According to the research, aspirin reduces
life-threatening post-operative blood clots by a third and halved the
rate of death from them.</P>
      <P>The new trial demonstrated that aspirin is even more effective
against deep vein thrombosis than against heart attacks and stroke,

    <HEADLINE>WU POH-HSIUNG TO SEEK KMT NOMINATION FOR VICE PRESIDENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung, a senior adviser to
the President, divulged for the first time on Saturday that he is
interested in seeking the vice presidency.</P>
      <P>The charismatic politician, who has served as Taipei mayor,
interior minister, secretary-general to the President and
secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang, made the revelation
during a presentation of creative Hakka songs and dances in Hsinchu
County, some 70 kilomters south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>At the gathering, many Hakka people urged Wu to team up with
Vice President Lien Chan to run in the ROC's next presidential
election scheduled for March 2000. Lien is widely believed to seek
the KMT's nomination for the coming presidential election.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said he appreciates his Hakka fellows'
encouragement and support.</P>
      <P>"To live up to your expectations, I'll adopt a more definite
attitude toward the feasibility of joining the race as a vice
presidential candidate," Wu said, adding that he has never hesitated
to grasp every possible opportunity to serve the people.</P>
      <P>Noting that his Hakka fellows' enthusiastic push for his vice
presidential candidacy reflects their sense of crisis over the fading
away of Hakka language and culture, Wu said he is willing to work
even harder to help preserve Hakka cultural heritage and promote
harmony and mutual respect among different ethnic groups in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu said the presidential candidate usually has a
final say in deciding his running mate. "Against this background, I
don't think I should not be too pushy and tough in seeking the vice
presidential candidacy at this moment. But anyway, I'll adopt a
more clear-cut attitude in dealing with the related issue. If
necessary, I'll take up the electoral challenge bravely," Wu
explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu's wife Tai Mei-yu also confirmed publicly that Wu
will join next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Tai said at the inaugural ceremony for KMT Legislator Mu
Ming-chu's service center in Taipei's Shihlin district that she
takes pride in her husband's capability and dedication to public
services.</P>
      <P>"I hope you will support him if he has the opportunity to run in
the next presidential election," Tai said. However, she didn't give
any details about Wu's electoral plan, including Wu will either seek
the presidency or vice presidency.</P>

      <P>Daily Air and the families of three
victims of a recent helicopter crash in Taipei County reached an
agreement on Saturday to hold a funeral service for the dead prior to
talks about compensation.</P>
      <P>A Daily Air spokesman said the talks leading to the agreement
proceeded in a rational manner. Expressing its condolences to the
families of the victims, Daily Air said it will give each family
compensation of at least NT$10.2 million (US$311,000).</P>
      <P>Of that amount, the company itself will pay at least NT$8.6
million, while the rest would come from an insurance system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the company will also sponsor a joint funeral service
for the victims, to be held Tuesday, the Daily Air official noted.</P>
      <P>The three Daily Air employees died when their helicopter crashed
into a mountainous area in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Daily Air flight B5550 took off from Taipei's Sungshan Airport at

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SUGAR PRODUCTION TO BE CUT BY HALF UPON WTO ADMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is set to reduce both the acreage
of its sugarcane plantations and its overall domestic sugar
production by 50 percent as it prepares for admission to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), sources from Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar)
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan expected to join the WTO as early as this year, plans
have been announced to reduce the island's 70,000 hectares of
sugarcane plantations to 35,000 hectares, while crude sugar
production is to be reduced to 150,000 metric tons annually, said
Taisugar President Cheng Hung-tsai.</P>
      <P>The reductions will go into effect once Taiwan is formally
admitted to the WTO.</P>
      <P>As more foreign sugar is allowed into Taiwan, the state-run
Taisugar will be appointed by the government to oversee the import of
sugar under a quota system, while private trading companies will be
allowed to import small quantities, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Since sugar, like rice, is one of the strategic commodities of a
country, most governments around the world have included sugar under
protective umbrellas, and Taisugar is doing the same by offering
subsidies to domestic sugarcane farmers so that the industry can
survive increased imports, Cheng noted.</P>
      <P>This year, Taisugar will buy some 300,000 metric tons of sugar
from domestic sugarcane farmers at a price of NT$24.8 (US$0.76) per
kilogram. Imported sugar costs an average of NT$16.5 (US$0.50) per
kilogram, he said.</P>
      <P>Taisugar is absorbing the total cost of the cash subsidies it
provides to sugarcane farmers to help them maintain their
plantations.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan is admitted to the WTO, however, Taisugar will have
sugar importers share in providing the cash subsidies to the farmers,
Cheng added.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taisugar also imports 200,000 metric tons of sugar
annually to meet the island's overall need of 500,000 metric tons of
sugar a year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang welcomes the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party's identification of Taiwan
with the name "Republic of China," said KMT Secretary-General John
Chang on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The DPP's change in attitude is seen by many as an attempt to
attract centrist voters to the party in the run-up to next year's
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chang said he was not surprised by the DPP's decision, adding
that if the party had not changed its position, it might have lost
the support of more moderate elements within itsthe party. Moreover,
the DPP's support for the name "Republic of China" vindicates the
KMT's long-standing basic national policy, he said.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP's move helps to bridge the gap between it and
the ruling party, Chang said the KMT would maintain its pursuit of
national reunification.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence DPP, which has long sought to establish an
independent country under the name "The Republic of China," will put
on the table a motion at an upcoming party congress to accept, at
least for the time being, the name "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>The motion, which still must be approved by a party congress on
May 8, reiterates the party's call for Taiwan's permanent separation
from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The change was driven by the party's presidential hopeful, Chen
Shui-bian, who while visiting New York, said on Thursday that "Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD SELL LONG-RANGE RADARS TO TAIWAN: MILITARY BRASS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Saturday declined to comment on a US newspaper report that the
Clinton administration has decided to reject a Taiwan request for
purchasing long-range radars.</P>
      <P>An MND official said the ministry has never told the press that
it plans to purchase US-made phased-array radars. "Therefore, we
would not make any comments on the report," said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>However, military sources said if the MND really has asked the
United States to sell the long-range radars, the Clinton
administration should not reject such a request.</P>
      <P>It will be in the US interests to sell such radar equipment to
Taiwan, the military sources said, adding that the long-range radars
can double the surveillance range of the ROC military's current
radar system.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's intensified development of
sophisticated ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, the sources
said the United States should provide Taiwan with long-range radars
in line with the provision of the Taiwan Relations Act in order to
maintain military balance between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
and safeguard peace and stability in the region.
 The Washington Times reported on Friday that the Clinton
administration has continued denying Taiwan access to important
defensive weapons for fear of offending mainland China.</P>
      <P>The report, carried in the paper's Inside the Ring column, said
an interministerial task force in the Clinton administration already
decided this week to reject sales of a list of weapons needed by
Taiwan to protect itself from mainland China's military attack,
including long-range phased-array radars</P>
      <P>The report said Taiwan badly needs long-range radars as
communist China will deploy up to 650 M-11 and M-9 ballistic
missiles within the next six years.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a Clinton administration official, who was
opposed to the special task force's decision, as saying that the
long-range radars are Taiwan's priority need. "Such radars have
nothing to do with any offensive weapons. Nevertheless, they can
offer five minutes for the 21 million Taiwan people to escape
missile attack," the official was quoted as explaining.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times further said an annual Taiwan-US meeting on
Taiwan's defensive weapon purchase needs will open in Washington,
D.C. on April 27.</P>
      <P>In addition to phased-array radars, the paper said, Taiwan also
hopes to purchase US-made air-launched anti-ship missiles,
submarines, advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles, Patriot
air-defense missiles and aircraft targeting equipment.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
said on Saturday that economic development and political
democratization are the two most important achievements in the
island's modernization.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan is famed for its "economic miracle" and
"peaceful revolution," because equality has been maintained during
its economic development, and peace and stability have not been
sacrificed during its democratization.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks at the opening of a symposium
on the impact of democratization on economic development.</P>
      <P>The symposium was held in memory of the late governor of the
Central Bank of China, Y.D. Sheu, who died in a plane crash last
year. The symposium was jointly sponsored by the Department of
Political Science under National Taiwan University and two private
foundations.</P>
      <P>Despite the achievements Taiwan has already made in its economic
and political development, Lien pointed out that Taiwan still has to
improve the efficiency and quality of its democracy.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that efforts should be made to improve the
holding of elections, the interaction between the administrative and
legislative branches of government and the normal operations of
Taiwan's financial markets. Moreover, efforts are needed to reduce
outside influence over law-enforcement agencies in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Lien said that early this year he spelled out the nation's
cross-century goal as striving for "a democracy with excellent
quality, a mature economy and a caring and concerned society."</P>
      <P>To attain that goal is not only the government's responsibility,
but also the public's, he stressed.</P>
      <P>As the 21th century is around the corner, Lien said, it is
important for all echelons of society to pool their wisdom on how to
improve the country's competitiveness and to construct Taiwan into a
science and technology island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL EMPHASIZES NATIONAL SECURITY IN NEW YORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Avoiding war is the supreme obligation
of a responsible politician and a sensitive political party, said
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) member and former Taipei Mayor
Chen Shui-bian on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said this is why national security is the main concern in
the "new central line" he has adopted. Chen made the remarks during a
press briefing in New York where he arrived on Thursday for a private
visit.</P>
      <P>He shrugged off questions about how he would reconcile the DPP's
goal of establishing a "Republic of Taiwan" with his new central
line, in which he accepts "Republic of China" as the name of the
independent country his party is struggling to establish.</P>
      <P>Chen said his new central line reflects mainstream opinion within
the party and will prevail as its official position at an upcoming
party congress on May 8.</P>
      <P>He said a political party should adapt to a rapidly changing
political environment with new ideas. Otherwise it will be abolished
by time and voters.</P>
      <P>Chen also deflected questions on whether the party would amend
its charter to enable Chen to run as the party's candidate in next
year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>The party's charter currently prohibits any party member who has
been nominated as a candidate for elected office from being nominated
again within four years' time. Chen failed in a re-election bid in
mayoral elections last December in which he represented the DPP.</P>
      <P>He is nevertheless regarded as the party's main hopeful in next
year's presidential election, though Chen has not said anything
publicly on the matter.</P>
      <P>He has traveled extensively at home and abroad to sell a modified
pro-independence vision that he says is consistent with the party's
long-standing pursuit of independence, while unlikely to lead to a
military confrontation with mainland China.</P>
      <P>In related news, Chen's main rival for the DPP's presidential
nomination, former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang, rebutted a remark
made by Chen in New York that the interim Taipei-Beijing agreement
urged by Washington officials is more a vaguely defined concept than
official US policy.</P>
      <P>Hsu argued that the interim agreement, floated first by US
Assistant Secretary of State for Asian and Pacific Affairs Stanley
Roth on March 23, and conveyed to Taipei by Darryl Norman Johnson,
director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan, is
in fact official US policy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL SHOWS KMT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE STANDS BETTER CHANCE TO WIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Even though major domestic political
parties have yet to select their candidates for the next presidential
election, the majority of local people have shown greater confidence
in the ruling Kuomintang candidate's winning chance, according to the
results of two opinion polls released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ROC Collegiate Teaching Faculty Association twice surveyed
local people's evaluation of likely presidential candidates of both
the KMT and the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>One survey was conducted between March 10 and March 14, and the
other was taken between April 15 and April 18. The first survey
collected 1,168 valid replies and the second poll drew 1,142 valid
replies.</P>
      <P>In the March survey, 43.6 percent of the respondents said they
believe the election of a KMT candidate as the country's next
president will contribute to Taiwan's political stability, compared
to 17.9 percent who said they think that the DPP candidate's win
will be more helpful to Taiwan's political stability. In the April
poll, the KMT-DPP ratio was 42.8 percent against 17.8 percent.</P>
      <P>On the handling of national security affairs, 32 percent of
respondents to the March poll and 32.7 percent in the April surveys
said they believe the KMT presidential candidate is more capable
of dealing with such issues, compared to 25.5 percent and 20.5
percent who said they think the DPP candidate can better handle such
issues than their KMT counterpart.</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, the two surveys also showed that the
respondents have greater confidence in the KMT candidate's ability
than the DPP hopeful, 41.8 percent vs. 20.3 percent in the March
survey and 39.8 percent vs. 18.5 percent in the April poll.</P>
      <P>The respondents to the two poll also showed greater trust in the
KMT hopeful's ability to properly handle relations across the Taiwan
Strait, according to poll results.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the gap between the two parties' abilities to cope
with economic problems is limited.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'DOME BREAD' FEVER SWIRLING IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   24  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, a frontline city in the
introduction of new fashions and trends to the Asian continent, is
now being permeated by the fragrance of bread, which has replaced the
steaming hot egg tarts from the Portuguese colony of Macau that
formerly captivated Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The dome-shaped bread, dubbed "dome," was born in Hokkaido, Japan
where the local dairy farmers make the soft and puffy bread with a
great quantity of milk. Taipei's Ambassador Hotel introduced the
bread from Japan's northernmost island to Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>The wildly popular bread is creating a frenzy similar to the one
seen last year when egg tarts reigned supreme.</P>
      <P>Ambassador Hotel bakers place fresh rows of domes on their store
shelves under the watchful eye of long, snaky lines of customers
waiting for their chance to buy the bread at NT$100 (US$3.05) a
piece.</P>
      <P>Milking the trend for all it's worth, quick-witted businessmen
have started to make their own "domes" or similarly scrumptious
breads, such as the curry-filled "giant pillow bread" available at
the Hilton Taipei hotel.</P>

government? A ruler needs only to earnest in his personal conduct,
and to behave in a manner worthy of his position."</TEXT>

      <P>The Philippine government is seeking to
sign a labor accord with 20 countries, including the Republic of
China, to further protect the rights of Filipino workers abroad.</P>
      <P>According to the Philippine Labor and Employment Ministry, Saudi

Japan.</P>
      <P>In 1998, 158,000 Filipino workers left for Saudi Arabia to work
in that Middle East country, while 79,000 and 64,000 went to Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>INDUSTRIAL LEADERS SAY FIVE-DAY WORKWEEK PLAN TOO RASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the legislature is actively pushing
for five-day workweek starting next year, industrial leaders and
government officials cautioned on Sunday that next year may be too
soon.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks while attending a forum to discuss
the proposed five-day workweek's affect on national productivity.</P>
      <P>New Party legislator Lai Shih-pao said the proposed plan does not
cut working hours, noting that under the plan the average working
hours per day will be extended to 8.5 hours, He said that as working
hours are not cut, productivity will not be affected.</P>
      <P>Addressing the concerns that government service, such as
passport service or national park management, could be cut due to a
shortened work day, Lai responded that government service is now
computerized or on the internet, adding that not only will government
service not be affected, it instead will be a 24-hour service.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yung-hsiung, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese National
Federation of Industries, said that if the plan is implemented next
year, civil servants will have up to 119 days of leave a year,
averaging one day off every three working days, which he said will be
the highest in the world.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he noted that last year there was a shortage of up to
200,000 workers in the industrial sector. He said an early
implementation of a five-day workweek will leave the sector
unprepared.</P>
      <P>He urged a gradual implementation of the plan, saying a rash
decision will not be supported by the trade and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>Most businesses in Taiwan now implement a five-day workweek every
other week. The Legislative Yuan's plan to push for a five-day
workweek every week starting next year has stirred heated debate.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said that a shortened workweek with a goal to
upgrade the quality of live is desirable, but worried that the plan
will adversely impact society.

PHILIPPINES TO REVIEW ONE-CHINA POLICY</P>
      <P>Manila April 25 (CNA) The Philippine House of Representatives
Foreign Affairs committee is set to review the country's One-China
Policy, saying that "changing times and recent economic and political
transformation" have prompted the country to take another look at the
policy.</P>
      <P>When the Philippines formally recognized and shifted its
diplomatic relations from the ROC on Taiwan to mainland China, it
signed a Joint Communique with mainland China on June 9, 1975;
thereby establishing a One-China policy, committee chair Rep.
Luwalhati Antonino said.</P>
      <P>Antonino said that the circumstances by which the Philippines
adopted the policy in 1975 have since changed and, therefore,
necessitates the need to assess the benefits of the policy.</P>
      <P>She said the overriding question is whether the One-China policy
is still economically advantageous for the country. "We need to take
another closer, harder look at the policy," she said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Rep. Apolinario Lozada (Negros Occidental) wants
RP-Taiwan relations expanded, saying that the One-China policy does
not prelude the people of the Philippines from pursuing other
mutually beneficial relationships with the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lozada said, "The Filipino people still consider its relations
with both countries very important, equal to relations with members
of ASEAN and member countries of the United Nations such as the US,
Japan and UK."</P>
      <P>Lozada added, "We should focus on enhancing those areas
considered to be most advantageous to all parties, the Philippines,
mainland China and Taiwan. He said that enacting HR 4573, would be a
"crucial step toward clarifying the country's One-China policy."</P>
      <P>HR 4573 proposes to establish the parameters of the economic,
social and cultural relations between Taiwan and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The bill, Lozada said, further seeks to maintain transparency and
clarifies further the specific type of relationship that should exist
between the people of the Philippines and Taiwan.

Taiwan-based aviation companies. One thousand three hundred and fifty
four of them are ROC nationals, while the remaining 537 are

      <P>An anti-nuclear group protested in front
of the legislature on Monday, calling for a proposed fourth nuclear
plant to be scrapped.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Anti-Nuclear Action Alliance, on the 13th anniversary
of the Chernobyl incident, urged the government to heed public
sentiment and freeze the budget for the proposed nuclear plant in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>They also asked for plans for the plant's construction to be
scrapped and for the Legislative Yuan to pass a plebiscite law as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Kao Cheng-yen, a spokesman of the group, noted that a nuclear
reactor at the Chernobyl plant in the Ukraine exploded on April 26,
1986, spreading a radioactive cloud across Europe, and causing grave
pollution in the world's worst nuclear accident.</P>
      <P>Kao said the incident caused heavy causalities with women giving
birth to deformed babies, while crops in more than 20 countries in
Europe also suffered heavy losses.</P>
      <P>Kao said that the government has disregarded the opinions of the
public by granting permits for the construction of the fourth nuclear

    <HEADLINE>'FATHER OF CHINESE PHYSICS' IN CRITICAL CONDITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Academia Sinica President Wu Ta-you
remained in critical condition Monday morning, though his life signs
were stabilizing, doctors from National Taiwan University (NTU)
Hospital said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has long been regarded as the "father of Chinese
physics," went in and out of a coma Sunday as his respiratory tract
became completely blocked, doctors said.</P>
      <P>Wu's family, including his son Wu Pao-chih, have asked the
hospital not to keep Wu on a respirator or cut his trachea open, in
hopes of sparing Wu any further pain, doctors said.</P>
      <P>Wu, 92, checked into NTU Hospital on March 13 with influenza. On
March 26, he was sent to the intensive care unit because of heart
failure and other complications.</P>
      <P>Over the past month, Wu has been treated for cardiac illness,
hypertension and diabetes. During the most recent two weeks doctors
have had to put him on a dialysis machine because of kidney failure,
and he has required regular blood transfusions because of massive
stomach hemorrhaging.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Wu murmured in English on his sickbed with his eyes
closed, according to Chen Tsung-hsien, a researcher at Academia
Sinica and one of Wu's many students.</P>
      <P>As his remarks became clearer, he was heard to say that his
innate talent could only be graded as a B-plus. "I overcame my
intellectual difficulties with my incessant and honest hard work," he
said.</P>
      <P>"My disposition is inherently shy and conservative, but my
attitude turned aggressive and belligerent when facing situations
which were undermining the academic sector's dignity and national
interests," he said.</P>
      <P>"I have treated my colleagues, students and all my duties with
honesty, and because of that, I have won praises and accolades that
were far more than I deserved. Because of my honesty, I have no
regrets," Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wu's son Pao-chih then approached him and said, "We are proud of
you, Dad." As if awakened from a dream, Wu opened his eyes and said,
still in English, "Thank you all," according to Chen, who has
remained at Wu's side in the hospital's intensive care ward.</P>
      <P>Wu, who entered Michigan University in 1931 at the age of 24,
obtained his doctorate in physics in less than two years. He returned
to China to teach before the outbreak of World War II.</P>
      <P>The pioneer of Chinese physics, Wu held professorships at
Beijing, Qinghua and Nankai Universities in mainland China before
1949. He came to Taiwan after the Republic of China moved its seat of
government to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Among his students, many of whom went on to become members of
China's scientific elite, were Yang Chen-ning and Lee Cheng-dao,
co-winners of the 1957 Nobel Prize in physics.</P>
      <P>He was president of Academia Sinica, the highest research
institute in Taiwan, between 1983 and 1993.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC POLLS FIND MAJORITY OF TAIWAN PEOPLE WANT TO MAINTAIN STATUS QUO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan people prefer to
maintain the status quo in relations across the Taiwan Strait,
according to the results of four large-scale opinion polls conducted
by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) over the past five years.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin said on Monday that the
repeated MAC surveys were mainly aimed at exploring mainstream
public opinion about the government's policy toward mainland China
and cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"The four massive opinion polls found that 80 percent of those
interviewed prefer to maintain different degrees of the cross-strait
political status quo," Lin said, adding that the results comply with
those recorded in many other similar surveys taken over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, more than 70 percent of respondents to the four MAC
polls said they oppose the mainland China-proposed "one country, two
systems" unification scheme, while the ratio of the proponents in
the four survey consistently stood below 7 percent.</P>
      <P>More than half of those interviewed further said they think the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should not start unification talks
until their gaps in political systems and lifestyles are narrowed.</P>
      <P>Survey results also showed that more than 70 percent
of the respondents are satisfied with the government's pace in
opening cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the number of people who said the government should
not open the doors to mainland Chinese capital in the fourth survey
surged to 41.3 percent, marking a 10.8 percent rise from that
recorded in the previous survey.</P>
      <P>The latest MAC survey was conducted between July 5, 1998 and
Sept. 5, 1998, in which 1,604 valid replies were collected. Because
of the large scale of the survey, the MAC didn't complete analysis
of the findings until recently and made public the poll results on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy was that the number of respondents who think it
is more important for Taiwan to develop relations with other
countries than to promote cross-strait ties outpaced the percentage
of those who think otherwise by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Even if Taiwan's diplomatic efforts caused tension in
cross-strait relations, more than 60 percent of those responding to
all the four MAC surveys still said Taiwan should continue expanding
its diplomatic frontiers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS CONCERNED ABOUT MOVEMENTS OF FOREIGN CAPITAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid grave concern from lawmakers about an
influx of foreign capital, Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)
Chairman Lin Tzong-yeong said on Monday that his agency will closely
monitor subsequent developments in the local financial market.</P>
      <P>Continued inflows of foreign capital into the local stock market
is an indication that Taiwan's economic fundamentals remain sound,
he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Central Bank of China will monitor the levels of
foreign capital moving in and out, while his agency will also keep a
close watch on foreign investments in the domestic stock market. As
to short-term foreign capital movements in Taiwan, the SFC head said
all will be dealt with according to government regulations.</P>
      <P>As of the end of March, US$11.2 billion worth of foreign
investments had been channeled into the domestic bourse, accounting
for 3.5 percent of the market's total capitalization, which Lin said
is still low compared with the 10-percent level of
foreign capitalization seen in other countries.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks when fielding questions at the Legislative
Yuan. The legislature's finance committee was screening the SFC's
budget for the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Some lawmakers opined that the Finance Ministry's decision in
February to lift the threshold for foreign capital investments in the
Taiwan's stock market to 50 percent may cause serious side effects in
the local financial sector.</P>
      <P>Pointing to Thailand as example, Legislator Yu Cheng-tao with the
Democratic Progressive Party said the Southeast Asian country's
financial woes effectively resulted from the lax control of huge
amounts of foreign capital in its stock market.</P>
      <P>The Finance Ministry's move to allow greater foreign investment
in Taiwan's bourse may pose a threat to the local financial market,
he added.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lai Shih-pao said the government must take
some measures to prevent speculation by foreign players in Taiwan's
stock market. A sudden withdrawal of the market's huge amount of
foreign capital, currently about NT$400 billion, will undoubtedly
pose a danger to the financial sector, he contended.</P>

      <P>Aging veterans of Canada's Korean War

weeks."</P>
      <P>The parallels go further, said Barris. His book "Deadlock in
Korea" presents the Korean conflict -- a UN police action that was
never officially designated a "war" -- through the eyes of a foot
soldier.</P>
      <P>Likewise, no one has formally declared war against Yugoslavia
over its actions in the rebellious province of Kosovo, he noted.</P>
      <P>NATO has sent an armada of aircraft, including a dozen Canadian

    <HEADLINE>GODDESS OF THE SEA RETURNS TO TACHIA SHRINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central  Taiwan, April 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese folk deity
Matsu, the Goddess of the Sea, returned to her shrine in Taichung,
late Monday after an eight-day, seven-night parade throughout central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 worshippers throughout the island escorted the
Goddess Matsu on the 280-kilometer annual tour, which included visits
to 59 temples in Taichung, Changhua, Yunlin and Chiayi Counties.</P>
      <P>During the eight days of religious worship, other cultural events
and folklore activities, including drummer troupes and Chinese kung
fu fighting, were also staged.</P>
      <P>At abut 1:30 p.m. Sunday, the "horse-riding informants" arrived
in Tachia Township, indicating that Matsu's arrival would not be
long.</P>
      <P>To welcome the return of Matsu, residents in Tachia, particularly
the stores along the miles of streets surrounding the Chenlankung
(Calming the Rolling Billows) Temple served free food, fruit and
drinks.</P>
      <P>With thousands of worshippers and bystanders on the streets, it
took hours for the Goddess of Matsu, carried by worshippers in an
sedan-chair of imperial style, to make her way through Tachia's
streets. The Goddess did not return to her shrine in the Chenlankung
Temple until 8:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>In some streets, the sound of firecrackers was deafening leaving
the firecrackers' residual dust laying inches thick on the ground.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, the day the Goddess returned, about 10,000 Tachia
households hosted feasts for relatives and friends from around the
island. The feasts cost the township some NT$100 million (US$3.05
million).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung County Council Speaker Yen Ching-piao, who
supports direct shipping links between Taichung and mainland China's
Fujian Province for religious pilgrimages, said a Taiwan fleet
carrying some 10,000 worshippers will travel through a small Japanese
island chain in October to Fujian's Putien County to pay tribute to
the real Matsu.</P>
      <P>Yen's calls for "direct religious shipping links" between
Taichung and Fujian have been rejected by the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council for national security reasons.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 Taiwan pilgrims annually visit Meizhou Island
located in Fujian Province's Putien County to pay tribute to the
Goddess at a century-old temple. The peak seasons are in March and
September on the lunar calendar. March 3 is the anniversary of
Matsu's birthday while Sept. 9 marks her deification.</P>
      <P>Matsu has been worshipped by Chinese people, particularly those
in southern provinces, since the Sung Dynasty. Tradition says that
Matsu was a girl of a fishing family from Meizhou Island. She
sacrificed her life by drowning herself in exchange for the lives of
her father and brother, both working at sea. Not long after her
sacrifice, Matsu was deified.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN HOUSEMAIDS, CARETAKERS DEMAND LABOR STANDARDS LAW COVERAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of foreign housemaids and
caretakers petitioned the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) on Monday
for coverage of the Labor Standards Law to better protect their
rights and well-being.</P>
      <P>More than 10 foreign housemaid and caretaker representatives
from around the island staged a play in front of the CLA office on
Taipei's Minsheng E. Road to highlight their plight.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has over 50,000 foreign housemaids and
caretakers. Kung You-chien, a volunteer at the Catholic Foreign
Laborers Service Center in Chungli, some 40 kilometers south of
Taipei, said foreign housemaids and caretakers have become cheap
labor and even "slaves" as they are often required to get ready for
work round-the-clock.</P>
      <P>"In addition to working overtime, many foreign housemaids and
caretakers are denied holidays and have been troubled by the
nightmare of sexual harassment," Kung said.</P>
      <P>She went to say that as foreign housemaids and caretakers work
in individual families, they are isolated and have limited channels
to seek assistance or counseling.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Kung said, if foreign housemaids and caretakers file
complaints about their working terms or conditions, employers
usually would ask government authorities to repatriate them on
grounds that they are not suitable for the job.</P>
      <P>The CLA originally agreed to offer foreign housemaids and
caretakers protection provided by the Labor Standards Law. However,
the Cabinet-level council broke its promise in January this year on
grounds that it was technically difficult to define housemaids and
caretakers' work time and other related work terms.</P>
      <P>Kung urged the CLA to pay more attention to foreign housemaids
and caretakers' plight and revise current regulations to offer them
coverage of the Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>Kung also suggested that the CLA ban local employers who have
abused their managerial power and ignored foreign workers' rights
from hiring foreign housemaids or caretakers any more.</P>
      <P>Responding to the petition, Tsai Shao-nan, deputy director of
the CLA's Department of Labor Standards, said the CLA will make an
overall review of the Labor Standards Law late this year and does
not rule out the possibility of including foreign housemaids and
caretakers into the law's coverage.</P>
      <P>In fact, Tsai said foreign workers' rights can be protected
through other relevant regulations and employment contracts. "We
hope all labor-management disputes can be resolved reasonably within
a legal framework," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIER FORECASTS 5.28 % GROWTH FOR TAIWAN ECONOMY THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy, fueled by recovering
world markets and a bullish domestic bourse, will grow 5.28 percent
this year, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER)
forecasted on Monday.</P>
      <P>The private economic think-tank adjusted its forecast upward to
5.28 percent from the previous estimate of 5.01 percent in light of
better international and domestic economies.</P>
      <P>TIER said on Monday that the island's economy will grow 4.57
percent, 4.61 percent, 5.78 percent and 6.06 percent in the four
quarters of this year, respectively.</P>
      <P>TIER President Wu Rong-I cautioned that there are still
uncertainties which threaten Taiwan's growth.</P>
      <P>These uncertainties include the volatile US stock market, whether
the Japanese economy has bottomed out, Taiwan's readiness for the Y2K
Millennium Bug, a high ratio of overdue bank loans, stagnating public
construction projects and whether privately-run enterprises can
improve their financial structures, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a recent TIER survey found that 35.9 percent of
companies in the island's manufacturing sector think business will
improve during the next six months, while 11.5 percent say business
will decline.</P>
      <P>In similar survey conducted by TIER in March, 44.9 percent of
manufacturing companies said they expected business to pick up in the
following six months, while 14.4 percent saw a decline.</P>
      <P>In the latest survey, 52.6 percent of manufacturing companies
said business will remain stable in the next six months, compared
with 41.8 percent in March.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian said
he is willing to serve as the top campaigner of former DPP
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang if Hsu manages to win the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party's nomination to run in the next
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen, one of the most popular DPP politicians, made the
statement shortly after his return from a US visit, part of his
global "journey of learning" aimed at boosting his own presidential
bid.</P>
      <P>Chen said he would not like to see Hsu quit the DPP to run in
the coming presidential election as an independent.</P>
      <P>Hsu, a two-term DPP chairman, said on Sunday after a grueling
eight-day-seven-night pilgrimage from Taichung County to Chiayi
County along with an icon of Matsu, the Chinese Goddess of the Sea
that he has come to a decision on his future career. "I'll make
public my decision a week later," Hsu told the local press.</P>
      <P>Many observers said Hsu's Sunday remarks signal his withdrawal
from the DPP to run in the next presidential election as an
independent.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hope that such speculation will prove untrue," said
Chen, who has consistently led Hsu in approval ratings in various
public opinion polls concerning who stands better chances to win the
2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen began his global "journey of learning" in March, which
already took him to Japan, South Korea, Mongolia and the United
States.</P>
      <P>During his just-concluded US trip, Chen said he visited
Washington, New York and Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>"I managed to meet with 12 American lawmakers, Clinton
administration officials in charge of East Asian affairs and noted US
think tank research fellows to exchange views on the possibilities of
Taiwan's participation in the US-proposed theater missile defense
(TMD) system, the World Trade Organization and many other important
topics," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen gave three interviews to US news media and met

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, former chairman of the
major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who reportedly
will announce his decision to leave the DPP and launch his own run
for the presidency this week, avoided DPP leaders on Monday.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Committee, after holding an emergency meeting,
tried to prevent Hsu from leaving the party.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, the DPP's secretary-general, paid a visit to Hsu
Monday, at the behest of DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung. Yu was
accompanied by Kuo Chun-ming, the DPP's director-general of the Dept.
of Organization Affairs, and Chou Yi-cheng, acting director-general
of the Dept. of Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>However, due to not having an appointment, the trio was greeted
by Wang Chun-fang, a policy researcher for Hsu's party faction,
causing some embarrassment.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the party's secretary-general stressed that DPP
Chairman Lin hopes to meet "Chairman Hsu" in person whenever Hsu is
available. Yu was hopeful the meeting would occur in a couple of
days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuo told the press that "Chairman Hsu" is a super
member of the DPP and that all members hope to keep him in the party.</P>
      <P>Staff workers at Hsu's office said that after participating for
eight days in a religious pilgrimage, Hsu is now resting.</P>
      <P>Ever since Hsu' departure from the DPP looked like inevitable,
the DPP Central Committee has tried to stop him. DPP Chairman Lin
tried unsuccessfully to contact Hsu on Sunday, said DPP officials.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Committee has concluded Hsu's departure would
harm the party's bid for the presidency in next year's election.</P>
      <P>The DPP is currently weighing how to minimize the impact of Hsu's

    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation and Communication
Minister Lin Feng-cheng on Monday defended his ministry's plan to
sell of part of Chunghwa Telecom's share to public.</P>
      <P>He said at a legislature cmmmittee meeting that the move to sell
Chunghwa's share is aimed at strengthening the company's competitive
edge in the face of the opening of local telecommunication market.</P>
      <P>The committee on Monday started to review the Ministry of
Transportation and Communication's (MOTC) 1999 year budget. According
to MOTC's budget, an initial sell-off of NT$127.3 billion of Chunghwa
Telecom stocks will step up its privatization progress.</P>
      <P>But legislators from both the ruling Kuomintang and opposition
parties strongly questioned the move, saying once the budget plan has
been passed, the legislature may lose its right to supervise Chunghwa
Telecom's operations.</P>
      <P>Legislators went on to say that the estimated price for selling
Chunghwa shares was too cheap and accused the MOTC of unfairly
favoring consortiums by setting a lower-than-standard share price.</P>
      <P>Lin explained that even after the sell, the shares held by the
government and Chunghwa employees will still surpass 50 percent. He
added that the move is aimed at strengthening Chunghwa's
competitiveness against local and foreign competitors.</P>
      <P>Earlier Monday, Chunghwa Telecom's labor union, which also
strongly opposes the stock sale, gathered in front of the Legislative
Yuan to protest against a government plan to compensate its
budget deficit by selling Chunghwa's shares.</P>
      <P>The estimated 5,000 protesters mobilized by the union used mobile
telephones to simultaneously call the Executive Yuan in an attempt to
paralyze the Yuan's telephone system.

    <TEXT>
      <P>As former Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang's quitting the party seems inevitable,
more than 20 DPP members issued a joint statement on Monday urging
the party to call a crisis management meeting.</P>
      <P>Among them are several party doyens, such as former Chairmen
Huang Hsin-chieh, Shih Ming-teh and Yao Chia-wen, and former
Kaohsiung Magistrate Yu Chen Yueh-ying.</P>
      <P>The joint statement termed Hsu's possible quitting the party as
the "worst crisis" the party has suffered since establishment, and
voiced deep disappointment over the handling of the case by party
leadership.</P>
      <P>It calls for the convening of an emergency meeting, with Huang
Hsin-chieh serving as chairman, to discuss how to cope with the
situation. The emergency meeting will also have the participation of
the party's past chairmen and representatives from various factions.</P>
      <P>It is widely speculated that Hsu has decided to quit the DPP to
run as an independent in next year's presidential election as the DPP
leadership is expected to support former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian
as the party's presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>At a press conference called to issue the joint statement, DPP
Legislator Wang Tou criticized the DPP leadership, headed by Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung, for its failure to keep Hsu in the party. He described
Hsu as an "excellent man."</P>
      <P>Yu Chen Yueh-ying said that Hsu's plan to quit the DPP has
created a crisis within the opposition camp. She hoped Hsu would
remain in the party.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen Ching-chun said that Hsu's quitting the
party will be a loss not only to the DPP, but also to the Taiwanese
people.</P>
      <P>The joint statement said that Hsu has given many constructive
proposals for party development, but did not receive proper treatment
in return from the party leadership.</P>
      <P>It added that the DPP leadership has paid little attention to
Hsu's ideas on Taiwan's political development, and these factors
prompted Hsu to quit the party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STOCK INSIDER TRADING EXIST: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Lin Tzong-yeong of the Securities
and Futures Commission on Monday said that he would not deny the
existence of insider trading in Taiwan's stock market.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at a joint session of Legislative Yuan's
Financial and Budget committees, during which lawmakers
fiercely criticized the insider trading in the market.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yen Chin-fu of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), said that before the local share market closed for the
Chinese lunar new year holidays on Feb., 10, about 40,000,000 shares
of the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, 70,000,000 shares of the First
Commercial Bank and 50,000,000 shares of the Hwa Nan Commercial Bank
were traded, compared to their average daily trading volumes of
10,000,000 shares, 20,000,000 shares and 9,000,000 shares,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The Finance Ministry, coincidentally, announced on Feb. 19 a cut in
banks' business tax from 5 percent to 2 percent and a reduction of
bank reserve ratio, Yen said.</P>
      <P>Yen doubted that insider trading was involved in the case from
which the businesses run by Taiwan's Kuomintang had profited greatly.</P>
      <P>Citing reports by the Swiss-based International Institute for
Management and Development (IMD) that Taiwan ranked 38th in the world
in 1996 and 47th in 1998 in terms of its crackdown on stock insider
trading, New Party (NP) Legislator Lai Shih-pao also rapped the
commission for its inability to stop the irregularities in the stock
market.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Lai said, the Securities and Futures
Commission only handed over 34 cases of suspected insider trading to
the prosecutors for investigations, with four of them being indicted,
and only one convicted.</P>
      <P>The poor record of Taiwan's effort to guard against unfair stock
trading actually has turned the island into "the haven of insider
trading," he said.</P>
      <P>Both Yen and Lai also accused KMT Business Management Committee
Chairman Liu Tai-ying of trying to influence stock markets by often
publicly urging the investors to buy or sell specific stocks.</P>
      <P>Lin, however, said that his commission will redouble efforts to
stop insider trading.</P>

      <P>In Monday's hearing, Jan restated his willingness to exact Yang's
criminal responsibility for wounding him-- a crime which would be
pursued only on the victim's complaint-- even if the evidences were
not enough to convict Yang of attempting to commandeer a plane.</P>
      <P>Jan told the court that Yang persuaded him to transfer to a seat
beside Yang during the flight under the excuse that he wanted to file
a complaint and suddenly attacked him with a sharpen toilet flush
handle.</P>
      <P>Although Yang was immediately overpowered by the escort police,
the attack left a deep laceration on Jan's face.</P>
      <P>An ensuing inquiry found that Yang and the three other defendants
conspired to block the repatriation by controlling the plane with
force and diverting it to the US island of Guam, according to court
document.</P>
      <P>The three other accomplices, however, didn't come to Yang's aid
as Yang was subdued almost immediately, said prosecutors who presided
over the inquiry.</P>
      <P>In his testimony, Jan said he was not sure of Yang's motive to
attack him but felt Yang intending to kidnap him rather than hijack
the plane.</P>
      <P>All the defendants denied they conspired to hijack the plane at
the hearing. Yang said he wounded Jan to vent his anger over the SEF
for what Yang said SEF's climbdown on its promise of not deporting
his son Yang Yang, with whom Yang and his wife took with them when
they hijacked a plane to Taiwan in 1993.</P>
      <P>The three other defendants said they confessed to police about
their conspiracy with the hope of staying in Taiwan even if that
meant longer jail terms.</P>
      <P>They remained in custody after the hearing.</P>

him, you waste your words. A man of intelligence never loses his
opportunity, neither does he waste his words."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CPC PLANS ANOTHER OIL PRICE HIKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) may soon raise prices for its products again as international
crude oil prices have risen significantly in recent weeks, company
sources said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A senior CPC executive said crude oil prices have been
skyrocketing since NATO began air strikes on Yugoslavia over the
Kosovo issue in late March. For instance, the price for Western Texas
crude oil already surged to US$18 per barrel, far higher than US$16
originally predicted by the CPC.</P>
      <P>The executive, who preferred anonymity, said the company's
average crude oil import cost has ranged between US$12 a barrel and
US$14 since the beginning of this year. "We expect international
crude oil prices to continue rising in the months ahead," he added.</P>
      <P>The CPC announced a 2.69 percent hike for its oil profucts on
April 6. The adjustment range was based on two terms: the crude oil
price was US$11.67 a barrel and the New Taiwan dollar's exchange
rate against the greenback was NT$33.14 vs. US$1.</P>
      <P>"As international crude oil prices have continued rising since
then, we do not rule out the possibility of adjusting our prices
upward once again," the executive said, adding that the company may
announce its final decision next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The executive further said that the adjustment range will not
exceed 3 percent.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the recent crude oil price rise in the
international market can be attributed to two reasons: an
explosion at a US oil refinery which originally could produce
410,000 tons of oil products, and NATO bombing on Yugoslavia has
raised US demand for fuel oil. The US demand for oil has increased
by an average of 200,000 barrels a day since the beginning of NATO
air strikes on Yugoslavia.</P>

      <P>Canberra, April 27 (CNA): Australia has withdrawn its complaints
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) against Japan's 390 percent
rice tariff after threats of a trade war affected wheat and rice
exports.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, who also serves as trade
minister, on Monday said the decision was taken because Australia
faced the prospect of "a major blockage developing with rice and
wheat," which could have affected its next tender for rice exports to

steep tariff on imported rice.</P>
      <P>Japan imports rice from the United States and Thailand in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, April 27 (CNA): Australia's Prime Minister John Howard
and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer have issued warnings to rogue
army chiefs in Indonesia against challenging President B.J. Habibie's
authority on the issue of East Timor.</P>
      <P>Howard, Downer and Defense Minister John Moore on Monday arrived
in Bali and will start talks on Tuesday with Habibie and General
Wironto and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on ways to resolve the East
Timor problems in the wake of escalating violence.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the talks, Downer on Monday night issued a stern
warning to sections of the Indonesian military backing the violence
in East Timor, saying the violence must stop.</P>
      <P>Downer's warning came amid growing speculation in Jakarta that
Habibie has told the military that unless it stopped the killings, he
would order the armed forces to leave East Timor, which may trigger a
civil war in the territory.</P>
      <P>Downer said it's important that "all people in the Indonesian
military, at all levels, respect the Indonesian Constitution, respect
the position of the President of Indonesia, recognize that there are
elections coming up ... that will allow people to express their views
about the future of the country."</P>
      <P>Howard is expected to seek a firm guarantee that Jakarta will
fully implement the U.N.-supervised election in East Timor, including
the use of up to 100 foreign police. Howard's other goal is to seek
Habibie's commitment to an impartial and peaceful vote in July and
accept the need for an orderly transition to either autonomy or
independence for the territory.</P>
      <P>Last week, Howard and Habibie both agreed that East Timor should
finally be offered the option of independence. Both want this to be
done in an orderly and peaceful manner, supervised by the U.N.</P>
      <P>But elements of Indonesian military have decided they will not
allow East Timor to become independent, fearing independence would
fuel separatist sentiments in Aceh and Irian Jaya.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FISHING BOATS ACCUSED OF INTRUDING INTO FALKLAND WATERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The British Trade and Cultural Office
(BTCO) has lodged a protest to the ROC's Council of Agriculture (COA)
over Taiwan deep-sea fishing vessels' alleged intrusion into waters
near the Falkland Islands, a British colony.</P>
      <P>COA officials said on Tuesday that BTCO Deputy Director-General
Debbie Clarke and Peter Wickenden, BTCO economic division chief,
paid a visit to the COA on April 14 to express their concern about
the issue.</P>
      <P>The two BTCO officials accused Taiwan squid fishing ships of
having illegally operated in the Falkland waters. On April 22, BTCO
Director-General David Coates also wrote the COA, saying Falkland
authorities have secured the British government's approval to use
armed patrol ships to crack down on intruding Taiwan squid fishing
boats.</P>
      <P>Coates further said in the letter that Falkland authorities do
not rule out the possibility of opening fire at intruding Taiwan
fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that without operating licenses issued by Falkland
authorities, foreign fishing boats are banned from operating in
Falkland's economic waters because such operations will not only
affected Britain's rights but will also spoil its fishery resources
conservation programs.</P>
      <P>"We would not tolerate continued illegal operations by any
foreign fishing vessels in Falkland waters," Coates said in his
letter, adding that he hopes the Republic of China government will
immediately demand its deep-sea fishing boats not to illegally
operate in Falkland waters any more. Otherwise, Coates said, Falkland
patrol ships will open fire and arrest intruding Taiwan squid
fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>The British Trade and Cultural Office represents British
interests in Taiwan in the absence of former diplomatic ties between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>In response to the British protest, COA officials said they have
urged Taiwan deep-sea fishing ships not to illegally operate in
waters near both the Falkland Islands and Argentina.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials said the COA has asked British
authorities to use more moderate ways to disperse intruding Taiwan
fishing boats instead of opening fire at them.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has more than 100 deep-sea squid fishing
vessels and its annual squid catch is second only to Japan's in the
world. The open seas in the Southwestern Pacific and economic waters
of Falkland Islands and Argentina are the ROC's main squid fishing
grounds.</P>
      <P>Squid is a traversing migratory fish. In the past, ROC deep-sea
fishing boats often accidentally or unintentionally intruded into
other countries' economic waters while fishing squid in open seas.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>US investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter applied to the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) for
permission to open a branch office in Taiwan, a Morgan Stanley Taipei
official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>John S. Wadsworth Jr., chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in
Asia, said that if the application is approved, they will offer
securities and brokerage-related services to Taiwan and non-Taiwan
investors.</P>
      <P>The global investment bank is optimistic about Taiwan's economic
development in the coming five to 10 years, and Morgan Stanley
believes it will generate a profit by investing in Taiwan for the
long term. These factors were the reason Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
decided to establish a branch in Taiwan, said Wadsworth.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley will initially focus on brokerage services. When
they expand their operations in the future, futures-related services
will be offered, Wadsworth added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the SFC said that all foreign investment companies are
welcome to set up offices in Taiwan, and as long as Morgan Stanley
meets the SFC's requirements, its application will be approved.</P>
      <P>To apply for a branch brokerage license, the applicant has to
have brokerage experience in the country where its headquarters is
located. Apart from a sound financial condition, the applicant must
be free of any securities-related violations for the past two years,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY RECOVERING, ALBEIT SLOWLY, SAYS CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is recovering, though
slowly, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level CEPD said that the economy flashed a
"yellow-blue" indicator in the first quarter of this year, slightly
better than the preceding quarter's "blue" light, which indicates a
recession.</P>
      <P>Judging from the leading indicators and the coincident
indicators for March, as well as from the profits of the
manufacturing sector, the CEPD concluded that although Taiwan's
economic recovery is weak, the economy will not turn for the worse in
the near future.</P>
      <P>According to CEPD statistics, March's index of leading economic
indicators, which gauges economic prospects for the next three to six
months, stood at 96.3, up 1.8 percent from February. March's level
was the highest since November 1998.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which reflects present
economic activity, also grew 1.5 percent to 104.8, the highest level
since December 1997.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's estimate regarding Taiwan's economic growth is
cautious when compared with a forecast by the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research that indicated on Monday that the island's economy
"has begun making an upturn."</P>
      <P>When asked by the media whether Taiwan's economy has bottomed
out, an official with the CEPD's Economic Research Department said
that it is hard to make an accurate assessment merely through one or
two indicators.</P>
      <P>But "at least the economy will not turn worse in the foreseeable
future," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CEPD survey of the manufacturing sector showed that
sales by manufacturers in March increased 19.4 percent from February,
mainly because March had more business days than February, the month
of the most recent lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>New orders for March rose 2.7 percent, and the utilization rate
of equipment rose 2.2 percentage points to 78.7 percent. Net profits
originating from sales were up 0.3 percentage points to 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey indicated that 20 percent of polled manufacturers
believe the country's economic prospects will improve in three
months' time, while 73 percent believe the economy will remain at the
current level. Only 7 percent said business will turn worse.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE REASSURES PARAGUAY OF ROC SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion, April 27 (CNA)
(By Raymond Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
told El Dia Daily News a couple of days ago that he hopes ties
between the Republic of China and Paraguay will be strengthened
further after the new government of this South American country
weathered a crisis earlier this year.</P>
      <P>El Dia special reporter Roque Gonzalez B. reported that President
Lee made the remarks in Taipei while receiving a delegation of 14
reporters from Latin America. Gonzalez was a member of that
delegation.</P>
      <P>Lee spoke with the reporters about the ROC's strategy to put an
end to its isolation and to increase its presence in Central and
South America.</P>
      <P>President Lee pointed out that he wishes Paraguay can be a door
for the Republic of China to enter the South Common Market
(Mercosur), so that the Republic of China can extend its business
relationships with the economic bloc, which ties together Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.</P>
      <P>President Lee was asked how the Republic of China would seek to
improve its relations with Mercosur and whether Paraguay could play a
special role, as a result of its diplomatic ties with the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Lee smiled and said that is an idea he himself has proposed
before.</P>
      <P>"I proposed that idea. I think through Paraguay we should deepen
our relationships with the countries of the Mercosur, because trade
between us is bulky."</P>
      <P>"We have to increase our relationships with the Mercosur and
let's do it through Paraguay, which is our ally. This is a country
which helps us, and thus we hope to be partners of the Mercosur," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after being reminded that Mercosur concluded
an agreement with the European Union in 1995, which aims to reach a
treaty on free trade between the two blocs in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is necessary for the Republic of China to improve its
relations with Mercosur, because of the ROC's trade deficit with the
bloc.</P>
      <P>The reporter said the Republic of China is one of the countries
with the greatest purchasing power in the world, as its per capita
income exceeds US$13,000. Moreover, it constitutes an interesting
market for Paraguayan products.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Republic of China imported 54,000 tons of soybeans
from Paraguay. The reporter said Taiwan had sought to purchase
100,000 tons this year, though that now appears unlikely.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China government will
continue strengthening ties with the parliaments of its African
diplomatic partners to boost bilateral relations, Foreign Affairs
Minister Jason Hu said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As all of the Republic of China's African diplomatic partners are

    <HEADLINE>US TENTATIVELY AGREES TO SELL US$1.7 BILLION WORTH OF ARMS: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US government is leaning toward
approval of US$1.7 billion worth of arms for Taiwan, the US-based
Defense News reported in its latest issue that hit newsstands on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The weekly, however, pointed out that 11th-hour lobbying by
pro-mainland China interests may gut the package by half.</P>
      <P>The Defense News said a final decision was still pending
on Defense and State department recommendations to approve up to
two additional Patriot air defense batteries and a long-range early
warning radar for sale to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If approved, the weekly said, the package would supplement and
upgrade the three Patriot batteries Taiwan previously purchased from
Taytheon Co. under a specially tailored program called Medium Air
Defense System (MADS).</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Washington Times reported on Friday that
because of strong opposition from Kenneth Lieberthal, Asian affairs
senior director with the White House National Security Council, and
John Holum, the State Department's arms control division chief, the
Clinton administration has decided not to sell the AN/BOND phased
array early warning radar to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An annual US-Taiwan meeting on the island's demand for weapons
and military equipment will open in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting US government and defense industry officials, the
Defense News said the new Patriot batteries slated for Taiwan will
be similar to those sold in February to Greece.</P>
      <P>The Greek package, according to Raytheon's Feb. 23 news release,
includes Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) ground equipment and
the Guidance Enhanced Missile. The Greek package is more advanced
and sophisticated than the MADS previously sold to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Defense News said the AN/BOND phased array early
warning radar slated for Taiwan is similar to the US Air Force's
Pave Paws radar.</P>
      <P>US government and industry sources said the large, stationary
radar will communicate with Patriot ground-based fire control
sensors and could provide Taiwan an additional five or six minutes
of early warning to respond to a mainland Chinese missile attack.</P>
      <P>Some Clinton administration officials stressed that the missile
defense package was rendered necessary by recent mainland Chinese
missile deployments across the Taiwan Strait. However, the US State
Department and the National Security Council still oppose selling
such equipment to Taiwan, saying the sale may prompt Beijing to make
reaction detrimental to Taiwan Strait stability.</P>
      <P>In its latest issue, the Defense News also carried a commentary
urging the White House to improve defense cooperation with Taiwan in
various fields. It also urged the Clinton administration to make
positive response to Taiwan's arms purchase requests to be presented
at the upcoming annual meeting.</P>

Tuesday that he will depart on Thursday for an inspection tour of the
Pratas Islands.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a municipal meeting, Hsieh said the major purpose of
his trip to the Republic of China-controlled island group in the
South China Sea is to study the possibility of Kaohsiung's
demarcation of the islands, which will lay a foundation for the city
authorities' bid to develop the islands for tourism.</P>
      <P>Hsieh revealed that the Bureau of Civil Affairs under the
Kaohsiung City Government is currently working on the issue.
Kaohsiung's demarcation will also help buttress ROC sovereignty over
the islands, he added.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan authorized the Kaohsiung City Government to
have trusteeship of the Pratas Islands in February 1990.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Kaohsiung City Government's plan to develop the

    <HEADLINE>MERGER POISED TO FURTHER DEVOUR M'LAND CHINA'S INSTANT NOODLE MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's food giant President Enterprises
Corp. is set to buy into the company which produces mainland China's
favorite brand of instant noodles, Master Kang, a move which will
turn rivalry between two competitors into partnership, trade sources
reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>President, currently the second-largest manufacturer and
distributor of instant noodles in mainland China, is working to
acquire a 33 percent controlling stake, worth about NT$4 billion
(US$122.32 million), of Ting Yi Holding Co., the Hong Kong-registered
producer of Master Kang, better known in the mainland as Kangshihfu
convenient noodles.</P>
      <P>Currently, Ting Yi, known in Taiwan and the mainland as Ting
Hsin, which is owned by four brothers from Taiwan, is the top instant
noodle producer in mainland China, holding a market share of about 32
percent.</P>
      <P>The merger is also poised to further expand the Ting
Hsin-President domination of mainland China's instant noodle market
from the current 50 percent total market share.</P>
      <P>In addition, according to President Chairman Kao Chin-yen, the
new tie-up also promises to curtail stiff competition between Ting
Hsin and President in mainland China, saving them from cut-throat
competition by adopting a "win-win" approach.</P>
      <P>Until recently, Ting Hsin has been continuously lowering its
prices to keep its head above water in the face of severe competition
from President, which has seen its market share in mainland China
growing steadily.</P>
      <P>However, Kao said that the two companies only signed a letter of
intent last Saturday for the tie-up. Final agreement will not be
forged until late May after President has reviewed a complete
financial report to be provided by Ting Hsin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Cabinet-level Fair Trade
Commission said the President-Ting Hsin merger will not be approved
until the commission learns more about the nature of the venture.</P>
      <P>Fair Trade Commission Vice Chairman Liu Tsung-rong pointed out
that President operates more than 2,000 7-Eleven convenient stores
around Taiwan. After the merger materializes, Ting Hsin's
mainland-produced commodities will be legitimately allowed to appear
on shelves of 7-Eleven stores around Taiwan, with no distinction
between the Taiwan and mainland Chinese markets, which is currently
prohibited under the government's mainland Chinese policy, he added.</P>
      <P>Ting Hsin currently operates 12 production hubs and 1,450
distribution centers around mainland China.</P>
      <P>The company entered the mainland market in 1989 with start-up
capital of just a few million new Taiwan dollars, but has seen its
capital grow to more than NT$32 billion (nearly US$1 billion) over
the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Although its annual sales have reached over NT$20 billion (US$612
million) in previous years, Ting Hsin's turnover has been declining
in recent years due to growing competition and too-rapid
diversification of its business operations.</P>
      <P>President, which first cut into the mainland Chinese market in
1992, has increased its investment capital there to US$270 million,
with 15 production plants around the country.</P>
      <P>Ting Hsin began negotiations late last year with Campbell, one of
the leading food companies in the United States, for a possible
merger. However, the talks hit a snag recently after the two sides
spelled out differences over the portion of shares Ting Hsin would
yield, and the unit price of the shares.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN'S NEW GUIDELINES GOOD FOR REGIONAL SECURITY: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official with the Republic of China's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Tuesday that new
guidelines for US-Japanese security cooperation will help regional
peace and security.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-cheng, deputy director of MOFA's Information and
Cultural Affairs Department, made the comment as three bills related
to the new guidelines passed through the Japanese Lower House
earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Chen said that US-Japanese security cooperation is designed to
deter military threats from non-democratic countries, and will
therefore not only safeguard the United States and Japan, but also
ensure security and peace in the entire region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a deep interest over the six definitions of the
emergency situation in Japan's surrounding area which will be covered
by the new guidelines for US-Japanese security cooperation.</P>
      <P>One definition describes the emergency situation as "when
internal unrest occurs in some country, or when there is a danger
that a civil war in a third country may become an international

    <HEADLINE>ROC AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME 15 TIMES HIGHER THAN IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average per capita income in
mainland China in 1997 was US$860, ranking the mainland as a
medium-to-low income country despite it's listing as the world's
seventh-largest economy, according to statistics released on Monday
by the World Bank.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to official tallies, the Republic of China's
average per capita income in 1997 was 15 times greater than that of
the mainland, at US$13,198.</P>
      <P>However, dragged down by a weak New Taiwan dollar, Taiwan's
ranking for 1997 world average per capita income dropped sharply to
39 from the previous year's 23.</P>
      <P>The figures were gleaned from the bank's 1999 World Development
Indicators survey.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, mainland China's Gross National Product
reached US$1.55 trillion, ranking it the seventh-largest economy in
the world, and the second-largest in Asia in 1997.</P>
      <P>The 1997 top ten largest economies were the United States, Japan,
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, mainland China, Brazil,
Canada and Spain.</P>
      <P>In the same year, Taiwan was the 19th-largest world economy, and
the fifth-largest in Asia.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that the average per capita income in east
Asia and the Pacific accounted for just US$970, compared to the
global standard of US$5,180.</P>
      <P>Four countries in the region are defined by the World Bank as low
income nations for their below average per capita income. They are
Laos, with average per capita income of US$400, the Republic of
Mongolia, with US$390, Vietnam, with US$310, and Cambodia, with

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said on Tuesday that it will scale down a war drill by reducing the
amount of live ammunition fired, out of respect for local peoples'
concern about the impact on the environment.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Kung Fan-ting, a spokesman for the MND, told a weekly
press briefing that the "Cheng Kung Drill," aimed at demonstrating
the proficiency of a newly reorganized tank brigade, will also be
staged in two phrases to reduce the amount of shots fired by the
tanks.</P>
      <P>The first phrase of the drill is a demonstration of firepower to
be performed at a beach in the offshore county of Penghu on April 30.
It has been designed to show the combat skill of the tank unit and
will be presided over by Gen. Chen Cheng-hsiang, the army's
commander-in-chief.</P>
      <P>The second part of the drill, to be held on May 18, will be a
formal review of the unit and an exhibition of the its weaponry and
combat equipment.</P>
      <P>The review and exhibition, also to be held in Penghu, will be
observed by local government officials, military reservists,
servicemen's families and local residents, said Kung.</P>
      <P>The drill has roused the ire of local residents during its
preparation stages, because they say the ammunition used in the drill
will destroy the beach and coral in the area.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's former Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser on Tuesday warned NATO countries that Russia could be
drawn into the current Balkan conflict, and questioned the
effectiveness of NATO's continuing bombing in the region.</P>
      <P>Fresh from his return to Melbourne after visiting Moscow and
Belgrade, where he failed to secure the release of CARE Australia aid
workers, Fraser told a news conference that whether Russia will allow
Yugoslavia to run out of oil and ammunition needs to be watched very
carefully.</P>
      <P>If the answer is in the negative, then "Russia could be pulled
into" the conflict, which could increase the danger of widespread
war, he warned.</P>
      <P>Fraser, who was appointed an Australian envoy, met with Russian
leaders in Moscow to seek help in securing the release of Steve Pratt
and Peter Wallace of CARE Australia, the country's largest relief
agency, of which the former prime minister is chairman.</P>
      <P>He also met unsuccessfully with the Yugoslavian foreign minister
for the same reason.</P>
      <P>Fraser said Pratt was detained on charge of spying because he
used military language and possibly a naive determination to retain
CARE Australia's extensive records of its assets in Yugoslavia, which
contributed to his arrest as a spy.</P>
      <P>He said CARE Australia workers might have been naive in trying to
cross a border of a country at war. Despite his failure, Fraser said
he remained hopeful that the two aid workers would be released.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Verka Modanu, the Republic of Macedonia's
first resident envoy to the Republic of China, arrived in Taipei on
Tuesday to assume her post.</P>
      <P>Modanu said upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
that the Macedonian Embassy in the Republic of China will become
formally operational on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>She said she hopes that her work here will help cement bilateral
ties between Macedonia and the ROC, which established formal
diplomatic relations on Jan. 27 this year.</P>
      <P>Modanu, accompanied by her daughter, is here in a temporary
capacity as minister rather than ambassador, in line with similar
measures adopted by Taipei.</P>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appointed Peter Cheng,
Taiwan's deputy chief representative in the United States, to
Macedonia as the first ROC envoy to the Balkan state after the two
countries forged formal relations. Cheng arrived in Skopje earlier
this month to assume his post.</P>
      <P>Because of the opposition by President Kiro Gligorov to Skopje's
establishment of formal ties with Taipei, the current Macedonian head
of state is not expected to acknowledge the credentials from an ROC
ambassador to Macedonia, which is why Taipei decided to appoint Cheng
as a minister rather than an ambassador.</P>
      <P>The contingent arrangements by both governments are expected to
be changed later this year, after Macedonia holds presidential
elections in which Gligorov is not expected to be re-elected, MOFA
officials said.</P>
      <P>Modanu, who studied Chinese literature and history at the
University of Beijing between 1973 and 1978, speaks fluent Mandarin
Chinese.</P>
      <P>She was director of the Asian Affairs Department under
Macedonia's Foreign Ministry before being appointed envoy to Taipei.
She has been working with the Asian Affairs Department since the
independence of Macedonia in 1991. Before then, she worked for the
Yugoslavian government and a state-run trading company for about ten
years.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinatrust Commercial Bank (CCB) issued
its first platinum visa card in Taiwan on Tuesday, offering a "royal
identification" to those who seek the deluxe in life.</P>
      <P>A CCB spokesman said that holders of the platinum credit card
will receive more services than those given to gold card owners. For
example, he said, they will receive complete information on key
international meetings and various exhibitions, can join in health
care schemes, and will have booking privileges for transportation.</P>
      <P>The spokesman noted that platinum card holders are covered with
better travel insurance than that provided for gold card holders. In
addition, he said, the bank will help their "very important
consumers" to analyze their annual spending.</P>
      <P>The number of visa cards issued in Taiwan broke through the 10
million mark on Tuesday, making it the hottest plastic currency on
the island, Hsiung An-ping, Asia-Pacific vice president of Visa
International Service Association, said in Hong Kong, according to a
CNA dispatch from the formal Beitish colony.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, charges to visa cards
surpassed NT$100 billion (US$3.05 billion), reflecting the fact that
Taiwan's credit card market has not shrunk, despite the regional
recession caused by the Asian financial storm, Hsiung said.</P>
      <P>Turnover on visa cards reached more than NT$362.7 billion on the
island last year, according to VISA statistics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the fifth Asia-Pacific market to offer the platinum
visa card, following Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia,
VISA said.</P>

      <P>Board of Foreign Trade
Director-General Chen Ruey-long called at the Office of the US Trade
Representative (USTR) on Tuesday to exchange views with US trade
officials on Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO).</P>
      <P>Chen met with David Burns, a senior adviser to the USTR Office,
for talks primarily on Taiwan's proposed opening of its markets and
the signing of a final protocol on WTO entry.</P>
      <P>The WTO Secretariat has decided to hold a working group meeting
on Taiwan's accession from May 10-12, prompting Taipei to accelerate
preparatory work in Washington, Geneva and Taipei, in the hope of
being able to join the world trade regulatory body this year.</P>
      <P>The USTR has stressed on many occasions that Taipei's and
Beijing's accession to the WTO should be achieved based on their
respective economic and trade conditions, according to Burns, who
made a similar statement when he met an ROC delegation of legislators
in Washington, D.C. last week.</P>
      <P>USTR officials, however, have also hinted that Taiwan and
mainland China are expected by the international community to enter
the WTO simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The USTR is scheduled to make public its 1999 "Special 301" watch
list on April 30, and Taiwan is expected to remain included. USTR
officials said they are concerned about the fairness of Taiwan's
judicial process, especially in several cases concerning infringement
of patent and trademark rights of US-developed products, said Chen.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A committee of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) modified a controversial draft resolution on
Tuesday to head off the perception that the pro-independence party
has betrayed its original ideals and has accepted the Republic of
China as the official name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP Committee for Party Development decided to replace the
original text, which reads: "Taiwan, whose official state name is the
Republic of China," with "Taiwan, whose official name, as provided in
the current Constitution, is the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>The new statement mirrors the reality rather than the party's
official opinion, and should not offend the extremists within the
party who will not be satisfied with any idea less than an
independent "Republic of Taiwan," said a committee member.</P>
      <P>The original text, designed to free the party from having to
fulfill its previous pledge of pressing for Taiwan's independence via
plebiscite, has come under fire from party hardliners who criticize
it as backing down on previous DPP promises.</P>
      <P>The prospect of making plebiscite a constitutional right via
amendment, however, is dim in the foreseeable future, given the lack
of public support. In addition, many DPP leaders harbor the concern
that their campaign for independence will destabilize the subtle
triangular ties between Taipei, Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>They are also worried that blind adherence to the independence
cause will cost the party votes which are vital if the DPP is to come
to power in the next national elections.</P>
      <P>The new text of the draft resolution will be presented to the
party congress for approval on May 8 after receiving the nod from the
Party's Central Executive Committee.</P>

Hsu to settle their competition within the party.</P>

Madeleine K. Albright that he will seek legislation to circumvent the
decision if the State Department denies Taiwan a long-range early
warning radar system.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times quoted on Tuesday US officials close to the
arms sales talks as saying that the White House and the State
Department prevailed over the Pentagon in interagency policy
discussions and succeeded in blocking several important weapons
systems sought by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rep. Gilman noted in the April 22 letter that the State
Department "is advocating a policy that is not merely wrongheaded,
but also dangerous to the people of Taiwan and the personnel of our
US armed forces who may one day be called on to help defend Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The White House opposes the radar sales because of mainland
Chinese opposition to Asian missile defenses that could neutralize
Beijing's growing short-range missile force, reported the Washington
Times. The US Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that mainland
China will deploy up to 650 M-9 and M-11 missiles near Taiwan over
the next six years.</P>
      <P>"I will not accept a decision by the administration to deny early
warning radar systems to Taiwan," Gilman said in the letter, adding
that "I have directed my staff to prepare legislation to rescind the
president's legal authority to restrict the transfer of such systems
to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The New York Republican said that the legislation would be
introduced immediately after it is clear that the radar system sale
has been refused, adding that the measure "will command broad,
bipartisan support in the Congress."</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESSMAN SLAMS CLINTON ADMINISTRATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rep. Frank Wolf blasted the Clinton
administration on Tuesday for its "miserable" record on promoting
human rights, pointing to President Bill Clinton's decision not to
mention mainland Chinese religious persecution during recent talks
with mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.</P>
      <P>Congressman Wolf said on the House floor Tuesday that he believes
it is the Clinton administration's intention to miss the May 1
deadline for the Commission on International Religious Freedom to
submit its first report on the condition of religious freedom around
the world, by not naming its three commissioners as required by the
International Religious Freedom Act, which President Clinton signed
into law six months ago.</P>
      <P>It ensures that the Clinton administration can continue to "fudge
the facts" instead of taking serious action against countries such as
mainland China that refuse to protect the rights of religious
believers, said Wolf.</P>
      <P>The Virginia Republican said the administration's record on
promoting human rights "is positively miserable." In mainland China,
Catholic priests and bishops are still in jail and some have been
there for decades. So are Protestant pastors and lay people, he said.
Churches continue to be destroyed, and worshippers are beaten,
imprisoned and fined.</P>
      <P>But, Rep. Wolf pointed out, there was no mention of this by
President Clinton during his recent meeting with Zhu. Nor was there
discussion of the fact that Beijing has stopped all dialogue with the
Dalai Lama over the future status of Tibet or the mainland Chinese
government-sponsored campaign to encourage Tibetan Buddhists to
become atheists.</P>
      <P>Now, he added, a recent report indicates that the Christian
church in Hong Kong is getting squeezed in subtle ways. And the
Clinton administration has done nothing about the situation for
religious believers in Sudan, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The congressman stressed there is so much going on around the
world that there is no excuse for the Commission on International
Religious Freedom not to be given a chance to do its work. Too much
time has been wasted already, he said. "The lives of innocent people
are at stake and our lame response thus far is a disgrace," said
Wolf.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US READY TO SELL TAIWAN LONG-RANGE RADAR SYSTEMS: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration has agreed
in principle to sell early warning radar systems to Taiwan, according
to a senior member of Congress.</P>
      <P>Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R-N.Y.) said Tuesday that he had "initial
reports of the administration's decision in principle to approve the
sale."</P>
      <P>In a press statement, the chairman of the House International
Relations Committee said that "this is the right decision at the
right time."</P>
      <P>The decision "will send an important signal to the People's
Republic of China about our resolve to assist Taiwan in providing for
its legitimate self-defense needs," he added.</P>
      <P>According to his staff, the statement came after their telephone
conversations with White House and State Department officials, who
had apparently reversed their earlier position on this issue.</P>
      <P>According to a Washington Times report on April 23, the White
House and State Department were opposing the proposed sale so as not
to upset mainland China.</P>
      <P>In another article on Tuesday, the Times said that Gilman had
warned the administration against leaving Taiwan "vulnerable to the
growing (missile) threat" from the mainland.</P>
      <P>"I will not accept a decision by the administration to deny early
warning radar systems to Taiwan," he said in a letter last week to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</P>
      <P>He also said that he had directed his staff to prepare
legislation "to rescind the president's legal authority to restrict
the transfer of such systems to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Gilman had earlier sent a letter to President Bill Clinton,
urging him to approve the sale.</P>
      <P>In Tuesday's statement, the senior member of Congress said that
he will decide whether to introduce the legislation after full
briefings and assurances from the administration regarding these
transfers.</P>
      <P>The White House and the State Department had no immediate
comment. State Department and Pentagon officials earlier told
reporters that the United States remains committed to the Taiwan
Relations Act and its provisions related to Taiwan's defense needs.</P>
      <P>If the administration has indeed decided to provide Taiwan with
early warning radar systems, it will be welcomed news to a Republic
of China military delegation currently in Washington for the annual
defense procurement talks.</P>
      <P>The phase-array radar systems are said to be much more powerful
than any systems currently in Taiwan's possession and will provide up
to six more minutes of warning time against missiles from across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESENT POPULATION POLICY IS TO RAISE MARRIAGE RATE: MOI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Interior (MOI) said on
Wednesday the present population policy is focused on raising the
marriage rate to prevent a decline in, and the aging of, Taiwan's
population.</P>
      <P>According to an MOI report on Taiwan's population structure,
Taiwan's population will turn from zero to negative growth in three
to four decades, resulting in population gaps, a graying population,
a smaller labor pool and too many dependents.</P>
      <P>The MOI said Taiwan's present population policy should focus on
reasonable population growth, as both excessively high or low birth
rates are "unreasonable."</P>
      <P>According to MOI statistics, the number of Taiwan women who are
married fell from 61.8 percent of the female population in 1983 to
58.7 percent in 1997. The decline is attributed to the fact that many
women are marrying later in life.</P>
      <P>To improve Taiwan's marriage rate, the government should
encourage people to marry and have children at the "right time" to
combat the current tendency to marry late or not at all. The
government should also educate the public on the disadvantages of
having only one child, the MOI said.</P>
      <P>The MOI pointed out that even a moderate birth rate increase
could help maintain reasonable population growth, but officials said
the emphasis should be on getting people to marry at the right age
and have two children, not indiscriminately encouraging childbirth.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that Taiwan's population density of 606 people
per square kilometer is the second highest in the world. But birth
control policies have slowed the island's birth rate to
1.570 percent, and by 2036 the rate will be 1.170 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an aging population is expected to increase Taiwan's
mortality rate from 0.559 percent in 1997 to an estimated 0.624
percent in 2001 and 1.070 percent in 2031.</P>
      <P>As a result of more deaths and fewer births, Taiwan's population
growth rate is expected to fall from 0.948 percent in 1997 to 0.837
percent in 2001. Between 2031 and 2036, the rate is expected to drop
to almost zero, as birth and mortality rates become nearly equal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Alarmed by the latest killing of
teachers and students in the United States, the anti-gun lobby in
Australia has renewed its plea for a ban on all semi-automatic rifles
across the country.</P>
      <P>The memories are still fresh in Australia of the 28-year-old man
who used semi-automatic weapons to gun down 35 people and injure
scores of others at Port Arthur in Tasmania in April, 1996, stunning
the world and breaking the record for killings by an individual.</P>
      <P>As members of the bereaved families commemorate the dead in
Tasmania this week, the anti-gun lobby said the latest killing of 15
teachers and students in Colorado has revived fears of more such
incidents in Australia.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the 1996 massacre, Prime Minister John Howard
reacted by asking all gun owners to surrender their weapons. But gun
lobby groups and owners have resisted the government on the issue,
with less than half of the country's gun owners surrendering their
weapons between 1996 and 1998.</P>
      <P>The gun lobby in Australia is powerful, with around 3 million
registered gun club members.</P>

      <P>All mainland Chinese ministerial and

by their subordinates as a Maoist-style "rectification" campaign
intensifies.</P>
      <P>According to a report appearing in the Hong Kong Standard on

    <HEADLINE>PASSPORT FORGERY RING BUSTED; SUSPECTS NABBED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau (APB) announced
on Wednesday the cracking of an ROC machine-readable passport (MRP)
forgery ring and the arrest of four key suspects involved in the
production of forged passports.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that an MRP forgery ring has been busted
in Taiwan since the government began to issue the technically
advanced passports in 1995.</P>
      <P>Police said the ring has colluded with mainland Chinese human
smuggling rings to sell doctored or forged ROC passports to
prospective mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>APB Director Chang Shih-liang said aviation police have tightened
monitoring and security checks at major Taiwan airports after several
batches of ROC passports were reported missing from Chiang Kai-shek
(CKS) International Airport over the past few years.</P>
      <P>After several months of intensive investigation, aviation police
tracked down Lin Hsin-kuei, 46, who was suspected of falsifying ROC
passports. They launched an all-out search of Lin's home in Linkou,
Taipei County, on Tuesday evening after securing a search warrant
from the Taoyuan Prosecutor's Office.</P>
      <P>Police arrested Lin and three of his accomplices at Lin's home.
Also seized were a large number of photos of mainland Chinese people,
13 finished fake ROC MRP passports, 12 semi-finished fake passports,
13 US visas, four old-style ROC passports and a large amount of
counterfeiting equipment.</P>
      <P>Dozens of genuine ROC passports which had been reported missing
or stolen were also discovered at Lin's home. Initial investigations
show that at least one of those passports was stolen at CKS Airport
on July 4, 1998.</P>
      <P>Lin told police that he originally engaged in international
trade. About three years ago, he said, he began to counterfeit or
tamper with ROC passports with methods he invented himself. According
to Lin, a doctored ROC passport could fetch tens of thousands of new
Taiwan dollars on the black market, while a forged or doctored ROC
MRP could be sold to mainland Chinese human smuggling rings for up to
US$30,000.</P>
      <P>Police said they suspect that Lin's ring might have been involved
in the several large-scale passport theft cases reported at CKS
Airport, Taiwan's main gateway, over the past two years. On April 18,
more than 80 passports were reported missing from the airport.</P>
      <P>The three other arrested ring members were identified as Chen
Wen-jung, 45; Huang Chi-wen, 30; and Tseng Mao-lin, 51.</P>
      <P>According to APB officials, Chen is a senior executive with a
Taipei travel agency, and Huang is a medical college student, while
Tseng has an extensive criminal record for document forgery.</P>
      <P>The four suspects have been transferred to the Taoyuan
Prosecutor's Office on charges of document forgery. Police said they
will continue their investigations to check whether any other
accomplices are involved.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian federal-provincial committee
which watches over water safety has for the first time set limits on
the permitted amount of aluminum in the country's drinking water.</P>
      <P>Committee spokesman Barry Thomas said on Tuesday that all water
treatment plants should be run to achieve "the lowest level of
aluminum possible." The committee recommended that treatment plants
set a target of 100 micrograms per liter.</P>
      <P>"Neurological toxicity such as Alzheimer's is one of the concerns
we have," he said. Research suggests aluminum can accumulate in the
brain, killing cells and causing memory loss. Studies have found
higher rates of Alzheimer's where drinking water has high aluminum
levels.</P>
      <P>The committee has also launched a major study to examine the
health effects of water chlorination. Chlorine, used to disinfect
water, combines with organic matter to form hundreds of byproducts
which are suspected of contributing to the risk of cancer, especially
bladder cancer.</P>
      <P>Canada already has a health guideline for chlorine byproducts in
drinking water, which is 100 parts per billion, but there is concern
the guideline is too high. A task force will make recommendations on
the issue by 2001, said Thomas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO MAKE NO SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS ON WTO ENTRY: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang said on Wednesday that Taipei will make no concessions on
its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) during his
forthcoming trip to the United States.</P>
      <P>Wang explained his statement by pointing out that as Taipei has
already concluded bilateral WTO negotiations with Washington, no
further concessions are necessary.</P>
      <P>The economics minister is scheduled to leave for the United
States on May 3 to discuss Taipei's WTO bid with US Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, while negotiations of the WTO
Multilateral Working Group are to be held in Geneva from May 10-12.</P>
      <P>Wang's upcoming US visit is to solicit Washington's support in
the Multilateral Working Group talks.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in answer to questions from lawmakers at the
legislature during a joint staff conference of the Economic and
Energy Resources Committee, and the Budget Committee. The legislators
were concerned about Taiwan's WTO bid.</P>
      <P>Beijing's efforts to gain entry into the WTO have been
accelerated since mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji made
significant trade concessions during his recent US trip, and the
lawmakers wondered whether Wang would also make significant
concessions during his forthcoming trip.</P>
      <P>However, Wang observed that Taiwan's bid for entry into the WTO
is already firmly grounded, since the world trade regulatory body is
avowedly non-political.</P>

accession based on this fundamental point, Wang pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which has promised tariff and quota concessions
acceptable to WTO member economies, deserves an unbiased evaluation
of its application, stressed the economics minister.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming WTO Multilateral Working Group negotiations will
be critical for Taipei's bid, Wang said, and went a step further by
saying that Taipei's multilateral negotiations have proceeded into
the final stage.</P>
      <P>A total of 134 economies' backing will be needed, and the support
of the influential United States and the European Union are deemed
indispensable, Wang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SEES RISING ROLE IN HELPING ASIAN NATIONS DEVELOP SMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is set to play an
increasing role in providing its experience to help Asian countries
develop small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), according to a
spokesman for the Chinese Taipei delegation to the APEC SMEs
conference in Christchurch, New Zealand on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The three-day conference, in which delegates from 20 APEC member
economies took part, ended on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tze told CNA that the ROC delegation, led by Minister
without Portfolio Yang Shih-chien, was asked by delegates from
Indonesia and Thailand to provide assistance in developing their
SMEs.</P>
      <P>He said Yang and John Ni, director-general of the Small- and
Medium-Sized Business Administration under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, agreed to try their best to help SMEs in the two countries.</P>
      <P>"We have no reservations about offering our assistance to
Thailand and Indonesia and some other Asian countries in need of our
experience in the field of SMEs," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The conference ended with a joint statement which recognized the
rising role of SMEs in the development of APEC member countries.</P>
      <P>"SMEs will be the engine of growth in the knowledge-based
economies of the future. By their nature, they are innovative,
flexible and opportunity-seeking," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Four principal areas were defined by the conference as important
for promotion of SME growth:</P>
      <P>-- Enhancing management performance through education;</P>
      <P>-- Reducing barriers to trade and compliance costs;</P>
      <P>-- Improving capital markets and access to them; and</P>
      <P>-- Strengthening electronic links to assist businesses within the
region.</P>
      <P>Also emphasized was the need for educational training, removing
non-tariff barriers to trade, and the need for capital access so that
SMEs can overcome problems caused by a credit crunch such as the one
which occurred in Thailand, triggering the Asian financial crisis in
1997.</P>
      <P>In addition, the delegates recognized the importance of the Y2K
problem.</P>
      <P>They also recognized the critical role that SMEs will play in the
economic recovery of the Asian Pacific region.</P>

      <P>Women in Taiwan aged 20 to 30 consider
health, rather than love, to be the most important factor in their
lives, according to the results of a survey released on Wednesday by
Taiwan Cerebos Co.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Cerebos, the local branch of the Japanese foodstuff

their female consumers were asked to list the issues which most
concern them. The results show that 23 percent of the survey
respondents care most about their physical condition.</P>
      <P>The second and third most common concerns were work and academic
study, accounting for 19 and 13 percent, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US REAFFIRMS ROC ARMS POLICY DESPITE BEIJING PRESSURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of State reaffirmed
on Tuesday that its policy on arms sales to Taiwan remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>The State Department made the statement after He Yafei,
minister-counselor at the mainland Chinese embassy in Washington,
D.C., met with Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>He requested the meeting to express Beijing's strong opposition
to US arms sales to Taiwan, just as an annual ROC-US meeting on
Taiwan's arms purchase plans opened here on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He told the press before his meeting with Roth that Beijing
thinks that US arms sales are gross interference in mainland China's
sovereignty, and have impaired its territorial integrity. "Therefore,
we strongly ask the US government to strictly abide by its three
joint communiques with us, particularly the 1982 joint communique
which requires the United States to gradually cut arms sales to
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He, who once served as deputy director of the arms control
department under mainland China's State Council, said Beijing demands
that the United States stop selling advanced weaponry systems to
Taiwan, in particular the theater missile defense (TMD) system, as
well as all related equipment and technology. He said such sales will
adversely affect the development of Beijing-Washington relations.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the meeting, the State Department issued a press
statement which said US policy on arms sales to Taiwan has long been
widely known and that this policy remains unchanged. "We also don't
expect any change to this policy in the future," the statement added.</P>
      <P>The US Defense News reported in its latest issue that the Clinton
administration is leaning toward sales of US$1.7 billion-worth of
weapons to Taiwan, including additional Patriot air defense batteries
and the AN/BOND phased array early warning radar system. However, the
weekly also said some Clinton administration officials oppose sales
of those highly advanced defensive weapons for fear of offending
Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to an article carried in Tuesday's Washington Times,
Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R-N.Y.), who is also chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, has warned the Clinton
administration against leaving Taiwan "vulnerable to the growing
(missile) threat" from mainland China.</P>
      <P>"I will not accept a decision by the administration to deny early
warning radar systems to Taiwan," Gilman said in a letter to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Rep. Douglas Bereuter (R-Neb.), also chairman of the
House Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, said in an interview on
Tuesday that the United States and Taiwan have always conducted
bilateral arms deals quietly as it is appropriate.</P>
      <P>"Clearly we have the responsibility through the Taiwan Relations
Act, now 20 years old, to provide equipment that will provide
Taiwan's defense," Bereuter said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that mainland China's acceleration of missile
deployments along its coast opposite Taiwan will certainly cause
concerns of Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>"So as I've suggested to officials from the PRC and various
governments generally that governments have provocative actions are
not in their interest to do that," Bereuter said, adding that
Taiwan-US discussions on ballistic missile defense are quite a normal
reaction to Beijing's military build-up across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
said on Wednesday that the ROC government will not change its policy
on mainland China investment, even after Taiwan enters the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to a highly publicized merger of President
Enterprises with the Hong Kong-listed Tingyi Holding Corp., a
subsidiary of the Taiwan-based Ting Hsin Co., saying the Investment
Commission under his ministry will closely monitor the case once it
receives an application to proceed from President.</P>
      <P>Local media reported that President, a leading local
food-processing company, signed a letter of intent on April 24 with
Ting Hsin, the maker of the leading brand of instant noodle in
mainland China, to acquire a 33 percent share of its stocks.</P>
      <P>The transfer of shares is reportedly worth NT$ 4 billion
(US$121.2 million), and has aroused grave concern from ROC lawmakers
about whether the deal violates the government's "no haste, be
patient" policy regulating Taiwan investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The regulations require Taiwan businesses to register large-scale
mainland investment projects worth US$50 million or more with the
government, and each such investment plan is screened by the
government on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at an interpellation session at the
legislature, Wang assured lawmakers that the Investment Commission
will process the case fairly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fu Don-cheng, head of the Department of Economic
Affairs under the Mainland Affairs Council, declined to comment on
the investment plan, saying only that the government is willing to
see Taiwan businesses conduct "normal" investment in the mainland in
compliance with government rules.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong, April 28(CNA): Mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji is
being asked to tone down some of the concessions he reportedly made
to the United States to secure mainland's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the South China Morning Post reported today.</P>
      <P>The report said that a well-connected group is trying to persuade
top government leaders, including President Jiang Zemin, to revise
the terms for accession into the international trade body.</P>
      <P>A Beijing source reportedly said representatives of the textile
industry have asked the leadership not to yield to US demands that
quotas on Chinese textile exports be extended until 2010.</P>
      <P>"The textile lobby is close to Jiang and his aides because
Shanghai is the power base for the president as well as the
industry," the source was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Zhu cabinet has also been urged
by representatives of the banking and insurance industry not to open
that area of the economy too wide, too soon.</P>
      <P>Mainland bankers and insurers allege that US and other foreign
banks and insurance companies enjoy "political and psychological
advantages".</P>
      <P>Other WTO opponents have focused on possible threats to "economic
sovereignty" and even national security.</P>
      <P>Leftists, or quasi-Maoists, have long argued that an influx of
foreign capital and goods would aid efforts by "neo-imperialists" to
turn the mainland into a capitalist state via "peaceful evolution",
the report noted.</P>
      <P>Additionally, Zhu faces tough opposition from within the
telecommunications sector, where senior cadres including Information
Industry Minister Wu Ji-chuan holds reservations about opening up the
sensitive sector.</P>
      <P>The report said WTO opponents had switched to citing political
reasons for blocking multinationals.</P>
      <P>They quoted an anti-WTO lobbyist as saying state secrets might be

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING STEPS UP ATTEMPTS TO SUPPRESS TAIWAN IN WORLD COMMUNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on
Wednesday that mainland China is very likely to step up attempts to
suppress Taiwan in the international community after its premier's
recent barnstorming-style trip across the United States and Canada.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks in his report to the Legislative Yuan
Foreign Affairs Committee on the possible adverse impact on Taiwan
of mainland Premier Zhu Rongji's recent US-Canada visit.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Beijing leadership thinks its relations with
the United States and Canada have improved following Zhu's visit.
"Against this background, mainland China is likely to intensify its
suppression on Taiwan," he noted.</P>
      <P>Quoting mainland officials, Hu said mainland China has adopted a
new measure against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the new measure, Hu said, mainland China will deny visas
to foreign nationals whose passports bear ROC visas or
records showing they had visited Taiwan. Mainland China would accept
their visa applications only when they apply with new passports.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, two Europeans were denied visas by mainland
officials in Hong Kong. The mainland officials told the Europeans
that this is a new measure against Taiwan after Zhu's US visit. They
demanded that the Europeans apply for mainland visas with brand new
passports.</P>
      <P>Hu said some foreign countries have said they will
immediately issue their nationals new passports to enable them to
apply for mainland visas.</P>
      <P>"We hope the recent incident was just an isolated case," Hu
said, adding that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is closely
watching the developments of the issue and will work out
countermeasures to cope with the new situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said the United States has yet to make a final
decision on whether to sell long-range early warning missiles to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said the ROC government will not give up any
opportunity to seek US supplies of advanced defensive weapons to
help safeguard Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China needs long-range early
warning radars to have an additional five or six minutes of early
warning to respond to a possible mainland missile attack, Hu said
such equipment is defensive in nature.</P>
      <P>"We hope the United States will carefully consider our
defense needs and will not just consider mainland China's
possible reaction to its arms sales to Taiwan," the minister
stressed.</P>
      <P>In related news, Hu also said that Macedonian Prime
Minister Ljubco Georgievski has decided to postpone his planned visit
to Taiwan in consideration of Macedonia's current political and
economic situation.</P>
      <P>Georgievski was originally scheduled to arrive in Taipei on May
2 for his first visit to the ROC since the two countries forged
formal diplomatic ties in January this year.</P>
      <P>However, the military confrontation in the Balkans and the
influx of a large number of Kosovar refugees into Macedonia have
affected political and economic situation in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>"We have informed Georgievski that we fully understand his
difficulty and will respect his decision on his travel plan. We
welcome his visit at his convenience," Hu added.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said
on Wednesday that the nation will increase its purchases from the
Republic of Macedonia to help tide the Balkan nation over its present
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks during a meeting with Verka Modanu,
Macedonia's first resident envoy to the ROC, on Wednesday afternoon
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Modanu said that the flood of refugees fleeing the neighboring
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo into her country has had a heavy
impact on the nation's economy. She said that Macedonia had
originally agreed to take 20,000 refugees, but noted that more than
140,000 refugees have now swarmed across the border, representing
about 8 percent of Macedonia's total population.</P>
      <P>She said the multitude of refugees has greatly affected
Macedonia's stability, and added that Macedonian Prime Minister
Ljubco Georgievski announced on Tuesday night that the nation has
declared a state of emergency and has closed its common border with
Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, she said, exports to central and
western Europe have all stopped, dealing a devastating blow to the
nation's exports of tobacco, textiles, chemical and industrial
products, and wine.</P>
      <P>She also noted that plant closures have increased the
number of the jobless by 30,000 in the past two weeks alone, while
official figures put the monthly losses of the nation at US$220
million since Kosovo crisis, a huge loss for the already impoverished
country.</P>
      <P>Modanu expressed her appreciation for the help offered by the
government and people of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Modanu, who arrived here on Tuesday night to assume her post,
first toured the Taipei suburb of Tienmou, where the Macedonian
embassy is located, before calling on Hu.</P>
      <P>Hu welcomed her arrival, saying that her mission and goal are the
same as the ROC's -- to upgrade bilateral relations to a new level --
and that the ROC will always be on the side of the Macedonian
government and people.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the ROC will put together joint ventures, emergency
assistance for the refugees, and arrange for a visit to Taiwan by
Macedonia's Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>Modanu, who studied Chinese literature and history at the
university of Beijing between 1973 and 1978, speaks fluent mandarin
Chinese, and acted as an interpreter when Hu and Vice Foreign
Minister David Lee visited Macedonia.</P>
      <P>She was director of the Asian Affairs Department under
Macdeonia's Foreign Ministry since Macedonia's independence in 1991
before being appointed envoy to Taipei. Before that, she worked for
the Yugoslavian government and a state-run trading company.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Czech President Vaclav Havel will address
a joint session of the Canadian Parliament during his three-day visit
to Canada, which begins Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The last statesman given that honor was South Africa's Nelson
Mandela.</P>
      <P>The philosopher-poet turned Czech leader, whose writings and
charisma spearheaded the Velvet Revolution that brought democracy to
Czechoslovakia and then smoothed the division of the federation into
two republics, will likely wax philosophical in his parliamentary
address.</P>
      <P>Vladimir Kotzy, the Czech ambassador to Canada, said he has seen
extracts from the speech. It looks at the relationship between
humanity and the state, the balancing of rights and responsibilities
and challenges concepts of the individual's place in society, Kotzy
noted.</P>
      <P>Alain Dudoit, a former Canadian ambassador to the Czech Republic,
said Havel's speeches are always deeply meaningful. He is one of the
few leaders around who writes his own texts, Dudoit added.</P>
      <P>"All his speeches are defining speeches," Dudoit said. The
Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s Newsworld channel will televise the
speech live.</P>
      <P>The 62-year-old president of the Czech Republic is scheduled to
open his visit in Winnipeg by meeting members of the oldest
Czech-Canadian association in the country.</P>
      <P>He will fly to Ottawa on Thursday for the speech to a joint
session of the Commons and Senate.</P>
      <P>On Friday, he will sit down for talks with Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien.</P>
      <P>Havel, head of one of NATO's newest members and fresh from the
alliance's 50th anniversary celebrations in Washington last weekend,
will discuss the Kosovo conflict with Chretien.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other issues on the table, including the
Canadian requirement that Czechs obtain a visa before visiting
Canada, according to Kotzy.</P>
      <P>Canada imposed the visa requirement a year ago to stem a surge of
Romas, also known as gypsies, who flocked to Canada seeking refugee
status.</P>
      <P>The ambassador said, "It's an issue we're not very comfortable
with." He said the Czechs have been working with other European
countries to ease the plight of the Roma, who complain of bitter
discrimination in some Eastern European countries.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with the
mainland, Koo Chen-fu, on Wednesday urged mainland Chinese
authorities to resume the cross-strait dialogues.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF), made the
call while speaking at a tea party commemorating the sixth
anniversary of the first meeting between Koo and his mainland
counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) Chairman Wang Daohan, on April 29, 1993 in Singapore.</P>
      <P>During meeting Koo and Wang signed a joint agreement establishing
a mechanism for regular cross-strait dialogues.</P>
      <P>The accord marked the end of confrontation between the two sides
that began after the 1948 civil war.</P>
      <P>Beijing, however, unilaterally suspended scheduled cross-strait
talks in the summer of 1995 in protest against ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's visit to the United States earlier that same year, sending
exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland to a standstill.</P>
      <P>Tension in the Taiwan Strait began was able to begin easing after
Koo paid a visit to the mainland last October. During the trip, Koo
met Wang in Shanghai and reached agreements concerning the resumption
of Taiwan-mainland talks, including a visit to Taiwan by Wang this
year.</P>
      <P>Koo said Wednesday that he hopes cross-strait talks can be
resumed as soon as possible, calling them the best means to benefit
the people on Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies
established in 1991 to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence
of official links.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN OFFERS TO PULL OUT OF  RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian stunned members of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Wednesday by asking
the party leadership to name former DPP chairman, Hsu Hsin-liang, as
the party' candidate in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen, the popular former Taipei City mayor asked the DPP Central
Standing Committee not to alter the party's rules concerning the
nomination of party candidates for public office.</P>
      <P>The rules, which limit party members to stand for election only
once every four years, in elections for president, vice president,
Taiwan governor or mayorship of the two major municipalities,
virtually prohibit Chen from taking part in the 2000 presidential
election because of his failed re-election bid in 1998 for the
Taipei City mayorship.</P>
      <P>In a statement presented to the DPP Central Standing Committee,
Chen asked the leadership to urge Hsu to retain his party membership
and to name Hsu as the party's standard bearer in the presidential
race.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is afraid the party will split if Hsu withdraws.</P>
      <P>Hsu said last week he is ready to quit the party and run as an
independent if DPP authorities either suspend or do away with the
four-year rule.</P>
      <P>In an interview published in Wednesday's United Evening News, Hsu
stopped short of declaring his withdrawal from the DPP but pledged a
run, whether as the DPP candidate or as an independent, in the 2000
race in which he will be a serious candidate rather than an
also-ran.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee, however, refused to accept
Chen's offer, claiming that it was a personal statement not a
proposal formally presented to the meeting.</P>
      <P>Members of the committee persuaded Chen to take back the offer in
a closed door debate and were silent on the issue after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen announced his offer in an ensuring press conference at his
personal office Wednesday afternoon and called on the party to unite
behind Hsu's candidacy.</P>
      <P>His call met a cold reaction from Hsu who voiced doubt whether
Chen would really stop seeking the party's nomination.</P>
      <P>Contending that his proposed withdrawal from the party has
nothing to do with Chen's political ambition, Hsu said he would not
compete with Chen for the DPP nomination although he has decided to
run for president.</P>
      <P>He regretted that Chen has erroneously boiled down the dispute to
his contest with Chen for the party's blessing.</P>
      <P>Hsu echoed Chen's call to maintain the party's four-year limit,
saying that it should not accommodate any individual's ambition.
He lamented, however, that Chen made the call only after many party
leaders had already given their endorsement to waive the rule.</P>
      <P>Chen's sudden turnabout will plunge the party into turmoil which
will be difficult to rectify, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>The four-year limit is expected to cause heated debate at the
DPP Congress on May 8.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND NOT SURPRISED BY BEIJING'S BUILDING OF SIMULATED AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said on Wednesday that it is not surprised by reports that mainland
China has built an airport with bunkers and runways identical to a
major airbase in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Reports said that the airbase, which simulates Taichung's
Chingchuankang Airbase, was built next to the Dingxin military
airport in China's northwestern Gangsu Province. It is speculated
that the mainland will use the simulated airport to train its
pilots and missile units to attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kung Feng-ting, a MND spokesman, noted that mainland China has
never given up its threat to take Taiwan by force, and has always
seen Taiwan as a prospective enemy.</P>
      <P>Kung said the ministry has kept abreast of such information,
adding that in response to possible mainland infiltration and
sabotage, the military has reviewed its anti-air weapon deployment
and the air base security.</P>
      <P>The MND is also seeking to upgrade the quality of its military
personnel through various training and drills.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, An official in charge of the mainland affairs said the
simulated airport reflects the double-forked strategy of the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said on the one hand, the mainland is trying to woo Taiwan's
people through private exchanges, while still pressuring Taipei to
return to the negotiating table through military intimidation.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Beijing's simulated war against Taiwan targets will
not only raise international concern, but will make it easier for
Taiwan to purchase defensive weapons more easily.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman and secretary-general of
the intermediary body Straits Exchange Foundation, said that
Beijing's reported simulation will seriously hurt the feelings of the
nations' people toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shi said the mainland should understand why the number of Taiwan
people in support of unification with the mainland has dropped
dramatically since the government lifted the ban on visits to the
mainland, and why up to 80 percent of the public is in favor of
maintaining the status quo between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Shi also said that there is a possibility that the mainlanders
engaged in spying, photographing, and collecting secret military
information to obtain the blueprints for the Taichung airbase while
visiting Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky confirmed on Wednesday that she will meet with Republic of
China Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang in Washington, D.C.
early next month.</P>
      <P>Barshefsky, who met with the press after attending a lecture,
however, declined to answer questions about the accession of Taiwan
and mainland China into the World Trade Organization (TWO).</P>
      <P>WTO Director General Renato Ruggiero also met with the press at
the same occasion. He said he is positive that Taiwan will be
admitted soon.</P>
      <P>Disclosing that "mainland China will enter the WTO first, and
then ensues Taiwan," Ruggiero, nevertheless, ducked further questions
about how the process will be arranged.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang is scheduled to visit Washington,
D.C. May 5-7 to solicit US support at a time when the WTO is
accelerating the screening process for Taiwan and mainland China's
accession, according to Board of Foreign Trade Director General Chen
Ruey-long, who has just concluded two days of consultation with
officials from the US Trade Representative office.</P>
      <P>During Wang's stay, he will conduct a closed-door meeting with
Barshefsky. He will also meet with US congressmen, including John
Rockefeller (D-WV.) and Frank Murkowski (R-Ala.) and deliver a speech
to a US enterprise club, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>During Wang's second visit to Washington in 15 months, he will
drum up US support for Taiwan, and will reiterate Taiwan's stance
that Taiwan and the mainland's entry into the WTO should be handled
separately and be based on their fundamental economic and trade
conditions, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said in Taipei Wednesday that he will not make
significant concessions to speed up Taiwan's WTO bid during the

should serve those nobles and ministers in that country who are men
of moral worth, and you should cultivate the friendship of the
gentlemen of that country who are men of moral worth."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>US EXPORTS CAN HELP FREE PRC PEOPLE: COX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, April 28 (CNA): American policy toward the People's
Republic of China should proceed from a central premise, "It is our
sincere hope for the Chinese people that they will no longer live
under a Communist government," US Rep. Christopher Cox (R-CA) said
in an article published Sunday.</P>
      <P>The congressman wrote in the San Jose Mercury News last Sunday
that to this end, America's -- and California's -- world leadership
in high-tech enterprises promises far more than economic benefits.
"The export of these products to the Chinese people can be a great
democratizing and liberating force," he said.</P>
      <P>In January, the PRC sentenced Lin Hai, a 30-year-old software
executive and Web page designer, to prison for supposedly "inciting
subversion of state power." His so-called "crime" consisted of
exchanging e-mail addresses with an anti-Communist group in America.</P>
      <P>Rep. Cox noted that if Lin Hai had been able to keep the contents
of his computer messages away from the prying eyes of the Ministry of
Public Security -- using strong encryption in commercially available
software -- he would be a free man today.</P>
      <P>"That is why America's companies, the leaders in encryption
technology, must be able to export their products to China and around
the world," said the congressman.</P>
      <P>He explained that strong encryption is -- as Beijing's Communist
leadership is well aware -- "a massive threat to totalitarian regimes
and their government-maintained monopoly on information, because it
permits individuals to communicate privately without fear of
government eavesdropping or interception."</P>
      <P>The Californian Republican disagreed with the Clinton
administration that the current prohibition on American business
exporting encryption software is necessary for US national security,
saying the administration "seems to place a higher priority on
stopping the export of encryption software to the Chinese people than
on preventing the theft of our nuclear weapons technology by the
People's Liberation Army."</P>
      <P>Rep. Cox claimed that "This is exactly backward. Rather than
control commercially available computers, software and technology, we
should safeguard our most critical military secrets."</P>
      <P>He has chaired for the past nine months a House select committee
investigating the transfer of militarily sensitive technology to the
PRC. And the committee's classified report found overwhelming
evidence that such transfers -- including theft through espionage --
have caused serious harm to US national security, and continue to
this day.</P>
      <P>Although some have inferred that this would mean clamping down on
commercial exports, Rep. Cox pointed out that to the contrary, the
committee found that the current export-licensing process, which is
riddled with errors and plagued by delays, often does very little to
protect US national security, while frequently doing a great deal to
damage America's competitiveness in world markets.</P>
      <P>The committee has therefore recommended streamlining export
rules. The United States should provide a new "fast track" for most
items, while focusing greater resources and expertise on the limited
targets "that we know from our intelligence are the subject of
specific collection efforts by the PRC and others," said Rep. Cox.</P>
      <P>He added that encouraging exports to mainland China that promote
individual freedom and well-being is in the US national security
interest. For this reason, in addition to allowing the export of
encryption software, "US policy should focus on unleashing the
Internet as an engine of freedom in China."</P>
      <P>The recent public attention to espionage raises proper concerns
about America's lack of security, "but it should not distract us from
our objective of freedom for China's people -- a result that American
technology exports can help bring about," noted the congressman.</P>
      <P>Rep. Cox stressed that "It's time to focus not on whether to
engage -- we should all be agreed on that -- but rather on the terms
of engagement. We should have no illusions about with whom we are
dealing. We should have no doubt about where our policy is taking us.
Freedom -- not engagement and possibly marriage to a Communist
dictatorship -- is what our policy toward China should be seeking to
achieve."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIB TO INVESTIGATE CREATOR OF CHERNOBYL VIRUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei college graduate who is
performing compulsory military service has been targeted for
investigation for creating the CIH Chernobyl virus, which has
reportedly paralyzed computers in Asia and the Middle East, the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The man, identified as Chen Ying-hao, graduated from Taipei's
Tatung College of Industrial Technology and is now stationed at a
military base in northern Taiwan, according to CIB officials.</P>
      <P>Chen created the CIH Chernobyl virus last year when he was still
studying at the college.</P>
      <P>The virus, which is believed to have first attacked computers in
Taiwan in June 1998, can erase data stored on hard drives and make it
impossible to restart the computer by damaging the computer's basic
startup program, or BIOS.</P>
      <P>The virus targets computers running Windows 95 and 98 and has
spread mainly over the Internet and through the use of pirated
software.</P>
      <P>The CIH Chernobyl virus exists in at least three versions. The
most destructive one was timed to hit Monday, April 26, the 13th
anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. Another
version is set to strike on the 13th day of June, while the third
strikes on the 26th day of each month, according to officials from
CIB's Computer Crime Prevention and Control Squad.</P>
      <P>It was learned that Tatung College took away Chen's degree after
discovering what he has done, though they did not know at the time
that the virus could spread so much havoc.</P>
      <P>According to Republic of China laws governing
information-technology products and applications, Chen could face a
jail term of up to three years, CIB officials said.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports have said that the CIH Chernobyl
virus struck computers mainly in Asia and the Middle East, with South
Korea being the country hardest hit.</P>
      <P>Although some universities in the eastern United States have
reported that some computers had crashed because of the virus, US
experts are still assessing the damage.</P>
      <P>CIB analysts said some computer hackers create viruses not to
wreak havoc but to show off their "extraordinary" skills.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Liberalization is a global trend, and
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization will provide the
island with more advantages than disadvantages, P.K. Chiang, chairman
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a radio station, Chiang also said that
Taiwan is an export-oriented economy, and its entry into the world
trade body will help Taiwan's products to make inroads into the
international market.</P>
      <P>Chiang said, however, that many other nations are trying to make
inroads into the Taiwan market, and this will place pressure on
Taiwan's local automobile and agricultural industries. As such
increased competition is an inevitable trend, the government will try
to help upgrade traditional industries, he said.</P>
      <P>He also spoke on the progress of the Asia-Pacific regional
operations hub project, saying that both the construction of new
facilities and the deregulation of certain industries are central to
the project. The government will create a superb environment suitable
for investment and marketing by overseas manufacturers, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said a telecommunications center planned under the project
is moving toward total privatization, which means domestic consumers
will enjoy the benefits of cheap telecommunications services. As for
Taiwan's becoming a financial center, the Executive Yuan has worked
out a plan to lift bans on foreign investment in the Taiwan stock
market by 2000.</P>
      <P>But plans to develop Taiwan into a media center have lagged
behind compared with other centers under the project, he said, adding
that the problem lies with the slow pace of land rezoning.</P>
      <P>He stressed that to achieve the goals set out in the Asia-Pacific
regional operations hub center project, the nation needs to improve
the efficiency of the legislature and accelerate the pace of
deregulation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAD CHECKS AT 15-MONTH HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of checks that bounced in
Taiwan in March amounted to 98,159, a 15-month high, the Central Bank
of China (CBC) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The value of the bounced checks totaled NT$23.88 billion (US$730
million), a three-month high, officials from CBC's Economic Research
Department said.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the relatively high number and value of
bad checks in March to an economic slowdown that protracted from the
fourth quarter of last year.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the unusually high number and value was that
banking data recorded on Feb. 28 were not tabulated until March 1
because Feb. 28 was a national holiday, and the greatest number of
check exchanges for all of February occurred on the last day of the
month, CBC officials noted.</P>

(By J.J. Huang and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an effort to step up its accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Taiwan has decided to cut its
import tariffs on 4,500 commodities from a range of 7.55 percent to
8.25 percent to a range of 4.27 percent to 4.98 percent, according to
reports of the Journal of Commerce in New York.</P>
      <P>Among the 4,500 commodities, 3,400 items are industrial products,
while the rest are agricultural. An estimate made by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) of the Republic of China showed that Taiwan
will lose NT$22.4 billion in the first year of its participation in
the WTO, said the report.</P>
      <P>The paper cited Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung of the Council of
Agriculture (COA) under the ROC's Executive Yuan as saying that
Taiwan's agricultural sector will lose NT$34 billion in the first
year after Taiwan's entry into the WTO.</P>
      <P>Losses totaling NT$54 billion will likely be incurred by farmers
of beef, chicken, grapes and oranges in the sixth year after Taiwan's
WTO entry, added Lin. To reduce the impact, the COA will allocate
NT$21 billion for subsidies, the vice chairman explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRETORIA-BEIJING TIES ARE A BIG MISTAKE: SA SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Johannesburg,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Chang Jer-shong and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pretoria's decision to switch
official ties from Taipei to Beijing has proved a costly mistake,
wrote Professor Themba Sono of the University of Pretoria's Graduate
School of Management in an article that appeared recently in the
South African newspaper The Star.</P>
      <P>Asking "where's the Peking duck?" Sono said the promise of
economic prosperity as a result of relations with Beijing has yet to
be realized.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, hopes for a boon to South Africa's economy have
been dashed, as mainland Chinese exports to South Africa are harming
the country's economy, said Sono, who is also president of the South
African Institute of Race Relations.</P>
      <P>Trade imbalances are increasingly in Beijing's favor, the scholar
said, and he cited statistics indicating that in 1998 -- the year in
which South Africa established relations with Beijing -- South
Africa's exports to mainland China amounted to less than 1 billion
rand (US$164.75 million), whereas imports from mainland China totaled
more than 4 billion rand.</P>
      <P>Including trade with Hong Kong into the calculations makes the
disparity even worse, he said, warning that the gap is set to widen
further this year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, vast numbers of unemployed mainland Chinese people have
emigrated to South Africa to make a new start. As a result, South
Africa's Chinese community has grown from 30,000 or 40,000 two years
ago to more than 120,000 today.</P>
      <P>"Many Chinese find their way into SA (South Africa) illegally via
our neighboring cities of Mbabane, Maseru and Maputo," he wrote. In
addition there has also been increases in illegal smuggling and in
the number of Chinese gang members in the country, he said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan businesses in South Africa once
numbered 620, and together they employed 45,000 local people. The
figure has since dropped to 33,000, Sono said. He also pointed out
that in 1997, South Africa's imports from Taiwan totaled 760 million
rand, while exports to the island reached more than 1 billion rand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EARLY WARNING SURVEILLANCE CRITICAL TO TAIWAN'S DEFENSE: REPORT (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  28  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's geographic features have
made early warning surveillance for cueing purposes essential to the
defense of Taiwan against communist China, according to a US
Department of Defense report.</P>
      <P>The non-confidential Pentagon report, which was sent to Congress
on Wednesday, analyzes the architecture requirements for a theater
ballistic missile defense (TBMD) system in the Asia-Pacific region to
protect key regional allies and friends of the United States.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon carried out the study in accordance with Section
1533 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.
The confidential part of the report was already sent to Congress in
February.</P>
      <P>The 13-page non-confidential report mainly addresses missile
defense options for Japan, South Korea and Taiwan separately based
on the unique political and military threat environment confronting
each one.</P>
      <P>Three pages of the report were devoted to Taiwan-related
issues. Five architecture options were developed and examined for the
defense of Taiwan based on the unique political and military threat
environment facing the island.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that the key geographic feature
dominating the architecture requirements and options for the defense
of Taiwan against mainland China is the short 175 km sea barrier
between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>"Shorter range missiles could fly over that barrier and remain
inside the atmosphere for the entire trajectory," the report said,
adding that with the size of mainland China, an attack could come
from multiple directions.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the report said, mainland China possesses theater
ballistic missiles with longer ranges. "These features make early
warning surveillance for cueing purposes essential for an effective
missile defense," it noted.</P>
      <P>The report presented five active theater missile
defense force structure options for the defense of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the Pentagon assessment, lower tier land- and
sea-based architectures could adequately defend most of Taiwan's
critical assets.</P>
      <P>However, the report said, neither architecture can provide any
defense against longer range theater ballistic missiles (TBMs.)</P>
      <P>To address the full range of threats, the report explored three
land- and sea-based upper tier options. One land-based upper tier
fire unit, with an additional Theater High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD)-like radar, would be able to cover the entire island of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This system could intercept incoming missiles both inside the
atmosphere (endo-atmosphere) and outside the atmosphere
(exo-atmosphere)," the report said, adding that this architecture is
referred to as an endo-exo option.</P>
      <P>The report went on to say that either sea-based upper tier exo
system could cover all of Taiwan, adding that only one ship position
is required for either sea-based exo-upper tier system.</P>
      <P>The fifth option examined in the Pentagon report is the fast exo
upper tier system, which the report said could also provide
shoot-look-shoot coverage for portions of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report explained that the development of Taiwan missile
defense architecture options were based on short and medium range
ballistic missile threats which are expected to increase
significantly over the next several years.</P>
      <P>"Both of these missile types have apogees outside the
atmosphere. The medium range missile also has a re-entry speed
likely to preclude a high probability of intercept by lower tier
systems," the report said.

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung, Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pentagon said the architecture options analyzed for
Taiwan, Japan and South Korea in no way suggest or imply a
region-wide architecture network.</P>
      <P>"The report does not advocate or recommend deployment of any
specific TMD architecture," the Pentagon said, adding that the report
is neither aimed at discussing issues related to the TBMD development
and production nor at discussing requirements for any TBMD technology
transfer.</P>
      <P>The report only provides a general review of TBMD architecture
options probably to be available in the early years of the 21st
century.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon said it involves many complicated problems to
develop TBMD defense for Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. A
comprehensive, in-depth analysis is needed before a definite
conclusion can be reached, the Pentagon stressed.</P>
      <P>It also said if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait imporve their
relations, mainland China's missile threats to Taiwan may be reduced.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the architectures utilize
representative TBMD systems now under development, including Patriot
PAC-3, Navy Area Defense, Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
and Navy Theater Wide (NTW) similar to the Block I and Block II
systems.</P>

Director-General Chen Ruey-long on Wednesday completed talks with the

Working Group, although no conclusion was reached on the issue of
motorcycle imports, sources reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, there are 185 paragraphs in Taiwan's WTO
Working Group report, and he exchanged viewpoints with the United
States regarding measures related to the government procurement and
government subsidies.</P>
      <P>During the talks, the US Trade Office accused Taiwan of having
overly harsh regulations on exhaust standards for motorcycles with
engines larger than 150 cubic centimeters, saying Taiwan's
regulations are tougher than the strictest US regulations.</P>
      <P>The US Trade office went a step further by urging Taiwan's
Environmental Protection Bureau to conduct exhaust inspections on
US-made Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The office said that as long as
the motorcycles pass Taiwan's exhaust standards, the United States
will not insist that Taiwan revise its environmental protection
regulations.</P>
      <P>But Chen said that Taiwan must have high standards since
motorcycles are the main form of transportation on the island.</P>

      <P>Presidential hopeful Hsu Hsin-liang, a
former chairman of opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
told the press Thursday that he will definitely not seek to represent
the DPP in Taiwan's 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he loves the DPP, but he loves Taiwan even more. He said
he has always taken Taiwan's interests as a whole into consideration,
and then weighed what position the DPP and he himself should take,
instead of taking only the DPP's interests as a base to weigh what
national policy and his personal position should be.</P>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian told a news conference
Wednesday that he would consider pulling out of the presidential race
-- although he has not yet announced his candidacy -- if that was the
only way to prevent Hsu from quitting the party. Chen also appealed
at a meeting of DPP's Central Committee to leave the controversial
"four-year clause" unchanged in the party charter.</P>
      <P>According to the clause, the former Taipei mayor will be barred
from running for president under the party banner until four years
after stepping down as mayor.</P>
      <P>Chen even recommended Hsu be given the nomination, he said in a
statement at a news conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to Chen's statement, Hsu noted that if what Chen said
Wednesday was only for the sake of preventing Hsu's departure from
the party, then Chen can safely seek to represent the DPP in the
election, adding that he would not contest Chen within the DPP.</P>
      <P>Hsu once said he definitely plans a run on his own, regardless of

      <P>Labor workers will hold an islandwide

unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>In previous years protests were held in Taipei and Kaohsiung
only.</P>
      <P>News of the planned protest was announced by the preparatory
committee of a nationwide labor union during a "New Taiwanese'
Nightmare -- May 1 Anti-Unemployment March" press conference in front
of the Legislative Yuan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The committee will coordinate rallies by 15,000 workers in 11
cities and counties around the island to protest what they perceive
as government inaction over Taiwan's unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>The committee said that during the economic depression, the
government addressed only the difficulties faced by businesses and
not those affecting workers, such as unemployment.</P>
      <P>They added that the present policy of privatizing state
enterprises is only adding to the workers' burden, and has caused
30,000 people to lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>Among the demands of the committee were an unemployment insurance
law, a policy of offering laborers the same aid funds that are

      <P>Foreign brides married to Taiwan men will
be asked to attend classes by the Republic of China government aimed
at helping them get accustomed to their lives in Taiwan, the Interior
Ministry said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Interior Ministry said that starting late this year, foreign
brides, with the exception of those from mainland China, will be
required to take part in the classes before being granted permanent
residency in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>M.C. Liu, head of the Population Administration Department under

currently being given by Meinung authorities in the southern township
in Kaohsiung County to foreign brides living there.</P>
      <P>The classes, which will be fully implemented late this year or
early next year, are designed to help foreign brides overcome
language and cultural differences while living in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
Liu said the number of applications by foreign spouses wishing to
reside in Taiwan has amounted to more than 50,000.</P>
      <P>Most of the foreign brides in Taiwan are from Southeast Asian
countries, with those from Vietnam -- totaling more than 20,000 --

the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar, he said.</P>
      <P>An investigation by the Taiwan Provincial Family Planning

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Thursday
wished a happy Labor Day to Taiwan workers, and hailed them as the
driving force behind Taiwan's progress.</P>
      <P>Attributing Taiwan's development to the hard work and efforts of
the island's vast number of workers, Lien encouraged them to continue
learning at work in order to pursue greater achievements.</P>
      <P>"I see Taiwan's future in everyone here," the vice president
said.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks prior to celebrations marking Labor Day,
May 1, during a visit to a precision machinery company at the Shenken
Industrial Zone in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lien also reiterated that the government is paying heed to
workers' safety in their workplace, pointing out that the Council of
Labor Affairs will designate this year as a "work safety year," which
is a reflection of the government's intention to build a safer

    <HEADLINE>DPP EX-CHAIRMAN RULES OUT SEEKING PARTY NOMINATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said on Thursday that he would not seek the
party's nomination in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In a riposte to a challenge from arch intra-party rival Chen
Shui-bian on Wednesday, the former DPP party head solemnly declared
at a press conference that he will not compete with Chen for the
chance to stand for the DPP in the election.</P>
      <P>He urged Chen to declare his candidacy immediately and said he
would not stand in Chen's way. If Chen does not declare his
intentions, the DPP should seek out another presidential hopeful to
stand for the party, he said.</P>
      <P>But Hsu stopped short of announcing his departure from the party
he helped to found.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former Taipei mayor, is widely believed to be the party's
best hope of winning the next presidential election, although he is
barred from seeking the DPP's nomination for president under current
party rules.</P>
      <P>Chen lost a re-election bid for Taipei mayor last December, and
DPP rules prohibit someone who has run for certain elected positions
-- those of president, vice president, governor of Taiwan Province,
and mayor of Taipei or Kaohsiung -- from running for any of those
posts again for four years.</P>
      <P>Although Chen did not publicly declare his intention to take part
in the party's primary, he has made his intentions clear by going on
a whistle-stop tour around the island and abroad to seek political
support.</P>
      <P>To help Chen secure the party's nomination, many DPP leaders have
called for the so-called "four-year clause" to be waived.</P>
      <P>Their advocacy of Chen's nomination offended Hsu and led to his
announcement that he intended to quit the DPP and run as an
independent. He will reportedly announce his final decision before a
DPP party congress on May 8.</P>
      <P>The reports that Hsu will withdraw from the party have brought
Chen under fire from Hsu's supporters. In a surprise preemptory
movement aimed to turn the tables on Hsu, Chen urged the party on
Wednesday to retain its "four-year clause," and he voiced support for
Hsu's candidacy.</P>
      <P>While stopping short of saying he would not seek the party's
nomination, Chen said in a statement that the DPP cannot afford a
split within the party in the run-up to the election.</P>
      <P>His announcement put pressure on Hsu and plunged the party into
chaos. Many party leaders who had been trying desperately to dissuade
Hsu from quitting the party are now scrambling to urge Chen to
withdraw his call to keep the four-year clause.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to dispel perceptions that his announcement on
Wednesday was made with tongue in cheek, Chen reiterated on Thursday
his sincerity in calling for the DPP to name Hsu as its presidential
candidate.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Lee
Hsien Loong has been named Asiamoney's "Central Banker of the Year"
for 1999.</P>
      <P>Explaining the honor given to Lee, the Monetary Authority of
Singapore's chairman, Asiamoney editor Will Goodhart, told The Strait
Times:</P>
      <P>"At a time when other countries were moving in the
opposite direction, the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) has
taken steps to open up Singapore's financial services sector and has
embarked on an impressive reform program that will enhance its status
as an Asian financial center. The impetus that BG Lee has provided to
that program earns him the award in a year that saw strong
competition from other Asian central bankers."</P>
      <P>Thailand's Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda is this year's "Finance
Minister of the Year," while Lee Hun Jai, commissioner of South
Korea's Financial Supervisory Commission, was named the region's best
restructuring agency chief -- in an award newly introduced by the
magazine.</P>
      <P>In an article on Lee's award, Asiamoney added: "He is not a
central banker by training, nor does he concern himself with
day-do-day management of monetary policy in Singapore, but his
position atop the city state's monetary authority and his actions as
that body's chairman more than qualify Lee Hsien Loong for the
Central Banker of the Year award."</P>

      <P>Amid serious internal disputes, the
Democratic Progressive Party will convene a crisis meeting Saturday
of its Central Standing Committee, said the party's chairman.</P>
      <P>Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung asked former Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang not
to drop out of the party for the sake of party solidarity. Hsu
revealed his plans to withdraw from the DPP during an announcement
Thursday that he would not seek to represent the party in next year's
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsu said last week that he is ready to quit the party and run as

charismatic former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian as the party's

      <P>Lin urged Hsu to stay within the party to combat the ruling
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Hsu has led the opposition party for at least four

    <HEADLINE>CHUNGHWA TELECOM PRIVATIZATION PLAN APPROVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan to privatize state-run Chunghwa
Telecom Co. Ltd. by auctioning it off on the stock market was
approved by the Legislative Yuan on Thursday amid fierce protests by
company employees.</P>
      <P>The controversial plan was shepherded through the floor of the
legislature by legislators of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), which
consider the privatization of the company a vital part of its efforts
to deregulate the telecom market and prepare the island for World
Trade Organization membership.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators supported the plan after tacking on a
five-point resolution that requires the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications to raise the target selling price of the company's
share from the proposed NT$40 to NT$60, and to look after the
interests of the employees.</P>
      <P>They first vetoed a motion by opposition parties to postpone the
bill, then rammed it, as well as the five-point resolution, through
the floor in a vote largely on party lines.</P>
      <P>Outside the Legislative Yuan, some 5,000 Chunghwa Telecom
employees protested the privatization plan, which they said would
result in the company's shares being sold at too low a price and in
their interests being harmed.</P>
      <P>They clashed with riot police, and several were held briefly,
though they were later released.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Fong-cheng said
the protesters' claims were groundless and welcomed the passage of
the plan, saying it will speed up the liberalization of Taiwan's
telecom market and result in more efficient and cheaper telecom
services for consumers.</P>

      <P>The US State Department refused
Thursday to confirm news reports that the United States has agreed to
sell to Taiwan early warning radar systems.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman James Rubin said that an agreement
between Taiwan and the United States on the matter prohibits public
discussion of the results of arms sales consultations.</P>
      <P>When asked about reports of the sale of long-range radar systems
to Taiwan, Rubin told a routine press briefing that in accordance
with the Taiwan Relations Act, the US president and Congress
determine which defense articles and services Taiwan needs to
maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.</P>
      <P>Under the act, there are periodic consultations that include
Taiwan military representatives, he said.</P>
      <P>"We have had a frank and broad exchange of views on issues
related to Taiwan's self-defense needs, but both sides have agreed
not to discuss the details of this process," he said.</P>
      <P>When asked to confirm that there have been consultations with
Taiwan in the last two days, Rubin said there have been consultations
but refused to discuss the results, adding that his understanding is
that the Taiwan delegation is still in Washington.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FBI DIRECTOR CONFIRMS SECURITY BREACHES: US SENATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>FBI Director Louis J. Freeh has
confirmed that espionage activities at US national weapons
laboratories represent "a deep penetration by the Chinese," according
to Sen. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Committee on
Intelligence.</P>
      <P>Shelby said that although it is not known how deep or wide the
penetration has been at this point, it is nevertheless significant.</P>
      <P>The senator said the committee will push legislation he
introduced in the Senate to put a moratorium on visits to weapons
laboratories by foreign nationals this year. He said it is likely
other forms of legislation will be drafted that deal with other
aspects of the alleged espionage.</P>
      <P>Although Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is not presently
interested in suspending the visitation program, Shelby said, "I told
him that we weren't trying to stop it, we wanted to slow it down and
evaluate it, because I think national security at our labs has to be
of paramount interest to the United States."</P>
      <P>The alleged espionage activities represent an ongoing threat to
US national security and require swift and decisive action, he said,
adding that this is why he introduced legislation on Wednesday that
would "suspend all visits to American nuclear research laboratories
by scientists from sensitive countries," including mainland China,
according to a statement.</P>
      <P>"Sensitive countries," according to Shelby, are those considered
dangerous to the United States and those determined to be interested
in acquiring American nuclear weapons secrets.</P>
      <P>He told reporters after a closed committee hearing that Freeh
gave his committee a comprehensive update on the status of the ongoing
investigation of espionage at US national labs, specifically Los
Alamos, and said that as the investigation is unfolding, it is
confirming some of their worst fears in regard to what information
mainland China has had access to.</P>
      <P>The Senate Committee on Intelligence has basically finished its
investigation report on the alleged mainland Chinese espionage and
they hope to release it in the next week or 10 days, added the
Alabama Republican.</P>
      <P>Freeh has been unwilling to discuss possible arrests since the
investigation has not been concluded, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei will again voice at an annual board
meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) its objections to the
bank's decision in 1986 to change the designation of the Republic of
China within the organization, sources from the Central Bank of China
(CBC) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan led an ROC delegation to Manila to
attend the annual meeting, which opened Friday.</P>
      <P>The ADB changed the ROC's designation from the Republic of China
to "Taipei, China" after mainland China was admitted to the body in
March 1986.</P>
      <P>Perng will lodge the ROC's protest against the name change while
making a report on Taiwan's current economic and financial situation,
said CBC officials.</P>
      <P>A founding member of the organization, the Republic of China
boycotted the bank's board meetings in 1986 and 1987 in protest over
the name change.</P>
      <P>In April 1988, then CBC Governor Chang Chi-cheng led an ROC
delegation to the ADB meeting, held in Manila, under protest.</P>
      <P>In May 1990, when the ADB's annual meeting was held in Beijing,
then Finance Minister Shirley Kuo led the ROC's delegation to the
meeting, also under protest. Kuo's attendance at the ADB meeting set
a precedent in regard to ROC officials attending international
meetings in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's stake in the ADB currently stands at 1.25
percent, which puts it 13th among the organization's 55 members. The
ADB was founded in 1966 to bolster economic and social development in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Traumatized employees -- not stolen cash

security expert said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Gene McLean, security director for the Canadian Bankers
Association, said robbers take about C$4 million in an average of
1,300 robberies per year.</P>
      <P>"It's not an issue of money," the retired policeman told a crime
forum in Vancouver. "There is very little money taken from bank
robberies as a rule."</P>
      <P>Trauma is more expensive, McLean said, adding that is "the key
cost of bank robbery -- the trauma to employees, the time off they
take, the counseling required, the loss of work."</P>
      <P>There were 1,365 bank robberies in Canada last year, up from
1,309 in 1997. Of the total, 193 were in Vancouver, while Toronto had

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA ANNOUNCES SLIGHT RISE IN IMMIGRATION INTAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government has announced
a slight increase in its immigration intake for fiscal 1999-2000,
resulting in demands for an even bigger quota from Victoria Premier
Jeff Kennett and the business sector.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on Thursday night announced
that the government would allow 70,000 migrants -- including those in
the business and skilled, and family reunion categories -- to come to
Australia in the next fiscal year. This figure excludes the steady
quota of 12,000 refugees admitted yearly on a humanitarian basis.</P>
      <P>In fiscal 1998-99, which ends on June 30 this year, Australia is
expected to have attracted up to 68,000 migrants from Taiwan,
mainland China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia and other areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-TECH IS TAIWAN'S EDGE, SAYS US GURU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's competitiveness lies in its high
technology, and only through high-tech development can Taiwan create
profits, said an American management guru here on Friday.</P>
      <P>Michael E. Porter, a Harvard University professor, said that
seeking profits and growth through high-tech industries is the only
feasible way for Taiwan to upgrade its international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Porter made the remarks during a summit meeting with Taiwan's top
entrepreneurs on competitiveness strategies.</P>
      <P>Porter, who arrived in Taipei on Thursday at the invitation of
German company SAP and Commonwealth magazine, said he agrees with the
Taiwan government's "no haste, be patient" policy toward mainland
China.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will not sharpen its competitive edge by
increasing investments or stepping up business activities in mainland
China, whose market is "less cutting-edge and less sophisticated"
than Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>He reiterated Friday a viewpoint on Taiwan's competitiveness that
he spelled out during a lecture made on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has to make good on its uniqueness -- by producing
scientific and technological innovations -- if it intends to maintain
its competitiveness, said Porter, who has written 15 books and more
than 50 papers on economic development and management strategy.</P>
      <P>Porter said Taiwan does not stand much of a chance of becoming an
Asia-Pacific business operational center in the face of competition
from Singapore and Hong Kong, but Taiwan has one of the highest
"innovation indexes" of all developing countries, and holds promise
as an "innovation center" in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has remained largely unscathed by the Asian economic
crisis that has ravaged neighboring countries, indicating that most
of the development policies and strategies followed in past years
were correct, Porter pointed out.</P>
      <P>But to remove impediments that threaten to diminish Taiwan's
competitiveness, Taiwan should accelerate reforms that have not been
completed, including the streamlining of its financial systems and
cutting down on government red tape, he added.</P>
      <P>Porter offered Taiwan four suggestions to turn its innovation
strengths into real assets: maintain a high standard of investment in
research and development (R &amp; D), make the government more
transparent, further improve intellectual property protection and
shift R &amp; D work from government-financed agencies to private sectors
and educational institutions.</P>
      <P>Porter, whose insights, articles and books have helped shape a
new generation of corporate thinking, left Taipei Friday at around
noon, after attending the summit meeting.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Porter met with Vice President Lian Chan, Premier
Vicent Siew and other high-ranking officials in charge of business
and trade affairs.</P>
      <P>Porter, who was instrumental in helping map out Taiwan's economic
policies during the years when Vice President Lien Chan was then
premier, may be invited to be an adviser to the Executive Yuan,
according to sources from the Cabinet.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bonn,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A planned visit to Taiwan by Macedonian
Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski will be indefinitely postponed as
the prime minister is tied up by aggravating refugee problems at
home, sources from the Macedonian capital of Skopje said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Georgievski was previously scheduled to leave for Taipei on May 1
for an official visit to the Republic of China, which established
formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of Macedonia on Jan. 27
this year.</P>
      <P>However, since early this week, fresh waves of refugees from
Kosovo have continued to flood into Macedonia, which borders the
Yugoslavian province to its north.</P>
      <P>So far, nearly 190,000 Kosovar refugees have fled the country to
Macedonia, causing an increasing crisis upon the former Yugoslavian
state, which is hard pressed to provide accommodation for the
refugees.</P>
      <P>The resultant threat of social instability has prompted the
question of whether the nation should declare a state of emergency.</P>
      <P>Skopje has also made an emergency appeal to members of the
European Union for assistance to help it handle the escalating
refugee problem. Most of the EU countries which have committed to
accept the refugees have been reluctant to take concrete measures to
implement this commitment, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Skopje also called for EU members to offer economic
aid to Macedonia in order to help the Balkan state maintain
stability.</P>
      <P>Since the Yugoslavian crisis erupted in early March, Taipei has
offered Macedonia some US$5 million in cash donations, medical
equipment, food, clothing and other daily necessities to help
alleviate the suffering of the ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo.</P>

      <P>International terrorist Osama bin Laden,
wanted for ordering bombings against US embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last August, is recruiting Muslims in Melbourne to join a
jihad, or holy war, in Kosovo and Chechnya, Australian police
reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>They said Interpol in Australia has been asked to investigate
Hamoud Abaid Al Anezi, who entered Australia last month on a Saudi
Arabian passport. Al Anezi and four other men have been charged over
an aggravated burglary at a home in Melbourne on April 19.</P>
      <P>Al Anezi was carrying a Yemeni passport in another name at the
time of his arrest, while the other four men were Iraqi nationals
granted protective refugee status in Australia.</P>
      <P>Two of the aggravated burglary victims -- Muslims living in
Australia -- told police they were bashed with wooden clubs over
their refusal to be recruited by Al Anezi as terrorists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY BLASTS BEIJING OVER ARMS ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative to the United
States Stephen Chen criticized mainland China on Thursday for its
unceasing vociferous opposition to Taiwan's acquisition of defensive
weapons and related military equipment.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland China itself possesses many offensive weapons,
but it has consistently opposed Taiwan's purchase of any defensive
arms. "This is like somebody who has a sharp sword opposing its foe's
purchase of a shield by claiming that the shield is of an offensive
nature," Chen said, adding that this is most unreasonable logic.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC ambassador to the United States made the remarks
in response to a protest by the mainland Chinese embassy in
Washington, D.C. over the opening of an annual ROC-US meeting on
Taiwan's arms purchase plans.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland China would protest even if the United States
were to sell matches to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about the April 27-28 ROC-US arms sales meeting, Chen said
the two countries have held regular consultations on Taiwan's defense
needs. "However, the two sides are required not to divulge any
details about such discussions, including the participants, venue,
agenda and any specific military item," he explained.</P>
      <P>Touching on a recent Pentagon report to the US Congress on
theater missile defense (TMD) architecture options in the Asia
Pacific region, Chen said the report will help the US legislative
branch, the media and the general public to better understand the
importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the ROC government appreciates the US
executive branch and Congress' sustained security commitment to
Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act, the US law governing relations
with the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>In related news that same day, Chen said at a seminar that he
believes historians will record that China has finally evolved into a
liberal democratic country because of the existence of a free and
democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he is convinced that China will eventually unify
under the principles of freedom, democracy and equitable distribution
of wealth.</P>
      <P>The career diplomat pointed out that per capita national income
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait was only US$50 five decades ago.
"But today, Taiwan's per capita GNP is far higher than mainland
China's. That is mainly because Taiwan has adopted the right economic
development strategy," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to its economic prosperity, Chen said, Taiwan has
also made significant progress in democratic and human rights
reforms.</P>
      <P>He recalled that he often received letters from Americans
criticizing Taiwan's human rights records about 10 years ago when he
was the ROC's deputy representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>"The number of such letters has declined significantly since I
assumed my current post in October 1997," Chen said. "Moreover, most
of these letters no longer address human rights concerns but are
aimed at appealing for better treatment of stray dogs on the island,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC does not oppose engagement between other
countries and mainland China. "We just hope that they do not develop
ties with the mainland at the expense of Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>The seminar was sponsored by the Third World Affairs Association
on Capitol Hill. In addition to Chen, envoys to the United States
from the Philippines, Iceland, Grenada, and many other countries
attended the seminar.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR UNITED PARTY TO WIN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Lin Yi-hsiung on Friday again urged former
DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang to stay in the party so that a united DPP
can fight against a "split ruling Kuomintang" and win the
presidential election in 2000.</P>
      <P>Faced with Hsu's imminent defection, Lin will convene an
emergency meeting on Saturday which will be attended by members of
the DPP Central Committee and faction leaders, as well as county and
mayoral heads affiliated with the DPP, including former Taipei Mayor
Chen Shui-bian, who is widely viewed as the party's most likely
presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Lin said the problem facing the DPP is not the quitting of a
member, nor is it someone's reluctance to make a presidential bid.
Rather it is an issue of whether party members have the sincere
resolve to end the disunity within the party, he stressed.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman also called on the public not to view the
Chen-Hsu issue of recent days as political machinations or
brinkmanship.</P>
      <P>Chen made a plea on Wednesday that efforts to amend the party's
nomination rules to accommodate his candidacy be halted, and pledged
to urge delegates to next month's party congress to nominate Hsu as
the DPP's presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Saturday's emergency meeting will focus on the defusing of Hsu's
defection crisis. However, according to informed sources, Hsu's
leaving is almost certain, which means the DPP must start to think
about how to cope with the resulting impact.</P>
      <P>However, party officials observed that since there are more than
ten months left before the election, the DPP should have enough time
to control the problem.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Chang Chun-hung, who is also the convener of the
party's New Century faction, urged the party to postpone its May 8-9
National Party Congress to allow more time to settle the infighting.</P>
      <P>In response to Chang's proposal, Lin said that the party congress
should not be postponed. As to whether the controversial "four-year
clause" will be amended, Lin said this should be left to the decision
of the party congress.</P>
      <P>According to the "four-year clause" in the party's nomination
rules, members are barred from seeking presidential, legislative or
mayoral candidacies twice within four years, which would effectively
eliminate Chen from the running.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA CHIEF OUTLINES MAJOR DRAWBACKS IN FMD CONTROL OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top agricultural administrator
said on Friday that five major drawbacks exist in the island's
pig epidemic control system.</P>
      <P>Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA) made
the statement after a string of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) cases
were reported at pig farms in major agricultural counties in the past
half a month.</P>
      <P>Peng said at a meeting of livestock disease control officials
around the island that sporadic FMD cases have been reported since
the island was hit by the deadly pig epidemic two years ago.</P>
      <P>"This is mainly because the FMD virus has widely spread
throughout the island," Peng said, adding that Taiwan is unlikely to
resume a non-FMD-stricken area any time soon.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned-administrator said it took France 42 years
to reclaim the International Livestock Disease Conference's
recognition as a non-FMD-stricken area.</P>
      <P>"Germany and the Netherlands also spent several decades and
Argentina even spent 137 years eradicating the FMD virus," Peng
noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Peng said these examples should not be used
as an excuse for lax FMD control operations. "We should redouble
efforts to curb further spread of the pig epidemic," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Peng said he feels regret that many FMD cases have been reported
in recent months. He outlined five major faults in the local FMD
control operations. The drawbacks include slow reports on the
detection of the epidemic; low FMD inoculation rate; pig farmers'
failure to establish an adequate self-defense system to prevent the
disease; a lack of sense of responsibility on the part of pig
farmers as well as their speculative mentality.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by scholars and experts, FMD
vaccination rate must exceed 80 percent if an FMD-stricken area
wants to effectively control the epidemic.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the current inoculation rate falls below 70
percent.</P>
      <P>Peng said the COA will join forces with local-level livestock
disease control authorities to work out measures to encourage
pig farmers to have all of their pigs vaccinated in accordance
with government regulations.</P>
      <P>Peng said the COA will tighten enforcement of disciplinary rules
to punish pig farmers who fail to have their pigs inoculated
according to government regulations.</P>
      <P>"We'll make an all-out effort to raise the vaccination rate to
80 percent in three months," Peng said.</P>
      <P>As the effect of vaccination is not 100 percent, Peng said pig
farmers should establish their own anti-FMD system to protect their
animals from being infected by the deadly virus.</P>
      <P>Peng also demanded local livestock disease control offices to
intensify inspection of pig ranches under their jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lai Hsiu-sui, a National Taiwan
University professor, suggested that the COA offer free vaccines to
help enhance vaccination rate. Lai said free vaccination will cost
the government only NT$500 million to NT$600 million.</P>

(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislators clashed with Military Police (MP)
officers in front of the Presidential Office on Friday.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers had gone to the Presidential Office to ask
President Lee Teng-hui to resolve an alleged assault by Kuomintang
lawmaker Tseng Chen-nung during a Legislative Yuan session last week.</P>
      <P>The session was suspended for a week due to the alleged physical
conflict between Tseng and DPP lawmaker Lai Ching-lin.</P>
      <P>A group of nearly 60 DPP lawmakers marched towards the
Presidential Office on Friday morning carrying banners and chanting
slogans to protest against what they called the ruling KMT's
"indulgence of violence."</P>
      <P>The lawmakers were stopped by the MPs, and a short scuffle
ensued.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Payen Talu tore off the nametag of an MP surnamed
Chou, and later claimed to the press he was hit on the chest during
the struggle.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers' demand to meet the president was ignored, and the
protest fizzled out amid some more slogan-chanting. The lawmakers
said they will return next Tuesday to try to see Lee.</P>
      <P>The group's convener Chang Chun-hsiung said that as Tseng's
alleged violence stemmed from his defense of the Executive Yuan's
budget bill, Lee, as the KMT chairman, should come forward to resolve
the conflict.</P>
      <P>Chang added that as Tseng is also a KMT lawmaker, Lee should
shoulder even more of the responsibility. He also expressed regret
over Payen Talu's altercation with the MPs.</P>
