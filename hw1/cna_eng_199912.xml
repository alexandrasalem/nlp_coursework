    <HEADLINE>ISLANDWIDE RUSH FOR LOTTERY TICKETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first batch of the two-in-one lottery
tickets issued by the Central Bank of China (CBC) went on sale on
Wednesday, causing a buying spree around the island.</P>
      <P>At 7:30 a.m., the Bank of Taiwan and all of its 105 branches on
the island began selling the lottery tickets at wholesale price to
licensed sellers. Later, people swarmed to lottery tickets stands,
railway stations, department stores and cinemas to purchase the
lottery tickets in the hopes of winning prizes.</P>
      <P>The so-called "two-in-one" means that ticket buyers have two
chances at winning prizes with a single ticket. First, they can
immediately scratch their tickets to reveal six sets of numbers. If
three sets of numbers match, the number represents the prize money,
with prizes ranging from between NT$100 and NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>In addition to the first chance, ticket buyers can wait to see if
the seven numbers on their tickets match up with a set of numbers
drawn at a later date. If the numbers all match, they will win a top
prize of NT$500,000, and if only the last of the seven numbers match,
they will win the minimum NT$100.</P>
      <P>Lottery regulations state that people under the age of 18 cannot
purchase tickets or claim prizes, while those authorized to sell the
tickets, most of them from low-income families, aboriginal people or
disabled, must have their licenses displayed in a highly visible
place.</P>
      <P>A total of 17,949 sellers have been licensed. The general public
can also buy lottery tickets at nine financial institutions,
including the Land Bank of Taiwan, the First Commercial Bank, and
Taipei Bank.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said on Tuesday that the lottery will be held every
month, with the first issue comprising 30 million tickets at NT$100
apiece.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN RULES OUT POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATING WITH ANY OTHER HOPEFUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday ruled
out the possibility of cooperating with any other presidential
hopeful.</P>
      <P>"I'm confident in my odds to win the 2000 presidential election,"
Chen said confidently, adding that any speculation concerning the
possibility of his cooperation with any other contestant is just a
campaign gimmick of rival camps.</P>
      <P>The outspoken lawyer-turned-politician stressed that he is
unlikely to take any post in the Kuomintang administration if
Taiwan's current ruling party manages to retain its grip on power.</P>
      <P>"Nor is it likely that I cooperate with independent presidential
candidate James Soong," said Chen, who often trailed behind Soong
but ahead of KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan in the support
rating in numerous public opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Chen made the above remarks while meeting with a group of
international media correspondents stationed in Hong Kong and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to allay fears in some quarters that Chen
might declare de jure Taiwan independence following his election, the
ex-Taipei mayor told the visiting journalists that if elected, he
will not do anything that might shock or panic anybody.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen reiterated that any attempt or proposal to
change the status quo that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are two
separate independent states must be determined by the 22 million
people of Taiwan through a plebiscite, and cannot be determined by
any single political party or individual.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, if I'm elected, I will not make any unilateral
announcement that might ire or panic anybody," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that the people of Taiwan cannot accept
the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems" unification scheme.
Quoting the results of a recent survey by the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, Chen said less than 10 percent of those interviewed
support the formula, while the majority of 80 percent oppose such a
proposal.</P>
      <P>Chen said confidently that he believes that the disputes between
the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party will come to an end if he
manages to win the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP is very likely to replace the KMT as the
ruling party following the election, Chen said that under his
leadership, the DPP will prove itself to be a "strong defender of
Asia-Pacific security and peace, not a troublemaker as some people
have alleged."</P>
      <P>Touching on relations with mainland China, Chen said parity is
the most important prerequisite for cross-strait dialogue and
negotiations.</P>
      <P>"To show goodwill, sincerity and accountability, if I manage to
win the presidency, I would like to visit the mainland before my
inauguration to lay a foundation for normalization of cross-strait
relations," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that he has advocated a new
"middle-of-the-road" policy to resolve cross-strait confrontation and
hostility, adding that he believes normalization of cross-strait ties
can start from normalizing bilateral trade and economic relations.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that a foreign reporter told him during a recent
interview that Beijing thinks it may be easier to communicate with
Chen than with the KMT's presidential candidate, Vice President Lien
Chan.</P>
      <P>"It interests me why Beijing has such a feeling," Chen said,
adding that he is willing to do his utmost to maintain peace in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the DPP has its roots in Taiwan, Chen said the
party does not have any historical grudge against the Chinese
Communist Party. "It was the KMT that once had a civil war with the
communist party."</P>
      <P>Chen said the DPP will forge relations with Beijing with an "open
mind," adding that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should engage
in "peaceful competition," not in "military confrontation."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has identified Russia as one of
the world's Y2K black spots and is reducing its consular presence in
Moscow as a temporary measure at the end of this month, according to
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>
      <P>A DFAT spokesman told reporters the department has authorized the
departure of non-essential consular staff and their dependents from
Moscow by December 28 due to fears of widespread disruption caused by
computer problems when January 2000 arrives in Russia.</P>
      <P>The department has also advised Australians to delay
non-essential travel to Russia and warned those living there to
carefully reconsider any travel plans due to limited seats as fewer
commercial aircraft are likely to be operating as a result of Y2K
problems.</P>
      <P>Other countries expected to have a higher rate of computer
problems related to Y2K are Poland, the Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government has urged its
nation's companies to follow steps taken by their US, European, and
Japanese counterparts and take advantage of the unprecedented
opportunities for expansion in Asia.</P>
      <P>The call came in a 350-page book launched in Sydney on Tuesday by
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who said Australian institutions
should take advantage and expand their operations in banking, capital
markets, funds management and life insurance in Asia.</P>
      <P>He said Australian financial institutions had shown a "laudable
sense of caution" in their approach to expansion in Asia but they had
been less active than institutions from the US, Europe and Japan.</P>
      <P>Only three Australian banks haven taken the chance of expanding
their operations in Asia and others should follow suit, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pfizer, manufacturer of Viagra, is suing
the Australian government for its refusal to subsidize the cost of
its drug, used by males to combat impotency.</P>
      <P>The government has decided not to reimburse Viagra buyers in the
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBAC) because it regards Viagra not
as a medicine, but as a stimulant.</P>
      <P>"Pfizer regrets that it has had to take this action, but
unfortunately this is the only avenue of appeal available to
pharmaceutical companies who feel that due process has not been
followed by the PBAC," the company said in a statement released to
the media here on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pfizer is the first pharmaceutical company to challenge the
government's decision in court and its challenge will be heard in the
Federal Court in Sydney on December 8.</P>
      <P>Viagra is available by private prescription in Australia at a
cost of about A$70 (nearly US$47) for a four-tablet pack.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SET TO REAP NEAR-RECORD WHEAT HARVEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's wheat harvest in 1999-2000 is
expected to reach a near-record high of between 20 and 22.8 million
tones, and the optimism for its exports, including those to Taiwan,
remain high, according to the Australian Wheat Board.</P>
      <P>The previous record was set in 1996-97 when Australia's wheat
harvest hit about 23 million tones, of which more than 15 million
tones were exported to Taiwan and other countries, according to a
board spokesperson.</P>
      <P>Last year, Australia's wheat exports totaled 16 million tones of
which 42,000 tones were sold to Taiwan, down from 60,000 tones sold
in the previous year. The spokesperson said sales to Taiwan will
continue to fluctuate.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a potentially lucrative market for Australian wheat.
But it will take time to promote the market because Taiwanese
importers are still not fully aware of the advantages of Australia's
quality wheat. They are accustomed to buying wheat from the US," she
said.</P>
      <P>Trade Minister Mark Vaile is now in Seattle fighting for the
removal of government subsidies on agricultural exports. The US and
the European Union, at present, heavily subsidize their farm exports.</P>
      <P>"If we can remove government subsidies, then our wheat exporters
will be in a better position to compete with their US and European
rivals," the spokeswoman said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIVE ROC MOVIES CHOSEN AMONG `THE BEST OF THE 90S'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Nov.  30 (CNA)
(By  Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five Republic of China movies were chosen
as among the best movies made during the 1990's by a prestigious film
group in Toronto on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cinematheque Ontario, the Toronto International Film Festival
Group's year-round screening program, conducted an exhaustive poll of
almost 60 programmers at such well known organizations as New York's
Museum of Modern Art and the National Film Center in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The poll gave rise to a series of "the most acclaimed and
neglected films" of the past decade, including works by venerable
masters such as Jean-Luc Godard and Victor Erice.</P>
      <P>Among the top 25 vote receivers were five films made in Taiwan.
These included Hou Hsiao-hsien's "Flower of Shanghai," Edward Yang's
"A Brighter Summer Day," Tsai Ming-Liang's "Vive L'Amour," and Hou's,
"The Puppet- Master" and "Good-bye South Good-bye."</P>
      <P>France ranked first in terms of the country with the most movies
in the "Top 25" list with nine, followed by the United States with
eight. Taiwan and Iran shared third place with five each. Fourth
place went to Japan with four films.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Yang and Tsai, along with Hong Kong's Wong Kar-wai
("Chungking Express"), Denmark's Lars von Trier and Iranian Mohsen
Makhmalbaf were lauded as directors who "broke into the international
scene in the 1990s."</P>
      <P>Spanish director Victor Erice won the top honor (garnering 57
votes) for his "Dream of Light" (El Sol Del Membrillo). Another
surprise was Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian director who finished far
ahead of any other in the voting with an astonishing four films in
the top six. The scores show he is "the most influential and revered
filmmaker of the decade," according to Cinematheque Ontario.</P>
      <P>Poll participants include representatives from some of the
world's most important film institutions, such as the National Film
Theatre in London, American Cinematheque in Los Angeles, Cineteca
Nazionale in Rome, The Royal Film Archive in Brussels, and the Cannes
Film Festival.</P>
      <P>"Cinema Scope," an internationally distributed magazine published
in Toronto, is publishing a special issue focusing on the poll and
featuring more than 100 contributors including Kent Jones ("Film
Comment"), Robin Wood, Berenice Reynaud ("Cahiers du Cinema") and
many of Toronto's most influential critics</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DOESN'T ACCEPT COA CHAIRMAN'S RESIGNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew didn't accept the
resignation filed by Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Peng
Tso-kwei, returning his written resignation late Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Chao Yi quoted Premier Siew as saying on
Wednesday that the Executive Yuan has always supported the COA's
stance on the country's farmland policy and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Peng formally submitted his resignation to the Executive Yuan on
Tuesday after several Kuomintang legislators submitted a draft
amendment to the agricultural development plans to allow residences
and other structures to be constructed on newly-acquired farmlands.</P>
      <P>In his three-page resignation letter, Peng said he decided to
quit the office because he could not condone what he considers to be
a wrong policy shift.</P>
      <P>To back up Peng, Chao said the Executive Yuan will accelerate
lobbying at the Legislative Yuan so as to discourage lawmakers from
adopting an amendment to the agricultural development draft. Instead,
the government will help push for the passage of another Executive
Yuan-revised version of the agricultural development draft, he added.</P>
      <P>Peng, as Taiwan's top official in charge of agricultural
policies, remained firm on the Executive Yuan-version of the new
agricultural development draft which insists that no residential or
commercial-purpose structures should be built on newly-acquired
farmlands so as to maintain a balanced ecological environment and
prevent farm yields in rural areas from being polluted.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment proposed by Kuomintang legislators was viewed
by some political observers as a scheme to win electoral ballots as
the presidential election scheduled for March, 2000 approaches.</P>
      <P>Peng said in the letter that as a cabinet minister, it is his
responsibility to put forward policies aimed at improving people's
lives rather than at "soliciting ballots."</P>
      <P>Commenting on Peng's resignation, Hung Yu-chin,
executive-director of the Kuomintang's Policy Coordination Committee,
said Peng does not need to deal with the problem by resigning his
post.</P>
      <P>Hung said while the Legislature has made moves aimed at
reflecting the opinions of farmers as well as of the general public,
the Executive Yuan has the right and the responsibility to insist on
its stance on issues. The most important thing is to coordinate
and to exchange views when differences arise, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuomintang spokesman Huang Huei-chen denied that the
proposal made by some Kuomintang legislators on the draft amendment
was a "turnabout in policy" by the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Huang said what makes democracy so precious and worthy is that it
allows for and tolerates differences. Besides, he said, the amendment
has not passed yet and there is still room for debate at the
Legislative Yuan before it becomes law.</P>
      <P>Huang declined to confirm whether ROC President and Kuomintang
Chairman Lee Teng-hui was behind the draft amendment proposal. He
only said that Lee, an agronomist-turned-president, has spared no
effort in taking care of farmers' interests while trying to maintain
balanced economic development in society.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTMENT DECLINING IN MAINLAND CHINESE PORT CITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis which broke out
two years ago in Southeast Asia has caused many Taiwan firms to scale
down their investments in the city of Xiamen in mainland China's
Fujian Province, according to a Hong Kong-based newspaper.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, a number of Taiwan businesses have
decreased or withdrawn their investments in Xiamen by an annual rate
of more than 20 percent as a result of sluggish operations, the
Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported.</P>
      <P>Quoting Fujian provincial government officials, the newspaper
said higher production costs in Xiamen have also led to a withdrawal
of Taiwan capital from the southern mainland Chinese coastal city. It
said Xiamen's rising labor costs and factory acquisition costs have
made it difficult for Taiwan companies, mostly labor-intensive
businesses, to maintain their operations.</P>
      <P>Under the current circumstances, the Fujian provincial government
has worked out a series of measures in an effort to persuade these
outgoing Taiwan businesses to relocate in the eastern and northern
parts of the province, the newspaper reported.</P>
      <P>However, a Fujian economist said he was taken by surprise to find
during an inspection tour to the southern part of Jiangsu Province
that many Taiwan businesses have already shifted from Fujian to
Jiangsu's Kunshan City, according to the newspaper. Taiwan investors
in Kunshan were quoted as saying that the investment climate in
Jiangsu is much better than in Fujian.</P>
      <P>Because of Taiwan's historical links and geographic proximity
with Fujian, Xiamen has long been one of the favorite investment
targets among Taiwan enterprises over the past decade or more, and
Fujian authorities have set up four investment zones, three of which
are in Xiamen, especially for Taiwan businessmen, a move expressly
designed to court greater investment from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently, one-third of the foreign investment projects in Xiamen
are funded through investment by Taiwan enterprises.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT SCIENTISTS JOINTLY DISCOVER IMPORTANT NEW FOSSIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>a group of scientists from both sides of
the Taiwan Strait have discovered the first craniate chordates with a
clear head and a large brain which might be the original ancestors of
all vertebrates on earth.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held in Taipei on Wednesday, Prof. Li
Chia-wei of the Hsinchu-based National Tsinghua University in
northern Taiwan announced the discovery of the some 300 specimens of
530 million-year-old fish-like fossils which may rewrite the history
of the origin and evolution of vertebrates, including humans.</P>
      <P>The discovery of the fossils will provide scientists with a clear
picture of the distant ancestors of all vertebrates, said Li, who
made the discovery with his mainland Chinese coworker, Chen Junyuan
of the Nanjing Institute of Paleontology and Geology, Chinese Academy
of Science, and his assistant, Huang Diying.</P>
      <P>Announcing their discovery to the world simultaneously in Taipei
and Nanjing, Li and Chen named the fossil Haikouella, because the
specimens were collected from a hill in Haikou, in southern mainland
Chinese province of Yunnan.</P>
      <P>The fossils are all under 4 cm in length, but the excellent
preservation, including admirable minute details, are deeply
inspiring, said Li. "With these genuine materials, we are able to
trace, in exquisite detail and for the first time, vertebrates back
to their ancestors without backbones," he said.</P>
      <P>The prestigious British journal Nature will carry Li and Chen's
discovery in a five-page report in its Nov. 4 issue, labeling it as
an "exciting, major scientific discovery."</P>
      <P>In the article, Li and Chen point out that due to a dearth of
fossil evidence, human knowledge in the past had mistakenly assumed
that the cephalization and full endoskeletonization of the
vertebrates was an event accomplished at one swoop.</P>
      <P>"Now Haikouella shows us that there is a prolonging history of
cephalization before the origin of backbones. The animals in the
pre-backbone history that have a clear cranium but no clear
indication of endoskeletons or backbone as "vertebrates" clearly
transgress the manifest taxonomic principle of naming the organisms
"vertebrates" based on the existence of a backbone," they say.</P>
      <P>The discovery will also be carried in the latest issue of the US
periodical Science, according to Li.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Li and Chen jointly discovered and announced the
oldest-known fossils of complex animal life forms on earth, known as
"pre-Cambrian sponges with cellular structure," in Guizhou, southern
mainland China.</P>
      <P>That finding moved back the date of the earliest appearance of
complex and varied forms of life on earth by 40 million to 50 million
years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC WANTS INTERVIEW MECHANISM FOR WOULD-BE MAINLAND CHINESE SPOUSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) is
seeking to establish an interview mechanism to screen the entry to
Taiwan of mainland Chinese spouses of local residents, MAC sources
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Through the interview, a system which has been used for years by
advanced Western countries to screen new immigrants and visitors, the
government should be able to more effectively curb the surge of bogus
marriages used as pretexts for people coming to Taiwan to work as
prostitutes or take on other kinds of work, said Johnnason Liu,
director of the MAC's Department of Legal Affairs.</P>
      <P>However, such interviews would have to be conducted outside
Taiwan, ideally in mainland China, but there are currently no
suitable locations for the interviews, said Liu.</P>
      <P>He added that the MAC will consult with relevant agencies from
the ministries of the interior and justice to try and establish the
content of the interviews and appropriate venue where they could take
place.</P>
      <P>To meet an increasing demand, the MAC has expanded the annual
quota for mainland spouses allowed to enter Taiwan to 3,600 beginning
this year.</P>
      <P>Currently, mainland spouses can obtain visas for three months at
a time, extendible for a further three months. After that, they must
leave the island and return to the mainland before reapplying to
enter for another three months.</P>
      <P>The MAC is also mulling whether to extend the visa to six months,
extendible by six months, according to Liu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD NOT IN FAVOR OF UNCONDITIONAL CROSS-STRAIT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman (MAC) Su
Chi said on Wednesday that the more Taiwan's politicians advocate
"unconditional cross-strait links," the more reluctant mainland China
will be to negotiate on the issue.</P>
      <P>At a gathering of legislators, Su was asked to comment on the
"unconditional three-cross-strait links" and the "one-way
cross-strait transportation link" advocated recently by presidential
hopefuls Hsu Hsin-liang and Chen Shui-bian, respectively.</P>
      <P>Hsu, an independent candidate, and Chen, who is carrying the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) standard in the presidential race
scheduled for next March 18, have made the three direct links --
trade, transport and postal -- the pillar of their mainland China
policies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan refuses to accept the mainland's terms for the three links
between Taiwan and the mainland because it is afraid of compromising
its national security.</P>
      <P>Su said that Chen's proposal for "a one-way direct
Taiwan-mainland transportation link" does not take national dignity
into account, an issue which needs to be solved through negotiation,
although it does safeguard the security of the nation.</P>
      <P>On whether the top cross-strait negotiators of both sides --
Taiwan's Koo Chen-fu and the mainland's Wang Daohan -- will meet at a
ceremony to mark the handover of Macau to mainland Chinese rule on
Dec. 20 in the Portuguese enclave, Su said that Taiwan has so far
received no invitation to the event.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan would welcome a meeting between the two at any
time and on any occasion, he added however that "it would be better
for them to meet in Taipei rather than in Macau."</P>
      <P>Beijing has postponed a scheduled 1999 visit to Taiwan by Wang,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait in
protest against Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-strait relations as a "special state-to-state
relationship."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the recent offer of Koo, chairman of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation, to make another visit to the mainland to
invite Wang again, Su said that Taiwan has fully demonstrated its
goodwill on the issue, and that it will not make any "unnecessary"
move without a positive response from the mainland side.</P>
      <P>Koo last met with Wang in October last year during an
ice-breaking trip to the mainland, where he invited Wang to make a
reciprocal visit to Taiwan, which Wang accepted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative to South Africa Du
Ling on Tuesday donated 500 wheelchairs to South African handicapped
people on behalf of the Republic of China government and people.</P>
      <P>The ceremony, witnessed by nearly a hundred South African
disabled citizens and social welfare workers, took place at the Nan
Hua Temple some 50 kilometers east of Pretoria. Essop Pahad, head of
the South African Presidential Office, received the donation from Du
on behalf of his government and people.</P>
      <P>The 500 wheelchairs were jointly contributed by the Taipei
Representative Office in the Republic of South Africa and the
Taiwan-based International Fukuangshan Buddhist Foundation.</P>
      <P>Du said the donation was in response to South African President
Thabo Mbeki's appeal to help handicapped people, and also serves as a
demonstration of fraternity between the ROC and South Africa.</P>
      <P>Master Huilee of the Nan Hua Temple said the people of Taiwan
have so far donated more than 4,000 wheelchairs to various African
countries, and will continue to extend their charity in the future
despite the fact that Taiwan suffered tremendous loss and damage as a
result of the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Expressing his appreciation for the donation, Pahad explained
that the major purpose of the South African government's policy on
assisting disabled people is to help them upgrade their quality of

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF HIV CARRIERS ESTIMATED AT 10,000 IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
issued a sobering set of new statistics on HIV carriers in Taiwan on
Wednesday, World AIDS Day.</P>
      <P>DOH tallies show that 125 people tested HIV positive in the past
three months alone. Among these newly found HIV carriers were three
couples and an 18-month-old baby.</P>
      <P>Tu Hsing-tze, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable
Disease Control, said that a decade ago, HIV was transmitted mostly
among homosexual men. "This shifted to drug users, and now
heterosexual transmission is the most common," he warned.</P>
      <P>Tu further said anti-AIDS campaigns should focus on young people,
particularly those in the 15-25 age group, since they are the most
vulnerable.</P>
      <P>According to DOH statistics, a total of 2,375 Republic of China
nationals have so far been confirmed as HIV carriers, 841 of whom
have developed AIDS.</P>
      <P>Tu said as one-third of local HIV carriers did not learn of their
infection until after they had developed full-blown AIDS, the number
of actual HIV carriers is believed to be four to five times the
number of confirmed carriers.</P>
      <P>Based on this estimate, Tu said the actual number of local HIV
carriers should be somewhere in the region of 10,000 people.</P>
      <P>"More worrisome is that heterosexual transmission has been
increasing rapidly in Taiwan in recent years," Tu said, adding that
the number of married couples infected with the virus has increased
to 87.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Tu said, five young children have also tested HIV
positive.</P>
      <P>According to DOH data, the mother of the fifth HIV baby is a
foreign bride. "After more than a year of tracking and examination,
the baby is confirmed as having been infected with HIV from his
mother," Tu said, adding that six other young children are still
being closely monitored to determine whether they have been infected
with the killer virus.</P>
      <P>Tu further said health authorities should intensify HIV testing
on foreign spouses with a view to preventing the further spread of
the disease.</P>

(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Research in Singapore into a new
triple-drug therapy for Aids patients is going well and could slash
their medical costs drastically, The Straits Times newspaper reported
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Further tests of drugs to combat HIV, the cause of Aids, are due
to start next week.</P>
      <P>The new therapy, initiated by doctors from the Communicable
Disease Center (CDC) in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, combines a drug for
cancer and another for arthritis with an HIV drug.</P>
      <P>If it works, the new therapy would cut a patient's monthly
medication costs to about S$300 (US$178) from the current monthly
average of more than S$1,200.</P>
      <P>Dr. Nick Paton, who heads the CDC's department of infectious
diseases, said he hopes the studies will yield results by the middle
of next year.</P>
      <P>Dr. Leo Yee Sin, head of HIV Medicine at the CDC, said tests had
been conducted for a month on several patients, but it was too short
a time to determine how effective the drugs were.</P>
      <P>Only about one-sixth of Singapore's HIV-infected patients can
afford current drug cocktail therapy, which is not subsidized by the
government as the drugs used are "non-standard."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RATED WORLD'S 11TH FREEST ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Nov.  30  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was rated the world's 11th
freest economy in an analysis of 161 economies around the world
released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, compiled by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall
Street Journal, ranked Hong Kong as the world's freest economy. The
territory has remained on the top spot since the foundation began
the annual survey in 1995.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 1999 ranking was four slots lower than its 1998 rating
mainly because of increased government intervention in the
economy, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The annual study ranks the freedom of national economies on
the basis of several factors: trade, tax, government intervention in
the economy, banking and monetary policy, capital flows and foreign
investment; wages and prices, property rights, regulations and black
market activity.</P>
      <P>The rating uses a 1-to-5-point scaling system. One point
represents the freest and five points the least free.</P>
      <P>Taiwan got a score of two points in the 1999 rating, a bit worse
than its 1998 rating of 1.9 points.</P>
      <P>In all the four previous similar surveys, Taiwan ranked in
the "fully free" category. But in the 1999 rating, it dropped to
the "mostly free" category for the first time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 8th in the 1995 survey, seventh in 1996 study and
16th in the 1997 report.</P>
      <P>Among the 10 factors gauged, Taiwan received the highest marks
in three factors -- banking and monetary policy, property rights,
and regulation and black market activity.</P>
      <P>In the 1999 survey, Singapore and New Zealand were ranked as the
world's second and third freest economies.</P>

Changhua, Kaohsiung, Tainan and Pingtung counties, in that order.</P>
      <P>The results also show that the financial situation of Pingtung
County in southern Taiwan is the worst among the 21 counties and
cities of the Taiwan area. The other four counties and cities on the
top five worst financial situation list are Taichung City, Kaohsiung
County, Changhua County and Tainan County.</P>
      <P>The definition of the extent of political corruption was
described as the number of serious criminal cases in which local
parliamentarians are involved, the number of such cases which

      <P>The definition of the financial situation depended on the
financial institutions' overdue outstanding loans, and the number of
bad debts in the various counties, he added.</P>

1, a senior Republic of China official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister Lin Fong-cheng
confirmed that he has received an official letter from the Philippine
authorities affirming the 1996 air Taipei-Mania agreement that was
unilaterally suspended by the Philippines side.</P>
      <P>"Taipei-Manila flights can be resumed any time, as soon as we
give the nod," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Philippines scrapped the Taipei-Manila air pact after Taiwan
refused to accept its request for a slash in the number of passengers
that Taiwan airlines could carry between the two sides from 9,600 per
week as agreed upon in the 1996 pact, to 3,600.</P>
      <P>The Philippine government made the move in a bid to save its
debt-ridden national flag carrier, Philippine Airlines, from
continuing crippling losses.</P>
      <P>Lin said that under the terms of the 1996 pact, the maximum
number of seats offered to the two Taiwan airlines which formerly
plied the route -- China Airlines and EVA Airways -- will be
maintained at 9,600 weekly, and that one-year prior notice must be
given if either side wants to suspend the pact.</P>
      <P>The letter was transferred to Taipei through Taiwan's
representative office in Manila. It is believed that Manila was
forced to make the concession under strong pressure from the
100,000-strong contingent of Philippine laborers working in Taiwan,
many of whom want to return home to spend Christmas with their
families.</P>
      <P>Since the suspension of direct Taipei-Manila flights, Filipino
workers in Taiwan have had to travel via Hong Kong while traveling
between the island and their home country, greatly increasing their
expenditure and travel time.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's export processing zones (EPZs) have
created US$36 billion in surplus since their establishment in 1966,
Director Pan Ting-pai of the EPZ Administration said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Pan said that the exports and imports through the EPZs totaled

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS RIGHT TO EXPAND INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Foreign Minister
David Lee said recently that Taiwan has every right to expand its
activities in the international community.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Austrian Broadcasting Company
(ABC), Lee admitted that Taiwan has difficulty forging diplomatic
ties with foreign countries under Beijing's efforts to isolate Taiwan
from the rest of the international community.</P>
      <P>"If Beijing wants to win respect from Taiwan, it must give Taiwan
room to play in the international community," Lee said.</P>
      <P>An ABC reporter visited Taipei in early November at the
invitation of the Government Information Office (GIO), during which
he interviewed government officials, officials of the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and scholars, on the cross-Taiwan
Strait issue.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that Taiwan, with its population of 22 million
people, ranks as the world's 19th-largest economic power and the
world's 14th-largest trading nation. However, because of Beijing's
pressure, the country maintains diplomatic relations with just 29
countries.</P>
      <P>Asked how the escalating diplomatic tug of war between Taiwan and
mainland China in Central and South America, Africa and Oceania can
be resolved, Lee said that Beijing would be better off letting Taiwan
have some international space than spending huge sums of money to
engage in the diplomatic battle.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said that Taiwan renounced the use of force to
recover mainland China in 1991, but pointed out that the mainland
authorities have yet to reciprocate by renouncing the use of force to
take Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that this intransigence has invited criticism and anger
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang Ping-nan, deputy director-general of the GIO, claimed that
over 80 percent of the people of Taiwan back the government's current
mainland China affairs policy, while more than 70 percent are opposed
to Beijing's "one country, two systems" reunification proposal.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, director of the Mainland China Affairs Department
of the opposition DPP, said that Taiwan is a completely independent
and sovereign country. From the DPP's point of view, he went on,
Taiwan should strengthen economic, trade and cultural interchanges
with mainland China on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-ming, a professor of sociology at National Taiwan
University, said that the education system today emphasizes the
awakening of the "Taiwanese consciousness," in contrast with the past
emphasis on "Chinese consciousness."</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said on Wednesday that Taiwan is willing to share its development
experience with Malawi to enable the people of the two nations to
enjoy the fruits of prosperity and progress.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks before a state-banquet he gave in honor of
visiting Malawi President Dr. Bakili Muluzi at the Presidential
Building.</P>
      <P>Lee said that since assuming office in 1994, Muluzi has
vigorously pushed ahead with various political and economic reforms
to eradicate poverty, maintain social order and upgrade his people's
standard of living.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Muluzi again led his party to overwhelming
victory in Malawi's presidential election in June and a parliamentary
election in October, showing that he has won the trust and respect of
the Malawi people.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that relations between the ROC and Malawi have
been very close since they established diplomatic ties in 1966.</P>
      <P>The cordial relations were further evidenced by the opening of
the Malawi embassy in Taipei earlier in the day and the appointment
of the African country's first ambassador to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Muluzi, for his part, thanked Lee for the assistance that Taiwan
has offered his country in the fields of agriculture, medical
services and transportation over the years.</P>
      <P>He also extended his sympathy to the families of the victims of
the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Muluzi reaffirmed that his country will always stand behind
Taiwan in its bid to join the United Nations and other international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Muluzi arrived in Taipei on Tuesday for a five-day state visit,

    <HEADLINE>CPC SET TO HIKE OIL PRICE NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
is poised to announce another oil price hike next week, by an average
of 3 percent, CPC sources reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said the price hike, probably to come on Dec. 7, is
inevitable due to price surges in the international crude oil market
and a pre-tax profit for November that is lower than the government
projection.</P>
      <P>The cost to the CPC for imported crude oil reached US$22.21 per
barrel in November, a 35-month high, and US$0.42 per barrel higher
than the average in October, according to CPC officials.</P>
      <P>The last time the CPC raised its prices was on Nov. 10, hiking
them 2.91 percent over the previous levels. The CPC has raised its
prices by a total of 17.27 percent so far this year up to Nov. 30.</P>
      <P>CPC originally planned to announce two separate oil price hikes
in October and November, with a combined price increase to the tune
of 6 percent. The plan was dropped after a devastating earthquake
wreaked havoc in central Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>More than a month of post-quake price stability has made oil
price hikes possible in November, they noted.</P>
      <P>The officials forecast that international crude prices may
increase further in the months to come as there is no sign that
oil-producing countries are attempting to raise output, and potential
supply shortages may keep prices sizzling.</P>
      <P>As of Dec. 1, the price of West Texas Intermediate surged to
US$25 per barrel and there is no sign that the price will ease any
time soon, they pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA HEAD'S RESIGNATION MAY UNDERMINE KMT ELECTION HOPES IN HSINCHU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu  County,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The resignation of Taiwan's top
agricultural official may undermine the Kuomintang's prospects of
winning ballots in the northern county of Hsinchu in the presidential
election next spring, local political sources said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA), submitted his resignation to Premier Vincent Siew
Tuesday in a move showing his disapproval at the ruling Kuomintang's
shift in farmland policy.</P>
      <P>Peng decided to resign after Kuomintang legislators submitted a
draft amendment to the agricultural development statutes that allows
residences and other structures to be constructed on newly-acquired
farmlands, a move which he considered a decision by KMT higher-ups.</P>
      <P>A professor at National Chungshing University's College of
Agriculture, Peng was recruited into the Cabinet by the then Vice
President and Premier Lien Chan in early 1997. Since then, Peng has
played a major role in winning votes for the Kuomintang in several
major elections, particularly in his hometown of Hsinchu, which is
home to many Hakka people.</P>
      <P>Some folks back in Hsinchu support Peng's resignation, describing
the action as a reflection of the Hakka people's "hard neck" spirit.</P>
      <P>However, some people disapprove of Peng's action, saying that his
resignation will adversely affect the Kuomintang's operations in
Hsinchu at a crucial time in the lead-up to the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew didn't accept Peng's resignation
and will meet with him shortly for close-door talks in an attempt to
convince him to stay on at his post, Siew said.</P>
      <P>It was learned that Peng moved out of his Taipei office on
Tuesday and is now staying at his previous residence in Taichung near
National Chungshing University.</P>
      <P>Peng has been avoiding the media, only saying through his aides
that the chances of him returning to office are slim unless the
Legislature opts for the Executive Yuan's version of the new
agricultural development draft which insists that no residential or
commercial-purpose structures be built on newly-acquired farmlands.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia can still learn about
technological management from Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea in
order to help its exporters compete in the world market, a leading
Australian expert says.</P>
      <P>In his article titled "Innovative Asia Leads Way" and published
by the Australian Financial Review on Thursday, Associate Professor
John A. Matthews of the Macquaire Graduate School of Management, says
Australia can learn some valuable lessons from its East Asian
neighbors.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, industry is kept under constant pressure to maintain
its innovative activity -- to keep renewing itself technologically.
This does not involve firms being required to generate 'new
knowledge' but aims to ensure that they have access to the latest and
most important technological breakthroughs, and that they actually
implement them in their products and processes," he says.</P>
      <P>"The key to relentless technological upgrading, which keeps firms
innovative and competitive, in Taiwan and elsewhere in East Asia, is
not just a focus on the technicalities of knowledge generation, but
on the creation and operation of institutional machinery for managing
the process of diffusion of new techniques throughout the economy,"
writes Matthews .</P>
      <P>"The rapid rise of countries such as Korea, Taiwan and Singapore
as technological powers demonstrate that painstaking attention to the
institutions of diffusion is every bit as difficult, and important,
as attention paid to traditional knowledge generation," he says.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has
reiterated that Indonesia, mainland China, the United States and
Japan are the cornerstones of Australia's foreign policy.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA on Thursday, Downer said
Indonesia, China, Japan and the United States "are the four most
important relationships for Australia."</P>
      <P>When Downer released the White Paper in 1996, he set the
relationships with these four countries as the most important for
Australia. Commenting on present policy, he said that "we have not
changed that assessment at all."</P>
      <P>Downer mentioned that Australia has no plans to downgrade its
ties with Indonesia as a result of the friction caused by Australia's
leading role in the UN operation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>On the topic of mainland China policy , Downer reiterated that
Australia does not have a special relationship with that country,
saying that "using the rubric of special relationships simply sets up
false expectations."</P>
      <P>Last week, Downer told a business gathering in Sydney that
Australia has mature and broad relations with China. But at the same
time, Australia will vigorously continue its commercial ties with
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2000 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION A HISTORIC CHANCE FOR DPP: DPP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's 2000 presidential election is a
historic chance for the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), party chairman Lin Yi-hsiung said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in a speech to more than 100 people at the
American Enterprise Institute, a think tank, on the DPP's policy
toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said it is "highly possible" that the presidential candidate
of the ruling Kuomintang will lose the election, and added that the
DPP can play a responsible and constructive role in Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Lin reiterated the DPP's point of view that based on the
consideration of air security over Taiwan, the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can start a "one-way direct air link" from Taiwan and
let both sides share the profits resulting from this link, or even
allow mainland China to solely enjoy the profits.</P>
      <P>However, he went on to say that while the DPP has been making an
effort to express goodwill toward mainland China, Beijing has not
formally responded.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP stresses the importance of an all-out
cross-strait dialogue, adding that prior to finding a solution to the
disputes that both sides can accept, Taipei and Beijing should
establish a normal communication channel and confidence-building
mechanism in order to lower the possibility of the occurrence of
misjudgment and conflict.</P>
      <P>Lin declined to directly talk about the DPP's expectations of the
US role in the cross-strait issue, but indicated that if Beijing
intends to forcibly unify Taiwan, it will cause great instability and
even conflict and war in the Asia-Pacific region. And once war breaks
out, the United States, based on its position of maintaining human
rights, democracy, freedom and peace, will make the "best decision"
to cope with it, he added.</P>
      <P>With regard to Taiwan's status in the international arena, Lin
noted that the DPP sees Taiwan as an independent sovereign country
and it is up to the people of Taiwan to decide on the future
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>During his visit in the United States, Lin also visited the
Brookings Institute and the Nixon Center, two other think tanks. At
the Nixon Center, he met with various experts on China and
cross-strait affairs, and also exchanged views with officials of the
US State Department, Defense Department and Congress on issues of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>He wound up his three-day visit to the United States and left for
the Canadian capital of Ottawa on Wednesday evening to continue his
first US-Canada tour since he took the post of chairman of the DPP
more than a year ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOSSIL OF POSSIBLE ANCESTOR OF ALL VERTEBRATES ON DISPLAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central  Taiwan,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recently discovered
fossils of the first craniate chordates with a clear head and a large
brain which might be the original ancestors of all vertebrates on
earth went on display in Taichung City on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The display at the National Museum of Natural Science in downtown
Taichung coincides with a prominent report in the prestigious British
journal Nature in its Nov. 4 issue, said Prof. Li Chia-wei of the
Hsinchu-based National Tsinghua University.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Li had announced in Taipei the discovery of the
305 specimens of 530 million-year-old fish-like fossils which may
rewrite the history of the origin and evolution of vertebrates,
including humans.</P>
      <P>Li jointly made the discovery recently with his mainland Chinese
coworker, Chen Junyuan of the Nanjing Institute of Paleontology and
Geology, Chinese Academy of Science, and Chen's assistant, Huang
Diying.</P>
      <P>The discovery of the fossils will provide scientists with a clear
picture of the distant ancestors of all vertebrates, Li said at a
press conference which coincided with the opening of the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Li said the discovery proves that some 530 million years ago, on
a beach which today is in the central part of the southern mainland
Chinese province of Yunnan, there lived a wide variety of numerous
"sophisticated-structured" animals, some covered with shells, some
with naked tender bodies, leading widely diversified lives.</P>
      <P>However, these animals without backbones died suddenly en masse
over a very short period of time, which world paleontologists have
labeled the Cambrian explosion. The cause of the big explosion
remains unanswered, Li said.</P>
      <P>Announcing their discovery to the world simultaneously in Taipei
and Nanjing, Li and Chen named the fossil Haikouella, because the
specimens were collected from a hill in Haikou, Yunnan Province.</P>
      <P>The fossils are all under 4 cm in length but excellently
preserved in clear and minute detail, allowing Li and his research
team to trace, in exquisite detail and for the first time,
vertebrates back to their ancestors without backbones, Li added.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will run until April 9, 2000, will allow
Taiwan residents the opportunity to view for themselves one of the
most likely possibilities of how the earth's vertebrates, including
humans, evolved from low-grade craniate chordates without backbones.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`TALK FIRST, RESUME FLIGHTS LATER,' SAYS ROC TRANSPORT MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister
Lin Fong-cheng said on Thursday that the Taiwan-Philippine air links
unilaterally suspended by Manila on Oct. 1 will be resumed as long as
relevant bilateral talks are completed.</P>
      <P>Lin said his office has notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
to arrange for the talks, paving the way for formal resumption of air
links between Taiwan and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Lin said he received a letter on Wednesday from his Philippine
counterpart notifying Taipei that Manila had changed its mind and had
decided to recognize the 1996 air-link pact, under the terms of which
Taiwan carriers China Airlines and EVA Airways can offer 9,600 seats
on their flights every week, while the "sixth flight right" -- the
right to transport passengers from Manila to a third destination via
Taipei -- should be settled through further negotiations.</P>
      <P>He added that since the Philippine authorities have now
demonstrated goodwill in the dispute -- a two-month period of agony
for the affected parties, particularly airline companies and Filipino
laborers working in Taiwan -- Taipei is willing to return to the
negotiating table.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin stressed that the bilateral agreement should be
adhered to, saying that one of the factors that led to the dispute
was the fact that the Philippines disregarded a stipulation in the
1996 agreement that one year's prior notice must be given if either
side wants to suspend the pact.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNREPENTANT ARMORED VEHICLE DRIVER ARRESTED FOR THEFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police announced on Thursday the arrest of
four men suspected of being involved in a NT$53 million armored van
heist that took place in Taipei County on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Jen-mao, the driver of the Guardforce Security Co. van and
alleged mastermind of the robbery, said after his arrest on Wednesday
night that he did not regret his criminal act.</P>
      <P>Hung, 40, allegedly colluded with his three accomplices to
abscond with the NT$53 million which he was transporting on Tuesday.
The accomplices, who have also been nabbed, were identified as Hung
Chu-meng, 46; Hsieh Ching-yu, 31; and Chang Yi-teh, 40.</P>
      <P>Police also managed to retrieve NT$51.92 million from one of the
four suspects' hideouts in Tahsi, Taoyuan County, some 40 kilometers
south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Police Bureau Director Liu Chin-chang said he
appreciated assistance offered by informants. "Information provided
by (the informants) helped us to break the case in less than two
days," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that Hung drove away in the armored
van, carrying six security boxes containing the NT$53 million in
cash, while two other Guardforce security guards were collecting more
money from a soft drink firm in Chungho, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of his three accomplices waiting nearby, Hung
transferred the cash to another vehicle and abandoned the Guardforce
van in order to avoid the police.</P>
      <P>Hung confessed to police that he and his accomplices had planned
the theft for three months, as he needed money to repay gambling
debts and support his family. Hung had been employed by Guardforce
Security Co. for just a year.</P>
      <P>All of the four suspects came from Kinmen, a Taiwan-held military
outpost which lies closer to mainland China than to Taiwan. They
originally planned to remit the stolen money in several installments
to the mainland Chinese port city of Xiamen opposite Kinmen before
sneaking over to the mainland themselves in fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Hung told police that they had contacted a human smuggling ring
to arrange for them to illegally enter the mainland. However, the
quick police action thwarted their plan.</P>
      <P>Police first arrested Hung Chu-meng in Neili, Taoyuan County at 8
p.m. on Wednesday. Acting on information he provided, police managed
to nab Hung Mao-jen, Chang and Hsieh in separate raids in Chungli,
Neili and Tahsi in the wee hours of Thursday.</P>
      <P>The four suspects, all of whom had previous criminal records, had
spent slightly more than NT$1 million of their huge haul.</P>
      <P>It was the fifth private cash van theft case reported so far this
year, and the third to be cracked. Two of the cases remain unsolved.</P>
      <P>Police said they believe that their speed in cracking the most
recent case will help deter others from attempting similar crimes.
They further said security loopholes in the Kinmen area should be
plugged to discourage criminal suspects from trying to get to the
mainland to evade prosecution in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung of Taiwan's main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) flew into Ottawa from
Washington on Wednesday night for a three-day visit to Canada, the
first such trip by a DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>Lin said the main purpose of his visit is to establish a
communication channel with Canadian political circles and to
introduce Taiwan's recent situation and DPP policies to Canadian
political figures and Taiwan compatriots residing in Canada. He said
he hoped this will signify the beginning of a friendship between
Canadian political figures and his party.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Chiou Yi-jen, the DPP's representative in the
United States, Hsiao Mei-chin, director of the party's international
affairs department, and Chen Yi-chia, the DPP's senior specialist,
Lin was scheduled to visit the Canadian Parliament on Thursday for a

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE WRITER PRAISES ROC'S QUAKE-RELIEF PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A well-known Japanese writer has said that
the Japanese people have given high marks to the Republic of China
government and people for their post-quake relief efforts.</P>
      <P>In an article to be published in the January issue of the monthly
magazine "Shogun," Yusuke Mukata says several Japanese writers want
to translate President Lee Teng-hui's "Quake Relief Diary" into
Japanese and present it to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi for
reference.</P>
      <P>Mukata recently visited Taiwan and had an exclusive interview
with Lee on the devastating earthquake which rocked central parts of
Taiwan on Sept. 21, claiming more than 2,400 lives.</P>
      <P>During the interview, Mukata said, Lee first expressed heartfelt
thanks for the assistance and donations made by the Japanese
government and people in the wake of the earthquake, using a Chinese
proverb relating to "timely assistance."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the government's reconstruction plans, Lee stressed
that some aspects needed to be implemented immediately, while others
need to be accomplished gradually over time. He added that the most
important thing is to accomplish all the plans with ceaseless efforts
until the work has been completed.</P>
      <P>He also said Taiwan and Japan should establish closer relations
on measures to cope with such natural disasters, because both Taiwan
and Japan are located in the same temblor-prone region.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that many of Taiwan's civic organizations engaged
in post-quake relief work have encountered financial, personnel
training and experience problems. If Japan can render assistance to
help train Taiwan's rescue teams, local rescue teams could rush to
Japan in the event of another earthquake there, he said.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that people should face the disaster
and keep hope alive to fight for a better tomorrow. Taiwan went ahead
in hosting the Johnnie Walker Classic Golf Tournament just 50 days
after the quake with the aim of showing the world that Taiwan had
arisen from the rubble.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1969, "Shogun" is one of the most widely read
magazines in Japan, with a circulation of 120,000.</P>

    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will fully cooperate in a plan
unveiled by US President Bill Clinton to help the world's poor
countries under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
ROC Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang, leader of a Taiwan delegation attending the WTO's
ministerial-level meeting, responded enthusiastically to the
consensus reached among the world's rich nations, saying Taiwan has
always been supportive of such a stance in all WTO meetings and
gatherings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum it has
attended in the past.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has been listed by the WTO as a developed country, the
island is expected to share a greater responsibility in the plan in
the future, but Wang described this as a great honor for Taiwan, and
recognition of Taiwan's progress and economic clout.</P>
      <P>According to the economics minister, Taiwan has always been
active and cooperative in offering trade, investment and technical
assistance to poor countries around the world, and the island will
move in compliance with WTO agreements on issues related to providing
favorable customs duties to the world's least developed countries.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks following a speech delivered by Clinton at
a lunch party sponsored by the US Trade Representative Office and
attended by trade ministers from all over the world.</P>
      <P>Clinton announced that the United States is joining forces with
the European Union, Canada and Japan to work out a package to help
the world's poorest countries by offering greater market access to
products from these countries and integrating them into global trade
systems.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>EVA Airways announced on Thursday it will
operate Taipei-Sydney flights after Ansett Australia stops flying
the route in February next year.</P>
      <P>EVA said it will dispatch its MD-11 passenger planes for flight
services between the two cities. "We'll maintain three weekly
flights in order not to affect passengers' rights and interests,"
said an EVA spokesman.</P>
      <P>EVA, a wholly-owned offshoot of Taiwan's Evergreen Group which
operates the world's largest container shipping fleet, made the
emergency announcement after its partner in operating
Taiwan-Australian flight services unexpectedly announced on
Wednesday that it will suspend Taipei-Sydney flights from Feb.
12, 2000.</P>
      <P>At present, four carriers -- Taiwan's EVA and Mandarin Airlines
and Australia's Qantas Airways and Ansett -- operate
flight services between Taiwan and Australia. They offer about 4,000
seats per week in total. Intense competition and big differences in
passenger volumes between peak and off seasons have prompted Ansett
to decide to withdraw from the market, airline sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Ansett will shift focus of its
operations to the Hong Kong market and will raise the number of
its weekly flights between Hong Kong and Australia.</P>
      <P>Following Ansett's withdrawal, the number of seats on the
Taiwan-Australia flight route may drop to about 3,000 seats per
week.</P>
      <P>EVA, Ansett and Air New Zealand have jointly operated
Taiwan-Oceania flight services through a code-sharing system since
last year. Under the cooperative system, EVA focuses on flying the
Taipei-Brisbane route, while Ansett flies the Taipei-Sydney route
and Air New Zealand operates Taipei-Auckland services.</P>
      <P>As the period from December to the Chinese New Year holiday is
the peak season for the Taiwan-Australian aviation market, Ansett
will not stop its services on the route until after the lunar New
Year holiday which will start from Feb. 4 through Feb. 8.</P>
      <P>EVA said the schedule for its new Taipei-Sydney flights will be

      <P>US Republican presidential hopeful
George W. Bush said on Wednesday he believes that pushing for a
peaceful solution to the cross Taiwan-Strait issue should be a
mission of the next president of the United States.</P>
      <P>The incumbent Texas governor made the remarks in a speech to the

      <P>Bush said that if he manages to win the US presidency next year,
he will help Taiwan defend itself against mainland China in the event
of a military action against the island.</P>
      <P>"I believe that the issue between Taiwan and China must be solved
peacefully," Bush stressed, adding: "It's (a peaceful solution) got
to be the mission of the next president of the United States."</P>
      <P>Bush further said it's important that if mainland China makes it
into the World Trade Organization, Taiwan ought to follow.</P>
      <P>Bush also said he supports the "one China" policy, but stressed

      <P>"Our relationship is not one of strategic partnership, but one of

    <HEADLINE>ROC, PAKISTAN ICE-BREAKING TALKS MAY LEAD TO OPENING TRADE OFFICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Chi Chin-ling &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang held "ice-breaking talks" with Pakistan Trade and Industry
Production Minister A. Dawood on Wednesday in Seattle.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, the Pakistani official expressed his interest
in exchanging trade offices in each country's capital, according to a
source close to the Taiwan delegation attending the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial-level conference.</P>
      <P>The source described the Wang-Dawood meeting as "ice-breaking
talks," given the fact that Pakistan, along with Sri Lanka, India,
Bangladesh and Cuba -- all with a long-held pro-Beijing stance --
spoke against Taiwan's WTO entry at an unofficial working meeting
held in Geneva in July.</P>
      <P>Taiwan therefore tried to alleviate the obstacle by approaching
all five nations with the hope of building a better understanding of
the situation.</P>
      <P>During the 30-minute meeting, Wang briefed Dawood on the current
situation regarding Taiwan's WTO entry, the ROC's current economic
development, and its outbound capital investment.</P>
      <P>The Pakistani official expressed surprise to hear that Taiwan is
among the top capital investors in Indonesia and Malaysia, according
to Wang, and added that he hopes Taiwan and Pakistan can build up
trade relations.</P>
      <P>Wang also met with representative of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Peru
and Switzerland, as well as with WTO Deputy Director-general Ablosse
Ouedraogo, the former foreign minister of Burkina Faso who assumed
his current post two months ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC HAILS RELEASE OF DETAINED TAIWAN SHIP, PART OF CREW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Thursday it welcomes mainland China's release of
a detained Taiwan freighter and part of its crew.</P>
      <P>The council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland,
also urged mainland authorities to release as soon as possible the
two remaining crew members who are still being detained in
Fujian province.</P>
      <P>The MAC issued the statement after the Keelung-based Hsinhua
cargo ship and eight of its crew returned to the Republic of
China-held island of Matsu, which lies closer to the mainland than
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "Hsinhua" was intercepted by mainland customs officers
in waters near Matsu on March 31 when it was chartered by ROC
military to transport rice, gasoline and canned food to troops
stationed on the offshore island. No military personnel were aboard.</P>
      <P>Mainland customs charged the ship's crew with smuggling goods
along the southeastern mainland coast. A mainland court ruled not to
indict the crew on Oct. 22. As mainland customs authorities were
dissatisfied with the ruling, the crew were still banned
from movements and communication with the outside world.</P>
      <P>Through the assistance of some Taiwan businessmen in mainland
China and several Taiwan politicians, mainland customs authorities
finally agreed to release the ship and eight of its crew. The
released crew members included an Indonesian national. However, the
ship's captain Kuo Tai-sheng and administrative affairs chief Chen
Yi-chou are still being detained in Fujian.</P>
      <P>The ship's owner, Hsinhua Shipping Co., denied mainland customs'
smuggling charge and called for early release of the freighter's
captain and administrative executive.</P>
      <P>Tsao Yuan-chang, a National Assembly deputy elected from the
Matsu constituency, and a Hsinhua Co. boat captain flew to
Fujian on Wednesday to sail the "Hsinhua" freighter to Matsu and
accompany the crew home.</P>
      <P>In its Thursday statement, the MAC expressed its regret that
mainland China has delayed in releasing the cargo ship and its crew
members.</P>
      <P>It further said the incident has once again signified the
necessity for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to establish a
mechanism to resolve problems and disputes arising from increased
bilateral civilian exchanges and to better protect the rights and
safety of ships and their crew sailing in the strait.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the MAC said the two sides should
resume dialogue as early as possible and work hand-in-hand to fight
smuggling and other criminal activities across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF HEAD URGES EXCHANGES WITH ARATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu called on Thursday for continued dialogue between the SEF
and its mainland Chinese counterpart to promote cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Only through systemic exchanges between the SEF and the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) can Taiwan
and mainland China maintain direct communication channels and hold
bilateral negotiations on an equal footing, Koo said.</P>
      <P>Koo, Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, made the remarks
after being re-elected SEF chief for the fourth time. SEF Vice
Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow was also re-elected to
his post.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are the semi-official organizations set up by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Voicing his desire that all the SEF staff will work with him to
boost positive exchanges with the mainland, Koo expressed his hope
that his mainland Chinese counterpart -- ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan
-- will visit Taiwan "the sooner the better."</P>
      <P>Wang should visit Taiwan without any conditions attached, just as
he himself visited mainland China in October last year, the SEF head
said, adding that Taiwan has not suspended the arrangements for
Wang's planned visit.</P>
      <P>Although Wang's Taiwan trip, originally slated for autumn this
year, was put off by Beijing after President Lee Teng-hui aired his
"special state-to-state" theory to describe Taiwan-mainland ties in
July, Koo said both Taiwan and the mainland should understand the
importance of persistent SEF-ARATS exchanges, and that the two sides
should incorporate more rationality into their efforts.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has not halted its preparations for Mr. Wang's visit, and
we still hope that Mr. Wang will realize his planned Taiwan trip at
an appropriate time," Koo stressed.</P>
      <P>Claiming that cross-strait relations are "special in nature"
because the two sides share the same racial and cultural roots, Koo
emphasized that Taiwan has not changed its policy toward mainland
China and that neither side has shifted away from its goal of
eventual unification.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, all doubts arising from Taiwan's stance
on China's unification are unnecessary, and the accusation by Beijing
that Taiwan is a "troublemaker" is unfounded, he added.</P>
      <P>As to speculation that both Taiwan and mainland China are
expected to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) simultaneously
sometime next spring, the SEF chairman pointed out that admission for
the two sides will help the mainland boost its economic reform and
serve as a chance for the two sides to forge an opportunity for
two-way cooperation.</P>
      <P>He voiced the hope that Taiwan and the mainland will treat each
other with goodwill during the process leading up to WTO entry, and
work together to create an opportunity for Taiwan to review its
economic policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Turning to doubts as to whether or not Taiwan and mainland China
will have to open direct trade, transport and postal links across the
Taiwan Strait following their WTO membership, Koo replied that this
will not be necessary.</P>
      <P>Since the "three direct links" are not just economic issues, Koo
said, any breakthrough must be achieved through bilateral
negotiations between the SEF and ARATS.</P>
      <P>The fact that sea traffic and service industries will be issues
covered by the next round of WTO negotiations which will begin next
year, Koo gave his assurance that the two sides will have to conduct
talks on this front eventually, which means that the SEF and ARATS
will have to contact each other for such talks.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of whether Taiwan's and mainland China's
admission into the WTO means that Taiwan will enter the "middle
stage" set forth in the National Unification Guidelines, Koo argued
that conditions are not yet ripe for such an adjustment.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, we expect that Taiwan-mainland relations will
enter the middle stage at some point, which will mean bilateral ties
have heralded in a new era," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONDITIONS FOR WANG'S TAIWAN VISIT STAND, SAYS BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese official said on Thursday
that the two conditions set by Beijing for Chairman Wang Daohan of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to
visit Taipei remain valid.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks in a telephone interview with CNA,
which was seeking a comment on a statement by Koo Chen-fu, chairman
of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) following his
re-election as SEF chairman on Thursday, when he reiterated his
earlier invitation for Wang to visit Taipei at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>However, the official stressed that the two preconditions for
Wang's Taiwan trip, spelled out by mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin during his official visit to Australia in September, remain
effective.</P>
      <P>These are that Taiwan must retract President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-Taiwan Strait relations as a "special
state-to-state relationship," and that Lee must receive Wang only in
his capacity as Kuomintang chairman, not as president of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Wang was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan this fall to
reciprocate Koo's visit to the mainland in October last year, but the
trip was suspended indefinitely by Beijing after Lee voiced his
"special state-to-state relationship" view last July.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN WORKERS' MAXIMUM STAY TO BE EXTENDED TO SIX YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is considering extending the maximum
period of stay for foreign workers here as part of its efforts to
further improve the management of alien employees who are allowed to
enter to help alleviate labor shortages.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan on Thursday approved an amended draft of the
Employment and Service Statutes, allowing foreign workers to stay in
Taiwan for up to six years, three years longer than the current
limit.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said foreign workers have made positive
contributions to the country's economic development since they were
first introduced in 1992.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan develops into a business operations center in the
Asian-Pacific region, Siew said, the government should establish a
single-office administrative system to simplify foreign workers'
application and employment procedures.</P>
      <P>In addition, the amended draft also allows foreign nationals to
apply for jobs offered by employers other than the one that sponsored
their entry into Taiwan. Currently, foreign workers are legally bound
to their employers and cannot seek employment elsewhere on the
island.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, foreign nationals will be allowed to
work as English teachers in private, experimental and bilingual
schools, and as crewmen on commercial ships, work ships, and
ocean-going fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the amendment also stipulates that the interests and
welfare of aboriginal people should be protected while allowing for
an extension of foreign workers' length of stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Aboriginal people as a whole have an average unemployment rate of
7 percent, compared with 3 percent among other ethnic groups in
Taiwan, according to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The amendment will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review
before it likely passes into law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government has refused to
guarantee Radio Australia's access to a broadcasting transmitter near
Darwin after it sells the station to a private operator early next
year.</P>
      <P>RA network manager Jean-Gabriel Manguy said he made the request
for broadcasting access to mainland China, Vietnam and other Asian
countries, but the government refused the request by saying it must
compete on a commercial basis, according to a report by the
Australian Financial Review on Friday.</P>
      <P>The government closed the RA transmitter near Darwin in 1997 as a
way of cutting costs, depriving its millions of listeners in
Southeast Asia, particularly China, of its programming.</P>
      <P>RA presently broadcasts short-wave services to the Pacific from
Townsville in north Queensland and to Asia from the central Victorian
town of Shepparton. However it misses large areas of Asia from India
to China and parts of Indonesia, Manguy said.</P>
      <P>He noted that RA had to pay to use transmitters in Taiwan and
Singapore in order to broadcast more clearly into East Timor and
Southeast Asia recently. He complained that Australian politics
limited the types of programs the RA could broadcast to large areas
of Asia.</P>
      <P>"There is still a dire need for short-wave (transmission) into
Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Vietnam," he said. Millions of people
in the region rely on short-wave radio transmissions for independent
current affairs, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI FOR BILATERAL WTO TALKS IF BEIJING SHOWS 'GOODWILL': SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan wants to conduct "win-win" bilateral
economic consultations with mainland China under the World Trade
Organization (TWO) framework if Beijing is willing to adjust its
unfriendly attitude toward Taiwan, Premier Vincent Siew said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taipei would not exclude the possibility of engaging in
WTO-style bilateral consultations with Beijing after both Taiwan and
mainland China enter the world trade regulatory body. This, however,
hinges on the premise that Beijing shows goodwill first, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>Asked by legislators what is his definition of "goodwill", Siew
said Taipei would consider that Beijing were showing goodwill if it
were to stop suppressing Taiwan in the international community, stop
threatening Taiwan militarily and if it were willing to face the fact
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are distinct political
entities.</P>
      <P>As to whether and when Taiwan will review its "be patient, no
haste" policy toward mainland China, which Siew said was devised to
slow down the pace of Taiwan's big conglomerates and high-technology
manufacturers relocating their operations to the mainland, Siew noted
that it will be reviewed once Beijing removes its hostility toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew added that once Beijing shows goodwill, Taiwan will also
consider opening the so-called "three direct links" -- direct trade,
post and transportation links -- with the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTER DENIES REPORT ON TIES WITH ALBANIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen on Friday
denied a foreign wire service report that the Republic of China has
offered to give the impoverished Balkan state of Albania US$1 billion
in exchange for diplomatic recognition.</P>
      <P>"I have not heard of such a thing," Chen said in response to a
press inquiry about the report, adding that judging from common
sense, the situation is unlikely to resemble that claimed by the
report.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC currently does not have any special
relationship with Albania, Chen said he has not received any report
to indicate that the ROC is going to establish diplomatic ties with
the Balkan state.</P>
      <P>"I have not been informed of any development that would lead to
the establishment of formal diplomatic ties with Albania in the near
future," said Chen, a seasoned career diplomat who just took the helm
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Albania have not exchange representative or liaison
offices and bilateral trade is limited.</P>
      <P>A Reuters Dec. 2 report quoted Peilumb Shullazi, an Albanian
legislator and deputy chairman of the Association of Friendship
between Albania and Taiwan, as saying that he and several other
Albanian parliamentarians met with ROC envoy to Macedonia Peter Cheng
earlier this week to discuss measures to promote Taiwan-Albanian
relations.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Shullazi said, Cheng implied that he has been
authorized by his government to offer Albania up to US$1 billion in
exchange for diplomatic recognition.</P>
      <P>"During the conversation, held two days ago in Macedonia, it was
implied that their condition is for us to recognize them
politically," Shullazi was quoted as having told a private Albanian
television channel.</P>
      <P>According to the Reuters report, Albania, one of the poorest
countries in Europe, received the same amount of money -- US$1
billion -- from international donors for seven years starting in
1991, when communist rule was toppled in the country.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, MOFA officials said the news came as a
surprise and that they are still checking the reliability of the
report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister Chen said while ROC officials stationed in
neighboring Macedonia have had contacts with Shullazi, none of them
has ever mentioned that the ROC would be willing to offer Albania
US$1 billion in aid in exchange for diplomatic recognition.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that some Albanian parliamentarians are friendly
toward the ROC. "We are more than willing to forge ties with any
other country wishing to make friends with us," he said.</P>
      <P>The minister further said the ROC is currently endeavoring to
develop relations with many other countries. "But we have not made
any cash offer for forging ties," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Reliable sources said ROC Premier Vincent Siew and former Foreign
Minister Jason Hu met with an Albanian political heavyweight in tight
secrecy when Siew made an official visit to Macedonia this summer. At
that time, the ROC Cabinet would neither confirm nor deny the report.</P>
      <P>The ROC managed to forge formal diplomatic ties with Macedonia in
January this year, which gave the ROC a second foothold in Europe
other than the Vatican.</P>
      <P>ROC officials said the establishment of diplomatic ties with
Macedonia is expected to help facilitate the ROC's efforts to forge
friendships with other countries in the Balkan and East European
areas.</P>

      <P>The government will resettle people still
living in tents in the wake of the massive Sept. 21 earthquake in two
weeks, Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu, who is the executive officer of a post-quake reconstruction

the committee in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that among the more-than 10,000 quake victims now living
in tents, more than 2,000 are people afraid of aftershocks, and more
than 4,000 are those whose houses were damaged by the devastating
earthquake and are currently under repair.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he went on, that leaves around 3,600 who need
government assistance for temporary resettlement to tide them over
the winter, and these people have first priority in the government's

      <P>Liu said that after some discussion, the government has decided
to offer military barracks, warehouses, and shipping containers as
temporary accommodation, so that they will not have to spend the
winter in tents.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the prefabricated housing units under

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES CANADA TO HELP PROMOTE PEACE ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung of Taiwan's main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday urged
Canada to help promote peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin, who is on a three-day visit to Canada, urged Ottawa to voice
the call for a peaceful solution to cross-strait issues on various
international occasions.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a luncheon presided over by Canadian Liberal Party
parliamentarian Sarkis Assadourian, Lin stressed that the people of
Taiwan are sincere in wishing to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP not only encourages Taiwan students to study in
mainland China but also advocates providing scholarships to allow
young mainland Chinese to come to Taiwan to study in order to foster
reciprocal understanding.</P>
      <P>Lin reiterated that the DPP welcomes mainland Chinese sportsmen,
cultural and academic representatives, and officials, to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that while the DPP's goodwill gesture may not necessarily
receive the same goodwill response from Beijing, the party will
continue to make efforts to achieve the goal of improved relations.</P>
      <P>Replying to a question raised by one Canadian parliamentarian as
to the main obstacle hindering cross-strait communication, Lin said
the blame lies with mainland China's hegemonious attitude of wishing
to play the leading role in the unification of China and the lack of
the concepts of freedom, human rights and peace among the Beijing
regime.</P>
      <P>Asked what Canada can do to help Taiwan, Lin proposed four
points:</P>
      <P>-- to provide legal help to Taiwan immigrants and investors;</P>
      <P>-- to frequently invite Taiwan's parliamentarians to visit Canada
to exchange views on issues of mutual concern;</P>
      <P>-- to support Taiwan attempts to join international
organizations; and</P>
      <P>-- to strongly call for a peaceful solution to cross-strait
issues in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Prior to attending the luncheon, Lin, accompanied by three DPP
members, also visited the ROC representative office in Canada to
exchange views with officials there on the difference between
ROC-Canada relations and ROC-US relations, the DPP's policy toward
mainland China, as well as the issues concerning Taiwan's 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that the DPP has garnered more than 33 percent of
the vote in recent Taiwan elections, and he expressed confidence that
his party will win the 2000 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPZ CELEBRATES 33RD ANNIVERSARY</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taian's Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
celebrated its 33rd anniversary on Friday with a commitment to
developing hi-tech industry and warehousing businesses in tune with
the nation's regional operations hub project.</P>
      <P>The celebration was held in Nantzu EPZ, presided over by
Administration Director General Pan Tin-bai and attended by 600
representatives from the Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Nantzu EPZs.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Yang Shih-chien, who also attended,
presented outstanding business awards to Philips Electronics Building
Elements Industries (Taiwan) and other companies located in the EPZs.</P>
      <P>Pan noted that in response to the economic development of the
nation, the government set up the first EPZ in Kaohsiung on reclaimed
land in Dec. 3, 1966, adding that the target at the time was to
attract industrial investment, promote foreign trade, introduce the
latest technology, and increase employment opportunities, all of
which was achieved.</P>
      <P>As the response to the EPZ was so enthusiastic, other EPZs
followed, Pan said, and they attracted more manufacturers. In the
meantime, they also helped promote industrial automation and the
upgrading of industry, with a lot of semi-conductor manufacturers
investing in the EPZs.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that there are currently over 200 manufacturers
in the country's three EPZs, 80 percent of which are hi-tech
businesses. The combined export value totals US$83.86 billion, while
the combined import value totals US$47.9 billion, with a surplus of
US$35.96 billion.</P>
      <P>To deal with possible cross-Taiwan Strait development and
cooperation in the international community, Pan said the EPZs will
continue to push for warehousing transshipment zones in Kaohsiung and
Taichung which have already attracted investment from many
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Pan estimated that the plan will create an annual production
value of US$100 billion and 100,000 job opportunities.</P>

      <P>A Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) official
on Friday presented NT$101.24 million (US$3.2 million) from Taiwan
businessmen in mainland China to Republic of China Interior Minister
Huang Chu-wen for victims of the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow said that shortly after the
temblor, Taiwan businessmen on the mainland began to raise money and
collect relief materials such as batteries, blankets and tents for
the victims.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen in Shanghai donated 2.7 million renminbi
(US$325,000), and the donations by Taiwan businessmen in Ningpo
amounted to NT$1.7 million (US$53,000), he said.</P>
      <P>However, owing to Beijing's control on the flow of foreign
exchange, Shi said, the donations could not be remitted to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed his appreciation for the kindness shown by the
Taiwan businessmen, and said that the donations will be used for
post-quake reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The 7.3-magnitude quake, the strongest to hit Taiwan in nearly
100 years, left 2,400 dead and 10,000 others injured, and the
government estimates it will take five years to complete the

    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Chi Chin-ling and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang delivered a speech at a ministerial-level meeting of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle on Thursday, urging all
WTO members to support Taiwan's early entry into the organization.</P>
      <P>In his address in English, Wang also echoed US President Bill
Clinton's call for helping the world's less or least developed
countries develop their economies under the WTO framework.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ROC is more than willing to share with other
developing countries its experience in improving trade regime and
economic system.</P>
      <P>The ROC is attending the WTO ministerial meeting as an observer.</P>
      <P>Noting that the current Seattle meeting is aimed at working out
an agenda for a new round of WTO trade talks, Wang said he hopes all
WTO members can support for early entry of those who are still shut
out of the world trade regulatory body, particularly those who have
almost completed all accession procedures.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ROC, which has completed all bilateral
negotiations on its accession terms, earnestly hopes that it will be
able to take part in the WTO's new round of trade talks as a full
member.</P>
      <P>The economist-turned-minister pointed out that the ROC became an
observer of the WTO's precursor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) in 1992. Over the past seven years, Wang said, the ROC
has revised its trade regulations in line with the WTO requirements
so as to improve its overall trade regime.</P>
      <P>By now, Wang said, the ROC is fully prepared to become a formal
WTO member and is willing to carry out all obligations as a WTO
member.</P>
      <P>Wang further said the ROC is willing to help other developing
countries improve their trade regimes through technological
cooperation and to help poor countries survive under the WTO system.</P>
      <P>Touching on topics to be included in the new round of WTO talks,
Wang said the ROC supports the proposal to continue reducing
tariffs and removing trade barriers through negotiations in
order to realize the long-term goal of trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>The ROC, Wang went on, also agrees to include the "sustainable
development" concept into the agenda for the new round of WTO talks
in order to ensure consistency in WTO measures and multilateral
protocols on environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The ROC applied to join the WTO as an independent customs
territory in 1990. It expects to be admitted to the Geneva-based
trade regulatory body by next spring.</P>

not to "offend" the majority of voters in the coming presidential
race in March 2000, as the survey indicates that only 10 percent of
the island's farmers believe that the government's planned farmland
use liberalization package will produce positive results for the
KMT's presidential candidate -- Vice President Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after making public the results of the
public opinion survey which covered 1,122 Taiwan residents, including
219 farmers.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, Chen said more than 70 percent of the
respondents are aware of the current government policy that only
farmers can buy cropland, and around 66 percent of them also know
that the government is planning to ease this restriction. But even if
the plan goes ahead, over 40 percent of the people still believe that
farmland should be used exclusively for farming, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 66 percent agree that the farmland reform bill
will have a negative impact on Taiwan's long-term agricultural
development, while more than 60 percent expressed concern that new
construction built on farmland will bring disorder to the
countryside, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>In addition, nearly 77 percent are concerned that allowing
housing development on cropland will become a money-making tool for
special interest groups, although over 80 percent agree that housing
construction on farmland must be restricted to "high-class"
residential communities.</P>
      <P>Among the 219 farmers surveyed, more than 70 percent know that
the government is planning to ease restrictions on farmland purchase,
but 50 percent said they will not buy more cropland. At the same
time, nearly 60 percent said they will not sell their farmland, while
53 percent expressed the opinion that there is no need to place a
lower limit on the smallest parcel of farmland permitted to be sold.</P>
      <P>On the issue related to building construction on farmland, more
than 90 percent of the farmers expressed the hope that there will be
no restrictions in this regard, while 45 percent voiced support for
collective construction of farmhouses on farmland.</P>
      <P>The government's plan to relax the current farmland policy to
allow non-farmers to purchase farmland and to allow construction on
such land caused Council of Agriculture Chairman Peng Tso-kuei to
resign on Wednesday because President and KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui
is said to agree with the plan.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that KMT lawmakers are preparing to push for
the passage of the new farmland use bill next week in the Legislative
Yuan, a move which detractors accuse of being simply an expedient way
of gaining votes for the ruling party in the coming presidential
contest, with no thought for the future of the nation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A rare Euroasian otter has been discovered
on the Republic of China-held frontline island of Kinmen, which lies
closer to mainland China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The otter, believed to be less than one year old, was spotted by
a Kinmen civilian resident in the backyard of his home on Thursday
night. The resident kept the small creature in a cardboard box to
protect it from being hurt by stray dogs before handing the creature
to the Kinmen National Park Administration on Friday.</P>
      <P>Park administrators said the animal belongs to one of the world's
five threatened otter species. It is widely regarded as an "index
animal," as its presence or absence from a maritime area can serve as
a gauge of the environmental quality for that area.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen island group is a natural habitat of the Euroasian
otter, a small animal with brown fur, short legs and a long tail.
Otters swim well and eat fish. The Kinmen National Park has selected
the Euroasian otter as its representative animal.</P>
      <P>The park has also commissioned National Taiwan University
associate professor Lee Ling-ling to conduct an otter-related
ecological study. Lee will travel to Kinmen on Saturday to decide
either to release the newly found otter after implanting it with a
computer chip to allow it to be tracked, or to raise it until it
matures enough to survive in the wild.</P>

Chih-kang a series of talks on Thursday in Seattle with
representatives of Bangladesh, Uruguay, Germany, Brazil, Italy,

      <P>All the chief delegates on the sidelines of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial-level meeting who met with Wang
expressed their willingness to support Taiwan's WTO bid, the minister
said, adding that he was especially encouraged by the goodwill
response demonstrated by the representative of Bangladesh, a
long-time Beijing ally.</P>
      <P>The meetings followed an "ice-breaking" meeting between Wang and
Pakistan's trade minister on Wednesday, during which the Pakistani

      <P>Representatives of Pakistan, India, Cuba, Bangladesh, and Sri

that Taiwan is part of China and that Beijing should enter the WTO
before Taiwan, which is the largest obstacle barring Taiwan from WTO

      <P>Speaking on workers' rights, a controversial issue at the

    <HEADLINE>RARE AQUATIC FIREFLY SPECIES FOUND IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A rare aquatic firefly species --
the stripe-back firefly -- has been found in Taiwan, the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the COA's rare biological species study and
conservation center said they are very pleased to discover the
stripe-back firefly on the island because there are only 20 aquatic
firefly species in the world.</P>
      <P>Two aquatic firefly species -- the yellow-margined firefly and
the yellow-chest, black-wing firefly -- have long been found in
Taiwan. With the discovery of the stripe-back firefly, COA
officials said, Taiwan now boasts three species, matching the
number found in Japan.</P>
      <P>COA researchers said the stripe-back firefly swims backstroke and
has some other special features that have not been found in other
firefly species.</P>
      <P>Previous records show that stripe-back fireflies were once
common in the coastal areas of mainland China's Fujian province,
just opposite Taiwan. They have also been spotted in Taiwan-held
offshore defense outpost of Kinmen Island.</P>
      <P>In April 1998, COA researchers spotted the creature for the
first time in Hsinhua, a small township in the southern Taiwan county
of Tainan. The researchers later also discovered the species in
mountain regions bordering Taichung and Miaoli counties in central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The researchers have since discovered that stripe-back fireflies
usually hatch in April and that they are most active between May and
June. However, even in October, some stripe-back fireflies can still
be spotted at night.</P>
      <P>Researchers said they once recorded more than 200 stripe-back
fireflies in a single night. "This indicates that Taiwan is still a
good natural habitat for fireflies," said a COA official.</P>
      <P>The official added that some Japanese insect experts have
traveled to Taiwan to watch the newly discovered fireflies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN ANNOUNCES `JOURNEY OF PEACE TO MAINLAND CHINA' IF ELECTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President and Kuomintang presidential
candidate Lien Chan said on Friday that if elected president in
March, he will embark on a "journey of peace to mainland China" to
meet Beijing's leaders.</P>
      <P>"If elected, I would like, either before or after my
inauguration, to tour the mainland on a journey of peace to meet
mainland Chinese leaders, as long as the interests and dignity of the
22 million people of Taiwan are ensured," Lien said while meeting
representatives of international journalist organizations stationed
in Beijing, Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>"It doesn't matter where we meet, and if Beijing's leaders
consider it (Lien's mainland trip) inconvenient for them, then we
could meet in a third location," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed, however, that it is most important that both sides
should demonstrate goodwill and a sincere wish to resolve the
existing cross-Taiwan Strait problems before any such meeting can
take place.</P>
      <P>Lien, who initiated the KMT's "three noes" -- no rush toward
unification, no Taiwan independence, and no cross-strait
confrontation, and the "three wants" -- peace, exchanges, and a
win-win situation, said that both sides should first improve their
relations across-the-board, and engage in dialogues and negotiations
at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>"Any topics can be put on the negotiating table," Lien said,
adding that on the issue of national unification, Taiwan has no
timetable and no preset stance.</P>
      <P>"We are more than willing to conduct substantial and reciprocal
discussions with the mainland on any issue, as long as such
discussion are on an equal footing," Lien stressed.</P>
      <P>He suggested that both Taiwan and the mainland should set aside
their dispute on sovereignty. "We should not let the dispute continue
troubling us and should instead try to seek a breakthrough," he
added.</P>
      <P>To begin with, Lien said, both sides can join hands to fight
crime, crack down on smuggling and forge agricultural cooperation and
sci-tech exchanges, then resume dialogue, and move on to discuss
issues on ending cross-strait hostility, the signing of a truce
accord or even a peace agreement.</P>
      <P>Lien, hand-picked by President Lee Teng-hui as his successor,
also defended Lee's definition of Taiwan-mainland ties as a "special
state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>It is just a depiction of the reality that has existed between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait over the past 50-odd years, Lien
said, adding that Taiwan "will definitely not withdraw the theory in
any way."</P>
      <P>Of the other presidential hopefuls, Chen Shui-bian, the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party's candidate, has made a
similar offer to visit the mainland if elected.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following a meeting with Minister of Finance
Paul Chiu on Friday, domestic and foreign banks in Taiwan have agreed
to grant an extra grace period of six months to non-high-tech
industry borrowers, the minister announced after the meeting.</P>
      <P>At a press briefing, Chiu said all financial institutions,
including banks and bill finance firms, agreed to extend the deadline
of loans to non-information-industry firms by six months, a
suggestion set forth in a package of measures worked out by the
Cabinet on Thursday to promote the competitiveness of these firms.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's non-information-industry firms have been feeling the
bite of cash-shortages recently since their stock prices were sent
into a tailspin, with many share prices sinking below their face
value because of local investors' overwhelming enthusiasm for equity
in the island's information industry.</P>
      <P>As a result, many non-information-industry firms which borrowed
money against their stocks have seen their stocks, deposited with
their creditors as collateral, being dumped on the market as their
creditors scramble to recover the loans before the stocks have
totally lost their value.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the Cabinet measures cover only those firms which are
still operating and are up to date with their debt repayments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Governor of the Central Bank of China (CBC) Perng
Fai-nan, who was also present at the meeting, urged the bankers to
use the NT$100 billion (US$3.12 billion) credit line provided by CBC
to finance housing reconstruction and repair after the Sept. 21
earthquake, saying the move will hopefully prop up the island's
sagging construction industry.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Ambassador to Macedonia
Peter Cheng on Friday solemnly denied allegations that the ROC is
planning to pay a large sum of money to buy diplomatic recognition
from Albania.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire reports, Cheng told an Albanian
parliamentarian that he had been authorized by his government to pay
US$1 billion to Albania in a bid to establish diplomatic relations
with the European country.</P>
      <P>In a later interview with CNA, Cheng categorically denied the
report, and described it as "incredible" because the alleged sum
quoted far exceeds that of the annual budget of ROC's entire Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to reliable sources, a certain Albanian political
figure is indeed interested in the promotion of ROC-Albania
relations, but not as far as the establishment of diplomatic ties.
Albania is said to be hoping for the development of economic and
trade relations with the ROC in an attempt to attract Taiwan
businessmen to invest there, but it is determined to continue to
maintain diplomatic ties with Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT OF MAINLAND CHINESE FISHERMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is trying
to improve its management of mainland Chinese fishermen employed by
local ship owners, officials of the Fisheries Department under the
Council of Agriculture (COA) said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that since the government began allowing local
skippers to hire mainland crews to help alleviate a labor shortage on
Taiwan fishing boats, problems have arisen with the management of the
mainland fishermen.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example the fact that the "floating hostels" in
which the mainland fishermen are forced to live when not working are
shabby and overcrowded. The hostels, mostly dilapidated scows
anchored just off Taiwan's coast, are necessary since the mainlanders
are not allowed to set foot on Taiwan soil.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the department is now working out ways to
improve the management of these fishermen. Measurers under
consideration include the establishment of a comprehensive databank
on the mainland fishermen by asking local ship owners to report
relevant information to local fishing associations which can then be
used by marine police as reference during at-sea inspections.</P>
      <P>Other measures being considered are that the floating hostels
should stay at designated berths, should keep their engines running,
and should demolish any temporary buildings on board. Management
personnel should also be stationed on the hostels, who should report
regularly on the situation on their vessels to local fishing radio
stations.</P>
      <P>The officials estimated that the Taiwan fishery industry hires
about 31,000 mainland fishermen each year, but added that the actual
number of mainlanders working on Taiwan ships far outnumbers the
reported number.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that if calculated by the pay of mainland
fishermen of about US$400 a month, then mainland China should be
earning about US$148 million in foreign exchange per year,
underlining the interdependence of Taiwan's fishery sector and
mainland fishermen.</P>
      <P>The officials said that after the implementation of the proposed
measures, the Fisheries Department will ask maritime police to step
up crackdowns on illegal mainland fishermen.</P>
      <P>The department is also trying to diversify the sources of
fishermen, and is now in discussions with labor brokerages in Vietnam
and the Philippines to gauge the possibility of introducing fishermen
from those countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEATTLE MEETING HELPS BOOST ROC'S WTO BID: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang said on Friday that the just-concluded World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Seattle has helped boost
the ROC's bid to join the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Wang further said no problems arose over the designation issue
concerning the ROC's WTO membership. "We'll join the WTO in the name
of `Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (TPKM) Independent Customs
Territory,'" the minister said, adding that the abbreviation of the
ROC's full WTO title will be "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>The ROC adopted the TPKM designation when it first filed its
membership application with the WTO's precursor, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), in 1990.</P>
      <P>Wang also told a news conference held at the conclusion of the
WTO meeting that the ROC will make some adjustments to its trade and
economic policy after being admitted into the WTO.</P>
      <P>"The adjustments, however, will not include issues related to
transport links across the Taiwan Strait," Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to mainland Chinese Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Minister Shi Guangsheng's remarks that Taiwan
will violate WTO regulations if it continues to ban direct "three
links" with the mainland after both sides join the WTO.</P>
      <P>As mainland China remains hostile toward Taiwan, the ROC
government still bans direct trade, transport and postal links,
commonly known as the "three links," across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ROC will make some adjustments to its trade policy
in accordance with WTO regulations following its entry to the
organization. "But we'll not consider shipping or aviation link
issues, since no existing WTO rules regulate such issues," the
minister added.</P>
      <P>During the four-day WTO meeting aimed at launching a new round of
global trade liberalization talks, Wang said the ROC delegation
managed to hold bilateral trade consultations with 21 countries,
including Pakistan and Bangladesh, that have never had contact with
the ROC in the past.</P>
      <P>"During the talks, we solicited their support for our early entry
to the WTO," Wang said, adding that all of those countries gave
positive responses to the ROC's request.</P>
      <P>Wang said some of the countries plan to upgrade the level of
contacts with the ROC, and several others said they hope to learn
from the ROC's experience in small- and medium-business development,
trade management and high-tech industry development.</P>
      <P>In addition, 18 ROC lawmakers also attended the Seattle meeting,
during which they met with their counterparts from the United States,
the European Union, Japan and Canada, to seek their support for the
ROC's WTO bid.</P>
      <P>"Through the concerted efforts of our executive and legislative
branches, I believe that the Seattle meeting has helped push forward
our WTO bid," Wang explained.</P>
      <P>The ROC attended the Seattle meeting as a WTO observer. During a
plenary session, Wang delivered a speech urging all WTO members to
support the ROC's early entry in line with the organization's
"membership universality principle."</P>
      <P>Wang also echoed US President Bill Clinton's call for
international assistance to less-developed countries under the
framework of the WTO, saying the ROC is more than willing to share
with other developing countries its experience in improving its trade
regime and boosting economic growth.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is stepping up its campaign
to attract foreign visitors to Taiwan in the wake of the massive
Sept. 21 earthquake, a tourism official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-sheng, deputy director-general of the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, made the
remarks at a seminar in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that due to widespread reports by the international
media on the earthquake that devastated parts of central Taiwan,
foreign tourists are under the mistaken impression that the entire
island is a quake-stricken area and are staying away, casting a pall
over the usually booming tourism business which has seen hotel
occupancy rates plunge by an average of 60 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan people scheduled to go abroad or travel
around the island has also dropped by 50 percent and 70 percent,
respectively, he went on.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau has initially estimated that as of November,
international hotels had lost NT$1.06 billion in room and restaurant
revenue, while smaller hotels had lost about NT$600 million in
canceled bookings, private resorts had lost about NT$1.21 billion,
travel agencies had lost about NT$2.54 million, while 210,000
international airline seats had been canceled as of December.</P>
      <P>Total losses incurred by the tourism industry have been estimated
at NT$30 billion, bureau officials added.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that in order to help revive tourism, the government has
provided low-interest loans to tourism operators, and is stepping up
an international campaign to attract more foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>The government has also planned trips on the theme of lessons to
be learned from the earthquake, and has worked out four routes with

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ELITE SAID STANDING IN WAY OF EDUCATION REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Resistance from the elite of Taiwan society,
who account for no more than ten percent of the population, is
standing in the way of the country's education reforms, an activist
claimed on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Although the island has come a long way in revamping its
education system, there is still a long way to go before the goals of
those in favor of education reforms are realized, said Huang
Wu-hsiung, a psychology professor at National Taiwan University and
an education reformist.</P>
      <P>He made the comments at a symposium organized by the China Times
newspaper on educational reform.</P>
      <P>Huang said that so far, deregulation of the education system has
seen a breaking of the monopoly held by teacher training schools on
the nation's new teachers, an introduction of an Education Basic Law
which shields the education system from political meddling and
guarantees an education budget, a mechanism to accredit educational
level via examinations, and the formation of local government-level
educational councils, said Huang.</P>
      <P>However, there has been little change in the educational
infrastructure and much work remains to be done in this regard, such
as a two-pronged educational system of private and public schools,
the establishment of pilot private junior high schools which prepare
local students for study at foreign universities, popularization of
community colleges, and the relaxation of the academic
degree-awarding system.</P>
      <P>Huang, who is also the chief organizer of the community colleges
in Taipei County, said that one of the problems which has foiled the
efforts of the reformist groups is students' obsession with higher
academic titles and their "abnormal" devotion to studying merely for
high examination marks.</P>
      <P>Another hurdle to education reform is the education leaders'
tenacious grip on the right to shape the educational system for the
public. Their reluctance to return this right to the people has
seriously impeded the reform, said Huang.</P>
      <P>However, Minister of Education Yung Chaur-shin, who was present
at the symposium, ruled out the prospect of awarding academic degrees
to graduates of community colleges, saying that requirements
stipulated in the Academic Degrees Awarding Law will stifle the
flexibility for which community colleges were created.</P>
      <P>Skills learned from community colleges should be certified by an
accreditation system rather than by academic degrees, said Yung.</P>
      <P>He outlined the four targets of reform being pursued by his
ministry as easing the strain on junior high school students who vie
for limited chances to enroll in prestigious senior high schools;
establishing proper nursing schools and a pre-kindergarten education
system; promoting community colleges as an alternative channel of
study; and taking care of underprivileged students such as those who
cannot afford the cost of further education.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND URGES CAUTIONS ON DIRECT TRANSPORTATION LINKS WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct transportation links with mainland
China will jeopardize Taiwan's security by throwing the country's
doors wide open to its long-standing rival, a defense official
claimed on Friday.</P>
      <P>You Liang-hui, deputy director of the Department of Joint
Operations under the Ministry of National Defense (MND) told a
hearing at the Legislative Yuan that direct links with mainland China
will increase the difficulty for the armed forces in monitoring
Taiwan's airspace and territorial waters, and will stretch the troops
too thin.</P>
      <P>Direct shipping links with mainland China would provide mainland
Chinese freighters the opportunity of secretly mining Taiwan's
harbors -- which often double as military ports -- while mainland
Chinese survey vessels could masquerade as fishing boats and map
Taiwan's sea lanes, he said.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese fishing boats, if allowed to operate in Taiwan
territorial waters, could be used to ferry troops and heavy military
equipment without being detected, the officer claimed.</P>
      <P>To address Taiwan's security concerns, You said, his ministry
would suggest limiting direct links with mainland China in the
preliminary stage to specific harbors via fixed shipping routes and
during prescribed times.</P>
      <P>Although the armed forces is stepping up its air and sea
surveillance, a 24-hour notice to the armed forces of each mainland
Chinese vessel entering Taiwan waters would be necessary for
effective military supervision, said You.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile an official from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Taiwan will not be obliged to set up direct
shipping lines with mainland China immediately after its entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>However, Fu Teng-chen, director of the Economic Affairs
Department under the MAC told the hearing that shipping links with
mainland China should begin by 2003 under WTO rules, while direct air

    <TEXT>
      <P>An architect, a civil engineer and three

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO RESPECT 'SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONSHIP'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  southern  Taiwan, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan,
also the ruling Kuomintang's presidential candidate, urged mainland
China on Saturday to respect the "special state-to-state
relationship" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien made the appeal in his speech to the opening ceremony for
the 11th Asia Outlook Forum being held in the southern Taiwan
city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the division and separate rule of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait is a historical and legal fact, Lien said both
sides must respect this cold reality and hold regular dialogue with
goodwill and on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>"Only by so doing can the two sides transcend their political
differences and forge a relationship that will contribute to China's
eventual peaceful unification under freedom and democracy," Lien
said, adding that this is why ROC President Lee Teng-hui has defined
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that as the Republic of China fully understands
the extreme importance of Taiwan Strait stability to peace in the
Asia-Pacific region, the ROC has spared no effort to promote
cross-strait rapprochement in a pragmatic manner in hopes of helping
safeguard regional security and stability.</P>
      <P>Following the end of the Cold War, Lien said the world community
has developed new concepts on national security and international
relations. The most important change has been abandoning military
confrontation and advocating regional cooperation to maintain peace
and stability.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Lien said all Asia-Pacific nations hope
to forge a relationship that signifies peaceful competition and
mutual cooperation with a view to achieving "co-prosperity."</P>
      <P>Lien further said Beijing's resistence to drop its ideological
boundage and hegemonic mentality has made it a potential threat to
regional security.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned-politician also expressed his regret that
mainland China has not made any goodwill response to the ROC's
call for renouncing the use of force in resolving cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>Even so, Lien said, the ROC will continue doing its utmost to
ease cross-strait tension and boost steady development of bilateral
relations.</P>
      <P>Touching on ROC-Japanese ties, Lien expressed gratitude for
generous relief aid offered by the Japanese government and private
sector after Taiwanwas rattled by a devastating earthquake on Sept.
21 this year.</P>
      <P>Lien further said there is still ample room for the ROC and
Japan to expand cooperation, including defense technology, manpower
training, information technology, infrastructure construction and
management.</P>
      <P>More than 100 scholars, business executives and political
analysts from Taiwan and Japan are attending the annual Asia Outlook
Forum.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation is headed by Koo Chen-fu, a senior adviser to
President Lee and Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, while
the Japanese delegation is led by Masao Kamei, a senior adviser to
Sumitomo Electric Industries.</P>
      <P>Koo and Mineo Nakajima, president of the Tokyo University of
Foreign Studies, jointly presided over the opening ceremony, held at
the Tainan City Council auditorium.</P>
      <P>The agenda for this year's meeting will include relations between
marine civilization and technological networks; Japan's development
trends and Taiwan's new political identification; and cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and Asian-Pacific security in the digital age.</P>
      <P>The Asia Outlook Forum, founded in 1989, is aimed at pooling the
wisdom of the elite of business, political and academic communities
in Taiwan and Japan to help boost bilateral substantive ties as well
as regional prosperity and stability.</P>
      <P>The forum holds its annual meeting alternately in Taiwan and
Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD GAUGE MILITARY CONTACT WITH BEIJING: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should gauge its
military contacts with mainland China carefully, according to a
former American military attache to Beijing.</P>
      <P>It should adopt a simple standard to govern future military
cooperation: "Do nothing to improve the People's Liberation Army's
capability to wage war against Taiwan or friends and allies of the
United States," Larry M. Wortzel, director of the Asian Studies
Center at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, wrote in a new
analysis.</P>
      <P>Wortzel said that US armed forces need to conduct a security
dialogue with mainland China, but the Defense Department must make
clear during these discussions that the United States will continue
to support the efforts of Taiwan's armed forces to maintain its
defenses; view Beijing's missile activities and nuclear proliferation
as a grave threat to its security; and seek a theater missile defense
system to protect its forces in East Asia and offer that system to
its friends and allies.</P>
      <P>He said Americans should welcome Washington's recent agreement
with Beijing allowing mainland China admission to the World Trade
Organization, but pointed out that normal trade relations do not mean
normal military relations and "relations with China must be kept in
the proper perspective."</P>
      <P>Under the Clinton administration, military-to-military contacts,
or "engagement activities, allowed mainland Chinese military officers
broad access to US warships, exercises and even military manuals, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>But once it became clear that Beijing had obtained US nuclear
weapons technology through espionage, Congress felt compelled to
caution the Clinton administration to limit such contacts by adding a
restriction to the 2000 National Defense Authorization Act.</P>
      <P>This prohibited the secretary of defense from authorizing
military exchanges that "create a national security risk," seeking to
ensure that military contacts with the PLA would not improve mainland
China's ability to wage war, project force, threaten Taiwan, or
repress its own people, noted Wortzel.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, he wrote, it is not clear whether the Pentagon
understands the seriousness with which Congress considers the risk.
But the Pentagon can no longer ignore the fact that the "strategic
partnership" heralded by President Bill Clinton is, for Beijing,
strategic competition and "any military-to-military contacts must be
structured with this development in mind."</P>
      <P>In 1996, Wortzel said, mainland China's military leaders were
embarrassed by their inability to respond to the presence of US
aircraft carrier battlegroups off Taiwan, which were responding to
Beijing's military exercises in the Taiwan Straits during Taiwan's
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>In the years since then, the PLA has worked harder to find ways
to deter US military involvement in the area, such as improving its
capabilities in information or electronic warfare; extending the
operational range and capabilities of its air force with airborne
early warning and control systems, new missiles, and air-to-air
refueling systems; and making new missile threats against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wortzel stressed that "reopening normal military exchanges with
China as though it was just another Pacific region security partner
is the wrong approach." The Pentagon should establish clear standards
for future US-mainland China military contacts. There should be no
further "joint exercises;" the release of US war-gaming or combat
simulation computer software to the PLA should cease; and the Defense
Department should talk only with those leaders in Beijing who will
make the decisions governing when mainland China uses force or goes
to war.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI WILLING TO DISCUSS ALL TOPICS WITH BEIJING ON EQUAL TERMS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su
Chi said on Friday that Taiwan is willing to discuss all topics with
mainland China on an equal footing, so long as Beijing demonstrates
goodwill toward Taipei.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the "Face the Public" program on the Taipei-based
Broadcasting Corporation of China, Su said that Taiwan welcomes
discussion of all the issues facing the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, including direct trade, transportation and postal links.</P>
      <P>He said that most of the problems surrounding the establishment
of postal links have already been resolved, and that the volume of
cross-strait mail and telephone calls now surpasses that between
Taiwan and the United States, although all mail must travel via a
third country.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief said that indirect trade links between Taiwan and
the mainland are also well established, while direct transportation
links will be implemented in the future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to further ease its restrictions on trade with
mainland China in compliance with World Trade Organization
regulations, if Beijing displays goodwill toward Taipei.</P>
      <P>Su admitted that conditions are not yet ripe for establishing
direct transportation links, but added that Taipei will discuss the
issue with Beijing on the premise of upholding national security and
national dignity.</P>
      <P>He predicted that direct shipping links may be achieved fairly
easily, perhaps within the next three years, while negotiations on
aviation links will be conducted once shipping links have been
established.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAILURE OF WTO TALKS WILL NOT AFFECT TAIWAN: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The failure of the latest round of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial-level meeting will not
hinder Taiwan's efforts to join the organization, a member of the
Taiwan delegation to the talks said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Although the meeting wrapped up without having achieved progress
on several key issues on labor, the environment and investment due to
sharp differences between developed and developing countries, the
Republic of China official pointed out that the just-concluded
meeting had virtually nothing to do with the question of Taiwan's
membership, and will not affect the country's bid to enter the world
trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's top priority at the present stage is to enter the WTO,
and the fiasco of this round of negotiations will not hamper Taiwan's
prospects of becoming a WTO member," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The hastily concluded meeting -- a result of fierce protests from
anti-WTO demonstrators in the streets of Seattle -- is not expected
to have an immediate impact on global trade deals, and thus will not
affect Taiwan's foreign trade or its trade policy, the official went
on to explain.</P>
      <P>As the next round of WTO negotiations, originally slated to open
next spring, might be postponed as a result of the failure of the
Seattle talks, the ROC official predicted that Taiwan will probably
be able to attend the next round as a full WTO member.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation attended the Seattle talks as an observer.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a recent public opinion poll
show that independent presidential hopeful James Soong remains the
most popular candidate, while ruling Kuomintang presidential
candidate Lien Chan is believed to be the most competent.</P>
      <P>Poll results released on Saturday show that if the next
presidential election were to take place the following day, 32.9
percent of the respondents would vote for the Soong-Chang Chao-hsiung
ticket.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the KMT's Lien-Vincent Siew ticket received the
support of 22 percent of those interviewed, while 20.2 percent threw
their support behind the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) ticket of Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>An additional 23.6 percent of the respondents either declined to
answer the question or said they have yet to make a decision on their
choice.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,199 adults was conducted from Nov.
27-29 by the ROC Association for Public Opinion Research.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the Chen-Lu ticket was the least
popular, with 26.5 percent saying they would least like to see a
victory for the DPP candidates in the 2000 presidential election.
This was followed by the Soong-Chang ticket, with a 22.6 percent
disapproval rating, and the Lien-Siew ticket came in third, with only
16.8 percent saying they would least like to see success for the KMT
ticket.</P>
      <P>The same poll also found that 29.4 percent of the respondents
believe the Lien-Siew ticket to be most capable of maintaining
Taiwan's stability and security, followed by the Soong-Chang team,
with 24.9 percent, and the Chen-Lu ticket, with 12.2 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, 32.4 percent said they think that the Lien-Siew team
would be most capable of expanding Taiwan's diplomatic frontiers,
while the Soong-Chang team trailed at 21.9 percent, and the Chen-Lu
ticket came in third, with 17.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 30.2 percent said they believe that the Lien-Siew
ticket would be most competent in governing the country, followed by
the Soong-Chang team, with 29.9 percent, and the Chen-Lu team, with
19.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The Lien-Siew team also led in terms of ability to maintain
Taiwan's economic prosperity, with a support rating of 41.2 percent,
followed by the Soong-Chang ticket, with 20.5 percent, and the
Chen-Lu team, with 11.8 percent.</P>
      <P>An interesting finding was that only 5.9 percent said they think
the Lien-Siew team would be likely to make a decision which violates
Taiwan's interests at a critical juncture, compared to 21.4 percent
who believe that the Soong-Chang team could make a decision against
Taiwan's interests. Meanwhile, 12.8 percent said they think the
Chen-Lu team could make a bad decision at a crucial moment.</P>

      <P>A group of National Assembly (NA) deputies
on Sunday called for the quick establishment of a national disaster
management center in Taiwan in order to better deal with emergency
situations.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the disaster management center, which is
expected to be similar to the United States' Center of Excellence in
Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance (COE) and the Pacific
Disaster Center (PDC), both located in Hawaii, will also be conducive
to promoting Taiwan's "emergency-help diplomacy," said the NA
deputies.</P>
      <P>At a press conference about their recent visit to the PDC, the NA
deputies said a Taiwanese version of the COE or the PDC, to serve as
a counterpart to the US agencies, will provide a proper channel for
normalizing and accelerating cooperative exchanges in emergency
management between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>NA Deputy Tsai Chih-hung said the PDC has expressed a willingness
to render relevant assistance to help Taiwan further strengthen its
rescue and emergency management capabilities, and the PDC director
would like to visit Taiwan sometime to expedite cooperation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung, chairman of Taiwan's
largest opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, said in
New York over the weekend that the party's mainland China policy will
be to be patient and not rash.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed the hope that the people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait will continue having exchanges so that the mainland
understands that the wish of the people on the sovereign independent
island of Taiwan is to live in peace with the mainland and maintain
mutually beneficial relations.</P>
      <P>With respect to the upcoming presidential election, he said that
although the DPP's poll showed that independent presidential hopeful
James Soong leads both DPP presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian and
the ruling KMT's presidential candidate Lien Chan, Soong's support
rate is gradually slipping while Lien's is rising.</P>
      <P>He said that only Chen's support rate has remained stable, which
he said will be favorable to Chen if Soong and Lien play off against
each other in the presidential election next March.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in a speech to a Taiwanese businessmen
association in Flushing, New York, on Saturday.</P>
      <P>While answering questions after the speech, he said that he does
not favor a direct confrontation with mainland China given the vast

      <P>He told more than 300 overseas Taiwanese and mainland

fact that Taiwan is an independent sovereign state and that all

    <HEADLINE>60% IN POLL DISAGREE WITH SOONG'S MAINLAND POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent poll showed that 60 percent of
respondents disagree to the mainland China policy of James Soong, the
independent presidential candidate for the election next March.</P>
      <P>The survey, with a posted error margin of 6.97 percent, was
conducted by the New Image public survey center from Nov. 30 through
Dec. 2, interviewing 1,092 qualified voters in Taiwan in order to
gauge public opinion on the mainland policies of the six presidential
hopefuls.</P>
      <P>Merely 21 percent of the people surveyed supported Soong's view
that Beijing has shown goodwill toward Taiwan by proposing the idea
of "peaceful reunification through a `one China, two systems'
formula," and it is only that Taiwan has not noticed the goodwill.</P>
      <P>Seventy-eight percent of those polled said they support the
ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate Lien Chan's mainland policy
that states Taiwan will adjust its defense strategy and opinions if
the mainland demonstrates goodwill and respect.</P>
      <P>On Chen Shui-bien's proposal of promoting active and cooperative
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in order to
develop deeper mutual trust, 72.9 percent of the respondents
registered their support.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile 45.8 percent said they support independent candidate
Hsu Hsin-liang's idea of opening the "three-links" with mainland
China with no conditions attached.</P>
      <P>Chen is the presidential candidate of Taiwan's largest opposition
party -- the Democratic Progressive Party, which has introduced to
Taiwan the concept of the "Third Way," a new political trend in
several places around the world.</P>
      <P>As to the New Party candidate Lee Ao's view that mainland China's
"one China, two systems" formula is not a bad proposal, 74 percent of
those polled expressed strong disapproval, while only 15 percent said
they support Lee's argument.</P>
      <P>Over 50 percent of the citizens polled expressed their opposition
to the pro-Taiwan independence policy of Chen Pang-chen, presidential
candidate of the Taiwan Independent Party, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the survey, both Professor Pan Hsi-tang, an expert
on mainland China affairs at Tamkang University, and Professor Lee
Teng-ko of National Chengchi University indicated that the "one
China, two systems" policy seems to have affected the popularity of
some of the presidential hopefuls.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S INCINERATORS SAID TO BE RELEASING HIGH LEVELS OF DIOXIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Incinerators in Taiwan have been releasing
an alarmingly high level of dioxin, a carcinogenic chemical, into the
air, Professor Chang Chang-chuan of National Taiwan University said
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang made the remarks after analyzing a report by the
non-profit Environmental Quality Protection Foundation.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the amount of dioxin released by the five
incinerators in Taiwan is between 9.35 and 32.09 times higher than
levels in the United States.</P>
      <P>The five incinerators are located in Neihu and Mucha in Taipei
City, Hsintien and Hsulin in Taipei County, and Wenshan in Taichung,
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that according to the report, the biggest carcinogenic
threat comes from the oldest incinerator in Neihu, with risks 494
times higher than those of the US. The second most dangerous
incinerator is the one located in Hsulin, with levels 189 fold higher
than the US, followed by the one in Mucha at 163 times higher, the
one in Hsintien at 78 fold higher, and in Wenshan at 42 times
greater.</P>
      <P>Chang said that, in addition to dioxin, other carcinogenic
chemicals such as chromium and cadmium are also present in the
emissions and that based on calculations, the cancer risk is between
9.35 times and 32.09 times of that of the US.</P>
      <P>The people of Taipei City's exposure to carcinogenic substances
is more than 2,000 times higher than the average exposure level of
people living in the United States, while the exposure level for
people living in Taipei County is more than 1,000 times higher than
that of people living in California.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMOSA INCIDENT SAID TO HAVE BEEN A SOCIAL REFORM MOVEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local political critics said that the
Formosa Incident which occurred on Dec. 10, 1979 was not purely an
opposition movement but instead a wider social reform movement.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Incident refers to the turmoil which broke out after
opposition groups rallied in Kaohsiung to mark World Human Rights
Day, resulting in the arrest of 61 political activists, including
Huang Hsin-chieh, Shih Ming-teh , Yao Chia-wen, and Lin I-hsiung. A
total of 51 activists were eventually sentenced to prison terms
ranging from a few months to life.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, one of chief activists, said all the reforms they
had proposed 20 years ago have already been passed into law, which
has not only vindicated the incident but also brought about the hope
of a brighter future for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks at a symposium jointly sponsored by the
China Times and the New Taiwan Educational and Cultural Research
Foundation to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Formosa
Incident.</P>
      <P>"We should reevaluate the Formosa Incident and its impact," Shih
said, adding that "after reviewing it, the movement should be divided
into three stages -- the organization of an opposition for the
election in 1978, the incident in Kaohsiung (Formosa Incident) in
1979, and the judgment of these events that followed."</P>
      <P>Shih said that in the first stage, an opposition force emerged to
challenge the main-stream conservative force, while the Kaohsiung
incident helped encourage the rebuilding of the Taiwanese opposition
spirit which disappeared after the incident of Feb. 28, 1947, in
which hundreds of people were killed and thousands disappeared.</P>
      <P>The public judgment of the Formosa Incident in the third stage
pointed Taiwan on a democratic course, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih went on to say that the entire platform put forth by the
anti-government activists at the time has since been totally
implemented. President Lee Teng-hui's recent redefining of cross
Taiwan strait relations as special state-to-state relationship
completely echoed their proposal made 20 years ago, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Political commentator Nan Fang-shou added that he hopes that
Formosa incident activists will put the past behind them in order to
focus their efforts on democratization in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Economic Affairs Minister
Wang Chih-kang said on Sunday that Taiwan will certainly make due
adjustments on cross-strait trade after Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks at a press conference after he returned
home from the latest round of WTO ministerial talks in Seattle from
Nov. 30 to Dec.3.</P>
      <P>Responding to remarks by a mainland Chinese delegate to the
talks, Wang also said that if there is enough goodwill shown by
Beijing, Taiwan will make wider adjustments.</P>
      <P>Mainland China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister
Shi Guangsheng said in Seattle that Taiwan would violate WTO
regulations if it continued its ban on direct trade, postal and
transport relations with the mainland, commonly referred to as the
"three direct links."</P>
      <P>He said the ROC will make some adjustments to its trade policy in
accordance with WTO regulations following its entry into the
organization, but added that "we will not consider shipping or
aviation links issues, since no existing WTO rules regulate such
issues."</P>
      <P>Wang said that as of the present time, there are no plans to
impose exclusion clauses on any of the WTO members, which must be
done before WTO accession and requires the approval of two thirds of
all WTO members.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that although the latest round of WTO talks ended
in failure amid protests, this will not affect Taiwan's bid to enter
the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>He also said that during the WTO meeting, the ROC delegation
managed to hold bilateral trade consultations with 21 countries,
including Pakistan and Bangladesh, that had never had contact with
the ROC in the past.</P>

      <P>Beijing has issued a decree to merge all
of the so-called "small newspapers" in each province into one
newspaper, and place it under the management and control of the
communist party, a human rights group said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>The decree will effectively eliminate at least 200 tabloid

      <P>The tabloids are mostly published by provincial public security
authorities and other government departments. In addition to
government-approved news and propaganda materials, they carry reports
on crimes, accidents, and other matters that can hardly be found in
staid party newspapers.</P>
      <P>The government wants to eliminate the tabloids, because their
rapid growth in recent years have reduced the influence and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bilateral ties between Macedonia and the
Republic of China are expected to become even closer after the Balkan
state held a partial election re-run Sunday, reconfirming the victory
of president-elect Boris Trajkovski, officials from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The partial re-run, held in areas populated mainly by ethnic
Albanians, took place in order to put to rest allegations of
vote-rigging in the first run of the presidential election held on
Nov. 14 in which center-right Trajkovski tied with Social Democrat
Tito Petkovski. A run-off was held on Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>In Sunday's re-run, Trajkovski was still victorious, winning by a
wide vote margin, garnering 133,667 of 161,174 votes cast.</P>
      <P>The ROC will send a congratulatory mission to Macedonia for
Trajkovski, probably to be headed by ROC envoy to Macedonia Peter
Cheng, according to MOFA officials.</P>
      <P>Trajkovski had been instrumental in pushing for formal diplomatic
ties with the ROC when he was Macedonia's deputy foreign minister.</P>
      <P>He and Macedonian Assembly President Savo Klimovski, leading a
26-member mission from Skopje, visited Taipei in early March
following the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between
the two countries on Jan. 27.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Trajkovski showed a keen interest in
Taiwan in many areas, according to Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu.
He was particularly interested in the ROC's system of government and
its Constitution, asking for a ROC 1999 Yearbook for his personal
study, Hu added.</P>
      <P>Trajkovski's victory in the presidential election will facilitate
Macedonia's push for reforms and bring it closer to the European
Union, Hu noted.</P>
      <P>Hu added that Trajkovski's victory also gives a shot in the arm
to bilateral ties between Macedonia and the ROC since Trajkovski has
always supported increased exchanges with Taiwan.</P>

Australia will continue to push hard for the further opening of

export subsidies and for cuts to trade distorting domestic
subsidies."</P>
      <P>"Agriculture was a key focus for Australia at this meeting. We
made some significant progress on developing a detailed agricultural
mandate ... but unfortunately we were not able to bridge some of the
final gaps with the US, Japan and others," Vaile said.</P>

and labor had also complicated the agenda.</P>
      <P>Government officials believe the trade talks will be renewed next

    <TEXT>
      <P>US Senator John McCain (R-AZ), a
Republican presidential contender, stressed Sunday that Washington
has to make it very clear to Communist China that any aggression
committed against Taiwan is "a violation of the `one China' policy,
which calls for peaceful reunification," adding a warning to Beijing
that the consequences of aggression against Taiwan "would be very
significant."</P>
      <P>During an interview on NBC's "Meet The Press" program, McCain

America's strategic partner as President Bill Clinton stated in 1998
when he went to Beijing. "Our strategic partner is Japan," said the
senator.</P>
      <P>The Arizona Republican, however, added he is very optimistic
that, with the advent of the Internet and the increasing flow of
information, "if we can keep the pressure on the Chinese to improve
their human rights, to stop the terrible things that they are doing
in Tibet, that we will see democracy and freedom eventually come to
China."</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, when tension ran high across the Taiwan
Straits following President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state
relations" remarks, McCain said that "if the US is to abide by the
`one China' policy, we must be no less committed to the other basic
principle that is supposed to govern our relations with China and
Taiwan -- that the reunification of China must only occur peacefully,
in other words, voluntarily."</P>
      <P>"Strategic ambiguity will not serve US interests or values in
this current crisis. We must be very clear with Beijing. The United
States will do what it must to help defend freedom and stability in
Asia," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>McCain agreed that America must engage Communist China "if we are
to maximize our influence over how that immense nation emerges as a
world power." Therefore, he has opposed efforts to revoke normal
trade relations status for mainland China or freeze US diplomacy
toward Communist China.</P>
      <P>But he said "while we should hope for and work toward the best
end -- that our relationship will influence China to become an
internationally responsible and politically enlightened country, we
must also prepare for the other contingency, that China emerges as
the primary threat to American interests and values."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S CHILD POVERTY RATE TENTH LOWEST IN WORLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's child poverty rate is the 10th
lowest in the world, while Russia's is the worst among industrialized
nations, according to a study commissioned by the United Nations
International Children's Emergency Fund.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday reported that the study on
Child Poverty Across Industrialized Nations, which covers Taiwan and
some Eastern European countries for the first time, shows Russia is
the worst among a list of 25 countries. Trailing behind Russia are
the US, the UK, Italy and Australia.</P>
      <P>The study, co-authored by Dr. Bruce Bradbury, senior research
fellow at the Social Policy Research Center at the University of New
South Wales in Sydney, used two different measures to define poverty.</P>
      <P>One method was to use the US poverty line as a common reference
converted into the currencies of each country analyzed. It is a
measure of poverty based on people's real purchasing power, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>Using this method, Taiwan's child poverty rate was calculated at
4.3 percent, compared to 20 percent for Australia and 98 percent for
Russia. Switzerland's child poverty rate was calculated at only 1.6
percent while Sweden's was 3.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The study also used a measure of relative poverty to compare how
far the poorest children have fallen behind the living standards of
the average person in a country. By this calculation, 17 percent of
Australia's children were defined as poor, compared with 6.3 percent
in Taiwan, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN SHUI-BIAN TO NAME ANNETTE LU AS RUNNING MATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to formally
name Taoyuan County chief Annette Lu on Friday as his running mate
for the year 2000 presidential election, DPP sources said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Although it has been widely rumored that Lu will be Chen's
running mate, no formal announcement of the arrangement has yet been
made.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Yi-yang, Chen's deputy campaign manager, Dec. 10
was chosen as the date to announce the Chen-Lu ticket in order to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Formosa Incident, which
occurred on Dec. 10, 1979.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Incident occurred in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung and was labeled as one of the most prominent opposition
movements in Taiwan's history. It resulted in the arrest of 61
political activists, including many who later became founders or
heavyweights of the DPP, which was formally established in 1986.</P>
      <P>As political dissidents, both Chen and Lu served prison terms for
their opposition activities.</P>
      <P>Carrying a slogan of "A New Taiwan Team, A New Hope in the
Century," the Chen-Lu ticket also signals a major re-start of the
DPP, which has played a major role in checking the ruling Kuomintang
over the past decade, said Lee.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen is currently in London where he has met with
Prof. Anthony Giddens, author of "The Third Way," a book which has
had a tremendous influence on Chen's own political outlook, as
witnessed by his slogan: "the third way politics for Taiwan: a new
political respective."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HAILS BUILDING OF 8TH NAPHTHA CRACKER AS `MILLENNIUM PROJECT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Monday said that the
building of the eighth naphtha cracker in southern Taiwan will be
"the major construction project of the nation as it enters the new
millennium. "</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in Chiayi County as he attended the signing
of a letter of intent for the NT$600 billion (US$18.93 billion)
project between Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) President Pan Wen-yen
and Chiayi County Magistrate Lee Ya-ching.</P>
      <P>The premier said that after the island's entry into the World
Trade Organization, it will face a new situation in regional economic
development, and the building of the eighth naphtha cracker will
signal the nation's economic development as it enters the next
millennium.</P>
      <P>He backed his statement by citing as an example the building of
the sixth naphtha cracker in Miaoliao, Yunlin County, pointing out
that the project helped boost prosperity in the area.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Lee lauded Siew, saying that "Chiayi-born Siew knows
the local needs best."</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the county government will keep tabs on the
environment as the work is carried out, and he invited
representatives from local communities to also take part in the
monitoring activities.</P>
      <P>The county chief was elated about the choice of the Putai Salt
Field as the location for the new naphtha cracker, saying that the
project will create jobs, increase tax revenue and enrich the county
coffers.</P>
      <P>But while Lee said the building of the naphtha cracker will help
boost across-the-board development of the county, anti-eighth naphtha
cracker activists from Putai said that Lee's welcome of the project
can be likened to "making a deal with Faustus."</P>
      <P>They said that the invitation for the "high-risk and
pollution-generating" petrochemical industry to set foot in
residential areas of Putai will jeopardize the lives and property of
the people living there.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that once the naphtha cracker sets up in Putai,
the coastal areas of Chiayi will fall prey to greedy conglomerates.
Not only will the ecology be destroyed, but lives and property will
be subject to "an unprecedented threat."</P>
      <P>They noted that the prosperity to be created by the petrochemical
complex will be "phony." With disadvantages far outnumbering the
merits of the project, they said they are not opposed to local
prosperity, but have the welfare of their progeny as their major
concern.</P>
      <P>The project was first planned by CPC and a score of other
petrochemical companies four years ago with the purpose of increasing
supplies of petrochemical materials and sharpening the competitive
edge of the domestic refinery and petrochemical industry.</P>
      <P>The group had originally wanted to build the naphtha cracker in
Nanchou, in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County, but did not obtain
approval from Pingtung County. Later, Chiayi County Magistrate Lee
and other local heavyweights showed keen interest in hosting the
project, and the site was eventually switched to Chiayi.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the petrochemical complex will also set
aside two areas to develop a hi-tech industrial park, sources said.</P>

understanding of the approvals and disapprovals of the subjects. When
there is no such understanding then the good will not be discovered
and rewarded and the bad will not be punished."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN STRESSES TAIWAN SECURITY IN BBC INTERVIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential hopeful Chen Shui-bian said in
a Chinese-language interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. on
Sunday that Taiwan's security should take precedence over all other
issues.</P>
      <P>Chen, fielded by the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to run in the March 2000 presidential election, said he
supports the establishment of any dialogue mechanism conducive to
relations between Taiwan and mainland China, so long as the island's
security is not compromised.</P>
      <P>Questioned by an audience member during the interview on whether
Taiwan will withdraw President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state
relationship" theory on cross-Taiwan Strait ties, Chen said that
although he supports the normalization of relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, the island's sovereignty is an issue
which cannot be bargained over.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that Taiwan should stand firm on its stance, and need
not dance to Beijing's tune, Chen said it is important to pool wisdom
on the issue. However, he pointed out that the British government's
agreement to the "one country, two systems" formula designed by
Beijing to rule Hong Kong is not a good example for Taiwan to follow.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the mainland should step up contacts, dialogue and
negotiations in order to reduce the possibility of misjudgments and
misunderstandings, Chen went on, but he stressed that Taiwan is an
independent sovereignty, and that the island is not a local
government of the People's Republic of China, nor is it a region or a
part of mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan does not want to be ruled by Chinese communists and
disappear from the face of the earth," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen had arrived in London earlier in the day at the start of a
two-day visit to the United Kingdom. He will proceed to Brussels and
The Hague before concluding his current three-country European tour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VEEP LIEN CALLS FOR BETTER CARE OF ELDERLY DEMENTIA PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Monday
that the government will join forces with the private sector to
offer better health care and economic security for elderly people.</P>
      <P>Lien made the pledge at the opening of an international
conference on the care of dementia patients, co-sponsored by the
Taipei City Hall and the Catholic Foundation of Alzheimer's Disease
and Related Dementia.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of local residents aged over 65 has
exceeded 1.8 million, Lien said numerous national surveys show
what elderly citizens need most is health care and economic
security.</P>
      <P>In addition to implementing a national health insurance program
to offer better health care for senior citizens, Lien said the
government is also planning a financial mechanism aimed at ensuring
economic security for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Lien, also the ruling Kuomintang candidate for the 2000
presidential election, further pointed out that the government
needs the assistance of the private sector in improving health care
and welfare services for senior citizens.</P>
      <P>Lien said he admires the Catholic foundation's efforts to help
upgrade care for elderly dementia patients over the past years.</P>
      <P>Lien revealed that the Catholic foundation is now pushing for the
establishment of an activity and day-care center for elderly dementia
patients. "The project has been listed by Pope John Paul II as one
of the Holy See's 100 most important development plans around the
world for the year 2000," Lien said, adding that he believes the
foundation's achievement will inspire the government and other
relevant agencies to pay more attention to the care and welfare
services for old dementia patients.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Taiwan became an aging society back in 1991 when the ratio of
elderly people exceeded 7 percent of its total population.</P>
      <P>By now, Ma said the number of people aged over 65 has even
surpassed 9 percent of the island's total population. "Taipei alone
has 230,000 senior citizens and 7,200 of them suffer from senile
dementia," the mayor noted.</P>
      <P>Ma said the Taipei city government will design more activities
or programs catering to the need and taste of the elderly and will
also help unlicensed elderly people care centers improve their
facilities and management so that they can acquire legal operation
permits as early as possible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China official urged Japan on
Monday to help lead the economic rebound in Asia, and expressed the
hope that Japan will continue to support and take part in the
quake-reconstruction efforts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-chin, chairman of East Asian Relations Association,
made the remarks at an ROC-Japanese Economic Conference which opened
here on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin first expressed appreciation for Japan's assistance in the
wake of the devastating earthquake that hit the island on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>He noted that his Japanese counterpart, Reijiro Hattori, chairman
of Japan's Interchange Association, had delivered a letter from
Japanese Primer Minister Keizo Obuchi to ROC President Lee Teng-hui
in September to express sympathy toward the Taiwan people, and also
acknowledged the extensive donations made by the Japanese people to
the Taiwan quake victims.</P>
      <P>Lin urged more cooperation between the ROC and Japan to help
revive the Asian economy, adding that Taiwan enjoyed economic growth
of just 4.7 percent last year as a result of the regional economic
storm.</P>
      <P>Due to the massive quake, he said Taiwan's economic growth this
year will be adjusted downward from 5.7 percent to 5.4 percent, but
added that growth is expected to reach 6 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while Japan should take the lead in reviving the
economy, the economic rebound should not be shouldered by one single
country alone, and that the ROC and Japan could step up cooperation
to achieve an early revival.</P>
      <P>He suggested that more cooperation projects should be tabled and
discussed at the two-day conference.</P>
      <P>Lin also expressed hope that Japan will support and take part in
Taiwan's reconstruction efforts, saying that the earthquake has
resulted in massive damage to houses, public buildings,
transportation and the power supply system in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hattori, who heads the Japanese delegation, also expressed his
admiration for the rapid reconstruction efforts made by the Taiwan
government and people.</P>
      <P>He also said that trade relations between the two nations are
smooth, with two-way trade in the first 10 months of this year
reaching US$34.18 billion, up 13 percent from the same period of last
year.</P>
      <P>He noted that business and technology cooperation between the two
nations in semiconductors and liquid crystal technology also showed
dramatic growth, although Japanese investment in Taiwan in the first
eight months declined by 24 percent from the same period of last
year.</P>
      <P>He also admired the rapid rebound of Taiwan's electronics
industry after the temblor.</P>
      <P>Participants in the conference included officials from Japanese
government agencies who attended as observers, and ROC government
officials.</P>
      <P>Topics under discussion included cooperation relations under the
framework of international organizations such as World Trade
Organization, and the protection of intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>The economic conference has been held each year alternately in
Japan and the ROC since the two nations severed diplomatic ties in
1976.</P>

      <P>Lin urged more cooperation between the ROC and Japan to help
revive the Asian economy, adding that Taiwan enjoyed economic growth
of just 4.7 percent last year as a result of the regional economic
storm.</P>
      <P>Due to the massive quake, he said Taiwan's economic growth this
year will be adjusted downward from 5.7 percent to 5.4 percent, but
added that growth is expected to reach 6 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while Japan should take the lead in reviving the
economy, the economic rebound should not be shouldered by one single
country alone, and that the ROC and Japan could step up cooperation
to achieve an early revival.</P>
      <P>He suggested that more cooperation projects should be tabled and
discussed at the two-day conference.</P>
      <P>Lin also expressed hope that Japan will support and take part in
Taiwan's reconstruction efforts, saying that the earthquake has
resulted in massive damage to houses, public buildings,
transportation and the power supply system in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hattori, who heads the Japanese delegation, also expressed his
admiration for the rapid reconstruction efforts made by the Taiwan
government and people.</P>
      <P>He also said that trade relations between the two nations are
smooth, with two-way trade in the first 10 months of this year
reaching US$34.18 billion, up 13 percent from the same period of last
year.</P>
      <P>He noted that business and technology cooperation between the two
nations in semiconductors and liquid crystal technology also showed
dramatic growth, although Japanese investment in Taiwan in the first
eight months declined by 24 percent from the same period of last
year.</P>
      <P>He also admired the rapid rebound of Taiwan's electronics
industry after the temblor.</P>
      <P>Participants in the conference included officials from Japanese
government agencies who attended as observers, and ROC government
officials.</P>
      <P>Topics under discussion included cooperation relations under the
framework of international organizations such as World Trade
Organization, and the protection of intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>The economic conference has been held each year alternately in
Japan and the ROC since the two nations severed diplomatic ties in
1972.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone
(EPZ) is considering using helicopters for its transport operations
to increase the competitiveness of the businesses based in the
complex, the Kaohsiung EPZ Branch Administration said on Monday.</P>
      <P>As most of the more-than 90 factories headquartered in the
Kaohsiung EPZ in the southern Taiwan city are from the high
value-added semiconductor and electronics industries, the
administration said helicopters are very suitable for quick
transportation of their "light and small" products.</P>
      <P>The administration admitted that the planned move is due to
increasing demand from companies for shorter delivery times. Delivery
time for cargoes of electronic products has already been reduced to
about three days from the original five days, it noted, but added
that more and more businesses are now demanding next-day delivery.</P>
      <P>As Kaohsiung Port, Taiwan's largest, is close by the
Kaohsiung EPZ, the administration said it will soon apply for
government approval to run a short-haul helicopter cargo and
passenger transport business. Enterprises in the EPZ complex will be
able to use their rooftops as landing pads, so additional
infrastructure will be unnecessary, it pointed out.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan kiln is creating
a ceramic vase that will be the largest of its kind in the world, the
Guinness Book of World Records Museum in the central Taiwan city of
Taichung announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>The museum said it has approved an application by Snake Kiln in
Shuili, a mountainous township in Taichung County, to create a
6-meter-high thrown vase.</P>
      <P>According to the museum, the largest thrown vase on record is one
measuring 5.66 meters in height which was completed on Feb. 10, 1996
by Ray Sparks of the ESK Creative Clay Co. in Queensland, Australia.</P>
      <P>Tai Sheng-yi, chairman of the Taichung museum, said the unique
hand-made vase will have a special twin-mouth design, which in some
ways resembles an ancient Greek amphora with a double spout.</P>
      <P>Two veteran potters at Snake Kiln will work together to create
the vase, while the company's president, Lin Kuo-lung, will design a
larger-than-usual traditional kiln to fire the piece.</P>
      <P>The Guinness Book of World Records stipulates that no more than
three people can be involved in the production of a record-setting
ceramic item to be listed in the book.</P>
      <P>A ceremony marking the start of the vase's creation was held on
Monday morning at the Taichung Guinness Book of Records Museum, at
which the three craftsmen were present.</P>
      <P>The work is scheduled to be completed by the first half of March

      <P>MOTC statistics indicate that in the past decade, TRA's passenger

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER DEFENDS REPLACEMENT OF TROOPS WITH COAST GUARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei on Monday once
again defended the government's decision to replace marines stationed
in the Pratas (Tungsha) and Spratly (Nansha) islands in the South
China Sea with coast guard officers.</P>
      <P>Tang stressed at a joint meeting of the Legislative Yuan's legal,
interior, defense and financial affairs committees that the
replacement will in no way affect the Republic of China's sovereign
claim to the two remote island groups.</P>
      <P>The legislative committee meeting was originally designed to
screen a Ministry of National Defense-proposed bill on the
establishment of a coast guard administration to take charge of
coastal patrols and anti-crime operations in offshore areas. However,
lawmakers focused their interpellations on the so-called "Tungsha,
Nansha troops withdrawal" issue.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party Legislator Hau Lung-pin said the government
should not lightly replace marines with law-enforcement coast guard
personnel because such a move may mislead the world into thinking
that the ROC has forsaken its sovereign claim to the two island
groups.</P>
      <P>In response, Tang said a change in garrison personnel does not
imply abandonment of sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Noting that disputes in the Tungsha and Nansha areas are mostly
related to fishing issues, Tang said replacement of marines with
coast guard officers will facilitate a solution to those disputes.</P>
      <P>For instance, Tang said, 15 mainland Chinese fishing boats have
illegally operated in the 12-nautical mile area of Taiping Island, an
ROC-held islet of the disputed Spratlys group, over the past week. To
avoid causing international disputes, Tang said, ROC marines
stationed there have refrained from taking action to disperse the
intruding mainland fishing boats. "And this is an important reason
behind our decision to replace marines with coast guard officers to
facilitate handling of such disputes," the minister added.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan and mainland China, several other Southeast
Asian countries -- the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Brunei -- also claim sovereignty to the Spratlys, either in whole or
in part.</P>
      <P>Tang said the circumstances under which the ROC decided to
station troops on Taiping Island have changed significantly. "The
Spratlys have become a complicated and delicate international
political issue," Tang said, adding that the world community
generally hopes that the issue can be resolved through negotiations,
not by military means.</P>
      <P>Even if Taiwan continues to station military personnel on Tungsha
and Nansha islands, Tang said he does not think that Taiwan will be
able to defend the two islands now under its control because of the
geographical distance between the islands and Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Tang said, he hopes the legislature will pass all
related bills as soon as possible to pave the way for the
inauguration of a new coast guard administration to take charge of
coastal patrols, fishing dispute investigations and crackdowns on
smuggling of drugs, firearm and humans in offshore areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US, CANADIAN OFFICIALS CONCERNED OVER CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of Taiwan's opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said on Monday that US and
Canadian officials are concerned over the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and Taiwan's 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung said they also believe that Taiwan and mainland
China may boost mutual cooperation once they join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), and that their WTO participation might benefit
the two sides, which have been hostile to each other for decades.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at a press conference in San Francisco at
the end of a North American visit. He was accompanied by the DPP's
representative to the United States, Chiu Yi-jen.</P>
      <P>Revealing that he had contacted various US and Canadian officials
during his visit, Lin said that although Washington has been closely
monitoring Taiwan's upcoming presidential election, he felt that it
appears little interested in the eventual outcome.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that Washington's view is that the campaign is an
internal affair of Taiwan in which only the Taiwan people have the
right to be involved. He added that the US authorities have indicated
that Washington will not adjust its Taiwan policy unless the new
Republic of China president alters the existing political policies of
the country.</P>
      <P>In addition to meetings with government officials, the party
chairman also held talks with members of American think tanks and
representatives of overseas Chinese groups on issues centering on
cross-strait relations, Taiwan's political development, and the March
presidential election, according to Chiu.</P>
      <P>Asked about his opinion of reports that the DPP will harm
cross-strait relations if it becomes the ruling party, Lin said that
is the wrong image of his party, and one which has been created under
the Kuomintang's long-term administration.</P>
      <P>The DPP will follow the country's consistent cross-strait policy,
and will not make a "dramatic, extreme" change once it takes the
reins of power in Taiwan, Lin stressed, noting that no US politicians
have released any special warning or concern over such a scenario.</P>
      <P>He declared that the DPP has never changed its stance that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should build up ties in order to
mutually support each other and seek prosperity through contact and
negotiation.</P>
      <P>Lin arrived in San Francisco from Houston on Monday. He was
scheduled to leave for home later in the day after meeting with
leaders of Taiwanese organizations in the Bay area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANCES OF ANTHRAX OUTBREAK UNLIKELY: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>None of a group of 31 people who had contact
with a horse which died recently of anthrax have been infected with
the deadly disease, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The DOH had collected blood samples from the 31 people, staff
members at the Plum Flowers Horse-Riding Club in the Taipei suburb of
Peitou and the Livestock Health Research Institute in the northern
town of Tamsui for tests shortly after a mare kept at the equestrian
club died of anthrax on Nov. 24.</P>
      <P>"Blood tests show that none of them have been infected with
Bacillus Anthrax, the bacterium that causes anthrax," said Dr. Tu
Shing-jer, deputy director-general of the DOH's Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control.</P>
      <P>Tu said this initial test result indicates that the possibility
of an anthrax outbreak has been reduced.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, as the disease's incubation period can last for up
to one month, we'll arrange for these persons to undergo further
tests," Tu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, blood tests on 71 other people who had
visited the Plum Flowers club before and after the anthrax-infected
mare's death are still on-going. "The test results are expected to
come out in the near future," he said, adding that relevant agencies
are still investigating the source of the mare's infection.</P>
      <P>Anthrax is an acute infectious disease normally found in certain
livestock and wild animals, and sometimes humans. It is known to
affect the skin, the respiratory system or the intestinal tract,
depending on the mode of transmission.</P>
      <P>The last reported episodes of anthrax in animals and humans in
Taiwan were said to be in 1953 and 1972, respectively.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following reports that Taiwan's incinerators
are spewing out dioxin levels which are hundreds of times the amounts
considered safe in developed countries, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) promised on Monday to bring waste emissions up to
standard by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The EPA said that of the island's eight existing incinerators,
five meet with local environmental protection standards in terms of
dioxin emissions, and the other three will be brought up to standard
by the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>The EPA pointed out that Taiwan had no limitations on emissions
of dioxin -- a carcinogenic gas generated by burning plastics -- when
it built its first incinerator in the Taipei City suburb of Neihu,
but increasing environmental awareness later prompted the EPA to set
a limit of 0.1 ng TEQ\Nm3 on Oct. 6 this year, by which time there
were already eight incinerators running in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Incinerators at Shulin and Hsintien, both in Taipei County, met
with the O.1 ng standard after being retrofitted with active carbon
injectors, while two others in Neihu, Mucha, both in Taipei City and
one in Taichung, are under the process of renovation and are expected
to be brought up to the new standard when work is finished in June,
2000, said the EPA.</P>
      <P>Another three newly built incinerators, one in Peitou, Taipei
City, and two in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, were designed to
meet the strictest limitations in the world. In particular, the EPA
went on, the two in Kaohsiung which were completed in March and
October, have dioxin emissions of 0.003ng 0.0017ng, respectively,
said the EPA.</P>
      <P>The EPA attributed the huge volume of dioxin in Taiwan's
atmosphere to the large amount of plastic waste generated in daily
life, and urged the public to separate dioxin-producing waste from
other flammable waste as a way of cutting emissions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER AGREES TO ACCEPT RESIGNATION OF HEAD OF AGRICULTURE COUNCIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew agreed on Monday to
accept the resignation of Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the Council of
Agriculture (COA) after failing to persuade Peng to stay in his
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>After meeting with Peng for about 40 minutes, the premier agreed
to accept Peng's resignation letter which was expected to be
presented to Siew early on Tuesday morning, said government spokesman
Chao Yi.</P>
      <P>Peng's successor will be named after Peng's resignation becomes
effective, said Chao.</P>
      <P>Peng announced his decision to quit on Nov. 30, after the Cabinet
decided, despite his opposition, to allow farmers to build houses on
their newly acquired farmland.</P>
      <P>He warned the ruling Kuomintang against wooing farmers' support
in the presidential election at the cost of the country's long-term
agriculture policy.</P>
      <P>In the first press conference after his resignation announcement,
Peng defended on Monday his objection to the lifting of the
house-building ban, saying it will undo the government's
long-established policy of "farmland owned by farmers only and used
for farming exclusively."</P>
      <P>Allowing farmers to build houses on newly acquired farmland is
tantamount to transforming the island's farmland into de-facto
construction land, while allowing it be exempt from construction
regulations and virtually free from taxes, said Peng.</P>
      <P>Doing away with the ban is like opening a Pandora's box, and
although might rise the price of farmland in the short term, it will
dampen the price of construction land to the detriment of the
country's economy in the long term, he said.</P>
      <P>Disputing criticism that the COA shapes the country's agriculture
policy in air-conditioned offices without consulting with the
rank-and-file farmers, Peng said his council has organized
presentation meetings around the island to sell its policy and has
won support from farmers, especially in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most of the opposition to the ban comes from southern Taiwan,
where farmers, as well as the banks run by farmers associations, are
trying to use farmland commercially to solve the problems of a lack
of liquidity faced by farmers' banks.</P>
      <P>"Financial problems should be sorted out by financial policy
rather than by agricultural policy," said Peng.</P>
      <P>As a politically appointed official, Peng said, he should be
responsible for what he preaches and has no reason to hang on to his
job when his policies are rejected and his ideas discarded.</P>
      <P>After leaving the administration, the professor-turned-politician
said he will return to teaching at National Chunghsing University
where he served as dean of the Agricultural School before being
offered the job as COA chairman in 1997.</P>
      <P>Although at odds with Siew over the government's agricultural
policy, Peng reiterated his support for the premier's candidacy for
vice president in the general election.</P>
      <P>Peng said that if asked, he would stump for Siew and his running
mate Vice President Lien Chan, the KMT's candidate for president, in
the 2000 presidential election.</P>

calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE PAPERS REPORT ON ROC PRESIDENT'S DESIRE TO VISIT JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major Japanese newspapers on Tuesday gave
prominent coverage to reports that Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui hopes to visit Japan next year.</P>
      <P>President Lee told a group of Japanese visitors on Monday that he
hopes to attend the 12th Asia Outlook Forum to be held in Japan's
Nagano prefecture in December 2000.</P>
      <P>Nearly all influential Japanese dailies, including Yomiuri
Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun, Nihhon Keizai Shimbun and
Tokyo Shimbun, carried reports of Lee's statements on their
international news pages on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Sankei Shimbun, a major business daily, quoted Lee as saying
that if he manages to attend next year's Asia Outlook Forum, he will
deliver a keynote speech on Taiwan's political reforms and
democratization in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Lee, a graduate of Kyoto University, has long hoped to visit his
alma mater. However, he has been unable to visit Japan because of
strong opposition from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee's presidential term will expire in May 2000. When the Asia
Outlook Forum, an annual gathering of scholars, business executives
and political and economic analysts from Taiwan and Japan, holds its
next meeting in December 2000, Lee will no longer be the ROC's head
of state.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether Lee can realize his
wish to attend the 2000 Asia Outlook forum because Beijing has said
that it does not want to see Lee visit Japan even after his
retirement from the presidency. Lee will still be chairman of the
ROC's ruling Kuomintang after his presidential tenure ends.</P>
      <P>The Asia Outlook Forum, founded in 1989, is aimed at pooling the
wisdom of the elite members of the business, political and academic
communities in Taiwan and Japan to help boost substantive bilateral
ties as well as regional prosperity and stability.</P>
      <P>The forum holds its annual meeting alternately in Taiwan and
Japan. Its 11th conference was held from Dec. 4-5 in the southern
Taiwanese city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The Japanese visitors whom President Lee met on Monday were
participants to the just-concluded 11th Asia Outlook Forum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOW CRIME RATE AMONG FOREIGN LABORERS IN TAIPEI CITY: DBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The crime rate among foreign laborers in
metropolitan Taipei is low, but many of them do not have clean bills
of health, the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DBAS)
of the Taipei City Hall reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Department tallies show that the city had 21,882 foreign laborers
as of the end of October this year, most of whom were from the
Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Taipei's foreign laborers accounted for 7.51 percent of the total
number of blue-collar foreign workers in Taiwan and made up about 50
percent of Taipei's overall foreign population at the time the
statistics were compiled.</P>
      <P>According to the municipal statistical agency, 70 percent of
Taipei's foreign laborers were housemaids or family helpers.</P>
      <P>The department further said a total of 1,615 people were involved
in alien-related law enforcement cases in Taipei last year, 1,114 of
whom were foreign laborers, accounting for 68.98 percent of the
total. The figure marked an increase of 300 people from the 1997
level.</P>
      <P>In the first 10 months of this year, 720 foreign laborers were
involved in law enforcement cases, accounting for 59.85 percent of
total alien-related judicial episodes.</P>
      <P>Ninety percent of foreign laborer-related cases fell under the
category of violations of the Employment Service Law, and few were
criminal cases, according to city government tallies.</P>
      <P>In 1997, 22 foreign laborers were accused of having committed
criminal activities in Taipei, compared to nine in 1998 and 10 in the
first 10 months of this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four foreign laborers were victims of criminal cases
reported in Taipei in 1997, compared to eight in 1998 and only one in
the January-October period of 1999.</P>
      <P>DBAS officials said all these figures indicate that the major
impact of foreign laborers is in the city's job market, not in its
public order.</P>
      <P>The officials further pointed out that foreign laborer-related
health management should be improved. The city's health agencies
conducted a total of 34,010 physical checkups on foreign laborers in
1998, and 421 of them, or 1.24 percent, failed to meet requirements.</P>
      <P>In the first 10 months of this year, the failure rate surged to
1.72 percent, up 0.68 percent from the same period of last year. The
failure rate was the highest among Indonesian laborers, and 90
percent of those who failed to obtain clean bills of health were
found to have parasites in their intestines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TENTATIVELY AGREES TO SELL AIM-120 MISSILES TO ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has tentatively agreed to
sell AIM-120 advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles to the
Republic of China, the Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH)
announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shen Yuan-tai, deputy chief executive of the AFGH's Weaponry
Acquisition Office, told a routine news conference at the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) that the United States has agreed to integrate
the software of AIM-120 missiles into the firing control system of
the ROC's F-16 jet fighters.</P>
      <P>"The move indicates that we have obtained `admission tickets' to
enter the realm of the sophisticated missile system," Shen explained,
adding that the ROC Air Force expects to acquire the new missiles in
the near future.</P>
      <P>The radar-guided active missile is 3.65 meters long, with a
diameter of 1,078 mm. It weighs 157 kilograms, has a range of 50
kilometers, and is installed mainly on the US-made F-16 fighter.</P>
      <P>Shen's remarks came amid reports that Russia will sell modified
R-77 missiles -- under the export name of RVV-AE -- to mainland China
within the next year.</P>
      <P>According to the US Defense News, the R-77, and its export
variant the RVV-AE, are more sophisticated missiles in the AIM-120
class. The use of an active-radar seeker, rather than a semi-active
radar seeker, allows the launch aircraft to engage more than one
target at a time.</P>
      <P>The defense weekly also said the ROC Air Force has two active,
medium-range air-to-air missiles -- the French-made MICA and the
Taiwan-developed Sky Sword II. Neither, however, are integrated for
use on the 150 F-16s purchased by Taiwan from the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Defense News quoted Russian sources as saying that
Russia and mainland China have not yet signed a formal contract on
the RVV-AE deal. The report also made no mention of the number of
RVV-AEs that mainland China plans to purchase, saying only that the
RVV-AE deal may be part of mainland China's SU-30 MKK Russian-made
jet fighter procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, a senior MND intelligence officer
noted that the ROC military has always closely monitored mainland
China's missile development and deployment plans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO WTO PROGRESS LIKELY UNTIL AFTER US ELECTION: CANADIAN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There will be no real progress on World
Trade Organization issues until after the next US election, said
Canada's Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew on Monday.</P>
      <P>The minister made the comments during a media briefing on the
failure of last week's WTO meetings in Seattle, which were supposed
to set the agenda for the next round of trade talks. Instead, the 135
member countries went home empty-handed after deadlocking over farm
subsidies and labor standards.</P>
      <P>Pettigrew said Canada must now work behind the scenes to try to
establish a new way of negotiating trade issues.</P>
      <P>"You know there is no fast track authority in the United States,
there's a presidential election, it would be very difficult to really
get strong movement forward before that election takes place," he
said.</P>
      <P>"But a lot of work can be done in the meantime, and that's what
(WTO Director General) Mike Moore has to do right now."</P>
      <P>Pettigrew noted that the next round of talks, on agriculture and
services, will go ahead as scheduled in January. He also hinted that
Canada would lower or abolish the remaining tariffs on goods produced
by the world's poorest countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is making a major shift to the
promotion of free trade with the Asia-Pacific region through
bilateral agreements after failing to accomplish further trade
liberalization at the ministerial conference during World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle last week.</P>
      <P>Trade Minister Mark Vaile said there was little hope for progress
at the global level until after the US presidential elections in
November 2000, adding the delay in reaching an agreement at the WTO
talks could cost Australia up to US$15 billion in new exports.</P>
      <P>Australia's Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson on Monday
criticized US President Bill Clinton for allowing domestic political
considerations interfere with the talks.</P>
      <P>Anderson's predecessor was even more blunt in his criticism of
Clinton. "The sooner he, if not the administration, departs the trade
policy arena, the sooner the WTO will have a chance to re-rail for
the millennium round," Tim Fisher told reporters here.</P>
      <P>Vaile said Australia will bank on the ministerial meeting of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum next year and on free trade
discussions between Australia, New Zealand and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, hoping these talks provide opportunities for
regional and bilateral advances in free trade.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Presdient Bill Clinton warned Monday
that Russia will pay a heavy price for its rocket and artillery
attacks on largely civilian areas in Chechnya and also criticized
Communist China for its crackdown on peaceful Falun Gong followers.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the presentation of the Eleanor Roosevelt Human
Rights Awards, Clinton pointed out that in addition to Russia,
another country about which the United States must continue to
express human rights concerns is mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although Communist China is progressing and opening to the world
in many welcome ways, including its entry into the World Trade
Organization, "its progress still is being held back by the
government's response to those who test the limits of freedom. A
troubling example, of course, is the detention by Chinese authorities
of adherents of the Falun Gong movement," said the president.</P>
      <P>Clinton added that the Beijing regime's targets are not political
dissidents, and even though the practices and beliefs of Falun Gong
followers are unfamiliar to Americans, "the principle still surely
must be the same- freedom of conscience and freedom of association."</P>
      <P>"And our interests surely must be the same -- seeing China
maintain stability and growth at home by meeting, not stifling, the
growing demands of its people for openness and accountability,"
stressed Clinton.</P>

      <P>Australia and North Korea have agreed to
hold talks in Pyongyang in February to discuss normalizing their
diplomatic relations, which were broken by the withdrawal of North
Korean diplomats from Canberra almost 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Seoul, the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday

confirming the talks were being planned and saying that Australia has
"always insisted that North Korea must prove its credentials as a
responsible international citizen before we move forward in any
tangible way to the resumption of diplomatic relations."</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the talks were proposed by North Korean
Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun when he wrote to the Australian

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves had
reached a record high of US$103.53 billion as of the end of November,
the Central Bank of China (CBC) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said it is the forth consecutive month that the
figure has topped US$100 billion and the third consecutive month that
a record has been set. The reserves are also the third highest in the
world, behind only those of Japan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that foreign exchange reserves in November
showed a dramatic increase of US$15.46 billion from the same period
of last year, or the 17th consecutive month in which an increase has
been recorded.</P>
      <P>They attributed the record high to the continued increase of
trade surplus, the cancellation of foreign exchange deposits by
depositors, and the continued inflow into the stock market of foreign
capital.</P>
      <P>Foreign exchange reserves in August, September and October
registered US$101.13 billion, US$101.65 billion and US$102.67

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An overseas Chinese holding both Republic of
China and US passports on Tuesday urged the ROC government to end the
practice of making a note of the ROC passport number in a holder's US
passport after stamping both passports when they enter or leave the
ROC.</P>
      <P>The overseas Chinese, surnamed Chen, made the demand at a public
hearing organized by Legislator Ying Chih-hung.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that some overseas Chinese have had their passports
confiscated by US immigration officers when they re-enter the United
States because the notes reveal that the passport holder is breaking
the US law which stipulates that it is forbidden for a US citizen to
own a passport other than the one issued by the US government.</P>
      <P>At present, the ROC government recognizes dual nationality for
overseas Chinese, and those who show both ROC and US passports when
entering or leaving the ROC have both their passports stamped by ROC
immigration officers, and their ROC passport number is noted in their
US passport.</P>
      <P>Ku Fu-chang, director-general of the Bureau of Consular Affairs
under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that he is aware of the
situation, but has yet to receive a formal complaint on the matter.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that ROC immigration officers stamp both
passports and note the ROC passport number in the US passport only
when specifically asked to do so by the passport holder.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the National Police Administration, the Bureau
of Immigration, and the Civil Aviation Police Bureau attending the

(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices dropped 0.9 percent on
Tuesday as the market continued to experience consolidation due to a
lack of confidence among investors.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index closed
67.41 points lower at 7,827.05, and turnover narrowed to NT$115.19
(US$3.64 billion), with 2.40 billion shares changing hands.</P>
      <P>According to dealers, the reduced volume, which was a result of
defensive investors who were bracing for possible selling by
institutions and fund managers, was not enough to push up the index.</P>
      <P>Many institutional investors have already completed their
investment portfolios for next year and there is no reason for them
to trade in the market before the year-end holidays, the dealers
said.</P>
      <P>Foreign fund managers were also advised to adjust their
investment strategies in some Asian markets, including Taiwan, to
avoid any potential computer malfunctions caused by the Y2K rollover.</P>
      <P>All of the eight major stock categories closed lower, with the
cement sector suffering the heaviest losses of 1.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Financial shares and foodstuff issues both reported 1.5-percent
losses, while electronics issues fell 0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Decliners outnumbered gainers 343 to 131, with 76 shares
remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market moved down 3.01 points to close at

      <P>All TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index

      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for December moved down 59 points to close at

59 points to finish at 7,880, with 155 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for next March dipped 83 points to close at
7,912, with seven contract transactions, while those for next June
shed 74 points to close at 7,976, with two contract transactions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S NUCLEAR SUB EFFORTS SAID TO BE LINKED TO TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are indications that Communist China
has started to build its new-generation nuclear-powered and
nuclear-armed strategic submarine (SSBN) and that by constructing the
Type 094 submarine, it is trying to prevent the United States from
interfering in the Taiwan Strait, according to a recent issue of the
Toronto-based Kanwa News.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted a Chinese official report as saying General
Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Military Commission of the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, recently visited
HuLu Dao Shipyard where the SSBN is apparently being constructed.</P>
      <P>Judging from the ranking officials that accompanied him, the
inspection was seen as being related to the construction of the SSBN,
the military intelligence report said.</P>
      <P>It noted that among the 200 officials who accompanied Zhang, were
the elite of the Chinese army and the military scientific and
technical development industry. Also present were the heads of the
Navy, the nuclear industry, the aerospace industry, the General
Staff, and the heads of several committees related to industries
engaged in military research.</P>
      <P>During the inspection, Zhang emphasized that the shipyard is
facing an arduous task, but that production, especially military
production, must be completed in time with a good quality, Kanwa
quoted Zhang.</P>
      <P>Kanwa quoted a Western source as saying China had originally
planned to start construction of the second generation SSBN in 1997,
but because the ground trail of its nuclear power system had not been
completed, it turned to improving the IA-class SSBN.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that the improved IA-class SSBNs have
already been rearmed with 12 JL2 SLBM, in order to strengthen the
nuclear deterrence against the United States.</P>
      <P>Zhang's inspection shows once again that China attaches great
importance to nuclear deterrence forces, with which Beijing hopes to
prevent the US from intervening in the Taiwan problem, the Kanwa News
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FARMERS STAGE PROTEST TO URGE PASSAGE OF FARMLAND REFORM BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Waving banners urging the government to lift
restrictions on cropland use, farmers from central and southern
Taiwan staged a mass protest in downtown Taipei on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Led by officials of the Taiwan Provincial Farmers Association,
more than 10,000 farmers from 21 counties and cities gathered at the
plaza outside the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to demand that the
government permit free purchase of farmland to help local farmers
associations resolve their financial problems. Only the counties of
Hsinchu and Miaoli were not represented.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Vice Chairman Ling Shiang-nung and
Vice Finance Minister Sean C. Chen met the protesters at the plaza on
behalf of the government, with Lin vowing that the government will
fully protect farmers' interests.</P>
      <P>More than 30 lawmakers, including Legislative Yuan Vice President
Wang Jin-pyng, were also present on the occasion to show their
support for the farmers.</P>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate Hsu Hsin-liang and his
running mate Chu Hui-liang also attended the event, and declared that
they back the government's planned move to allow the free purchase of
farmland for construction use in order to protect farmers' rights and
interests.</P>
      <P>A declaration distributed by the Taiwan Provincial Farmers
Association made public four major appeals from the farmers to the
government:</P>
      <P>1. Totally ease restrictions on the purchase of farmland;</P>
      <P>2. Lift restrictions on the division of farmland;</P>
      <P>3. Permit housing development on farmland; and</P>
      <P>4. Draw up a feedback plan for farmers whose cropland is assigned
for farm use only;</P>
      <P>Some 3,000 of the farmers, accompanied by Lin and Hsu, later
marched to the Legislative Yuan to deliver a petition in support of
the farmland use reform bill.</P>
      <P>The legislature is slated to screen the bill on Wednesday and
Thursday.</P>
      <P>President and Kuomintang Chairman Lee Teng-hui has been reported
to have allegedly agreed with the package, prompting COA Chairman
Peng Tso-kuei to resign last week.</P>
      <P>Peng, a scholar-turned-Cabinet member, said he stands firm on his
stance that the nation's farmland should be reserved for farm use
only. "Lifting restrictions on building housing on cropland will be
like opening Pandora's box, and will cause endless damage to future
generations," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Peng officially left his post at the COA on Tuesday morning after
his resignation was approved by Premier Vincent Siew the previous
evening.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the local academic spectrum expressed strong
opposition to the government's planned farmland use liberalization
package at a seminar sponsored by National Taiwan University (NTU),
voicing concern that allowing housing construction on farmland will
lead to the abuse of cropland by special interest groups and that
farmers themselves will suffer the most damage.</P>
      <P>Citing Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, NTU Professor
M.C. Chen pointed out that Taiwan's food production will be greatly
affected if construction on farmland is allowed, and that Taiwan's
cropland will become even more polluted by waste water discharged
from additional households.</P>
      <P>C.C. Huang and C.J. Liu, both professors from National Chungshing
University, claimed that local farmers associations' wishful thinking
that the farmland reform bill will allow them to resolve their
financial troubles is killing the goose which lays the golden eggs,
the results of which will be even harder for farmers to take.</P>
      <P>Protection of farmland should go hand in hand with the
development of national territory, and relevant measures should be
worked out to effectively regulate the use of cropland, they said.</P>
      <P>As the government's past policy of "industrialization in the
countryside" has already caused disorder among the island's rural
areas, they warned the government against its planned move to
liberalize the use of farmland, pointing out that it will have a
terrible impact on Taiwan's long-term agricultural development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND KEEPING TABS ON BEIJING'S DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR SUBMARINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
keeping tabs on the development of nuclear-power submarines in
mainland China, an MND official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chao Lien-ti, assistant deputy chief of the ministry's General
Staff for Intelligence, said at a regular press briefing that the MND
has kept abreast of Beijing's development of nuclear weapons for more
than a decade, noting that it published articles about mainland
Chinese development of submarines and missiles launched from
submarines as far back as 1986.</P>
      <P>Judging from the progress of its development, Chao said, it is
certain that Beijing will complete the deployment of nuclear-powered
submarines by 2005.</P>
      <P>Chao made the remarks in the wake of a Washington Times report on
Monday that Beijing is beginning work on a new submarine that will be
targeted against US nuclear forces and will carry missile warheads
built with stolen US nuclear technology.</P>
      <P>Chao said that Beijing has developed five "Han-class" submarines,
one "Hsia-class" submarine, and is now working on two new models with
the code numbers 093 and 094, and added that the MND is keeping
abreast of developments on the mainland as they unfold.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times also said that Beijing will start
construction in the next several weeks on 094-type missile submarine.</P>
      <P>The JL-2 missile which will be installed on the 094 submarines
is based on the DF-31 International ballistic missile, but has a
longer range of around 8,000 kilometers and would be able to reach
the west coast of the United States if fired from the southeastern
coast of mainland China. Each submarine will be armed with between 12
and 16 warheads.</P>
      <P>Chao said that the MND believes that the submarines are intended
as a strategic deterrent, and to provide the mainland with a second
strike capability, and will not target Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a legislator from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party on Tuesday claimed that the recent Washington Times
reports are aimed at influencing Taiwan's 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Trong Tsai, the reports on the
construction of the 094 submarine are untrue, but he noted that the 
authoritative Jane's Navy Review reported that Beijing had begun to
develop 094 submarines almost 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he suspected that one of Taiwan's presidential
candidates may have orchestrated the reports to drum up voter support
by employing US public relations companies to prod US officials
into speaking to certain news media. He did not elaborate, either on
the identity of the candidate.</P>
      <P>But he urged the presidential candidate not to play with fire as
the people of Taiwan are getting used to Beijing's military
intimidation and verbal attacks. Moreover, he went on, Beijing has
already stated clearly that it will not use military intimidation as
a means of intimidating Taiwan's voters as it did in the last
presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC ANNOUNCES OIL PRICE HIKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) on Tuesday
announced this year's sixth oil price hike, saying that prices will
be increased by an average of 2.99 percent.</P>
      <P>The CPC said that prices for gasoline and diesel will be raised
by NT$0.4 per liter from midnight on Tuesday, while the price of
fuel oil will be hiked by NT$394 per kiloliter.</P>
      <P>The CPC also announced an increase in the price of natural gas at
an average rate of 2.94 percent, but added that only industrial
customers, electricity generating customers and co-generation
customers will be subject to the hike, while domestic customers will
not see an increase.</P>
      <P>The CPC explained that the price rise is necessary to keep pace
with the continuing increases in international crude oil prices.
Purchasing costs for the CPC in November climbed to US$22.21 per
barrel, a new high since February, 1997, and almost US$4 up on the
October price.</P>
      <P>This will be the CPC's sixth price hike since the beginning of
the year.</P>
      <P>Because the Commission of National Corporations under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the authority which supervises national
corporations including the CPC, stipulates that the upper limit for
oil price raises in three months is 6 percent, the CPC is not
expected to increase prices again in January, 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN OUTLINES TAIWAN'S POLITICAL VISION FOR NEW MILLENNIUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Normalization of relations across the Taiwan
Strait will be the most important mainstream value for the early
years of the new millennium, a presidential candidate from the
Republic of China said here on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, the standard-bearer of Taiwan's main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the 2000 presidential
election, said that if elected, he will be willing to sign a peace
agreement with mainland China based on the principles of "mutual
respect and parity."</P>
      <P>Chen made the statements while fielding questions from the
audience after delivering a speech on Taiwan's political vision for
the new millennium at the London School of Economics and Political
Science.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician said he believes that so long as
mainland China refrains from trying to set Taiwan's future status and
is willing to negotiate with Taiwan on an equal footing,
normalization of cross-strait relations will not be a pipe dream.</P>
      <P>Even if Beijing declines to treat Taiwan on an equal footing,
Chen said he will wait patiently for the right time to resolve
bilateral disputes naturally and peacefully.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan Strait peace and Asia-Pacific stability will
benefit both sides, Chen said he is convinced that Taipei and Beijing
can work out their differences. "We can sign a basic treaty to
regulate bilateral relations on a `parity' basis," he added.</P>
      <P>In his speech, the former Taipei mayor also outlined his new
political vision under a new middle-of-the-road policy to cope with
the problems facing the country.</P>
      <P>Chen said his new policy is aimed at establishing a full-fledged
democratic system under which major political parties take turns in
holding power.</P>
      <P>If elected, Chen said, he will push for the establishment of a
"partner" relationship between the central and local governments by
delegating more power to local-level governments.</P>
      <P>Chen also vowed to establish a president-centered, three-branch
government and a unicameral parliament, strengthen financial security
management, eradicate vote-buying and the influence of money and
gangsters in politics.</P>
      <P>Chen further promised to develop Taiwan into a "green silicon
island," by accelerating development of biotechnology and information
technology as well as developing new "network" communities.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait relations, Chen said he expects to forge
friendly ties with Beijing based on goodwill. "We are hopeful that
Beijing can overcome all difficulties and transform itself into a
moderate giant in the Asia-Pacific area."</P>
      <P>If elected, Chen said he will be willing to conduct regular
dialogue with Beijing and work together with it to overcome all
obstacles to bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>He also called for establishment of a military exchange mechanism
and normalization of bilateral trade, saying the two moves would mark
major breakthroughs to normalization of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen is the first foreign presidential candidate to be invited by
the London School's president, Anthony Giddens, to speak at the
school's "public affairs forum."</P>
      <P>His speech attracted a packed audience, including many students
from both sides of the Taiwan Strait. At one point in Chen's speech,
Taiwan and mainland Chinese students publicly argued over
cross-strait issues and even traded insults.</P>
      <P>Witnessing the brief episode, Giddens said afterward that
although he knows cross-strait issues are very sensitive, he did not
expect that they could so easily trigger a flare-up between the
people from both sides.</P>
      <P>Following his two-day London visit, Chen will travel to Belgium
where he will deliver a speech on Taiwan's political vision at the
European Union's Asia-Pacific Research Center.</P>
      <P>He will also visit the Netherlands before ending his three-leg
European tour and returning to Taipei on Dec. 9.</P>

      <P>Lin made the remarks upon his return from a visit to the United

      <P>During his visit, he held talks with scholars in various US and

      <P>Lin also spoke about the DPP's efforts to improve cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and seek a breakthrough in the diplomatic blockage
imposed by Beijing on the island.</P>
      <P>He noted that some scholars suggested to him that Taiwan's
security depends not only on military and economic security, but also
on the democratization of Taiwan and the sympathy and support of the
international community.</P>
      <P>Lin said he found many of the officials with whom he spoke to be
very concerned about the March 18, 2000 presidential election, but
added that they assured him that as democratic countries, the United
States and Canada believe that a president elected through the
democratic process should be respected, and that the two countries
will not dramatically change their policies toward Taiwan, no matter

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on
Tuesday that exports in November totaled US$11.55 billion, setting up
a record high in a single month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$1.44 billion, or the
fifth time that trade surplus topped US$1 billion this year, in
November, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that exports totaled US$110.62 billion in the
first 11 motns, while imports totaled US$100.4 billion, with Taiwan
enjoying a trade surplus of US$10.22 billion, surpassing the trade
surplus recorded both in 1997 and in 1998.</P>
      <P>The MOF estimated that export growth in December will be 15
percent, while imports will be 10 percent. Judging from the estimate,
the export growth this year will reach between 9.3 percent and 9.6
percent, setting up a new high since 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE GROUP ISSUES REPORT ON TAIWAN'S HUMAN RIGHTS CONDITIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should further improve its human
rights conditions as it still flunks evaluations by local elite
groups, the Chinese Association for Human Rights (CAHR) said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The association has compiled a report on Taiwan's human rights
conditions annually since 1991, based on the results of opinion
survey of elite members in local society.</P>
      <P>The association managed to collect 2,544 valid replies this
year. It used a one-to-five-point scaling system to gauge human
rights condictions in eight categories -- political, economic, women,
judicial, children, elderly people, social, and cultural and
educational fields.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that none of the eight major indices
received the minimum passing score of three points.</P>
      <P>Compared with last year's tallies, the scores for political,
social and children's rights declined slightly, while the scores for
the remaining five categories all posted gains.</P>
      <P>Political rights received the highest score of 2.98. Although
the score still fell below three points, it indicated that local
political rights situation has gradually become acceptable to elite
members.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the CAHR report pointed out that rampant political
apathy and consolidation of democratic system remain major problems.
Moreover, the report said debate on Taiwan's future status and abuse
of political power for personal interests may eventually undermine
local people's civil rights.</P>
      <P>Political rights received a score of 2.83 points. Many scholars
and lawmakers responding to the survey said the government should
reduce unnecessary intervention into economic activities while
strengthening its "service" functions.</P>
      <P>The average score for children's rights conditions declined
slightly to 2.69 points. The report said the government should pay
more attention to uderage corporal punishment, peer and domestic
violence, and rape issues.</P>
      <P>Judicial rights received a score of 2.66 points. Quoting survey
results, the report said, Taiwan made improvements in criminal
investigations, law enforcement, and protection of law enforcement
officers' rights. Nevertheless, the report said there is still ample
room for improvement in court procedures.</P>
      <P>The score for social rights stood at 2.81 points, down slightly
from last year's level. The report attributed the decline mainly to

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on
Tuesday that exports in November totaled US$11.55 billion, setting up
a record high in a single month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$1.44 billion, or the
fifth time that trade surplus topped US$1 billion this year, in
November, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that exports totaled US$110.62 billion in the
first 11 months, while imports totaled US$100.4 billion, with Taiwan
enjoying a trade surplus of US$10.22 billion, surpassing the trade
surplus recorded both in 1997 and in 1998.</P>
      <P>The MOF estimated that export growth in December will be 15
percent, while imports will be 10 percent. Judging from the estimate,
the export growth this year will reach between 9.3 percent and 9.6
percent, setting up a new high since 1996.</P>
      <P>The MOF estimated that import growth will be around six percent
this year, with trade surplus estimated at 10.5 billion, or a new
high since 1997.</P>
      <P>The MOF attributed the double-digit growth to the rapid rebound
of Taiwan industry in the wake of Sept. 21 earthquake and the
entering of hot export season, adding that exports to major trading
regions such as the United States, Hong Kong , Japan, Europe, and
Association of Southeast Asian Nations all increase.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday officially
accepted the resignation of Cabinet member Peng Tso-kwei as chairman
of the Council of Agriculture (COA), and assigned Ling Shiang-nung to
fill the vacancy.</P>
      <P>Ling, incumbent COA vice chairman, was born in Kaohsiung County,

from Chinese Culture University, Ling served as deputy director of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of Central and South

      <P>Ling, who has been named as one of the top 10 Outstanding Young
Persons of the country due to his remarkable performance in social
services, has served under four COA chairmen.</P>
      <P>Peng announced his decision to quit on Nov. 30, after the Cabinet
decided, despite his strong opposition, to allow farmers to build
houses on newly acquired farmland. A 40-minute meeting with Siew on
Monday failed to change his mind.</P>
      <P>Allowing farmers to construct houses on their land is tantamount
to transforming the island's farmland into de-facto construction
land, while allowing it to be exempt from construction regulations
and virtually tax-free, Peng claimed.</P>
      <P>He also warned that lifting the house-building ban is like
opening a Pandora's box, and will cost the country's long-term
agricultural policy dearly.</P>

paid a visit to the Legislative Yuan on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan County magistrate told DPP legislators that her
selection as running mate by DPP presidential candidate Chen

Formosa Incident, when a group of Taiwan dissidents, who later formed
the DPP, marched with their supporters in Kaohsiung City in defiance
of a government ban on political demonstrations, and clashed with
military police.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Chen chose her to underline his campaign promise to
"make Taiwan a place where women are well-treated."</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Legislative Whip Chen Chao-nan said the fact that Lu,

      <P>Legislator Chen Chi-nan said the party's legislative caucus

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) under the name "Chinese Taipei," Economic Affairs
Minister Wang Chih-kang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Chinese Taipei" is the brief and contingent form of "Independent
Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" -- the name
that Taiwan used when it applied in January 1990 to join the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was superseded by the
WTO in 1995, said Wang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to use the title "Chinese Taipei" in 1991 when it
joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum as a full member.</P>
      <P>Wang predicted that the most likely time for Taiwan's accession
to the WTO will be in mid to late 2000, given the relevant
pre-accession procedures.</P>
      <P>He added that although Beijing did not oppose Taiwan's entry into
the WTO under the name "Independent Customs Territory of Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," it has insisted that it enter the world
trade regulatory body before Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yielding to the situation, Wang said that Taiwan's accession to
the WTO will most likely come after Beijing's, probably only a few
minutes later.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the United States, Canada and the European
Union did not think that Taiwan's accession should be linked to
mainland China's accession. However, a large number of the other
countries of the 135-member WTO insisted that Taiwan's entry should
come after Beijing's.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, Taiwan has completed bilateral
consultations with almost all the relevant countries and signed
agreements paving the way for Taiwan's entry. The one exception is
Hong Kong, with whom Taiwan has concluded WTO talks but hasn't signed
any agreement yet, said Wang.</P>

      <P>A 10-month-old baby boy is
waiting for a fresh liver to replace his failed liver, caused by
inherent gall tube blockage and cirrhosis, the liver transplant group
at China Medical College Hospital (CMCH) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yang Mei-tu, director of the surgical department at CMCH, said
the baby boy, surnamed Tsai, was stricken by continuous jaundice two
months after birth and was sent to CMCH. He was diagnosed as having a
blocked gall tube, resulting in cholangietic jaundice.</P>
      <P>Yang said preliminary surgery was performed on the baby boy after
being sent to CMCH, but cirrhosis of the liver resulted in recent
liver failure, a poor appetite, and hindered growth.</P>
      <P>After further tests, the liver transplant group decided the only
way to save the baby's life was to replace his liver. The hospital
has therefore completed all the preparations for surgery.</P>
      <P>Yang urged the families of people who have recently died
accidentally to exalt the spirit of fraternity and donate the
deceased's liver to help save the baby.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is likely to be admitted to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in May or June next year, Foreign Affairs
Minister Chen Chien-jen said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current circumstances, Chen said, it is widely
believed that Taiwan and mainland China will be able to enter the
Geneva-based WTO in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>"But many other factors may influence the decision of the
international community, and we really hope that Taiwan can be
admitted into the WTO immediately following mainland China's
accession," he noted, adding that "we will exercise the greatest
caution in the lead-up to Taiwan's membership."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
revealed that about two weeks ago, a US official "in charge" of the
issue told the Taiwan side that the island should be expected to be
allowed to enter the world trade regulatory body in May or June 2000.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official warned that a number of uncertainties
still remain in the way of accession. Many matters, including issues
related to mainland China's most-favored nation trade status and the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act in the US Congress, can influence the
outcome, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA'S 1ST HUMAN RIGHTS MONUMENT TO BE INAUGURATED ON FRIDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first human rights monument in Asia will
be inaugurated on Green Island off the southeastern coast of Taiwan
on Friday, to coincide with World Human Rights Day.</P>
      <P>Senior government officials and monument promoters, including
President Lee Teng-hui and Bo Yang, a noted writer who spent nearly
10 years in a tightly-guarded jail on Green Island as a political
prisoner during Taiwan's martial law era, will attend the inaugural
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Bo Yang, chairman of both the monument preparatory committee and
the Human Rights Education Foundation, said he hopes the new monument
will help promote the concept of human rights and cultivate a climate
conducive to respect and protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>Bo Yang, the pen name of Kuo Ying-tung, expressed his gratitude
for President Lee, who donated NT$20 million in proceeds from sales
of his book "The Road to Democracy: Taiwan's Pursuit of Identity,"
toward the monument's construction and the promotion of human rights
education.</P>
      <P>"I also appreciate Premier Vincent Siew's assistance in land
acquisition, as well as donations from other government officials and
business executives for the NT$38 million monument project," said Po
Yang.</P>
      <P>The monument was designed by Han Pao-teh, a renowned architect
and president of the National Tainan College of Arts, with the
assistance of calligrapher Tai Lan-tsun and art designer Hou
Jung-ling.</P>
      <P>Po Yang said the monument sports a very special design and is
made of high-quality limestone imported from Europe. "Generally
speaking, the monument looks elegant and offers feelings of warmth
and tenderness," he said.</P>
      <P>The names of 500 political dissidents who were jailed on Green
Island at one time or another during the repressive martial law era
are inscribed on the monument, along with a poem by Bo Yang which
reads: "During that grim period, how many mothers were crying in the
darkness of long nights for their children jailed on this island?"</P>
      <P>Bo Yang said the monument preparatory committee has taken great
pains to collate the names of the former prisoners and persuade their
families to agree to have their names inscribed on the monument.</P>
      <P>"Many former Green Island prison inmates and their families were
still reluctant to have their names engraved on the monument for fear
of `trouble,'" Bo Yang said, adding that their hesitation reflects
the depth of the psychological wounds endured by political dissidents
and their families during the "white terror" era.</P>
      <P>Bo Yang said the monument will be donated to the government after
its inauguration. The Tourism Bureau's Green Island office will be
responsible for management and maintenance of the monument, which is
expected to become a new tourist attraction for the offshore island.
"The area surrounding the monument will also be developed into a
human rights park," Bo Yang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Human Rights Education Foundation will sponsor a
workshop on Green Island on Dec. 10 to train human rights
instructors. "We'll launch a human rights education campaign, with
Green Island as the starting point," Bo Yang said.</P>

      <P>Otis, the world's largest elevator manufacturing company, intends
to install in new and existing elevators an "e-Display," a monitor
similar to a flat-panel computer screen, Stephen F. Page, President
and CEO of Otis Elevator Company, announced Wednesday morning at a
press conference held at the Waldore-Astoria Hotel.</P>
      <P>The monitor will provide news, entertainment, and targeted
advertising to elevator passengers in some of the more than 1.2
million elevators Otis operates around the world, and will enable
managers of apartment complexes, hospitals and commercial buildings
to communicate, quickly and efficiently, with residents, tenants, and
members of the community--alerting them to critical information.</P>
      <P>E-billboards by NGN currently provide information, e-tainment and
targeted advertising via high resolution monitors to over 40 million
consumers who wait in line each week. The monitors are currently
located in over 5,000 coffee shops, lobby shops, convenience stores,
Hispanic and Korean markets, gas pumps and transit hubs around the
United States.</P>
      <P>"Through e-Displays, we're bringing news and information to new
heights, and elevator passengers are going to love this medium the
way consumers do today," said Gerard P. Joyce, Chairman of NGN.</P>
      <P>The relationship announced today will bring together the
out-of-home media, content management and digital technology
experience of NGN, and the hardware, software and networking
capabilities of IBM's e-Business Solutions unit, and the global
reach, brand equity and customer relationships of the Otis Elevator
Company.</P>
      <P>Otis Elevator Company--a subsidiary of United Technologies
Corp.-- is also currently servicing more than one million elevators
in more than 200 countries around the world, including Taiwan.

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government will impose
harsh new penalties on employers found to be employing illegal
immigrants in its attempt to discourage illegal entries into the
country and foreigners overstaying their visas.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on Tuesday announced that
employers will face fines of up to A$66,000 (US$44,000) and up to two
years in jail for hiring illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>The harsh measures were immediately condemned by Australian
business groups, particularly farmers, who often hire refugees during
the harvest of citrus and other fruits.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said the new measures are necessary for curbing the
influx of illegal immigrants. "Each year my department locates a
significant number of people who have been working without
permission. They are taking jobs away from Australians." he told
reporters.</P>
      <P>But Mark Paterson, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of
Commerce and Australian farmers criticized the new measures.</P>
      <P>The number of illegal immigrants surged substantially with the
entry of about 2000 people from the Middle East and mainland China
since July.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS PROPOSE NEW THEORY ON THE ORIGIN OF URANUS AND NEPTUNE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers have used computer simulations
to show how the solar system's seventh and eighth planets, Uranus and
Neptune, may have been formed.</P>
      <P>Theorists have struggled to explain how Uranus and Neptune formed
at their present locations in the Solar System because, at such
distances, the disk density would have been low at the time that they
began to form and the time required for them to grow is thought to be
longer than the age of the Solar System.</P>
      <P>Astronomers Edward Thommes and Martin Duncan of Queen's
University in Canada, along with Harold Levison of the Southwest
Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, used computer simulations to
propose a solution to this problem, according to the Dec. 9th issue
of Nature magazine.</P>
      <P>Their computer simulations begin with the assumption that Uranus
and Neptune started out as rocky cores in the Jupiter-Saturn region,
and were violently tossed out by gravitational scattering from those
two planets when one or both accreted large amounts of gas.</P>
      <P>The ejected planets remained in highly chaotic orbits for a few
hundred thousand years, after which they settled down and gradually
migrated to their present nearly circular orbits.</P>
      <P>The authors begin their simulations with four rocky cores
embedded in a narrow zone of the solar nebula and find that in 50% of
their trials, the giant planets end up more or less where they are
now.</P>
      <P>The model is unusual in suggesting that all four giant planets
originated in the same region of the solar nebula -- within a ring 5
to 10 astronomical units in distance from the Sun. 1 AU equals the
distance from Earth to the sun.</P>
      <P>This is substantially narrower than previous estimates of 10 to
20 AU for the birthplace of Uranus and Neptune, and far inward from
their present locations of 19 and 30 AU, respectively.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the financial crisis in 1997, Asia
remains well-placed to halve the number of its people living in
absolute poverty by 2015, according to a new World Bank report.</P>
      <P>The Australian on Wednesday quoted the Global Economic Prospects
2000 report as saying that the number of East Asians living in
absolute poverty (less than US$1 per day) dropped to 265 million in
1996 from 432 million in 1993.</P>
      <P>The outlook report for developing and under-developed regions
found that at the end of 1998, the number of people in absolute
poverty jumped to 278 million.</P>
      <P>China, which accounted for more than 80 percent of East Asia's
poorest people in 1996, has continued to grow strongly over the past
three years, though the World Bank notes a worrying 2 million rise in
the absolute number of people living in poverty between 1996 and
1998, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>In South Asia, the moderate decline in the proportion of the
population living in poverty, mainly due to India's booming economy,
also has not stopped the absolute number of people living in poverty
from rising.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, in his capacity as
Kuomintang (KMT) chairman, on Wednesday called for an
across-the-board mobilization of KMT deputies of the National
Assembly (NA) to drum up support for Vice President Lien Chan, the
party's candidate in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee said the presidential election at the turn of the century is
crucial to the future development of the Republic of China and the
KMT. Seeking victory in the election is currently the pivotal mission
that party members should strive to accomplish, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee called for the NA deputies to gear up in the next 100 days to
create greater momentum and efficiency for the KMT so as to enable
the ruling party to win the century election.</P>
      <P>"We will fight in the upcoming 100 days to the last ditch," he
appealed.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a ceremony marking the swearing-in of
Tsai Cheng-yuan as the new NA secretary-general and 18 others as
deputy secretaries-general.</P>
      <P>Tsai's predecessor, Chen Ming-jen, resigned in September after
the then NA Speaker Su Nan-cheng rammed a vote through the NA for a
controversial amendment to extend NA members' terms.</P>
      <P>Su had since come under fire by both NA deputies and by the
general public, leading to his being expelled by the KMT on Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>The KMT charged Su with violating the party line and public
opinion by forcing the passage of the self-serving bill allowing the
incumbent NA deputies to extend their tenures for two years to May
2002.</P>

      <P>Delegates from Japan's Institute of Moralogy
on Wednesday brought to Taiwan a second cash donation from the

Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The donation of 16.43 million yen (US$164,300) was presented by
Toshio Ozawa, a standing director of the Hiroike school, an offshoot
operation of the institute, to the National Cultural Association
(NCA) of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Receiving the donation, NCA Secretary-General Huang Shih-cheng
relayed President Lee Teng-hui's gratitude to the institute for its
compassion, which Lee described as "warm as burning coal in deep
winter."</P>
      <P>Just five days after the devastating earthquake struck, Mototaka
Hiroike, the fourth-generation descendant of Chikuro Hiroike, founder

    <HEADLINE>10% OF LOCAL HIV-CARRIERS FOUND BY BLOOD DONATION CENTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10 percent of the Republic of
China nationals confirmed as being infected with HIV, which causes
deadly AIDS, were discovered by local blood donation centers, the
Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DOH tallies show that 254 of the 2,350-plus confirmed local HIV
carriers were diagnosed after being screened at blood donation
centers.</P>
      <P>"This ratio is too high," said Tu Shing-jer, deputy director of
the DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control. "It is immoral to
use blood donation as a channel for HIV testing," he added.</P>
      <P>He was referring to a local practice whereby certain members of
the public who suspect they may have contracted the virus go to blood
donation centers because they believe it affords greater anonymity
than going to a testing center at a local hospital.</P>
      <P>Tu explained that there is "window period" for blood from an
infected person, during which it is impossible to detect whether it
is contaminated with HIV. As a result, the possibility exists that
patients might receive a contaminated blood transfusion and become
infected with the deadly virus.</P>
      <P>To date, Tu said, nine local people have been infected with HIV
after receiving blood transfusions.</P>
      <P>Tu urged those in high-risk groups, including homosexuals,
bisexuals, drug addicts and people who have sex with prostitutes, not
to donate blood. "They should instead go to designated hospitals for
anonymous HIV testing as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>Tu reminded those in high-risk groups that blood donation centers
now no longer inform individual donors of their test results, and
added that HIV-infected blood donors can also face punishment.</P>
      <P>According to DOH statistics, 125 of Taiwan's HIV carriers are
students. The same tallies also show that sex is the main route of
transmission among teenage HIV carriers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 87 married couples are confirmed to have been infected
with HIV, including 12 of which one member is a foreign spouse.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
on Wednesday summed up the country's defense policy as "Avoid war but
be not afraid of war."</P>
      <P>Lien made the remark at the opening ceremony of an academic
seminar on cross-century national security and military strategy
sponsored by the Armed Forces University at the National Central
Library.</P>
      <P>In light of Beijing's military buildup and its hostility toward
Taipei, the ROC cannot remain self-satisfied simply with the
renovation of existing weapons and related outfits, Lien said.</P>
      <P>Instead, he went on, the country's military strategy and national
defense construction should be subject to appropriate adjustment
according to changes in the international climate and the advancement
of science and technology.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that the ROC should keep abreast of digital
sci-tech in the development of national defense, strengthen
anti-missile ability, and establish a reliable deterrent force, as
well as strengthen its second-strike ability.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-nominated candidate for the 2000
presidential election said he favors the establishment of a
militarily reciprocal trust mechanism between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait which could dissolve conflicts through communication
and mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Lien said he also favors the establishment of a military exercise
reciprocal notice and verification system across the strait, and a
hot line between Taipei and Beijing in order to prevent unnecessary
overreaction from either side.</P>
      <P>As to the issue of joining a theater missile defense (TMD)
system, Lien said that whether or not the ROC joins such a system in
the future, it should strengthen the establishment of anti-missile
advanced warning, interception and destruction systems in order to
ensure national security.</P>
      <P>Ten papers on the international situation, cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, national security and national defense were presented and

      <P>During the ceremony, Lee, whose tenure as president will expire
next May, harshly criticized so-called "supra-party" politics as Nazi
thought which will undermine party politics and harm the very basis

      <P>Implying that independent presidential candidate James Soong is
an ingrate for deserting the party, Lee called for support for the
KMT's presidential candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, who he
described as "honest and talented."</P>
      <P>Soong, the former Taiwan provincial governor and a one-time KMT

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PREMIER OPPOSES PULLOUT OF GARRISON FORCE FROM PRATAS ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Hau Pei-tsun said Wednesday
that he is opposed to the Ministry of National Defense decision to
pull out the garrison force from the Pratas Islands (Tungsha
Chuntao).</P>
      <P>Hau said that although the Republic of China has not needed to
develop nuclear weapons, ROC development of conventional weapons is
necessary.</P>
      <P>Hau, who stepped down from the premiership in 1993, denied
previous news reports that he had a political struggle with President
Lee Teng-hui. He stepped down because of differences of opinion with
the president, Hau said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Hau said he has
recently been pulled back into the public spotlight by developments
in the upcoming presidential election after separate visits by Vice
President Lien Chan, the ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate,
and Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Hau was reluctant to make known which candidates he will support.
He described Lien as a honest man and said it is unfair that former
Taiwan Governor and independent presidential candidate James Soong,
has been called a "crafty and cunning man." Hau said it is better to
say that Soong is a person of contemplation.</P>
      <P>Speaking on his meeting with Lien, Hau expressed caution about
President Lee's redefinition of cross-strait relations as "special
state-to-state" ties. He also urged the ruling party to resolve the
constitutional crisis and the self-extended tenure of the national
assembly deputies as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Hau stressed that Lee's proposed theory of special state-state
ties was very dangerous and said it would bring a great disaster to
Taiwan. He insisted on the one China principle, with Taiwan and
mainland China each having the right to its own interpretation.</P>
      <P>Hau said that he is worried about the growth of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The more votes the DPP gets, the
more danger for Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Although he praised the president's contributions to promote
Taiwan's democratization in the early 1990s, he criticized Lee's role
in five instances of constitutional amendment which have completely
destroyed the constitution. On the surface, Taiwan is democratic, but
actually, Taiwan's democratization has suffered setbacks in the past
10 years, he said.</P>
      <P>Hau also confirmed that the ROC originaiily had plans to develop
nuclear weapons and mid-range missiles, but in yielding to pressure
from foreign countries, the ROC was forced to abandon the projects.</P>
      <P>Hau, who was once vice chairman of the Kuomintang, was ousted by
the party in 1996 for running as vice presidential candidate in
defiance of the KMT in Taiwan's first direct presidential election.</P>

    <DATELINE>Brussels, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By P. C. Tang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, the presidential candidate
of the Republic of China's main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), delieved a speech to the European Parliament's
democratic liberal party caucus on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen was the second Taiwan politician to deliver an address at
the European Parliament after former Foreign Minister John Chang, who
now serves as presidential secretary-general to the President.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen said the DPP has managed to take the helm at
13 local county and city governments in Taiwan after 15 years of
development.</P>
      <P>"We hope to grip power at the central government level by
winning next year's presidential election," the DPP's
standard-bearer for the 2000 presidential election said.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the European Parliament, the legislative arm of the
European Union, not to disregard Taiwan while promoting relations
with the "People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the "PRC" has never ruled Taiwan, Chen said
Taiwan's future, regardless of moving toward independence or
unification, should be decided by its people through a plebiscite.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician said even he manages to win the
presidency next year, he cannot personally decide whether Taiwan
will go toward independence or unification with the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>If elected, Chen said he will give the top priority to seeking
nromalization of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Touching on foreign policy, Chen said if elected, he will
devote even more efforts to strengthen relations with the EU, in
addition to promoting ties with Taiwan's two major traditional allies
-- the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>"I believe there is still ample room for Taiwan to forge closer
cooperation with the EU," Chen said, adding that he thinks Taiwan's
small- and medium-sized enterprises can form strategic alliances
with their EU counterparts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen expressed welcome to a decision by the executive
commission of the International Alliance of Liberal Parties to hold a
board meeting in Taiwan next year.</P>
      <P>"I regard the meeting as a support for the DPP and my
presidential bid," Chen said, adding that he is confident of his
presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Brussels on Tuesday after a two-day visit to
London where he delivered a speech on Taiwan's new political vision
at the London School of Economics and Political Science's "public
afairs forum."</P>
      <P>During his whirlwind visit to Brussel, Chen met with many
influential European Parliament (EP) members, including Georg
Jarzembowski, chairman of the EP's Taiwan Association; Bertel
Haarder, deputy whip of the EP's liberal democratic parties caucus;
and Elmar Brok, chairman of EP's Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Brok, Chen said Taiwan's current
biggest difficulties are mainland China's military threat and
failure to enter major international organizations even it meets all
requirements.</P>
      <P>Chen told Brok that Taiwan's security is important not only to
the United States and Japan but also to other areas around the
world. Chen said the EU should set up an office in Taiwan to
facilitate bilateral exchanges and help boost regional peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>Chen was originally scheduled to meet with Beligian Prime
Minister Guy Verhofstadt, a former leader of Belgium's Liberal
Party, on Tuesday afternoon. However, the meeting was
canceled due to Verhofstadt's tight working schedule.</P>
      <P>Chen said later that he felt regret over failure to hold private
talks with the Belgian prime minister as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Chen will also visit the Netherlands before ending his three-leg
European tour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TZU CHI THANKS INT'L FRIENDS WHO HELPED THE 921 QUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On behalf of the victims of the Sept. 21
earthquake, Master Cheng Yen on Thursday expressed her appreciation
to the international community and to individuals who have extended
helping hands to the victims.</P>
      <P>"You have lifted the spirits of the victims and given them great
strength" in their reconstruction effort, said the master, who
founded the Taiwan Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, at
a press conference in honor of the international friends.</P>
      <P>Yao Ren-lu, the spokesman of the Tzu Chi Foundation, revealed
that in its relief efforts, the foundation received a lot of help
from abroad. Some helped by making donations, and some by putting in
their time and effort.</P>
      <P>"Their actions fully exemplified their belief in `reverence for
life' and that `great love transcends all borders,'" he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that special thanks should be given to: ABN Amro Bank,
the American Chamber of Commerce, AmeriCares, the Australia Commerce
&amp; Industry Office, the British Trade and Cultural Office, the
Canadian Trade Office in Taipei, the Europe Council of Commerce and
Trade, Fairton International Group, Goodyear, IVUSA, Lucent
Technologies Foundation, Mercy Airlines, US GE Co., World Daily and
many others.</P>
      <P>Yao explained that Tzu Chi's relief plan for the 921 earthquake
victims consists of three phases: emergency relief, resettlement and
Project Hope.</P>
      <P>In the emergency relief phase, the Tzu Chi Foundation mobilized
100,000 volunteers, set up 31 relief stations in the disaster areas,
and provided NT$220 million (US$7 million) in cash to the quake
victims.</P>
      <P>In the resettlement phase, Tzu Chi mobilized 200,000 volunteers
who worked at 17 sites to assemble 1,713 prefabricated houses, the
estimated cost of which is NT$1.2 billion (US$40 million).</P>
      <P>The goal of Project Hope is the reconstruction of more than
thirty schools with an estimated cost of NT$4.5 billion (US$150
million).</P>
      <P>The total budget for the relief plan is estimated to be NT$6
billion (US$200 million). Tzu Chi expects all phases to be completed
by August 2001.</P>
      <P>David Coates, director of the British Trade and Cultural Office,
also spoke at the conference. He praised Tzu Chi as one of the most
effective and respected international humanitarian aid organizations
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"That Taiwan has such an organization is a testimony to the
generosity and spirit of the people of Taiwan and to the
determination and practicality of Dharma Master Cheng Yen in putting
Buddhist ideals into daily life," he said.</P>
      <P>He expressed his belief that with the spirit and determination of
organizations like Tzu Chi, Taiwan's reconstruction will be solid
both in practical and humanitarian terms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER CALLS ON WHO TO ACCEPT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew has
called for the World Health Organization (WHO) to accept Taiwan as a
member nation of that organization.</P>
      <P>In a commentary published in Tuesday's edition of the Chicago
Tribune, Siew stressed that the Sept. 21 killer earthquake has
resulted in much closer relations between Taiwan and other members
of the international community.</P>
      <P>Siew called ROC entry to the WHO "most urgent."</P>
      <P>In his article, Siew expressed heartfelt thanks to those
countries that rushed disaster-relief personnel to Taiwan to carry
out rescue missions after the killer earthquake jolted the central
part of the island on Sept. 21, claiming more than 2,400 lives.</P>
      <P>Taiwan learned a great deal about the importance of humanitarian
spirit and cooperation in face of disaster, Siew said, adding that
this kind of spirit is in accordance with the principles mapped out
by the WHO.</P>
      <P>Siew went on to say that Taiwan has completed the first phase of
rehabilitation work in areas stricken by the earthquake. The issue of
public sanitation was the most urgent one faced by Taiwan, Siew said.</P>
      <P>The sanitation issue not only affects victim's health but also
that of people in neighboring countries, he warned, adding that
member nations usually appeal to the WHO for help and technical
assistance in such situations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, has been excluded by the WHO since 1972, when
the organization yielded to pressure from Beijing, and Taiwan has
subsequently only been able to secure assistance through unofficial
channels.</P>
      <P>Siew urged the WHO to remove all obstacles, including political
barriers, so as to carry out the ideals and principles of the
organization.</P>

      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
issued a statement Wednesday ahead of the 20th anniversary of the
Formosan incident, and expressed its hope to replace the ruling
Kuomintang to further promote democracy.</P>
      <P>The DPP noted that "the Formosan incident created a historical
wave and resulted in the construction of the nation of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The largest opposition party on the island pointed out that it is
still not fully satisfied with the development of Taiwan, and it will
strive for further democracy and prosperity for the island by
taking the helm of state.</P>
      <P>The Formosan incident, which is regarded as a milestone of
Taiwan's democratization, occurred on Dec. 10, 1979, when opposition
leaders gathered in Kaohsiung to mark World Human Rights Day.</P>
      <P>Many opposition leaders were arrested and tried by military
courts after the incident.</P>
      <P>The statement said that the movement initiated by Formosan
Magazine 20 years ago was intended to achieve democracy and reform,
adding that it awakened public consciousness and formed the spiritual
foundation for Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>The DPP stated that "Taiwan is a country" and "the Formosan
incident 20 years ago was the starting point of a huge construction
project for this country."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW FM LAYS OUT GUIDELINES FOR FOREIGN POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In his first appearance at the Legislative
Yuan as foreign minister, Chen Chien-jen on Wednesday laid out three
guidelines for Taiwan's foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was the director general of the Government Information
Office before being tapped to replace Jason Hu and take the reins at
the foreign ministry early this month, outlined the following three
pillars of diplomacy for the future:</P>
      <P>-- diplomacy with the input of all rather than just career
diplomats, pooling the resources of government and the private sector
to enhance the country's international profile;</P>
      <P>-- diplomacy carried out on all fronts rather than in the
conventional domains of politics, security and economy, with the
purpose of increasing the country's presence around the world; and</P>
      <P>-- engaging with countries around the world irrespective of their
geographic distance from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The new minister also advocated sincerity, practicality and
thoroughness in diplomacy.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from legislators, Chen denied news wire
reports from Albania that Taipei offered aid amounting to US$1
billion in exchange for diplomatic recognition by that country.</P>
      <P>"The ministry just doesn't have the budget, which is closely
supervised by the legislature, to make such a promise, let alone to
buy diplomatic recognition," said Chen.</P>
      <P>As for a statement in Hong Kong Tuesday by US 7th Fleet Commander
Walter Doran that Washington would likely seek allies if conflict
between Taiwan and mainland China required military intervention,
Chen said the ROC welcomes any state's assistance that proves helpful
for maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait, although he is
checking out whether Doran's remark reflects the official US view.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON SIGNS BILL SUPPORTING TAIWAN'S WHO MEMBERSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton on Tuesday
signed into law a bill requiring a report to Congress from Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright by Jan. 1 2000 regarding the Clinton
administration's efforts to secure Taiwan's appropriate and
meaningful participation in the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who sponsored the legislation, said
this law compels the United States to abide by its 1994 Taiwan Policy
Review to more actively support Taiwan's participation in the WHO and
other international organizations.</P>
      <P>"For too long, Taiwan's 21 million citizens have been denied
access to the WHO and its medical expertise. The question is not
whether Taiwan belongs in the WHO, but whether we support improving
health care for children, the elderly, and the most vulnerable people
in Taiwan. These are goals that our nation should support," he said.</P>
      <P>Brown, the top Democrat on the House Commerce Health and
Environment Subcommittee, added that "denying Taiwan's participation
in the WHO is an unjustifiable violation of its people's fundamental
human rights. Instead of worrying about offending China, our
government should help Taiwan gain its rightful place in the WHO and
other international organizations. This law is a step in the right
direction."</P>
      <P>Last fall, the Brown-sponsored resolution urging Taiwan's
membership in the WHO was unanimously passed by the House. Brown
spearheaded the drive in Congress to win official US support for
Taiwan's entry into the WHO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, last a WHO member in 1972, requires a majority vote of
all its members to be readmitted into the Geneva-based health

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON REITERATES CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton reiterated
Wednesday the principles of American policy on China, saying that the
US believes there is only one China, that disputes have to be
resolved through cross-strait dialogue, and that Washington opposes
and would view with grave concern any kind of violent action across
the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Clinton was asked at a presidential press conference if he was
concerned about America's ability to defend Taiwan with Communist
China building a second short-range missile base allowing them to
attack Taiwan with little or no warning.</P>
      <P>He responded by saying Communist China is modernizing its
military in a lot of ways, "but our policy on China is crystal-clear.
We believe there is one China. We think it has to be resolved through
cross-strait dialogue. And we oppose and would view with grave
concern any kind of violent action. And that hasn't changed."</P>
      <P>Although there are tensions across the Taiwan Strait, Clinton
said he is convinced that "if you look at the amount of Taiwanese
investment in China, it's obvious that eventually they're going to
get this worked out because they are too interconnected by ties of
family and increasingly by ties of economy."</P>
      <P>Regarding the Panama Canal, Clinton stressed that "it's important
for the American people to understand that the canal itself will be
operated and controlled entirely by the government of Panama, through
the Panama Canal Authority. It is completely and totally within the
control of the Panamanians."</P>
      <P>He noted that the Hong Kong company which got the concession to
operate the ports at both ends of the canal "will be responsible for
loading and unloading ships. They also do this in three or four ports
in Great Britain. The managing director is British. Most of the
employees will be Panamanian. So I feel comfortable that our
commercial and security interests can be protected under this
arrangement."</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Testosterone has an adverse effect on
blood vessels and can increase men's risk of developing vascular
disease, according to a new study by the Heart Research Institute in
Sydney.</P>
      <P>The study, led by Associate Professor David Celermajer, shows
testosterone increases the stickiness of blood vessel walls, allowing
cholesterol to build up on them more easily, and also making it more
likely that the cells in the walls will load up on fats.</P>
      <P>"This means that maleness is a risk factor for heart disease,
like diabetes, and high cholesterol and high blood pressure and
obesity," Celermajer told reporters on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He said the hormone that gives men their facial hair, muscles,
and bone strength could also be giving them heart disease.</P>
      <P>He said women have a much lower rate of heart disease than men. A
woman in her 40s has a one in three chance of developing coronary
disease as compared with a one in two chance for a man of the same
age.</P>
      <P>Celermajer said that even in their 70s, after they have stopped
producing estrogen, women still have lower rates of heart disease
than men.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC OPEN TO STRATEGIES TO BEEF UP DEFENSE CAPABILITY: LIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) would welcome any strategies or measures that are conducive to
strengthening Taiwan's defensive capabilities, a senior MAC official
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman and Vice Chairman Lin Chung-ping said seeking
peaceful reunification with mainland China and maintaining stability
across the Taiwan Strait have long been set policies of the MAC, but
it welcomes all measures that could beef up Taiwan's defense muscle,
given that Beijing has never renounced using force against Taiwan and
has continued to mount missile deployment aimed at the island.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks to echo Vice President Lien Chan's calls
Wednesday for long-range missile to deter assault from mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar at the Ministry of National Defense's Armed
Forces University, Lien said Taiwan needs long-range
surface-to-surface missiles that can discourage an attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien said that in order to ensure the Chinese communists don't
dare invade Taiwan, the country must establish a credible deterrent
military force and bolster its second-strike capability.</P>
      <P>"That includes developing the potential force of long-range
surface-to-surface missiles," said Lien, the ruling Kuomintang's
candidate for the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Lien's missile calls, Lin Yu-fang, an associate
professor at Tamkang University, said that seeking development of
ballistic missiles is by no means an easy task.</P>
      <P>Lin said all plans to develop ballistic missiles are limited by
controls established by international treaties.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, mid-range missiles fired from Taiwan would
have a sufficient range to cover the entire mainland. Taiwan's talk
of building long-range missiles would be meaningless, except for the
purpose of astounding the United States and European countries.</P>
      <P>"Lien should read more before speaking," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC SINGLES OUT POSSIBLE POST-MACAU HANDOVER PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China must work out measures
to cope with mainland China's intensified propaganda war after it
takes control of Macau from Portugal later this month, the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, said
mainland China will certainly take advantage of the Dec. 20 Macau
handover to promote its so-called "one country, two systems" scheme
for unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MAC said, mainland China will step up efforts to
sway pro-Taiwan social groups in Macau, such as associations of
alumni of Taiwan universities and colleges, the Sun Yat-sen Society
and the Taiwan General Chamber of Commerce. Those moves would make
Taiwan's work in Macau even more difficult after the enclave's
handover.</P>
      <P>The MAC also reiterated in its report to the weekly Cabinet
meeting that after the handover, Macau residents who hold Portuguese
passports can still make 14-day visa-free visits to Taiwan in
accordance with the Schengken Convention.</P>
      <P>As many recent mainland Chinese immigrants to Macau have traveled
to Taiwan for either work or sightseeing, the MAC said relevant
government agencies should study whether an increase in the number of
visitors from Macau would have an adverse impact on Taiwan's national
security.</P>
      <P>The MAC went on to say that it is also worth studying whether
mainland China-financed companies in Macau have made their way into
Taiwan and any possible impact of such activities.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the impending change in Macau's status, the
ROC government has legislated a special statute to regulate exchanges
with the enclave in the post-handover era.</P>
      <P>The MAC will also inaugurate a new department on Dec. 20 to
handle post-handover Taiwan-Macau exchanges and other related
affairs.</P>
      <P>In related news, MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chon-pin said mainland
China's insistence that all cultural and academic exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait must serve political purposes has seriously
hindered positive cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>Lin told a news conference that mainland China has intensified
obstruction of cross-strait cultural and academic exchanges
this year.</P>
      <P>"The scope and frequency of mainland obstruction of cross-strait
cultural exchanges have unreasonably expanded this year," Lin said,
adding that in the past 11 months, eight cases have signified
mainland China's intention to fend-off bilateral cultural and
academic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lin further said seven of those cases took place before ROC
President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties as a "special
state-to-state relationship" in an interview with a German radio
station on July 9.</P>
      <P>As for cross-strait relations, Lin said the ROC originally hoped
that Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), could visit Taiwan
this year and that the two sides could resume regular dialogue.</P>
      <P>"As the year is drowing to an end, chances of realizing these two
goals are getting slim," Lin regretted.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There seemed to be truth in the saying
that cats have nine lives when a weak, wasted kitty was found
Wednesday under the rubble of a destroyed building in Taichung City,
more than 70 days since the 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The cat was discovered by a group of construction workers under a
wooden board when they were clearing furniture out of the remains of
the building. The cat, lying besides the corpse of another feline,
could not walk or even stand due to weakness and possible injuries.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the cat could not escape because of the
weight of the wooden board, but it managed to survive, for 70 days,
by feeding off of the dead body of its companion.</P>
      <P>The cat was rushed to a nearby veterinary hospital where vets
found it so weak that it could barely move.</P>
      <P>The veterinarians, after injecting liquid nourishment into its
mouth with a syringe in an attempt to keep it alive, declined to
speculate whether the cat would survive, since it was diagnosed as
suffering from dehydration and kidney failure.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices dropped 0.92 percent on
Thursday over Y2K concerns with the approach of year's end and fresh
signs of a Taiwan-mainland China arms race.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index, ending
lower for four consecutive trading sessions and shedding 2.8 percent
in total, closed 72.18 points lower at 7,738.84, and turnover
expanded to NT$139.69 (US$4.42 billion), with 2.68 billion shares
changing hands, of which selling exceeded buying by 12 million
shares.</P>
      <P>The market opened 13.41 points lower, dragged down by moderate
losses on Wall Street, and closed even lower as the electronics
sector and financial sector, which attracted most of the turnovers,
both reported shoddy performance.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Vice President Lien Chan urged the military to
fortify the island's deterrent missile forces, which, according to
dealers, added uncertainty about relations between Taiwan and
mainland China despite the unlikeliness of immediate cross-strait
tensions.</P>
      <P>Sentiment was also chilled by worries that institutional
investors, including foreign funds, might gradually slow their
investment in Taiwan ahead of the year 2000 to avoid potential losses
caused by any computer malfunctions, dealers added.</P>
      <P>Among the eight major stock categories, the textile sector
suffered from the largest setback of a 2.9-percent loss, while the
cement sector posted the largest gain of 3.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Decliners outnumbered gainers 288 to 176, with 82 shares
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market edged down 0.22 points to close at
185.24, on a turnover of NT$16.75 billion.</P>
      <P>All TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) posted losses, with the exception of September futures, for
which no transactions were recorded.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for December moved down 70 points to close at
7,770, with 1,570 contract transactions. Those for January declined
84 points to finish at 7,782, with 317 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for next March climbed 87 points to close at
7,863, with six contract transactions, while those for next June shed
19 points to close at 7,941, with 17 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Thursday were 7,840
points for December, 7,866 points for January, 7,950 points for next
March, 7,960 points for next June, and 7,940 points for next
September.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, both reported losses.</P>
      <P>December TE futures shed 2.3 points to close at 390.5, with 809
contract transactions, and January TE futures moved down 2.3 points
to finish at 390.8, with 73 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for other months.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui met
with Guatemala National Congress President Leonel Eliseo Lopez Rodas
and his wife, and Lee extended his welcome for their visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Expressing his admiration for the ROC's remarkable political and
economic achievements, Lopez inquired about the country's efforts in
its pursuit of democracy and liberalization.</P>
      <P>Lee told his guests that democracy and liberalization have played
a crucial role in the ROC development of a self-sufficient economy,
and have helped Taiwan win its space in the international community.</P>
      <P>Promotion of a democratic system has also led to a stable society
on the island, while the effort to seek liberalization allowed all
people the chance to be involved in fair market competition,
struggling for themselves for wealth and happiness.</P>
      <P>Lee said it was not a smooth road that the ROC has walked in the
hope of developing a democratic system. Describing the process as
similar to the pain that every mother bears during childbirth, Lee
said that after long-term hard work, the Republic of China has
finally implemented the principle of democracy advocated by ROC
founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen, which assures each citizen the right
to exercise the political and civil liberties due to him or her.</P>
      <P>With the performance, Lee noted, the ROC has won much support and
friendship in the international community, despite the fact that its
rival, communist China, has never ceased exerting pressure on other
countries, aimed at isolating the ROC from the greater global
society.</P>
      <P>Lopez, who recently assumed his post, expressed that his
country's solid support for the ROC will never soften and that he
will pool more efforts for maintenance of Taipei-Guatemala relations.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary leader said the ties should be further
enhanced, and not only in the areas of politics and diplomacy. In
terms of economy, he noted, he hopes Taiwan businesses will launch
further investments in Guatemala, while the two countries strengthen
cultural exchanges and cooperation to promote increased mutual
understanding.</P>
      <P>Lopez and his wife arrived in Taiwan Sunday for a week-long visit

    <HEADLINE>AIT CHIEF MEETS INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Richard Bush paid a visit to independent presidential
candidate James Soong for wide-ranging talks on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Soong, a former Taiwan governor who was ousted by the ruling
Kuomintang last month for his insistence on running for the
presidency against the KMT-nominated Lien Chan. Soong is the first
presidential hopeful to have met Bush.</P>
      <P>Soong said after his 80-minute meeting with Bush that he has
told the top US liaison officer with the Republic of China that
Taiwan's democratization is important not only to its people but
is also conducive to East Asian development.</P>
      <P>"I also reiterated to Bush that our people cannot accept
mainland Chinese rule and are strongly concerned about Taiwan's
security and freedom," Soong said, adding he had told Bush that any
change to Taiwan's status quo must receive prior consent of the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bush arrived in Taipei on Wednesday for a routine visit to
inspect the AIT Taipei office's operations. The AIT is a
quasi-official US organization authorized to handle exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>According to a Soong-Bush agreement, Soong would not reveal what
Bush had said during their talks. Bush will express his opinions on
Taiwan-related affairs in a press conference to be held at the end
of his visit.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Soong said he had told Bush that mainland
China's constant threat to use force against Taiwan has caused
backlash among local people and even affect regional security.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Soong said he believes that Taiwan's new
president is obligated to help maintain freedom, peace and security
in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>As for his stance on President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state relationship" theory concerning Taiwan-mainalnd China
ties, Soong said he had made it clear to Bush that the ROC is an
independent sovereign state, not a local government under the
"People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Soong further said the ROC is willing to maintain peaceful
exchanges with mainland China, but that the people of Taiwan cannot
accept mainland China's rule at the moment. "Mainland leaders should
understand Taiwan people's insistence on sovereignty, security,
dignity and long-term interests," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Soong said he had exchanged views with Bush on Vice President
Lien Chan's proposal that Taiwan develop long-range
surface-to-surface missiles to protect its own security in the face
of mainland China's mounting military threat.</P>
      <P>Soong would not reveal Bush's opinion on the issue. He just
explained his own views, saying that the ROC is a peace-loving
country and has no intention to take any offensive action against
any target.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Soong added that Taiwan cannot afford to rule out
any possibility of development in order to maintain adequate defense
capabilities.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, he and Bush also discussed Taiwan's
democratic reforms, its 2000 presidential election and the two
events' possible impact on East Asian development.</P>
      <P>Soong said both he and Bush agreed that Taiwan's second direct
presidential election scheduled for March 18, 2000 will be an
important milestone to Taiwan's democratic development and national
security. "Both of us hope the election will proceed smoothly and
peacefully," Soong said, adding Bush had assured him that the United
States will provide Taiwan with adequate, appropriate defensive
arsenal in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Durning his stay in Taipei, Bush will also meet with two other
major presidential hopefuls -- the KMT's standard-bearer Lien Chan
and opposition Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian,
in addition to senior ROC government officials.</P>

      <P>The government should continue urging Taiwan businesses to invest
in Indonesia, in order to strengthen bilateral economic exchanges and
step up efforts to boost two-way activities in a wide range of areas,
he noted.</P>
      <P>In response to the great importance Wahid attaches to Taiwan's
investment in Indonesia, Lin said his office -- the Taipei Trade
Office in Jakarta -- sponsored a seminar in early November in which
Taiwan businessmen and Indonesian officials exchanged opinions on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investors pointed out that discrimination against ethnic
Chinese by Indonesian people will hamper Taiwan's investment
willingness in Indonesia, but the Indonesian officials denied that
ethnic Chinese are discriminated against, describing the behavior
instead as "envy." The ROC representative office vowed to extend
necessary assistance to Taiwan businesses wishing to invest there.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Taiwan should also forge closer ties with
Indonesia's parliament and strengthen exchanges of visits by opinion
leaders of the two countries as a way of further promoting
substantial bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investment in the Southeast Asian country totaled US$16.7
billion as of the end of September, making the country Taiwan's top
investment target in the region. At the same time, Taiwan is
Indonesia's fifth-largest foreign investor.</P>

      <P>Speeding up post-earthquake rehabilitation
has been listed as one of the government's four major administrative
goals in the coming year, Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has passed the National Development Plan for
fiscal 2000, which includes other key programs aimed at securing
national safety, to further strengthen the stable basis on which
Taiwan society has been built and to improve government efficiency.</P>
      <P>Siew said at Thursday's Cabinet meeting that with the unified
efforts of all units of the government, Taiwan has this year overcome
all the difficulties sparked by the Asian financial meltdown and the
Sept. 21 earthquake, evidenced by the fact that Taiwan's 1999
economic growth rate rose to sixth-highest in the world compared to
the 16th position it reached in 1998.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the annual growth of consumer prices
registered 0.2 percent this year, the lowest level since 1986.</P>
      <P>In the coming year, Siew went on, his Cabinet will be able to
achieve the targeted economic growth rate of 6.1 percent, as the
recovering international economy is expected to increase investment
on the island, a key factor in boosting domestic economic growth.</P>

      <P>Singapore and mainland China are to work
together to develop and exploit tourism opportunities in the latter's
southwestern region and Australia.</P>
      <P>This collaborative approach was agreed upon by the China National
Tourism Administration (CNTA) and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB)
at the 3rd STB-CNTA High Level Bilateral Meeting, which concluded
Thursday in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Both national tourism organizations agreed on efforts to work
together in areas of tourism development in regions where mutual
interest lie. Specifically, a Marketing and Promotion Event will be
jointly held in Australia to explore the twinning potential of
Singapore and Sichuan. The event is planned for the first half of the
year 2000.</P>
      <P>During the recent Singapore-Sichuan Trade and Investment
Committee meeting held in Singapore Dec. 1-3, the STB also helped
Holiday Tours and Travel, a local travel agency, sign a letter of
intent with the Sichuan Tourism Bureau to launch charter flights to
Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan.</P>
      <P>The STB has also, through its Tourism Development Assistance
Scheme, given grants to two ground operators in Singapore, the East
West Executive Travelers and Chan Brothers Travel, to develop
regional tour packages using Singapore as a hub to the southwestern
regions of China, such as Yunnan and Sichuan. The STB hopes to
encourage more travel companies to do likewise.</P>
      <P>In the last five years, mainland Chinese visitor arrivals to
Singapore grew 77.8 percent from 164,893 in 1994 to 293,166 in 1998.
Visitor arrivals from Singapore to mainland China grew 13.5 percent
from 472,171 in 1994 to 535,685 in 1998. For the period of January to
August 1999, this figure grew 32 percent on a year-by-year
comparison.</P>
      <P>Singapore is the second largest investor in tourism-related
sectors in mainland China, with total investments amounting to US$618
million to date, representing 10.5 percent of foreign tourism
investments in that country.</P>
      <P>Such investments include hotels and service apartments,
theme-parks, tour transport facilities and theme restaurants
developed or managed by Singapore companies, mainly in the coastal

      <P>France's Matra Marconi Space has replaced
Germany's Dornier Satellite System (DSS) to jointly build the

      <P>Huang Chen-tai, chairman of the Cabinet-level NSC, said that
because DSS was unable to obtain an export permit from the German

already got an export license from the French government, he went on.</P>
      <P>Huang said that construction of ROCSAT-2 will begin on Dec. 15,

    <HEADLINE>DPP ISSUES STATEMENT ON 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF `FORMOSA INCIDENT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday issued a statement on the eve of
the 20th anniversary of the 1979 Formosa Incident, also known as the
"Meilitao or Kaohsiung Incident."</P>
      <P>The statement, titled "From Beautiful Island To Beautiful
Country," said the Formosa Incident helped nurture Taiwan's
independent nation status.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Lin Yin-hsiung, who read the statement at a news
conference, said the movement initiated by Formosa Magazine 20 years
ago was a call for democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "Formosa" movement was based on the achievements
of several opposition movements led by "Taiwanese martyrs" in the
wake of World War II, Lin said the movement was fully rooted in
Taiwan and carried a deep Taiwanese historical sense.</P>
      <P>Lin further said that during Taiwan's repressive martial law era,
the Formosa Magazine played an important role in reflecting concepts
and values that had wide popular support. Even the then-authoritarian
regime felt the heat and threat of the Formosa Magazine-led
pro-democracy movement, he noted.</P>
      <P>The DPP statement described incident as Formosa
Magazine-organized human rights demonstration in the southern Taiwan
port city of Kaohsiung on Dec. 10, 1979 which was crushed by riot
police. An ensuing government crackdown was followed by a series of
arrests, brutal murders, courts-martial and long jail terms for many
pro-democracy activists.</P>
      <P>In the process, the statement said, the Formosa activists'
courage and firm conviction in democracy awoke the collective
conscience of the people, and inspired the spiritual strength
necessary to pursue democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>"This strength also stimulated identification with the island of
Taiwan and encouraged the pursuit of Taiwan's national identity," the
statement continued.</P>
      <P>It further said the DPP, founded by key figures in the Formosa
Incident and lawyers who later defended them in courts-martial, has
taken great delight in Taiwan's progress as an "independent state"
over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>While marking the 20th anniversary of the Formosa Incident, the
statement said, the DPP also hopes to win the 2000 presidential
election to push for further maturity of the country's democratic
system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese women's group has decided to
donate 1,000 Christmas gifts to the children living in
earthquake-stricken areas of Taiwan, according to news reports in
Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The reports said that Yukiharu Sato, who has a Taiwan-born
husband, visited Nantou in Central Taiwan, the area worst-hit by the
Sept. 21 earthquake in mid-November and saw that many schoolchildren
were having to attend classes in makeshift temporary classrooms.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, she was moved by the relief efforts of the Genki
Village volunteer group from the Japanese city of Kobe, who had
traveled to Taiwan to offer assistance to the quake victims. She then
hit on the idea of forming her own group to launch a gift collection
drive in her home town, in order to help the students of Chungfong
Primary School in Nantou.</P>
      <P>She was soon surprised to find that more than 1,000 gifts were
pouring in from various prefectures within a week of the launch of
the drive.</P>
      <P>She was also moved by 32 Christmas cards made by Hajime Murada, a
primary school student, and translated them all into Chinese with her
husband's help, so as to share their Christmas spirit with those less
fortunate.</P>
      <P>Sato said that a private transport company will transport the
gifts free of charge to Kobe, and will ship them to Taiwan along with
relief materials and other gifts collected by Genki Village in Kobe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REPLACING TROOPS, NOT RETREATING FROM SOUTH CHINA SEA ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is replacing marines
stationed on islands in the South China Sea with Coast Guard Command
(CGC) personnel and is not withdrawing from the area, Republic of
China Defense Minister Defense Tang Fei said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism from some presidential candidates that
the Ministry of National Defense is withdrawing troops from the
Pratas and Spratley islands, Tang said the move is a replacement
rather than a retreat.</P>
      <P>Although the marines stationed on the two islands, which are at
the center of territory disputes between Taiwan, mainland China and
various other Asian states, will be replaced by CGC forces, the ROC's
determination to exact sovereignty over the islands is not changed in
any way.</P>
      <P>In any case, the defense of the islands lies more in the hands of
the air force and navy than in those of the troops posted on them,
Tang said in an attempt to parry criticism that the CGC troops are
not sufficiently well-armed to protect the islands.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the two tiny islands, located some 800 nautical
miles from Taiwan, are impossible to defend, and not terribly
relevant to Taiwan's security, Tang said replacing the elite marines
with CGC troops is a realistic move.</P>
      <P>Movements of the CGC troops, which are not equipped with heavy
equipment, will not require warship escorts, thus substantially
reducing the cost of their transfer, Tang went on.</P>
      <P>The plan to replace the marines has been studied since 1996, and
its implementation was timed in line with the proposed establishment
of a Coast Guard Headquarters under the Cabinet, said Tang, in an
attempt to dismiss allegations that the plan is an ill-thought-out
whim.</P>
      <P>In an unrelated development meanwhile, anonymous US sources
claimed in Washington on Wednesday that Taipei raised a request for
US help in its missile development programs in bilateral preparatory
discussions on military sales in November.</P>
      <P>However, the sources said, Washington is unlikely to help Taipei
to develop offensive weapons.</P>
      <P>The sources pointed out that it is a longstanding US policy to
sell to Taiwan only defensive weapons which cannot be used to strike
mainland China, this is why the United States has consistently
turned down Taiwan's persistent requests for submarines and mid-range
air-to-air missiles.</P>
      <P>The sources also noted that it is established US policy to oppose
any country's development of missiles with a range of more than 300
kilometers and tipped with warheads of more than 500 kilograms.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest air
carrier, on Thursday successfully completed a flight test which
simulated potential problems which might be caused by the Y2K bug,
according to airline officials.</P>
      <P>The simulation was conducted on Flight CI2000, with 72 reporters
and CAL general manager Liu Ke-ya on board, the official said, adding
that both clock and aviation software were set at 11:15 p.m. on Dec.
31, 1999 before the plane took off at 11:34 p.m. from Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After a 26-minute flight, the Boeing 747-4 jetliner successfully
rolled over to Jan. 1, 2000 over Tainan in southern Taiwan, with no
problems at all, the officials said.</P>
      <P>After CI2000 passed the test to see how the millennium bug could
be overcome, chief pilot Chou Tien-sheng said travelers can fly
without anxiety on CAL planes during the rollover period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu pointed out that the airline has invested NT$300
million (US$9.5 million) in its project to cope with Y2K-related
problems.</P>
      <P>Fears are widespread that the dawning of the new millennium will

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA REMAINS AT LOW END OF OECD'S LIST OF AID DONOR NATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia ranks 14th and is at the low
end of the list of the 21 aid donor countries in the Organization of
Economic and Cooperation Development, according to a recent OECD
review.</P>
      <P>The OECD review, faxed to the CNA on Friday by Australia's
Department of Foreign Affairs, said the percentage of Australian
gross national product devoted to aid dropped to 0.27 percent in
1998, well below the UN target of 0.7 percent and below the OECD's
average of 0.4 percent of GNP.</P>
      <P>Australia ranked 14th out of the 21 aid donor countries on the
OECD's development assistance committee in terms of its aid-to-GNP
ratio and 13th in terms of billions of dollars donated annually, the
OECD review reported.</P>
      <P>But Downer, in a statement faxed to the CNA on Friday, said the
aid/GNP ratio would rise to 0.28 percent during fiscal 1999-2000 to
the tune of more than A$1.6 (US$1.07) billion.</P>
      <P>The OECD review said Australia's aid program has gone through an
impressive process of restructuring and renewal since the last review
in May 1996.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on Thursday described the
review as "a very positive report card." He said he wanted to see
Australia help reduce poverty and to achieve sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Australia's aid goes to about 30 countries and its major
recipients are Papua New Guinea, East Timor, mainland China, Vietnam,

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH CRITICAL OF BEIJING'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Dec.   9  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Human Rights Watch on Thursday
criticized Communist China for tightening its controls on basic
freedoms during the year, in part because of Beijing's desire to
ensure stability on several sensitive dates, including the tenth
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>Presenting its "World Report 2000" in Washington, the New
York-based organization pointed out that judicial independence took a
battering in Hong Kong, while religious persecution was a major issue
and corruption remained a major obstacle to respect for human rights
in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch noted that following former Premier Li Peng's
announcement in late November 1998 that Beijing would not tolerate
any political system that would "negate the leadership of the
Communist Party," three organizers of the opposition China Democracy
Party (CDP) received heavy sentences a month later.</P>
      <P>Some 30 CDP members were still in custody as of mid-October, and
the crackdown on the CDP had extended to some 20 provinces, cities
and autonomous regions.</P>
      <P>Communist China's restraints on religious belief also increased
significantly during the year. The peaceful demonstration by some ten
thousand members of Falun Gong in late April clearly shocked the
Beijing regime.</P>
      <P>While authorities took no immediate action, they began a
systematic crackdown three months later, labeling Falun Gong an
illegal organization, detaining thousands of practitioners for
reeducation, and issuing an arrest warrant for Li Hongzhi, the
group's leader who had been living in the United States.</P>
      <P>On the political front, President Jiang Zemin's determination to
bolster the Chinese Communist Party, to placate hardliners, and to
secure his own place in history contributed to heightened intolerance
of any organization openly critical of the Party's platform or
attempting to function outside Party control," wrote the annual
report.</P>
      <P>Individuals and groups suspected of ties to "hostile" foreign
organizations and those disseminating sensitive political information
overseas were particularly targeted by Beijing. State control of
religious affairs in Tibet intensified while dozens of judicial
executions were reported from Xinjiang, where some ethnic Uighur
groups were advocating a separate state. Other alleged "splittists"
were sentenced to long prison terms, said the report.</P>
      <P>Judicial independence and the rule of law in Hong Kong were
"seriously undermined" when the Special Administrative Region
government asked Beijing to interpret a ruling by the Court of Final
Appeal on right of abode in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Municipal councils, the middle tier of elected office in Hong
Kong, were abolished by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa this year, "in
a transparent effort to weaken the influence of pro-democracy
political parties in Hong Kong," added the report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, The two key human rights treaties signed by China in
1997 and 1998 remained unratified. But for the most part, the West
and Japan continued to use bilateral dialogue rather than pressure as
their method of choice in addressing mainland China human rights
issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS MONUMENT INAUGURATED ON GREEN ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first human rights monument in Asia was
officially inaugurated on Green Island off the southeastern coast of
Taiwan on Friday.</P>
      <P>About 300 people participated in a ceremony to unveil the
monument, including President Lee Teng-hui, Human Rights Education
Foundation Chairman Bo Yang, and former political prisoners and their
families.</P>
      <P>The monument, which stands near the beach, is inscribed with a
poem by Bo Yang, himself a political dissident who was incarcerated
in a notorious maximum-security jail on the island for a decade.</P>
      <P>"During that era, how many mothers cried in the long dark nights
over their children jailed on the island?" the poem reads.</P>
      <P>The names of 500 other political dissidents who were jailed on
Green Island at one time or another during the repressive martial law
era are also inscribed on the monument.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Lee paid his highest
respects on behalf of the government to those who made such efforts
in the pursuit of democracy on the island, and extended his deepest
apologies to those who suffered in their pursuit of human rights.</P>
      <P>In a choking voice, Lee stressed that "we will face the
historical trauma squarely, and we have made a solemn commitment that
democracy will not backpedal, that authoritarian rule will not
resurface, and that the next generation will not go through the same
fear and pain."</P>
      <P>Bo Yang, which is the pen name of renowned writer Kuo Yi-tung,
who was imprisoned between 1968 and 1979 on Green Island, said that
the inauguration of the memorial does not represent the end of these
efforts, but rather symbolizes the beginning of one major goal.</P>
      <P>He also extended his thanks to Lee, who donated NT$20 million
toward the funding of the memorial in proceeds from sales of his book
"The Road to Democracy: Taiwan's Pursuit of Identity."</P>
      <P>Bo Yang said that the mistakes made by the government can be
understood and condoned, but should not be forgiven, adding that if
they are forgiven, history will repeat itself and bring suffering
down upon our offspring.</P>
      <P>The monument, which was completed in one year after breaking
ground in Dec. 10, 1998, was designed by Han Pao-teh, a renowned
architect and presdient of the National Tainan College of Arts, with
the assistance of calligrapher Tai Lan-tsun and art designer Hou
Jung-ling.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman
Richard Bush said on Friday that he was impressed following a visit
to the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This was the first visit to the high-tech park by the top US

Wednesday for a routine visit to inspect the AIT Taipei office's

      <P>Bush met with Huang Wen-hsiung, director-general of the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park, visited United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC) and met with UMC Chairman Robert Tsao and President John Hsuan.</P>
      <P>There had been speculation that Bush might have invited UMC to
invest in the United States, as UMC said that in the wake of the
Sept. 21 earthquake, the company is considering setting up an
overseas plant to try to diversify investment risks. Hsuan also said
earlier that some overseas chip manufacturers have contacted UMC.</P>
      <P>However, Bush said that he visited UMC mainly to learn about the
company's development experience, and that he had not persuaded UMC
to invest in the United States. Nevertheless, he pointed out that the
United States has many locations suitable for setting up plants, and
welcomed investment by Taiwan manufacturers.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
suggested on Friday that local people planning to travel abroad over
the New Year period should apply for visas before Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official warned that if applications are made any later

      <P>Clark K. H. Chen, director of MOFA's Department of West Asian
Affairs, said during a news conference that the ministry also advises
people to avoid traveling to Russia during the Y2K rollover period.</P>
      <P>Russia is regarded as being ill-prepared for the Y2K problem,
Chen noted, adding that those living in colder areas are expected to
suffer more than those in warm regions if they are affected by the
computer bug which might disrupt power supplies and transportation
systems.</P>
      <P>Chen said that MOFA's representative office in Russia is prepared
for any possible incidents caused by the millennium bug, which could
crash older computer systems that use two digits to record dates and</P>
      <P>might therefore confuse 2000 with 1900.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, the liaison office has also advised
Taiwan people living in Russia that they ought to consider a trip
home or a visit to the United States or western Europe in advance of
the New Year period, in order to minimize the risk of Y2K problems.</P>
      <P>The MOFA Bureau of Consular Affairs said it will also implement a
full alert for the Y2K bug from Dec. 15 to Jan. 5, during which
period there will be provisions made for urgent requirements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD URGE SIMULTANEOUS WTO ENTRY FOR TAIWAN, PRC: POLICY ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To ensure the US-PRC agreement on
Communist China's entry into the World Trade Organization advances US
commercial interests without compromising significant US security and
human rights interests, Washington should insist on Taiwan's
simultaneous accession to the WTO, said a US expert on Asia Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stephen J. Yates, a senior policy analyst for the Asian Studies
Center at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, wrote in an
analysis piece that it is critical for US policy-makers to view the
conclusion of 13 years of negotiations over the PRC's entry into the
WTO as "the beginning of a long period of implementation."</P>
      <P>"The success or failure of this agreement rests upon as much
details as on the determination of American leaders to continue to
press for progress on security issues, human rights and Taiwan," said
the analyst.</P>
      <P>In reality, Yates pointed out, Communist China's membership in
the WTO is not likely to dramatically increase US investment and
participation in mainland China's market in the near future, nor is
it likely to ignite a passion for liberal democracy within mainland
China's borders. But neither will it hinder US ability to protect its
national security interests or promote freedom in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He is convinced that the US-PRC agreement is a step in the right
direction, despite the fact that it will take several years before
Communist China's market-opening pledges are realized.</P>
      <P>But Yates said, to ensure that the US-PRC WTO agreement would
advance US commercial interests without compromising significant US
security and human rights interests, Washington should insist on
Taiwan's simultaneous accession to the WTO.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the United States should also find a new
forum to address human rights and national security concerns,
continue national security-based export controls, establish
non-sanction methods to address human rights issues, and hold
Communist China to WTO discipline.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will seek to first join the World
Health Organization (WHO), after which time the ROC government will
adopt a flexible stance toward the island's name in the world body,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from reporters at a news conference, MOFA
spokesman Henry Chen said it is not yet the time to consider the name
issue because the government will first do its best to join the WHO.</P>
      <P>Responding to media reports that US President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday signed Resolution No. 1794 submitted by the US House of
Representatives, which supports Taiwan's efforts to enter the WHO,
Chen replied that it is an indication that both the US administration
and Congress back Taiwan's WHO bid.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of Taiwan's bid to join the WHO is to seek
greater benefits for the health of the island's 22.3 million people,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Citing sources from Washington, the local media also reported
that Beijing may agree to a proposal to be raised at a WHO meeting

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official with the US Department of
State indirectly said on Thursday that the US government would not
encourage and would not support Taiwan in developing long-range
ground-to-ground missiles.</P>
      <P>John Holum, senior adviser for arms control and international
security, made the remarks while answering a question about mainland
Chinese missile buildup and Republic of China Vice President Lien
Chan's statement that Taiwan should develop long-range missiles.</P>
      <P>Holum said, "I would echo the president's statement that we view
with very serious concern any buildup and any threatening gestures
that suggest a violent approach to the Taiwan Strait and to the issue
of China and Taiwan relations."</P>
      <P>He went on to say that "the president has also made clear that
our policy remains that of recognizing one China. But at the same
time, consistent with the three communiques and the Taiwan Relations
Act (TRA), we believe that the future of Taiwan should be determined
in a peaceful way between China and Taiwan, and we view with grave
concern any indications or preparations for military action."</P>
      <P>The official said that under an international accord on arms
control, the US government would not encourage and would not support
any country's development of missiles with a firing range greater
than 300 kilometers and capable of carrying warheads weighing over
500 kilograms.</P>
      <P>In reference to Taiwan's security, Holum noted that under the
TRA, the US has "provided a great deal of defense technology and
support to Taiwan, consistent with its security," adding that "we
will continue to evaluate requests and programs in that light."</P>
      <P>He stated that "it seems to me the right direction for both
Taiwan and China, and certainly consistent with US policy, is to draw
back from more ambitious military programs rather than embark on new
ones."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of seven people who were sentenced
to prison 20 years ago for their involvement in the Formosa Incident
filed criminal complaints against independent presidential candidate
James Soong in Kaohsiung City on Friday.</P>
      <P>In the complaints brought before the Kaohsiung prosecutors
office, Chou Ping-teh, a national policy adviser to the president,
and six others accused Soong, then general director of the Government
Information Office under the late president Chiang Ching-kuo, of
slandering them as traitors and violent criminals in a statement to
domestic and foreign news media.</P>
      <P>They also accused Kung Ling-chen, then director general of the
National Police Administration; Wang Ching-hsu, then
commander-in-chief of the Taiwan Garrison Command (TGC); and Chang
Chih-hsiu, then southern Taiwan commander under the TGC, of violating
their freedom by ordering or implementing the crackdown on a
demonstration on Dec. 10, 1979, which led to a violent clash between
law enforcers and protesters.</P>
      <P>The clash triggered a series of subsequent arrests, and many of
those who organized the demonstration in the name of the now-defunct
Formosa Monthly, after which the incident was named, were given
prison sentences ranging from eight months to six years for treason
or for hiding fugitives.</P>
      <P>The seven plaintiffs, who were arrested separately after Dec.
13, 1979, filed their suits just ahead of the expiration of the
20-year statute of limitations on criminal cases, according to their
lawyer.
 Earlier on Friday, Huang Chih-chuan, speaker of the Kaohsiung
City Council, urged the government to apologize to those convicted
for their part in the Formosa Incident, and to officially clear their
reputations.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with Chou and his fellow convicts in the incident,
Huang lauded the contributions to the island's democracy made by
those involved in the Formosa Incident, claiming that history has

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and his municipal
team have won an approval rating of over 60 percent from Taipei
citizens, according to the results of a survey released on Friday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who took over the mayorship a year ago, scored an approval
rating of 67.6 percent among Taipei residents who said they were
"very satisfied" or "satisfied" with his performance. At the same
time, nearly 60.3 percent of the respondents also expressed
satisfaction about the performance of the city government's staff.</P>
      <P>Responding to the public opinion results released by Taipei City
Councilor S.F. Chen, a humble Ma said he was not content with the
results and expressed the desire to be able to perform better on the
job.</P>
      <P>While answering questions from Taipei City councilors at an
interpellation session, Ma hailed the Formosa Incident, which
occurred 20 years ago in the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung, as a
milestone in the process of Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>Citing a quote by former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman

memorable event belonging to the entire people of Taiwan, Ma called
on the public to judge the historical event from a broader viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Ma admitted that he was deeply touched by Shih's words and
appealed the public to ponder the true meaning of the event. Although
Taiwan is moving toward democracy, each citizen still should be
concerned about the quality of Taiwan's democracy, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Shih, one of the prominent leaders of the Formosa Incident, was
arrested by police in a crackdown on dissidents and sentenced to a

    <TEXT>
      <P>The deployment of Filipino contract workers
to Taiwan has slowed considerably since the suspension of direct
flights between Manila and Taiwan by the Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB) two months ago.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Oct. 1 abrogation of the 1996 Air Pact between
the Philippines and Taiwan, around 2,000 job orders for Filipinos
were canceled by Taiwan brokers and employers.</P>
      <P>At a joint press conference on Friday, the Freedom to Fly
Coalition and the Filipino Manpower agency expressed their
apprehension that an additional 10,000 jobs could be lost over the
next three months if the government does not take action soon to
resolve the present air crisis.</P>
      <P>Most of the jobs were canceled due to additional airfares and
longer travel time and were diverted to Thais and to Vietnamese, who
have just entered the labor market in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently more than 30,000 Filipinos who wish to go home for
holidays are unable to make travel plans since most seats on the Hong
Kong-Manila route are booked for Christmas. It is feared that if
those workers cannot return on time, they face possible fines by
their employers and might even lose their jobs.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian police are warning the public that
high-tech criminals have come up with a clever new way to steal money
from bank accounts, hurting the prospects of the much-touted
e-commerce.</P>
      <P>Detectives said fraud artists have started tapping into
counter-top pads many consumers now use instead of paying with cash
or checks. When a customer sweeps their bank card across the automatic
sensor, automatically debiting money from their bank account to pay
for goods, crooks can record the information encoded on the back of
the card, police said.</P>
      <P>Even more, it now appears that they can also steal your personal
identification number (PIN) as well, and then quickly wipe out your
savings, police reported.</P>
      <P>Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Ben Soave, called
this form of fraud a "frightening" development that threatens
electronic commerce. He said the problem is too big for police
officers alone to solve.</P>
      <P>The situation is so serious that Canada's entire debit card
system may now be compromised, according to the RCMP.</P>
      <P>"The financial institutions, the Canadian Bankers' Association,
they are all working on this, doing damage control," Soave said.</P>
      <P>The latest scam was uncovered this week after police broke up
what they say was an Eastern European crime ring operating out of
Toronto. Dozens of people were arrested on Thursday and charged with
a variety of offenses, from money laundering to drug trafficking.</P>

(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Friday criticized Communist China for its crackdowns on
the China Democracy Party and Falun Gong, and for its continuing
repression of Tibetan Buddhists and non-government-sanctioned
religious groups.</P>
      <P>In her Human Rights Day statement, Albright said that these
actions demonstrate that "the (Beijing) government still fails to
recognize that everyone has the right to freedom of thought,
conscience and religion."</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the United States embraces the spread of
human rights around the world and celebrates the emergence of new
democracies, but "there are still too many places where human rights
and democracy are still elusive."</P>
      <P>In addition to Communist China, Albright cited Russia, Belarus,
Burma, Cuba, Iraq, Sudan and Afghanistan as countries that
fundamentally disregard the United Nations Declaration of Human
Rights' promise that everyone has the right to dignity, to security,
and to life and liberty.</P>
      <P>She noted that "in Kosovo, we learned that the international
community can come together to prevent wholesale human rights abuses.
In East Timor, we learned that concerted action by the United Nations
can prevent military units from overturning the will of a people. In
Indonesia, Nigeria and elsewhere, we learned that no nation, no
religion, no culture is immune to democratic values."</P>
      <P>"The United States remains determined to work with all those who
love freedom to ensure that the next century will see continued
progress in the promotion of democracy and respect for human dignity

    <HEADLINE>US PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL BAUER SPEAKS ON CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Republican presidential hopeful Gary
Bauer on Friday stressed that there would be no absorption of Taiwan
into China during his administration because the people of Taiwan
will not agree to it, saying unification can only come after China
becomes a free country.</P>
      <P>During the taping of NBC's "One on One" TV program, the
conservative Republican leader told John McLaughlin that he approves
of the installation of an anti-missile defense system on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When asked if he is willing to risk provoking military
confrontation as Communist China regards the US providing Taiwan with
a theater missile defense system as an intrusion into their "internal
affairs," Bauer pointed out that the lesson of this century is that
"the way to avoid military confrontation is to make it clear to our
adversaries what we care about, what we're willing to defend."</P>
      <P>Bauer added that the Clinton policy of appeasing Communist China
may lead to a military confrontation, but "my policy will surely not
lead to that."</P>
      <P>He also criticized Texas Governor George W. Bush, who endorsed
China's entry into the World Trade Organization and also
most-favored-nation trading status for Beijing, for not being much
different from Clinton and Vice President Gore on his China policy.</P>
      <P>As to Communist China's internal suppression of non-government
sponsored religion, Bauer said that if he were president, he would
respond to it the same way that Ronald Reagan responded to it in the
Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Bauer emphasized that "the first thing we need to do is turn our
agenda with China upside down. Right now trade is first and
everything else is a poor second, including our own national
security. I would make it clear to them that if they want to continue
to dump their goods in the US market, we're going to have to start
seeing progress on human rights, on issues affecting our national
security, and related matters."</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Not many people in Taiwan believe the
allegations that independent presidential candidate James Soong has
received donations from Beijing, according to a newly released
survey.</P>
      <P>Although his rivals have made strong suggestions that he has been
financially aided by Beijing, 40.44 percent of the people interviewed
by a local public relations firm , the Red Sky Poll Center, dismissed
the accusations as a smear campaign.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 14.44 percent said they feel it was a trick
used by Soong to make himself look like the victim of character
assassination campaign, while only 5.98 percent said they believe
Soong actually received funds from Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether or not they believe Beijing has been
trying to influence Taiwan's presidential election by providing money
to specific presidential candidates, 46.36 percent said no, 28.22
percent said yes, and the rest said they weren't sure.</P>
      <P>If the vote were held tomorrow, 27.74 percent of those
interviewed said they would support Soong, 21.76 percent said they
would support Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, and
17.47 percent would support Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan. The rest
of the respondents said they were still undecided.</P>
      <P>Although Soong leads all other contestants as the most popular
candidate, Lien is seen, by 34.93 percent of those surveyed, as the
candidate most likely to win the election. He is followed by Soong at
27.35 percent and Chen at 6.49 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Dec. 6-8, with 1,004 eligible
voters from around the island being interviewed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS HIGH DEMAND FOR HOUSING, DAY-CARE SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a recent opinion poll of
salaried people in Taipei show that the expectations of government
assistance in housing, day care and improvement of public order
remain high.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Salaried People Association has conducted an annual
survey of salaried people's opinions about job, daily lives
and work environment since 1996. The association began its 1999
survey in Septenber. It sent out 2,300 questionnaires and collected
2,184 valid replies, with 46.9 percent from male respondents and 53.1
percent from women. And the monthly income of those surveyed mostly
ranges between NT$30,000 and NT$39,000.</P>
      <P>On the everyday life-related demand, 56 percent of the
respondents said the government should help resolve housing issue;
51 percent cited the need for government assistance in resolving
children's day-care issue; and 37 percent said the government should
work harder to improve public order to ensure a safer living
environment.</P>
      <P>Housing and day care issues have remained on the top two spots
of the salaried people's service demand list for two years,
indicating that the problems have continued to trouble young
salaried people.</P>
      <P>On the work-related expectations, nearly 60 percent said the
government should organize training programs for salaried people to
learn more professional skills or expertise other than their current
work fields. Moreover, 52 percent said they hope the government will
offer on-job training programs. The two figures indicate that a
sense of unemployment crisis shadows many local salaried people.</P>
      <P>On the working conditions, 70 percent of those interviewed said
they hope a full five-day work week system can be implemented as
soon as possible. Meanwhile, two-thirds said their companies have
not yet implemented a retirement pension system.</P>
      <P>As for expectations of their companies, the respondents cited
a pay raise as their top desire; followed by the implementation of a
retirement system, an annual leave sysem and a severance pay
system in that order. Many female respondents also expressed their
strong hope for improvement of workplace gender discriminations.</P>
      <P>Turning to finances for post-retirement lives, 76.5 percent
said personal savings will be the main source of finances for
their lives after retirement, indicating that the government has not
done its due in offering financial subsidies or support for the
elderly.</P>
      <P>Poll results also show that the concept of relying their
children for the support of their post-retirement lives is no long a
mainstream idea as only 7 percent said they will rely on their
children for financial support after retirement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'TAIWAN STRAIT' ISSUE WILL WORSEN IF NO ADJUSTMENT IS MADE: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "Taiwan Strait" issue will worsen in
the new millennium if no new strategy is worked to tackle it, a
National Chengchi University professor warned on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Professor Chao Chien-ming made the remarks at a symposium
dubbed "Transformation and Development: Taiwan Marching Toward
the New Century," which was sponsored by the ruling Kuomintang's
manpower training institute.</P>
      <P>Chao said although the Taiwan Strait has been a military
confrontation high-risk area, it has not been included into any
international security systems.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chao said, Asian countries hold different views
concerning strategies for addressing security issues. Generally
speaking, Chao said, Southeast Asian countries prefer to incorporate
mainland China into a collective security system through informal
consultations, confidence-building and establishment of consensus.</P>
      <P>As for Northeast Asian countries, Chao said, they opt for
forging military alliances with the United States to ensure
security. For instance, Japan and South Korea have respectively
signed defense cooperation treaties with the United States. Chao
attributed the phenomenon mainly to North Korea's hostility toward
South Korea and a complicated historical complex between Japan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chao pointed out that Taiwan is not a member of the United
Nations and the ASEAN Regional Forum, and has not signed any
bilateral defense agreement with other countries.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chao said, the "Taiwan Strait" issue has been kept
out of international or regional collective security mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has never concealed its attempt to take
Taiwan by force, Chao said the failure to put the cross-Taiwan Strait
issue on the agenda of regional or international security
forums is worrisome.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's vociferous opposition, Chao said, it
remains uncertain whether the US-proposed Northeast Asian theater
missile defense system will cover the Taiwan Strait area.</P>
      <P>With the dawn of the new millennium, Chao said Taiwan, mainland
China and other countries in the nearby region should face the
cross-strait issue squarely and make adjustments in strategies or
attitudes in order to avoid a breakout of military conflicts in the
area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT  URGES SOONG TO EXPLAIN FINANCIAL SOURCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang on Saturday continued
turning the heat up on independent presidential candidate James Soong
to reveal the source of the huge sum of cash stashed in a bank
account of his son Soong Chen-yuan.</P>
      <P>Two days after a KMT legislator unearthed the existence of a
NT$140 million-plus sum of cash deposited in the account of Soong
Chen-yuan with a local bill and security company, the KMT campaign
manager, Jason Hu urged Soong to honestly explain where the money
came from.</P>
      <P>"Privacy should not be an excuse to shield public figures from
scrutiny," especially when he is aspiring to be the head of state,
said Hu, calling on Soong to reveal the source of the money.</P>
      <P>He denied the claim of a pro-Soong legislator Chou Shih-wei that
the KMT has this month launched a "Soong-bashing campaign."</P>
      <P>Taipei's KMT mayor Ma Ying-jeou joined the chorus in urging Soong
to reveal the truth about the origin of the cash or else face public
suspicions and damage to his credibility.</P>
      <P>"Transparency of financial activities is what the public expects
from their leaders, and political leaders should live up to their
expectations," said Ma.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong on Saturday continued to keep silent on the
source of the money after having played it down as a loan from a
unanimous family elder.</P>
      <P>The terse explanation only stirred up more public suspicions and
added fuel to the rumors saying that he received donations from
suspected sources, leading to a decrease in Soong's lead in
popularity polls.</P>
      <P>Soong's popularity has sunk below thirty percent in various polls
taken after the disclosure of the deposit as his political rivals in
the Kuomintang keep tightening the screw on him.</P>
      <P>Soong on Friday challenged other presidential contestants to make
public the source of all their finances. The move was dismissed by
critics as a futile attempt to deflect negative attention away from
himself and didn't help much in defusing the flak from his political
foes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST TAIWAN, CZECH REPUBLIC CO-PRODUCED PLANE ROLLS OFF ASSEMBLY LINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By W. H. Kuo and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first commercial airplane co-produced
by Taiwan's Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC) and the
Czech Republic's Aero Vodochody rolled off the assembly line on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Aero Vodochody chose the date of the company's 80th anniversary
to hold the roll-off ceremony, showing the great importance it
attaches to the joint-venture between the ROC and the Czech Republic,
sources said.</P>
      <P>Roy Wu, ROC representative to the Czech Republic, attended the
ceremony on behalf of the ROC government. He voiced his great respect
for the efforts made by both countries in developing the Ae270
commercial plane over the last two and a half years and expressed the
hope that this model of cooperation could be used in the high-tech
aviation industry in the future.</P>
      <P>David Chu, director of the ROC's Committee for Aviation and Space
Industry Development under the Ministry of Economics Affairs, and
AIDC Vice President Chou Yuan-yuan, both also expressed their
appreciation for the efforts made by Aero Vodochody so that the Ae270
could roll off the assembly line on schedule.</P>
      <P>Some 600 Czech dignitaries, including transportation, defense,
and trade officials, parliamentarians and media reporters also
attended the two-and-a-half-hour ceremony.</P>
      <P>AIDC and Aero Vodochody joined hands in 1997 to invest more than
US$50 million in developing the commercial plane, marking the first
step by the Taiwan aviation industry in making inroads into the East
European market.</P>
      <P>Sources said that the project first came up in discussion when
Vice President Lien Chan, then Premier, made a ground-breaking trip
to the Czech Republic in mid-1995, when he expressed interest in
cooperating with the most influential airplane manufacturer in East
Europe to extend the tentacles of Taiwan's aviation industry into
Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Yin Chi-min, then director-general of the
Industrial Development Bureau, then made two more trips to the Czech
Republic to finalize the joint-venture project.</P>
      <P>The Ae-270 commercial airplane is a 10-seat single-turbine
propeller aircraft which has obtained certification from the US
Federal Aviation Administration.</P>
      <P>AIDC officials noted that Aero Vodochody was the largest airplane
manufacturer in East Europe and has produced more than 5,000 military
or civilian planes.</P>
      <P>The officials paint a rosy picture for the joint venture, saying
that with the cooperation over the Ae270 aircraft, the AIDC will make
inroads into the international civil aviation airplane market, in
addition to expanding its Asian and Pacific operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS FINANCIAL DEALING SCANDAL HURTS SOONG'S IMAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a survey released on
Saturday show that independent presidential candidate James Soong's
clean image has been hurt by the latest accusations of financial
impropriety against him.</P>
      <P>The opinion poll, conducted by Gallup Taiwan Co. on Friday, also
found that many respondents believe opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian's choice of Taoyuan
County Magistrate Annette Lu as his running mate is conducive to his
presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Gallup was commissioned by Sanlih Entertainment Television to
conduct the survey to gauge the possible impact of the financial
impropriety accusations on Soong's popular support rating.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,069 randomly selected adults found
that 54.1 percent of the respondents think the accusations have
had an adverse impact on Soong's reputed clean image.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Yang Chi-hsiung said on Thursday
that when Soong served as the KMT's secretary-general in 1992, which
also happened to be an election year for the legislature, Soong's
son Soong Chen-yuan, then just 24, bought NT$120 million worth of
securities.</P>
      <P>"At that time, the junior Soong had just been discharged from
the military, and had no job to support himself -- how could he
afford to buy securities worth NT$120 million?" Yang asked.</P>
      <P>In response, Soong appeared to have shifted his stance on the
issue three times in the past two days. According to Soong's latest
version of the story in a statement released on Friday morning,
Soong said he had returned the money to the as-yet unidentified
person.</P>
      <P>The latest Gallup poll found that 49.5 percent of the
respondents do not think Soong's statement is true, 23.9 percent of
whom expressed their extreme unbelief in the truth of Soong's
statement. Only 14.3 percent said they believe that Soong's statement
is true, while 36.1 percent said they don't know whether they should
believe in Soong's statement.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Soong continued to lead the pack of presidential
hopefuls in terms of popularity. If the presidential election were
to take place the following day, 28 percent of the respondents said
they would still vote for Soong.</P>
      <P>The same poll found that 21.4 percent would throw support behind
the DPP standard-bearer Chen Shui-bian, and 17 percent would opt for
the ruling Kuomintang candidate, Vice President Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Lien beat his two chief competitors in terms
of the odds to win the 2000 presidential election. Poll results show
that 32.2 percent of those interviewed said they think Lien would
win the critical election, compared to Soong's 30.5 percent and
Chen's 10.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Turning to the impact of Chen's choice of fellow party member
Annette Lu as his running mate, 43.5 percent said they believe that
the decision will benefit Chen's presidential bid; 12 percent said
the move will have a negative impact.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 65.8 percent said they think that Lu will help
boost Chen's support among women voters; but 16.4 percent said they
don't think Lu can help Chen attract female supporters.</P>
      <P>As much as 93.5 percent said they would go to the polls on
the 2000 presidential election day, while 2 percent said they would
not and 4.5 percent said they have yet to make a final decision on
whether to cast their ballots.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the results of a similar opinion survey conducted
by the United Daily News on Friday show that Soong's support rating
declined to 24 percent in the wake of the "financial impropriety
allegations" against him. On the contrary, the supporting rates for
Chen and Lien both surged to 23 percent. This was the first time
that the three chief contestants' support ratings were so
close in the paper's presidential election-related polls conducted
over past few months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECORD NUMBER OF RARE BIRDS GRACE TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is graced by the arrival of a
record number of blackfaced spoonbills, an endangered species, this
year, a wild bird conservation group reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, 463 blackfaced spoonbills had been discovered in
the area surrounding the mouth of the Tsengwenchi River in Chiku
township of Tainan County in southern Taiwan, the Tainan Blackfaced
Spoonbills Conservation Association said.</P>
      <P>The number marked an increase of about 100 birds over the figure
recorded last year, the association said, adding that the number has
increased steadily since the first rare bird was spotted in the Chiku
area in September.</P>
      <P>The association said the increase might resulted from natural
expansion of the species. It might also be triggered by certain
problems seen in the species' other natural habitats, thus prompting
a large number of the birds to fly to Taiwan to avoid frigid cold in
the north.</P>
      <P>Blackfaced spoonbills are migrant birds which usually fly to
Taiwan from the north to spend winter and return to their original
habitats the following spring.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong-based consulting company will conduct a global survey
of blackfaced spoonbills in January next year. By then, the
association said, the reasons behind the increase in the number of
the rare birds to Taiwan will probably become clear.</P>
      <P>An international survey conducted a few years ago shows that the
number of surviving blackfaced spoonbills worldwide is about 600 to
700. As 300 to 400 of them consistently take shelter in Taiwan
each winter, the phenomenon has attracted much attention from
international wildlife conservation activists.</P>
      <P>A large crowd of bird watchers have visited the Chiku area in
recent days to observe the rare migrant birds. The association has
sent instructors to brief wild bird lovers on the features of
blackfaced spoonbills and the Chiku area ecological environment.</P>

      <P>Some 600 Falun Gong followers from
Hong Kong and at least seven countries in the world staged a
demonstration here Saturday, calling for an end to the government
crackdown on Falun Gong in China.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators sat silently in rows outside the Hong Kong
headquarters of China's official Xinhua News Agency first, and then
paraded to a nearby park. A spokesman for the demonstrators told the
press that they did not protest against anyone. He said they only
wanted Beijing leaders to know that Falun Gong is good to its
practitioners' health and mind, and that it won't hurt anyone.</P>
      <P>The Falun Gong followers, who are from Hong Kong, the United
States, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Great Britain, Singapore, Indonesia
and other countries, are in Hong Kong to participate in a two-day
symposium on their experience in practicing Falun Gong. It is a mix
of slow-motion Chinese traditional martial arts, meditation and
breathing techniques, and the teachings of Buddhism and Taoism. The
mainland Chinese government banned Falun Gong as an "evil cult" in
July.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa Saturday expressed grave
concern over the Falun Gong followers' activities in Hong Kong,
saying that they must observe Hong Kong laws and avoid doing anything
that may undermine the interest of Hong Kong, China, and their "one
country, two systems". President Jiang Enzhu of Xinhua headquarters
in Hong Kong also said Saturday that Hong Kong should not become a
Falun Gong base for infiltration into the Chinese mainland.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A strong cold air mass from mainland China
is moving southward, and will encompass Taiwan by Tuesday, predicted
the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The expected cold front would lower the island's temperature to
13 degrees Celsius, and the coldest temperatures are expected to
occur in the northern and central areas of Taiwan, said weather
forecasters, noting that such chilly weather could last for a few
days.</P>
      <P>The cold air current is expected to continue to affect the island
through at least next Sunday, the forecasters said.</P>
      <P>At present Taiwan remains affected by northeasterly monsoon
winds, which have led to pleasant weather. Sunday's daytime
temperature in northern Taiwan was moving upward to 23 degrees
Celsius from the early morning hours' 15 degrees, while that in the
south was expected to level out at 27 or 28 degrees Celsius, the CWB
reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, VIETNAM HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CLOSE TIES: ROC REPRESENTATIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A breakthrough in political relations with
Vietnam is difficult to pursue, but the substantial trade relations
between the Republic of China and that nation have always close, said
ROC Representative to Vietnam Hu Chia-chi on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hu noted that Vietnam shares a border with mainland China, and
considering the size contrast of the two nations, Vietnam is bound to
side with the mainland, especially considering the fact that both are
communist countries.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Hu said, in the foreseeable future, it would be overly
optimistic to expect a breakthrough in political relations with
Vietnam.</P>
      <P>But he also said both nations have developed close substantial
trade relations and Vietnam has realized the friendship of the ROC
and its contribution to that Southeast Asian nation's economy,
believing that the Taiwan experience would be the best model for
Vietnam in developing its economy and improving living standard of
its people.</P>
      <P>He noted that in November the first group of Vietnamese workers
arrived in Taiwan, saying that their high quality have caught the
attention of local people and predicting that there is room for
further growth in the number of Vietnamese workers on the island.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that the number of Vietnamese wives in Taiwan is
estimated at 20,000 and Taiwan businessmen investing in Vietnam
number 27,000. Civilian exchanges between the two nations are close,
and the substantial relations are becoming closer and more important
to both countries, he said.</P>
      <P>With the recent signing of agreements on labor cooperation and
cooperation in agricultural technology, relations between the two
nations are expected to grow even closer, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu added that his office is now working on several other goals,
including implementation of the two recently signed agreements and
revival of bilateral trade ministerial conferences. They are also
working toward the signing of trade agreements, a temporary admission
of goods agreement and memoranda of understanding on securities
cooperation and on protection of wildlife.</P>
      <P>Hu is scheduled to report on the current situation in Vietnam and
ROC-Vietnam relations to a legislative committee on Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WIDOW OF 'WHITE TERROR' VICTIM TELLS TRUE STORY OF 50 YEARS AGO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of elders, former students of a
contingent school in Penghu some 50 years ago, gathered Saturday at a
Taipei church to commemorate their principal who was sacrificed in
the White Terror campaign that bore numerous sad souls in Taiwan a
half-century ago.</P>
      <P>The senior citizens, in their 60s and 70s, prayed for Principal
Chang Min-chih, who was executed by Kuomintang security forces on
Dec. 11, 1949, for being a "communists' spy," and for peace for
Chang's surviving family, including his wife, Wang Pei-wu.</P>
      <P>Amid the sounds of solemn organ music, they read from the
just-released book "Principle on the Cross," a compilation of true
stories as told by the principal's wife, Wang, and jointly written by
former Legislator Kao Huei-yu and Liu Tai-ping, a senior staff writer
with the Taiwan Daily News.</P>
      <P>The book, according to the authors, is a record of the death of
Chang, principal of the Yentai Allied Middle School in Shandong, who
was authorized in 1949 to lead some 8,000 students from that northern
Chinese province to Taiwan in a national evacuation movement after
the Kuomintang, or the Nationalists, lost the civil war against the
Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Chang led the students to Penghu Island in the Taiwan Strait and
settled there in early 1949.</P>
      <P>On the morning of July 13, 1949, according to the book, the
Nationalist army marched onto the campus of the contingent school in
Penghu and ordered the students, ranging in age from 12 to 22, to lay
down their pencils and take up arms "at a time of national crisis."</P>
      <P>As no students showed willingness to join the military and some
expressed opposition to its undemocratic moves, the army fired on the
students, killing dozens and casting a shroud of deadly terror over
the campus.</P>
      <P>Chang, as head of the institute, shouted to the army officers his
indignation over the murders and forced conscription. Following the
event, he chose to protect the students and stand up to the military.</P>
      <P>After one month of standoff against the military, Chang decided
to go to the main island of Taiwan to meet with friends from Shandong
who held high government positions to seek assistance in persuading
the military to leave his students alone. He repeatedly failed to
obtain passage to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 15, when he was finally informed that there was a ticket
available for the ship to Taiwan, he was arrested aboard the vessel.
That was the last time that his wife and their 12-year-old son, Chang
Ping, saw him.</P>
      <P>Later that year, the Chang family was told that he had been
executed in Taipei on Dec. 11, on charges of spying for the Chinese
communists.</P>
      <P>Before he was executed, Chang and some 40 students of the
contingent school of Penghu were jailed in a prison in Taipei, all
standing accused of spying for the communists.</P>
      <P>On her own, Wang raised the six children she had with Chang,
surviving on limited material supplies. All the children, however,
received good education and later settled in the United States.</P>
      <P>Their eldest son, Chang Ping, who has the clearest memory of the
reign of White terror, returned to Taiwan as a scholar in the 1970s,
seeking justice and trying to clear the name of his father. The six
grown children jointly appealed to the government in 1989 to restore
Chang's reputation. Their efforts, however, were in vain.</P>
      <P>In that Penghu tragedy, some 100 students were victimized along
with Principal Chang, according to the book.</P>

      <P>So-called "E-shoppers" in Asia are mostly
men, according to the latest survey on Asian consumers released
Sunday by VISA International Service Association.</P>
      <P>The survey, designed to study consumption via the Internet,
showed that in Asia the number of male respondents who said they are
willing to buy goods using computers is two times that of women who
answered the questionnaire.</P>
      <P>Forty percent of the surveyed Asians said they will spend more
money on Internet shopping in the future, while one-third of those
polled revealed their plan to buy Christmas gifts through the
Internet.</P>
      <P>Forty-two percent of survey respondents said they had shopped on
Internet service networks. The figure is made up of 30 percent male
and 12 percent female consumers, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Results also showed that 62 percent of E-shopping lovers are 30
years old or older, revealing that currently male 30-something
consumers are the mainstream of E-shoppers in Asia.</P>
      <P>Convenience, a variety of choices, and shopping with minimal
physical exertion were cited as the main reasons why consumers want
to buy things in cyberspace. The most popular Internet shops among
Asian E-consumers are the Amazon bookstore and Yahoo, according to
the VISA survey.</P>
      <P>The poll pointed out that books, computers and related products,
electronic household appliances, cosmetics, and jewels are the items
most commonly purchased by E-shoppers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3 PHILIPPINE OFFICIALS TO ARRIVE FOR  AVIATION TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of three Philippine officials,
including Jacinto F. Ortega, director of the Civil Aeronautic Board,
will arrive in Taipei Monday to resume talks on the suspended
Aviation Pact between Taiwan and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The two other members of the delegation are Eduardo C. Galang and
Lito A. Mondragon, both members of the board.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautic Board comprises five members, and any
decisions are made by a majority of votes. That three board members
are traveling to Taipei to signify that they have the right to make a
decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Philippines unilaterally abrogated the Taipei-Manila Aviation
Pact signed in 1996 after two rounds of talks were held. The two
sides failed to reach an agreement because the Philippines insisted
on cutting the weekly passenger quota for Taiwan air carriers from
9,600 to 3,000 seats and revoking the sixth flight right to continue
to a third-country destination.</P>
      <P>The suspended Taipei-Manila air links caused great inconvenience
to those travelers going between Taipei and Manila, especially for
those Filipinos who work in Taiwan. More than 200,000 Philippine
workers are employed on the island. Most of them wish to return home
for family reunions at Christmas and the New Year's holiday.</P>
      <P>The Philippine side, therefore, reinstated its recognition of the
1996 Taipei-Manila Aviation Pact as one of the preconditions for
resuming talks set forth by the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>However, the remaining knotted issue is whether or not Taipei and
Manila can agree on the disputed sixth flight right for third-country
destinations during the upcoming talks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Professor Chang Lin-cheng of National
Taiwan University said she expects that frozen relations between
Taiwan and mainland China will start thawing after the two sides join
the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The world trade regulatory body is expected to build a bridge of
communication between the two sides across the Taiwan Strait, Chang
said, explaining that under the WTO framework, Taiwan and the
mainland can start their contact by opening negotiations on economic
disputes.</P>
      <P>If the talks proceed in a smooth manner and lead to good results,
the two sides may be able to open talks on thorny political issues,
Chang noted in her speech Sunday at the 1999 board and membership
meeting of the Taipei-based Association for Promoting Peaceful
Unification of China.</P>
      <P>Chang indicated that she found Beijing has been anxious about the
Taiwan problem since Hong Kong returned to mainland rule in July,
1997, and has maintained that stance, with Macau set to revert to its
sovereignty from the Portuguese at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>But mainland authorities will not use military forces against

    <HEADLINE>82% OF PEOPLE IN FAVOR OF LONG-RANGE GROUND-TO-GROUND MISSILES: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An overwhelming majority of the people of
Taiwan are in favor of Vice President Lien Chan's proposal to develop
long-range ground-to-ground missiles, a recent poll showed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the poll conducted by the Public Opinion Association of the
Republic of China, 82 percent of those interviewed said they are
supportive of Lien's proposal, while only 9.8 percent said they do
not support the proposal, and 8.2 percent said they were unaware of
it.</P>
      <P>The public was also asked about Lien's proposal to visit the
mainland if he is elected president next year and whether his
strategy of "avoiding war, but not fearing war" would contribute to
win-win cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Some 50.9 percent of respondents said the strategy would
contribute to win-win cross-strait relations; some 19.5 percent felt
it unlikely to do so, while 29.7 percent said they had no opinion on
the issue.</P>
      <P>Professor Oung Ming-hsien of Tamkang University, in analyzing the
latest public poll results, noted that mainland China has recently
launched verbal attacks and a military intimidation campaign against
Taiwan, so Lien's proposal has won the support of most people in this
time of public aversion for Beijing's intimidation.</P>
      <P>Oung said that policies on national defense, foreign affairs and
cross-strait relations will be crucial in the presidential election
and will be unavoidable issues for presidential candidates.</P>
      <P>He said Lien's strategy has won the high approval rating of the
public and the vice president is bound to win the approval and trust
of the voters.</P>
      <P>On Lien's proposal to visit mainland China if he wins the
presidential election next year, in order to establish a high-ranking
communications channel as a way to dissolve mainland threats, some
62.3 percent of respondents said they approved of the proposal; 13.9
percent said they are not supportive of it, and 23.8 percent had no
opinion on the matter.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 74.8 percent of respondents believed
political leaders "should clearly explain their strategy on
cross-strait relations and national defense," while only 8.5 percent
said there is no need for clear explanation, and 16.7 percent had no
opinion on that issue.</P>
      <P>The association conducted the survey islandwide between Dec. 9
and 11 with participants over 20 years old; the effective sample
totaled 1,207.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Taiwan-based EVA Airways and
China Airlines (CAL) will reduce the number of flights to and from
Taiwan around the Y2K rollover, airline sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways decided to cancel flights between New York and Taipei
and flights from Los Angeles to Taipei between midnight Dec. 31 and
noon Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>The reduction was designed on the grounds that people are
psychologically influenced by possible Y2K-related flight security
risks and an across-the-board reduction in the number flights, which
was called by the International Civil Aeronautic Organization,
effective during the rollover period between 1999 and the year 2000,
according to an EVA official in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>CAL decided to cancel flights between Los Angeles and Taipei,
flights between San Francisco and Taipei, and flights from Taipei to
New York between 9 p.m. on Dec. 31 and 12 noon on Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>A CAL representative called the reduction essential due to
worries of would-be passengers about the Y2K effect, as well as an
expected shortage of crew members during the holiday period.</P>
      <P>All EVA Air and CAL flights between Taiwan and the United States
are expected to resume normal operations beginning at noon on Jan. 1,
2000, the two airlines said.</P>

is planning to cancel 122 domestic and 57 international flights

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan and running mate
Premier Vincent Siew came from behind and now lead the three main
tickets of presidential hopefuls, according to results of the latest
poll by the Public Opinions Association of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The poll shows that 20 percent of respondents supported the
Lien-Siew team, followed by former Taiwan Gov. James Soong and Chang
Chao-hsiung with a 19.3 percent approval rating; 16.3 percent went to
Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
presidential candidate, former Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian and
Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>However, 38.8 percent of respondents said they have not yet made
a final decision on their choice, the poll shows.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,207 adults throughout the island was
conducted from Dec. 9 to 11 by the association.</P>
      <P>Analysis by Chu Li-min of National Chengchi University revealed
that Soong's popularity rating, apparently affected by his son's
stock scandal, has dramatically dropped from the prior 30 percent to
19.3 percent when the survey was initiated, the same day news of the
scandal broke.</P>
      <P>The poll also shows that 53.5 percent of supporters of the ruling
Kuomintang responded in support of the Lien-Siew combination, while
16.9 percent of the KMT-backers among the respondents expressed their
support for the Soong-Chang ticket.</P>
      <P>Liang Teh-sheng of Catholic Fujen University said this indicates
that those who had previously backed Soong have switched their
support to the Lien-Siew pair.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 64.5 percent of the opposition DPP's
supporters favored the Chen-Lu combination.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that Lien led the pack in terms of
odds to win the 2000 presidential election scheduled to be held on
March 18, 2000, with 37.6 percent saying that they expect to see
Lien's victory. Soong trailed in second place, with 22.4 percent
believing he will be victorious; Chen ranked third, with only 7

      <P>Among the three key presidential hopefuls, Chen topped the list
as the least popular, with 21.1 percent of respondents saying they
would dislike seeing Chen win the presidency; followed by Soong at
18.6 percent; and Lien with 8 percent.</P>

order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you can also make the
people keep away from wrongdoing, but they will lose the sense of
shame for wrongdoing. If, on the other hand, in government you depend
upon moral sentiment, and maintain order by encouraging education and
good manners, the people will have a sense of shame for wrongdoing
and moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>WEI JINGSHENG HOPES TO VISIT TAIWAN BEFORE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Kuo Wu-huan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prominent mainland Chinese dissident Wei
Jingsheng told the CNA Sunday that if given the chance, he would like
to visit Taiwan again before the March presidential election to view
the progress of democracy on the island.</P>
      <P>Wei said a first-hand observation of the presidential election,
which is one of the most important democratic processes in Taiwan,
would be absolutely beneficial to mainland China's democratization.</P>
      <P>Wei added that he has attached great importance to Taiwan's
democratic development because Taiwan remains the one and only area
in the world politically controlled by Chinese people that is
democratic.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said that maintaining Taiwan's interests is
tantamount to maintaining a source of hope for democratization in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Regarding the March presidential election, Wei said he is very
concerned about two feelings that the Taiwanese public in general has
that are not necessarily correct. One is that the Chinese communists
will not attack Taiwan militarily, and the other is that the United
States will intervene if military conflict erupts across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Wei warned that the Chinese communists, as a whole, are basically
a daring group willing to take risks. Citing history as an example,
Wei said that some 50 years ago the Chinese communists managed to
defeat the Nationalist forces and take control of the whole mainland
with proportionally fewer capabilities, simply because they "dared
to."</P>
      <P>He asked the people of Taiwan to avoid thinking that mainland
Chinese forces will not attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wei also said that according to his information gathered from the
United States, Washington would not come to Taiwan's rescue under any
circumstances.</P>
      <P>Wei, currently visiting Germany and scheduled to meet with
Germany's Foreign Affairs Minister Joschka Fischer Monday afternoon,
said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has been "too friendly" to China
since he assumed office.</P>
      <P>He said this policy is starkly different from that of the Social
Democratic Party and the Greens to which he had close relations
before becoming chancellor. Wei said he would try to find out the
reasons behind Shroeder's changed attitude.</P>
      <P>He said the German government must free itself from the illusion
of the huge potential for economic opportunities in mainland China,
saying that in fact there is not.</P>
      <P>Wei, who had been imprisoned for 18 years in mainland China for
his pro-democracy activities and criticism of Beijing authorities,
last visited Taiwan in December 1998.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTRODUCTION OF VIETNAMESE LABORERS SAID BENEFICIAL TO BOTH NATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The introduction of Vietnamese laborers to
Taiwan has been beneficial to both countries, Hu Chia-chi, the
Republic of China representative to Vietnam, said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu, reporting to a legislative committee about the current
situation in Vietnam and in ROC-Vietnam relations, noted the first
group of Vietnamese laborers arrived in Taiwan late last month, and
the high quality of their work has won the accolade of local
employers.</P>
      <P>He described the Vietnamese laborers as both diligent and
intelligent and as sharing the same customs as the local people. He
predicted that more Vietnamese laborers will likely be invited to
come to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from Legislator Hung Tu of the ruling
Kuomintang, Hu said that the laborers first learned Mandarin Chinese
before coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that, along with English, the study of the Mandarin
language has become popular in the southeast Asian nation.</P>
      <P>Hu said that relations between the two countries are close and
becoming increasingly important, noting that currently more than
20,000 Vietnamese women have married Taiwanese men, while more than
27,000 Taiwanese are doing business in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Tsai of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party expressed his concern about a assessment report by the United
States that stated the South China Sea could be the most likely spot
of clashes, and asked Hu whether mainland China is likely to clash
with Vietnam or the ROC in the area.</P>
      <P>Hu said that he has not heard about the report or any related
news.</P>
      <P>Another DPP Legislator Parris Chang asked whether Hu has
explained to Vietnam the ROC government's redefinition of
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship." Hu
responded that he has elaborated on the redefinition which is based
on historical fact.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the Vietnamese government has kept a low profile on
the redefinition, resulting in great discontent in Beijing. The
mainland government has hoped that Vietnam will express clearly that
it is opposed to the redefinition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA QUESTIONS BENEFITS OF BEIJING'S NEW RULES ON TAIWAN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on
Monday questioned the ultimate benefits of the new rules that Beijing
unveiled recently on Taiwan investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Officials from MOEA's Investment Commission said the new rules,
which supplement regulations issued in 1994, are just part of the
mainland's domestic laws and have not been endorsed by the relevant
Taiwan authoritative agencies after bilateral consultations.</P>
      <P>As prohibitively unclear as mainland China's investment
environment is, it is hard to believe that it could be improved
overnight simply by publicizing a notice of some new rules,
Investment Commission officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, they pointed out that related articles pertaining to
the property and personal security of Taiwanese business people in
mainland China are virtually non-existent.</P>
      <P>Commission officials believe that Beijing publicized the new
rules at this time because both overall foreign investment and
Taiwanese investment on the mainland have continued to diminish over
the past year, with overall foreign capital inflows declining some 10
percent over the previous year's levels.</P>
      <P>According to Investment Commission tallies, officially-approved
Taiwan investment on the mainland was 21.57 percent lower in value
and 28.9 percent lower in the number of investment projects in the
first 10 months of this year as compared to the same period of the
previous year.</P>
      <P>The officials said the only way to properly protect the interests
of Taiwan businesses on the mainland is for Beijing to put the issue
of investment guarantees on the cross-strait dialogue agenda. Only an
investment guarantee agreement stated in black and white terms could
serve that purpose, they noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Po-chih, an economics professor at National
Taiwan University, said Beijing's newly publicized rules for Taiwan
investment could at best only offset a small portion of the impact on
Taiwan businesses on the mainland after both Taiwan and mainland
China are admitted into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Foreseeing that the competitiveness of Taiwan businesses on the
mainland could diminish after the two sides enter the WTO, Chen
called for would-be Taiwanese investors on the mainland to think
twice, particularly about their competitiveness, before making any
moves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONE-YEAR CONSCRIPTION TERM 'NOT IMPOSSIBLE': MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of 43 legislators came up with a
draft bill on Monday, calling for amendments to the existing Military
Conscription Law to halve the mandatory service period to one year.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the amendment bill, Defense Minister Tang Fei said
shortening the conscription term is not a "mission impossible," but
some prerequisites, particularly budgetary issues, must be met.</P>
      <P>Opposition Legislator Chien Hsi-kun, who initiated the amendment
bill, said at a joint meeting of the Legislative Yuan's defense and
interior affairs committees that since Taiwan has entered a high-tech
combat preparation period, the importance of conscripted servicemen
in its military build-up plans has declined.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chien said, the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) should cut the conscription term to one year from the
current two years so that more young men can enter the local job
market and help upgrade Taiwan's national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Noting that only career soldiers are capable of operating the
country's second-generation weaponry systems and high-tech defense
equipment, Chien said mandatory-service personnel can only assume
less-important combat preparatory tasks.</P>
      <P>"Experiences of foreign countries that implement conscription
systems show that it takes only about one year for conscripts to
complete basic combat training," Chien said, adding that the current
two-year conscription period is too long. "We should shorten the term
in order to better use our manpower resources to upgrade our domestic
labor participation rate and overall national competitiveness."</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chien said he opposes the Cabinet's proposal to install
an "alternative" military service system, which he said would give a
false impression that the system is formulated for the privileged or
for those who do not have a clean bill of health.</P>
      <P>Chien said the MND should instead enforce a professional social
service system for older conscripts or those who have minor physical
problems.</P>
      <P>Chien also proposed that the social service term be set at one
and a half years because the work is less dangerous.</P>
      <P>In response, Minister Tang said the Ministry of National Defense
would not rule out the possibility of cutting the mandatory military
service period so long as some conditions, particularly budgetary
demands, can be met.</P>
      <P>Under the MND's current troop-reduction plan, Tang said, the
total number of the country's armed forces will be cut to 400,000
from the current 450,000.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy, Tang said, the military can gradually
reduce the number of conscripted servicemen while increasing the
number of voluntary career soldiers.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chien's proposal can be implemented when the ratio of
career soldiers to overall armed forces roughly equals that of
conscripted servicemen, Tang said the military needs a greatly
increased budget to recruit additional career soldiers.</P>
      <P>Tang said the MND has begun an in-depth study of the feasibility
of cutting the mandatory military service period, including related
budgetary and funding problems.</P>

      <P>Russia, mainland China, India and
Indonesia are likely to come to some form of an alliance in order to
balance the power of the United States and its Western allies,
according to a report in the Australian Financial Review on Monday.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted political experts as saying that Russian and
Chinese leaders have called for a multi-polar world in their efforts
to balance the Western hegemony in the post-Cold War era.</P>
      <P>Russia, a crippled giant, has moved to improve relations with
China, a second-rate power, and India, which does not enjoy the
international power and status due to a country of its size and
capabilities, according to a recent Stratfor intelligence update for
Defense Data Ltd., the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Both Russia and China also moved to build bridges to Indonesia,
whose President Abdurrahman Wahid is looking to China as a possible
source of weapons and spare parts after Jakarta suspended its
military ties with Australia and the tougher US ban on military sales
to Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Wahid said recently that he looked forward to a possible alliance
between India, China and Indonesia to help rectify the lopsided power
of the West.</P>
      <P>Russia and China have established close cooperation on
space-related activities, with Moscow pledging to help Beijing
conduct its first manned space flight early next year.</P>
      <P>The US and its Western allies would likely view an alliance
between the four powers with concern because Russia, China, India and
Indonesia comprise most of the Eurasian land mass and roughly half
the world's population, and they possess significant resources and
formidable skills, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT INNER STRUGGLE BIGGEST THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The inner struggle of the ruling Kuomintang
is the biggest threat to national security, said the presidential
hopeful of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian made the remark at a press conference after
meeting with Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen slammed Vice President and KMT-nominated presidential
candidate Lien Chan's proposal that the Republic of China develop
long-range surface-to-surface missiles, describing Lien as "hawkish."</P>
      <P>The former Taipei mayor stressed the importance of national
security and his determination to maintain peace across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said he could not imagine that Lien is actually advocating
that the ROC develop offensive weapons such as long-range (3,000 km
to 5,000 km) surface-to-surface missiles, which could hit targets as
far away as Xinjiang, northwestern China.</P>
      <P>Chen said the DPP strongly asserts that Taiwan should focus on
upgrading its defense capability, rather than on developing offensive
weapons.</P>
      <P>Chen said purchasing additional weapons is not the only way to
safeguard Taiwan's security. He said that in addition to the
procurement of weapons, national strategy as well as maintenance of
security in national political, economic, social and
energy-production fields should also be considered important,
especially political security.</P>
      <P>He indicated that unrest within the KMT caused by its inner
struggle is to blame for national instability.</P>
      <P>He again called for the KMT to end verbal attacks against its
rival competitors in the 2000 presidential election and present a
concrete platform on the ROC's future development.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that if he wins the presidential election he
would like to visit mainland China before the inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>He also commented on the remark by mainland Chinese Ambassador to
the United States Li Zhaoxing while meeting members of a
pro-unification group from Taiwan that, as far as he was concerned,
with the exception of Chen Shui-bian, any other candidate could be
elected Taiwan's new leader in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen responded that no country's diplomat should interfere in any
other country's internal affairs.</P>
      <P>Li Zhaoxing was quoted by members of the Taiwan delegation as
saying that although Chen has proposed a "new middle route," the DPP
still insists that the party incorporate "Taiwan independence" into
its platform, an ideal that is not acceptable to Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE-STRICKEN PEOPLE FRET OVER TAIWAN'S OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While there's hardly anyone who showed
indignation over the devastating 7.3-magnitude earthquake that hit
Taiwan Sept. 21, more than half the people in earthquake-stricken
areas said they are dissatisfied with the overall quality of life in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to results of the latest opinion poll conducted by
Academia Sinica's Institute of Social Sciences, there was hardly
anyone in the earthquake-stricken areas of central Taiwan who showed
indignation over the earthquake, which killed over 2,400 people,
injured some 8,000 and left more than 100,000 others temporarily
homeless.</P>
      <P>Most of them, however, sustained mental and psychological wounds
of various degrees and scopes in the wake of the deadly jolt.
Moreover, according to the poll, about 9 percent of central Taiwan
residents who had not incurred any property damage or losses also
sustained certain degrees of mental injury, said Chu Hai-yuan, a
researcher with the institute.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 52 percent of respondents in
earthquake-stricken areas said they are dissatisfied with Taiwan's
overall quality of life, while 77 percent said they are angry about
the island's public order.</P>
      <P>While 50 percent of them considered the post-quake rescue and
relief work carried out by the Executive Yuan and relevant county and
city governments as "satisfactory," 45 percent of them considered the
performances of lower-level public offices as "OK," the poll found.</P>
      <P>About 36 percent of respondents said their economic situation has
worsened and quality of life has been aggravated since the
earthquake, as some 27 percent painted gloomy prospects of their
future lives.</P>
      <P>Compared with 97 percent of couples who said they had a close and
harmonic relationship before the earthquake, nearly 20 percent said
their husband-wife relations and relationships with other relatives
became even closer and more cordial than before the quake, according
to Hsiao Hsin-huang, another Academia Sinica researcher who
cosponsored the poll.</P>

internet businesses were targeted by institutional investors as the
two industries are experiencing a global boom.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE REITERATES 'SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE' STANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui reiterated on Monday
that the "special state-to-state relationship" theory is the Republic
of China's basic stance on relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement while meeting with American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard Bush, who is currently on a nine-day
visit here.</P>
      <P>Lee told the top US liaison officer with Taiwan that the ROC is
willing to negotiate or handle any issue related to mainland China
or adjust its strategy toward relations across the Taiwan Strait
under the premise of "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Lee said for the first time in an interview with a German radio
station on July 9 this year that cross-strait ties should be defined
as a "special state-to-state relationship." His definition drew
furious response from Beijing which has consistently downgraded the
ROC as a local-level government and refused to treat it on an equal
footing.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC was established in 1912, Lee said it's an
undeniable historical and legal fact that the ROC is an independent
sovereign state. "The ROC was founded long before the People's
Republic of China came into being in 1949."</P>
      <P>Lee further stressed that the ROC, while recognizing the PRC's
jurisdiction over the Chinese mainland, effectively controls the
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu areas.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lee told Bush that the "special state-to-state
relationship" definition just affirms a cold reality, adding the ROC
can never accept Beijing's claim that the PRC represents the central
government while the ROC is only a local-level government.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that the ROC has formed a National
Unification Council, with promoting China's reunification under
freedom and democracy as its ultimate goal. "Nevertheless, before
this goal is realized, the ROC's existence and development should
not be denied and ignored," Lee added.</P>
      <P>In the face of imminent accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Lee said
that so long as Beijing shows enough goodwill toward Taiwan and
make positive response to Taiwan's call for resumption of
dialogue, the ROC is more than willing to review its current
cross-strait trade policy in order to meet the world trade regulatory
body's requirements and spirit.</P>
      <P>Bush arrived in Taiwan last Tuesday to inspect the operations of
the AIT Taipei office, also the de facto US embassy in Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Also present at the Lee-Bush meeting were ROC Foreign Minister
Chen Chien-jen; John Chang, secretary-general to the President; and
AIT Taipei Office Director-General Raymond Burghardt.</P>
      <P>Chen said the meeting proceeded in an amicable atmosphere and
lasted longer than originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Bush had brought any US message to President
Lee, Chen said he is not in a position to answer the question.</P>
      <P>This is Bush's third visit to Taiwan this year. In addition to
inspecting AIT operations, Bush will also meet with senior ROC
officials and the three main contestants for the ROC's presidential
election scheduled for March 18, 2000. He will give a press
conference on Wednesday to brief media on the results of his current
visit.</P>

      <P>The United States has approved an
application by a subsidiary of Taiwan's First Commercial Bank (FCB)
to set up a branch in Silicon Valley, California, said FCB officials
on Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said the new branch of FCB Taiwan California Bank,

18th branch worldwide, and it is expected to be operational by April
next year.</P>

anniversary on Nov. 26, will continue to establish footholds in
Taiwan and overseas where Chinese converge, hoping to provide its
customers with better financial service.</P>
      <P>They said that they are now working on setting up a branch in San

have most overseas footholds among local banks.</P>

      <P>The vice presidential candidate of the main

    <HEADLINE>ENTREPRENEUR SEES `BOON' IN NEW BEIJING RULES FOR TAIWAN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New rules unveiled by Beijing governing
Taiwan investment in mainland China will be a boon for Taiwan
businessmen, a Taiwan entrepreneur said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI), said that the new rules are the result of years of
effort by Taiwan businessmen, and that he believed all Taiwan
businessmen will be glad to see their implementation.</P>
      <P>Kao, who is also the chairman of Taiwan's President Group, is
well-qualified to speak on the issue, as his group has invested in
the mainland since 1992, but has only this year seen profits from its
mainland foodstuff interests.</P>
      <P>On whether President will continue to expand its investment in
the mainland, Kao said that the Republic of China government-imposed
investment ceiling on a Taiwan company's investment on the
mainland has nearly been reached, and the group will need to conduct
an overall assessment before investing further.</P>
      <P>Kao noted that the new rules provide Taiwan businessmen with
basic legal protection until the two sides of the Taiwan Strait join
the World Trade Organization, which he described as "a boon" for
Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>The rules unveiled by Beijing on Sunday came after Taiwan
businessmen complained to Beijing that 1994 regulations governing
Taiwan investment in the mainland are hollow and insubstantial.</P>
      <P>The new rules, aimed at wooing further Taiwan investment, provide
"national" treatment for Taiwan businessmen, giving them a level
playing field in areas such as purchasing equipment and services, and
obtaining credit and loans. Taiwan businessmen also get preferential
treatment with regard to investment and tax.</P>
      <P>However, there is still a dearth of substantial protection on the
property and personal security of Taiwan businessmen in mainland
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE SEIZE DRUGS SMUGGLED FROM MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By  Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
announced on Monday that it has formed a special task force to
investigate a large illegal drug smuggling case which police said
might be masterminded by Taiwan ringleaders hiding in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Police seized about 30 kilograms of high-grade heroin in Yungkang
township in southern Taiwan's Tainan County on Sunday and arrested
four suspects.</P>
      <P>The 79 heroin bricks, with an estimated street value of NT$300
million (about US$9.5 million), were discovered in a Yungkang house
rented by Wang Shui-lung, 49, who allegedly smuggled the contraband
drugs from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Police first spotted Wang in a rubber boat off the coast of the
southern Taiwan county of Pingtung at 4 a.m. on Sunday. The CIB then
deployed a large number of policemen in the vicinity of Wang's house.</P>
      <P>Wang and his three accomplices, including an illegal mainland
Chinese immigrant, were arrested as they were taking four travel bags
containing the heroin into the house.</P>
      <P>Wang's three accomplices were identified as his younger brother
Wang Shui-sung, Chang Shih-ming and Lin Yueh-chi, an illegal mainland
immigrant.</P>
      <P>Both Wang and Chang have long criminal records, and Wang was also
a key suspect in a 1983 Pingtung firearms smuggling case.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that in recent years, Wang has used
false or doctored passports to travel across the Taiwan Strait in
order to smuggle drugs and firearms from mainland China to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Police said Wang's younger brother also traveled to the mainland
in late November to assist Wang in handling the latest haul, and
returned to Taiwan on Dec. 2. He had been kept under
intensive surveillance since that time.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the investigative team said a large portion of
the heroin seized on Sunday belonged to a southern Taiwan-based drug
dealer who allegedly had given Wang NT$50 million to purchase the
drugs. Sources further said the dealer had close ties with Chan
Lung-lan, a notorious local drug and firearms smuggler who is
believed to be hiding on the mainland.</P>
      <P>As the size of the haul was very large, police said they believe
that in addition to the assistance of mainland-based drug
traffickers, Wang could also have other accomplices in Taiwan,
including downstream distributors, and vowed to bring all the
suspects to justice.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan consume an average
total of NT$250 million (US$7.9 million)-worth of pharmaceuticals
every day, the National Health Insurance Bureau said on Monday.</P>
      <P>According to bureau tallies, spending on pharmaceuticals in the
first 10 months of this year reached NT$76.9 billion, nearly double
the level recorded four years ago.</P>
      <P>The bureau said when the National Health Insurance Program was
inaugurated in 1995, the annual pharmaceutical bill was slightly more
than NT$40 billion.</P>
      <P>The amount increased to NT$54 billion the following year, surged
to NT$60 billion in 1997, and exceeded NT$70 billion in 1998,
according to official statistics.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials jokingly described the large increase in
pharmaceutical consumption as another Taiwan "miracle," but pointed
out on a more serious note that some local people seem to have
developed an "addiction" to taking home large amounts of medicines,
even when they do not have any serious illness.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, the officials went on, some others have got into the
habit of taking medicines without following doctors' instructions on
dosage.</P>
      <P>A comparative study conducted by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health a few years ago found that local people take an average of 4.1
tablets at a time, more than double the average of between 1.7 and

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking official of the ruling
Kuomintang on Monday criticized opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) presidential hopeful Chen Shui-bian's mainland China
policy as a coin with two contradictory sides.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with American Institute on Taiwan (AIT) Chairman
Richard Bush, Chang Jung-kung, director of the Mainland Research 
Department of the KMT Central Committee, said that on one side, Chen
seeks "a battle" with mainland China over Taiwan's independent
stance, while on the other, he seeks peace between Taiwan and the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang also pointed out that Chen on Monday criticized Vice
President Lien Chan, the presidential candidate of the KMT, for what
he called a "hawkish" proposal to develop long-range
surface-to-surface missiles.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that in fact, the KMT's mainland China policy
provides firm security for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that Chen shouted "long live Taiwan
independence!" when he met with pro-independence "hawks" ten days
ago, but that he told Bush on Monday that he will seek peaceful
cross-strait ties if elected.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence "hawks" gave very high marks to Chen's
"third way" or "middle-of-the-road" policy because of Chen's firm
insistence that Taiwan independence is the highest guiding principle
for the DPP's mainland China policy, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Chen has no new middle-of-the-road line,
describing Chen's stance as old pro-independence slogans mixed with
some new ones.</P>
      <P>If Chen is a "qualified politician with character," he should
call on the people to prepare for "a battle for independence,"
according to Chang, who added that to do otherwise by seeking peace
with the mainland at the same time as independence for Taiwan is no
more than wishful thinking.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S RULES UNLIKELY TO SPARK NEW WAVE OF TAIWAN INVESTMENT: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Monday that new rules unveiled by Beijing governing
Taiwan investment in mainland China are unlikely to spark another
wave of Taiwan investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that although the new rules address some existing
concerns of Taiwan businessmen, they have not met their basic
interests and needs.</P>
      <P>It noted that Beijing, in order to lure Taiwan investment to the
mainland, first presented regulations in 1988 to encourage Taiwan
investment in the mainland, followed by promulgation in 1994 of
regulations governing protection of Taiwan investments.</P>
      <P>The MAC said the new rules unveiled on Sunday are similar to the
1994 regulations, and added that their unveiling at this time is on
one hand part of a "united front" strategy, and on the other an
attempt to reverse the slowdown of Taiwan investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to Investment Commission tallies, officially approved
Taiwan investments on the mainland were 21.57 percent lower in value
and 28.9 percent lower in the number of projects in the first 10
months of his year compared to the same period of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The MAC noted that the economic situation in the mainland is
unstable, and that Beijing has continued to display a two-handed
strategy toward Taiwan. It urged Taiwan businessmen to carefully
assess investment risks in the mainland before channeling their money
there.</P>
      <P>The council said Taiwan businesses should base themselves firmly
in Taiwan, before investing in the mainland from a position of
strength, adding that only in this way can a win-win situation be
created for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>It further pointed out that the new rules are internal laws of
the mainland, and do not respect the fact of separate rule on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MAC urged the mainland authorities to see the importance of
cross-strait dialogue in protecting the rights of Taiwan investors.
It also urged an early resumption of cross-strait dialogue to discuss
issues of greatest concern to Taiwan businessmen, including mediation
and arbitration of cross-strait trade disputes and the protection of
intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's new rules, an official of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said that the rules, which
were retroactive to Dec. 5, are bound to encourage Taiwan and
foreign investors in the mainland in the short term, but warned that
in the long term, Taiwan businessmen should take heed of investment
risks in the mainland, as the mainland is not under the rule of law,
and the new rules are only administrative orders.</P>
      <P>Thomas Yeh, CEPD secretary-general, said that Taiwan and foreign
investors have helped create rich export foreign exchange reserves
for the mainland. To speed up its trade development, however, the
mainland has to rely on more investment from Taiwan and foreign
investors to deal with the increasingly fierce competition.</P>
      <P>But Hu Chung-ying, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, said that the new rules will not spark new investment
fever among Taiwan businessmen, saying that if the mainland
authorities will not even allow Taiwan banks to set up representative
offices in the mainland, it will be difficult for them to lure Taiwan
businessmen.</P>
      <P>The semi-official China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) also said that the new rules unveiled by Beijing are only a
promulgation of the principles, and that they give substantial leeway
to the mainland agencies who actually implement the rules.</P>
      <P>Ricky Kao, CETRA secretary-general, said that Taiwan businessmen
still have to be on guard when planning to invest in the mainland.</P>
      <P>He added that it remains to be seen whether there will be further
regulations to protect Taiwan businessmen once the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait enter the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Beijing's new rules provide national treatment for Taiwan
businessmen, giving them the same treatment as mainlanders in areas
such as purchasing equipment and services and obtaining credit and
loans. Taiwan businessmen also get preferential treatment with regard
to tax and investment. Taiwan businessmen coming from third places
are also afforded the same protection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRODUCTIVITY IN TAIWAN'S MANUFACTURING SECTOR GROWS 7.3 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Productivity in Taiwan's manufacturing
sector during the first three quarters of 1999 grew 7.3 percent
year-on-year, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The annual growth rate was higher than Singapore's 6.9 percent
and Japan's 1.3 percent, according to a DGBAS-issued report on
Taiwan's current economic situation.</P>
      <P>Average monthly pay for Taiwan's manufacturing sector employees
between January and September this year was NT$38,286 (US$1,210), up
2.4 percent from the same period of last year, in comparison with
South Korea's 10.2 percent, Singapore's 1.4 percent, and Japan's
negative 2.1 percent, said an official with the Cabinet-level agency.</P>
      <P>Affected by the slow growth in monthly pay and stabilized prices
of international raw materials, Taiwan's wholesale prices dropped 5.1
percent in the nine-month period, compared with Japan's negative 3.7
percent, South Korea's negative 2.3 percent, and Singapore's 0.4
percent, the official noted.</P>
      <P>As for interest rates, the report showed that Japan's basic rate
on loans stood at 1.4 percent, the lowest among the four countries
listed in the survey, followed by Singapore's 5.4 percent, Taiwan's
7.2 percent and South Korea's 8.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Due to sustained inflow of foreign capital and growing expansion
of Taiwan's trade surplus, the island's currency has recently
recorded a gradual appreciation against the US dollar, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>However, the official said appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar
against the greenback has been much lower than that of Japan's and
South Korea's currencies. As of late November, the local unit had
appreciated by 1.7 percent against the US dollar, while the yen and
the won rose by 12.6 percent and 3.9 percent against the greenback,
respectively, and the Singapore dollar depreciated by 1.5 percent
during the same period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO HEED BEIJING'S NEW RULES GOVERNING TAIWAN INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan entrepreneur on Monday urged the
Republic of China government to deal with Beijing's new rules
governing Taiwan investment in the mainland squarely to avoid more
Taiwan manufacturers being lured to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Tai Sheng-tung, chairman of the Association of Small- and
Medium-sized Enterprises, said Taiwan's industrial base will be
greatly affected by Beijing's unveiling of rules that give national
treatment to Taiwan businessmen in areas such as purchasing equipment
and service, and obtaining credit and loans.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen also get preferential treatment with regard to
investment and tax, according to the new rules.</P>
      <P>Tai said that if the government fails to address the situation
squarely, Taiwan capital, manufacturers and talent will be gradually
siphoned off to the mainland market.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example the fact that Taiwan businessmen have
invested a total of US$50 billion in the mainland over the past three
decades, and that many of Taiwan's biggest entrepreneurs have
established plants there.</P>
      <P>Not only have traditional local industries such as shoe and
umbrella manufacturers invested in the mainland, high-tech businesses
such as the electronics and computer sectors have also ploughed money
into the mainland.</P>
      <P>Tai suggested that the government should open Taiwan to imports
of mainland raw materials such as cotton, and review present trade
policies to stop the mainland from using seemingly attractive
measures to undermine Taiwan's industrial base and affect its
long-term development.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) on Monday
wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright again seeking
clarification on the Clinton administration's statements concerning
the US "one China" policy, which he described as a "most important
issue."</P>
      <P>Brown said in the letter that he has not received a response to
his Oct. 25 letter that sought similar clarification, adding that
"this is particularly distressing in light of President Clinton's
Dec. 8 statement that `our policy on China is crystal clear. We
believe there is one China.'"</P>
      <P>Brown pointed out that according to the 1972 Shanghai Communique,
the United States simply "acknowledges" Communist China's view that
there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of that China.</P>
      <P>But Brown stressed that "nowhere in that document are we bound to
agree with the PRC's view that Taiwan is a part of China.
Unfortunately, it appears the (Clinton) administration has assumed
the People's Republic's view of `one China' as its own."</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Brown sponsored a House resolution that
supports Taiwan's entry into the World Health Organization. The bill,
signed into law by the president last week, requires Albright to
report to Congress by Jan. 1, detailing the administration's efforts
to actively support Taiwan's "appropriate and meaningful
participation in the WHO and other international organizations."</P>

    <HEADLINE>IF ELECTED, BUCHANAN WOULD PUSH BEIJING AGENTS OUT OF PANAMA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Conservative American commentator Pat
Buchanan said Monday that if he were US president, his first order of
Western hemispheric business would be "to effect the peaceful
expulsion of any and all agents of Beijing from Panama, and to
reestablish a US presence in that country."</P>
      <P>Buchanan, who recently bolted the Republican Party to seek
nomination from the Reform Party for the year 2000 US presidential
election, pointed out in a statement that a generation ago, along
with Ronald Reagan, he opposed President Jimmy Carter's surrender of
the Panama Canal.</P>
      <P>"We insisted that the Canal was US property, its retention vital
to US security, and its transfer an unacceptable risk," he said.</P>
      <P>"History proved us right. To secure the Canal from a potential
threat, a decade ago, President Bush invaded (Panama). Tuesday's
transfer of all US bases in the former Canal Zone, as well as the Big
Ditch itself, now leaves this strategic asset in different, and
perhaps even hostile, hands," said the presidential hopeful.</P>
      <P>"The US bases from which we monitored drug flights out of
Colombia are gone. Critical US Army training facilities are gone.
Now, the Canal, crucial to victory in World War II and our security
and prosperity throughout this century, is gone. Ports at both ends
of the Canal will now be controlled by a company that answers to the
beck and call of an increasingly belligerent Beijing," continued
Buchanan.</P>
      <P>The renowned conservative commentator noted that "it is a mockery
of the Monroe Doctrine for America to stand idly by as Communist
Chinese reach for this vital artery of the US Navy and our $2
trillion world trade."</P>
      <P>"Were Theodore Roosevelt alive today, to watch a successor bomb
Serbia for 78 days because he said Kosovo was vital to us, as he
giddily surrendered the Panama Canal to agents of a dictatorial
China, the old Rough Rider would surely have concluded that his
country had fallen into the hands of thundering incompetents. And he
would be right," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Buchanan said that "only in some strange New World Order of
President Clinton's imaginings can a US presence in Bosnia call for a
four-year $12 billion US commitment, while the Panama Canal is let
go, when a tiny investment of a few millions of dollars could have
secured it."</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, his first order of Western hemispheric
business as president would be to send Communist China packing from
Panama.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH)
said on Tuesday it has formed a special task force to handle the
latest flight mishap involving a French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet
fighter.</P>
      <P>The single-seater Mirage, one of the 60 high-tech warplanes
that Taiwan has purchased from France, went missing during an
interception exercise off Taiwan's eastern coast near Hualien, AFGH
officials said.</P>
      <P>"The fighter, operated by Major Chiang Chin-liang, lost contact
with the military flight controllers at around 10:53 a.m." an AFGH
official said, adding that both the Air Force and the Navy have sent
helicopters and warships to search for signs of the plane and its
lone pilot.</P>
      <P>According to AFGH sources, the Mirage fighter No. 2036 took off
from the Hsinchu air base in northern Taiwan at 10 a.m. and flew to
the eastern city of Hualien for interception exercise. The plane,
however, lost contact with the flight controllers during its second
interception drill.</P>
      <P>Major Chiang, 31, was a graduate of the Chinese Air Force
Academy. The father of two young sons had a flight record of 1,181
hours. The missing Mirage's flight record was 275 hours.</P>
      <P>This was the second mishap involving a Mirage fighter in as many
months. On Oct. 15, a twin-seater Mirage crashed into the Taiwan
Strait after a bird was sucked into its engine. Two pilots aboard
the plane parachuted to safety and were rescued.</P>
      <P>Air Force authorities said it will carefully probe the cause of
the latest Mirage mishap. If necessary, the AFGH said it may ground
all Mirage fighters for comprehensive security checks.</P>
      <P>Since March 1998, Taiwan has lost four of its 150 US-made F-16
fighters. It is demanding compensation from Pratt &amp; Whitney, the US
maker of the engines that power its F-16s, alleging that an Aug. 15
crash was due to an engine malfunction.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 27th East Asia Economic Conference
opened here on Tuesday with more than 250 representatives from Japan
and the Republic of China participating.</P>
      <P>Sino-Japanese Economic &amp; Trade Foundation Chairman Ku Chen-fu and
his Japanese counterpart Akio Kosai headed delegations from the two
nations.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang, remarking on the ceremony,
said that though Taiwan's semiconductor industry was affected by the
devastating Sept. 21 earthquake, the island's high-tech industry has
displayed resilience, rebounding quickly.</P>
      <P>Wang predicted that Taiwan's economic growth this year could
reach its target of 5.5 percent, ranking it the sixth worldwide in
economic growth. Next year's growth could reach up to 6 percent.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan and Japan are geographically close and that
each nation's economic development could complement the other's, Wang
added that both countries excel in their own specific fields,
creating ample trade opportunities for bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Japan could increase its investment in
Taiwan's high-tech industry and that e-commerce could create more
trade opportunities for the two nations.</P>
      <P>Wang had earlier expressed the hope that Japan would increase
purchases from Taiwan to help address the huge trade deficit on
Taiwan's side.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports to Japan totaled US$9.3 billion last year, while
Japan's exports to Taiwan almost tripled that amount at US$27
billion.</P>
      <P>Chairman Koo said that he believed Taiwan-Japan trade
relations will become closer due to the development of Internet
industries and Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Kosai said that Japanese private investment and consumption are
still sluggish, but after the stimulus measures taken by the Japanese
government, economic growth this year should reach 0.2 percent, up
from the embarrassing negative growth over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Major issues slated to be discussed at the one-day meeting
included the current economic situation of the two nations,
cooperation between the two on post-quake reconstruction, and
measures to upgrade the national competitiveness of each country.</P>
      <P>The economic conference has been held alternately in Japan and
the ROC each year since the two nations severed diplomatic ties in
1972.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Victims of 14 miscarriage of justice cases
during Taiwan's martial law era will receive monetary compensation by
the end of the year, a government foundation said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-established foundation, responsible for screening
miscarriage of justice cases for alleged spying and treason during
the four decades of martial law that ended in 1987, said these are
the first rulings out of the 5,000 cases it has received since its
establishment earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Members of the foundation's board of directors ruled on
compensation for the 14 cases at a meeting held on Monday.</P>
      <P>The highest sum of compensation from among the 14 wrongful
convictions is NT$4.2 million (US$131,250) and the lowest amount is
NT$1.9 million, with a total of NT$36 million to be handed over to
victims, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>Out of consideration for the right to privacy, the foundation
will not make public the names of those victims or family members who
are entitled to receive compensation, the foundation said, adding
that the government is expected to complete procedures for awarding
the compensation money by the end of the year.</P>

years on charges of spying for Chinese communists, has not yet been

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices dropped 0.4 percent on
Tuesday, failing to continue the previous trading session's surging
trend over fears that fund managers could dump shares ahead of the
year 2000.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index closed
33.47 points lower at 7,850.14, and turnover expanded to NT$132.57
(US$4.20 billion), with 2.57 billion shares changing hands, of which
selling greatly exceeded buying by 41 million shares.</P>
      <P>Boosted by overnight gains on the US technology-heavy NASDAQ
index, the market opened 37.59 points, or 0.6 percent, higher with
recently popular internet-related stocks attracting the most
attention, but profit-taking later in the session sent the index into
negative territory.</P>
      <P>According to dealers, uncertainty over the investment strategies
of large funds leading up to the year 2000 triggered strong late
selling and played a crucial role in dragging the index back into the
red.</P>
      <P>Most of the eight major stock categories posted losses, with the
exception of the paper-making sector and the chemical and plastics
sector, reporting gains of 1 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Decliners outnumbered gainers 296 to 178, with 77 shares
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market edged down 2.46 points to close at
187.23 on a turnover of NT$13.32 billion.</P>
      <P>All TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) posted losses, with the exception of June and September
futures, for which no transactions were recorded.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for December moved down 78 points to close at
7,872 with 765 contract transactions. Those for January declined 70
points to finish at 7,910 with 1,302 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for next March dipped 80 points to close at
7,966 with 28 contract transactions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Civil aeronautic authorities from Taipei
and Manila failed to reach an agreement on the suspended aviation
pact after a 50-minute meeting on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A three-member Philippine delegation led by Jacinto Ortega,
director of the Civil Aeronautic Board, arrived in Taipei Monday
afternoon to hold talks with their Taiwan counterparts on resumption
of the Taipei-Manila air agreement, which was unilaterally abrogated
by the Philippines on Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>The Philippine mission met the Taiwan delegation headed by Chang
Yu-heng, director general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), at
9:30 a.m. and ended the talks at 10:20 a.m.</P>
      <P>Chang said at a press conference that because the Philippine side
lacked sincerity and the two sides differ on the issue of sixth
flight rights to third-country destinations, the two sides failed to
reach an agreement, and the talks thus broke down.</P>
      <P>It was understood that Manila was not fully prepared to hold
talks on the aviation pact with Taipei. The Philippine Civil
Aeronautics Board had only drafted a contract for Taipei-Manila air
link resumption while stipulating restrictions against allowing sixth
flight rights on flights between the two cities.</P>
      <P>A CAA official said the Philippine side has not shown respect
toward the Taiwan side. Not one aviation pact signed anywhere in the
world includes a clause stipulating restrictions on the use of sixth
flight rights, the official stressed.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan official continued, saying that although "our side
suggested a further 20 percent cut from the proposed weekly quota of
6,500 seats for Taiwan air carriers but withheld on the sixth flight
rights, the new Taipei proposal was not accepted by the Philippine
side."</P>
      <P>However, the door will continue to be open for talks in the hope
that those Philippine workers employed in Taiwan will be able to
return to their homeland for family reunions, Christmas holidays and
the New Year season, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, HK, CHINA AMONG TOP TEN MARKETS FOR EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec. 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong are
among the top ten educational markets for Australia, and the number
of students from the greater China area will show an increase this
year and in years to come due to a recovery in their economies.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Tuesday, Jan Kelly, manager of
network services for IDP Education Australia, said the country's
prospects for educational exports are "getting brighter this year and
the years to come because of an economic recovery in Asia."</P>
      <P>She cited a rise in the number of students from Taiwan, Hong Kong
and China by 16 percent, 66 percent and 50 percent, respectively,
between January and October 1999 from a year earlier, according to
student visa statistics compiled by the Department of Immigration.</P>
      <P>"I believe Taiwan, Hong Kong and China will continue to be major
educational markets for Australia, especially mainland China," she
said.</P>
      <P>She said the Australian government has considerably relaxed its
restrictions, allowing more Chinese students to study in Australia.
In the past, Australia had been very strict about granting student
visas to mainland Chinese students for fear they would stay on after
finishing their schooling, she acknowledged.</P>
      <P>"But the government has designated a number of Australian schools
to be responsible for monitoring the studies of Chinese students so
that they have to see them leave after they finish their studies in
Australia," she said.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan and Hong Kong, she said IDP Education would
continue its promotional efforts to lure more students to study in
Australia, and she is confident that the prospects are getting bright
due to the Asian economic recovery and because more Australian
schools are gaining recognition in both places.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Tung-jung, director of the Cultural Division of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canberra, also believed the
number of students from Taiwan studying in Australia would increase
in the years to come.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Education in Taiwan is encouraging more
Taiwanese students to study in Australia because cultural ties
between the two countries are getting closer thanks to increasing
exchanges of educational programs and exchange visits by teachers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the quality of life and education in Australia are
being recognized by more and more students and their parents in
Taiwan. Australian schools have the advantage of geographical
proximity and cheaper fees compared to those in the United States,
Japan and Britain, he said.</P>
      <P>He said Australia now ranks third as a destination for Taiwanese
students, trailing behind the United States and Britain. It is
followed by Canada and Japan. "I believe Australia can attract more
students from Taiwan if it increases its promotional efforts," he
said.

    <HEADLINE>ROC SHOULD PUSH FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL SECURITY MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen said on
Tuesday that the Republic of China should strengthen contact with
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.</P>
      <P>Chen also said the government should push for the establishment
of a sub-region collective security system to ensure Taiwan's
sustainable economic development.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a seminar on Taiwan's strategy for taking
part in Asia-Pacific regional cooperative systems, including
collective security mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan should study the possible impact on the security
system of economic globalization and Internet service development.</P>
      <P>The minister pointed out that two developments which are not in
harmony with each other still exist in the Asia-Pacific region in the
post-Cold War era. "They are arms races and mutual dependence," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, Chen went on, the Asia-Pacific has replaced the
Middle East as the world's largest arms importing area. On the other
hand, countries in the region have become more mutually dependent
because of their fast economic development and the formation of
various international cooperative organizations.</P>
      <P>At present, Chen said, the region has several government-level
international organizations, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum and the ASEAN Regional Forum. In addition,
the region also has various non-official dialogue mechanisms and
conferences.</P>
      <P>From a macro point of view, Chen said, there is still ample room
for the ROC to help boost prosperity and security in the entire
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>First of all, Chen said, the ROC should promote the establishment
of a sub-regional security mechanism which would cover several
countries in the region. Chen said he believes that tension in the
area can be reduced if countries in the region can seek a consensus
through a sub-regional or a multilateral security mechanism to
resolve the South China Sea disputes and problems related to mainland
China's ballistic missile development and nuclear proliferation.</P>
      <P>Second, he continued, Taiwan should increase contact with ASEAN
countries. "Even though the ROC is still not an ASEAN dialogue
partner, we can forge closer economic ties with Southeast Asian
countries under the APEC framework and by supporting various APEC
economic liberalization plans," the minister explained.</P>
      <P>Third, the ROC should study the impact of economic globalization
on existing international security systems. Noting that economic
globalization and the development of Internet services and related
technologies have rendered obsolete many traditional national
security protection measures, Chen said the ROC should take into
consideration all these new factors in tackling national and
international security issues.</P>
      <P>He further said the ROC should push for international cooperation
on various global issues, integrate the research results of
individual countries on regional issues, and lend substance to
various cooperative projects under the APEC framework.</P>
      <P>The seminar was co-sponsored by several local think tanks,
including the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research, the
Chinese-Taipei APEC research center, and National Chengchi
University's Institute of International Relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN HOPES TO ENHANCE CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS THROUGH EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Tuesday
that the Republic of China has always hoped that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait can enhance bilateral relations through exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a meeting with Richard Bush, the
Washington-based chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
who is currently on a nine-day visit to Taiwan to inspect AIT's
Taiwan operation.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's presidential candidate in the 2000
election said Taiwan would be most reluctant to see military
cross-strait confrontation, and that peace and stability is in the
interests of both sides, the region, and even the world.</P>
      <P>He stressed that national security is the primary concern of the
nation, and added that he has already suggested that both sides of
the Taiwan Strait actively work to establish a mechanism of military
mutual trust and try to ease tensions.</P>
      <P>This could be achieved, he said, through contact between relevant
officials, the establishment of a system to notify the other side in
advance of military exercises, and the setting up of a telephone hot
line to avoid unnecessary overreaction from the other side.</P>
      <P>The vice president said the areas for bilateral cooperation and
exchanges are wide and varied, but he expressed regret that
systematic cross-strait dialogue has yet to resume.</P>
      <P>He noted that after a groundbreaking high-level meeting between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1993 during which both sides
agreed to separate concepts of "one China," bilateral exchanges
followed.</P>
      <P>But he said mainland China later insisted that "one China" is the
People's Republic of China, of which Taiwan is a province, which is
unacceptable to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Lien said Taiwan is willing to negotiate with the mainland on
national unification on an equal footing once goodwill and consensus
have been built up after cross-strait exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>He also said there is no timetable or set model for unification,
and that both sides can negotiate in any feasible way.</P>
      <P>The AIT head later called on Su Chi, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council during which he expressed his
concern about the development of cross-strait relations after May or
June next year.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations were strained after President Lee Teng-hui
redefined cross-strait ties as "a special state-to-state
relationship" in July, and Beijing canceled a scheduled Taiwan visit
this fall by Wang Daohan, the mainland's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su reaffirmed that while Taiwan promotes cross-trait exchanges
and dialogue, it has to take into consideration its security and
dignity, and he expressed the hope that the US government understands
this stance and the needs of the nation.</P>
      <P>Su also told Bush that after both sides of the Taiwan Strait join
the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year, a new bridge, not a new
battlefield, will exist, and Taiwan will do its utmost to bring
cross-strait ties back on track.</P>
      <P>Su also cited President Lee's statement that if Beijing
demonstrates enough goodwill and gives a substantial response, Taipei
will be willing to review its cross-strait trade policy to be more in
tune with the spirit of the WTO.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force General
Headquarters (AFGHQ) has ordered all its French-made Mirage 2000-5
fighters grounded for thorough safety checks, an AFGHQ spokesman said
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The move came after a high-tech Mirage 2000-5 jet fighter,
piloted by Squadron Leader Chiang Chin-liang, plunged into waters off
the northeastern coast of Taiwan at around 10:53 a.m. in the morning,
he said.</P>
      <P>The fighter, accompanied by two twin-seater Mirages, took off at
10 a.m. from Hsinchu Air Base heading for waters off the northeastern
coast of Taiwan to conduct a simulated air intercept exercise. The
airplane lost contact with the control tower during the second stage
of the exercise.</P>
      <P>Two air force helicopters, a C-130 transport airplane, coast
guard cutters and a navy destroyer rushed to the area in which the
plane disappeared in the hope of rescuing the pilot and locating the
wreckage of the plane within 12 hours, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He added that if Chiang was able to eject from the aircraft
before it hit the water, there is a 99-percent chance that the rescue
will be successful.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that locating the plane will be difficult since
unlike the US-built F-16s owned by the air force, the French-built
Mirage is not equipped with a location beacon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST GROUP OF VIETNAMESE HOUSEMAIDS START NEW LIVES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of eight Vietnamese women, who
arrived in Taiwan on Monday to work as housemaids or family helpers,
met the local press on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Some of them impressed local journalists by speaking fluent
Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>They are the second group of Vietnamese nationals to be legally
introduced to work in Taiwan. The first group arrived in Taiwan a
few weeks ago to work at a factory in the central Taiwan county of
Taichung.</P>
      <P>Chuang An-chi, a manpower agent who introduced the eight-member
group to Taiwan, said the average age of the group is 28, with the
youngest member aged 27 and the oldest 40.</P>
      <P>All of the members are married and have children, Chuang said,
adding that all of them have received either junior or senior high
school education.</P>
      <P>Noting that Vietnam implements a 12-year compulsory education
system, Chuang said all Vietnamese nationals study English in
elementary schools and are also required to study Chinese at the
stage of senior high schools.</P>
      <P>Manpower brokers also offer 150 hours of Chinese language
training program and 30 hours of intensive course on Taiwan's legal
system, customs and general living habits for Vietnamese nationals
to be introduced to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A member of the Vietnamese group said she felt a little worry
before coming to Taiwan as she knew she will look after elderly
people and young children. "With the encouragement and support of my
family, I finally decided to come in order to help family finances,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Chuang said a Vietnamese college graduate can make an average of
US$50 (about NT$1,600) a month, while the minimum monthly wage in
Taiwan is NT$15,840. "It's a dream for many Vietnmaese people to
work in Taiwan," he noted.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan employers also have an affection for Vietnamese
workers because they are known for diligence and good work ethics,
Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chuang said, each Vietnamese manpower brokerage house
is required to deposit US$10,000 in guaranty money in a Vietnamese
government account, and each Vietnamese worker must also deposit
US$300 as a personal guarantee. The Vietnamese government also has
taken many other additional measures to prevent any overseas
Vietnamese worker from absconding, he added.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Tuesday talked about Taiwan's policy on mainland China during a
reception for a 22-member delegation from the Chinese Benevolent
Association of New York.</P>
      <P>He reiterated his stance that the ROC is definitely an
"independent sovereign country" legally and historically, as it was
established in 1912, while the People's Republic of China was not
established until 1949.</P>
      <P>This, he went on, is why he redefined cross-Taiwan Strait ties as
"a special state-to-state relationship" last July.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that freedom and democracy are the most useful weapons
in Taiwan's arsenal to counter the challenge from mainland China, and
added that Taiwan eagerly hopes to see the mainland people enjoy the
fruits of democracy and freedom as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Only when the ideals of freedom, democracy and equal distribution
of wealth is realized on the mainland, Lee said, can the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait march down the road of unification.</P>
      <P>Talking about the current cross-strait situation, Lee said that
stability across the Taiwan Strait is vital to the peace and
prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region, and he expressed the hope that
Beijing will give up its outdated ideology and adopt a friendly
attitude to strengthen dialogue with Taipei.</P>
      <P>During the reception, Lee also expressed his appreciation for the
contributions made by Chinese communities abroad for relief and
reconstruction efforts in Taiwan after the devastating Sept. 21
earthquake.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US State Department has never said that
the US government does not support Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization (WHO), a Taiwan medical group said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan
(MPAT) said the US State Department on Monday denied reports that it
said that based on the "one China" policy, the US government does not
support Taiwan's WHO bid and also opposes Taiwan's attempts to join
any other international organizations for which statehood is a
requirement.</P>
      <P>Lin Shih-chia, director of the MPAT office, said the US State
Department made the denial after relevant US officials were asked by
the US-based Formosan Association of Public Affairs (FAPA) to explain
the meaning of the alleged report.</P>
      <P>Refuting the report as totally groundless, State Department
officials told FAPA members that the State Department has made no
such statement. Rather, they pointed out, President Bill Clinton has
recently signed a bill actually supporting Taiwan's WHO membership.</P>
      <P>Clinton on Dec. 7 signed into law a bill requiring a report to
Congress from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by Jan. 1, 2000,
regarding the Clinton administration's efforts to secure Taiwan's
"appropriate and meaningful participation" in the WHO.</P>
      <P>Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who sponsored the legislation, said on
Dec. 8 that this law compels the United States to abide by its 1994
Taiwan Policy Review to more actively support Taiwan's participation
in the WHO and other international organizations.</P>
      <P>"For too long, Taiwan's 21 million citizens have been denied
access to the WHO and its medical expertise. The question is not
whether Taiwan belongs in the WHO, but whether we support improving
health care for children, the elderly, and the most vulnerable people
in Taiwan. These are goals that our nation should support," Brown
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 27th East Asia Economic Conference
concluded on Tuesday with the participants agreeing that small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and technical manpower resources need
to be nurtured.</P>
      <P>More than 250 delegates from Japan and the Republic of China took
part in the conference. Sino-Japanese Economic and Trade Foundation
Chairman Koo Chen-fu and his Japanese counterpart Akio Kosai led the
two delegations.</P>
      <P>In a joint statement issued at the end of the one-day meeting,
the participants said that both nations believe Asia has moved out of
the economic doldrums caused by the Asian financial crisis of 1997,
and it is now moving toward economic recovery.</P>
      <P>The participants also said that in the future, they will deal
with bad loans and foreign debts. In addition, to bolster the basis
of the manufacturing industry and upgrade both countries' national
competitiveness, they will ste0 up the nurturing of SMEs and
technical talent.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Japan should take the lead in helping Asian countries
improve their banking and financial systems, and should review the
possibility of regional financial cooperation.</P>
      <P>The participants said that the regional financial crisis showed
there is a complementary relationship between the two nations, and
that there is an interdependence between Asian and Japanese
economies.</P>
      <P>They also urged both governments to adopt measures to address the
trade imbalance in Japan's favor.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports to Japan totaled US$9.3 billion last year, while
Japan's exports to Taiwan almost tripled that amount at NT$27
billion.</P>
      <P>Both delegations agreed that both sides should increase bilateral
investment and technological cooperation in high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>In view of the devastating earthquake that hit Taiwan on Sept.
21, the Japanese delegates also said that "as long as the ROC
government puts forward the requests," Japan will provide assistance
in the form of experience, technology and talent, and will also urge
Japanese people to visit Taiwan as tourists.</P>
      <P>The Japanese delegates also said that as Japan is pushing for
restructuring of its financial and securities sectors, it will also
invest in other nations in Asia so that other Asian countries can
rebound quickly along with Japan.</P>
      <P>Both sides also concluded that for the continued economic growth
of both nations, the two nations need to pay more attention to
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The economic conference has been held alternately in Japan and
the ROC each year since the two nations severed diplomatic ties in
1972.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 2000 will have the strongest impact on the
country's agriculture sector, a high-ranking trade official said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Juei-lung, director-general of the Board of Foreign
Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), stressed that
the government has already taken some precautionary measures to
reduce the impact.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan hearing held by legislators Li
Hsien-jen (KMT-Taipei County) and Chang Shi-liang (New Party-at
large), Chen said that the government will also work to help the
industrial and service sectors in the hope of opening up a more
advantageous development phase for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that since agriculture is one of the
under-privileged industries in Taiwan, massive WTO impact on the
sector is to be expected as the government gradually opens the
country to imports of agricultural products and cuts tariffs and
export subsidies.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that as efforts have been made to secure more
favorite conditions for Taiwan's agriculture, the impact will be less
than originally expected.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed out that as far as the industrial sector is
concerned, WTO entry will be beneficial, since Taiwan's exports are
based mainly on industrial products, and WTO membership will give
more freedom regarding exports.</P>
      <P>Fu Dung-cheng, director of the Cabinet-level Department of
Research and Planning under the Mainland Affairs Council, who also
attended the hearing, said that as mainland China and Taiwan will
both enter the WTO next year, it is expected that bilateral relations

(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of giving Taiwan ballistic
missiles, US senator John McCain advocated on Tuesday the development
of a sea-borne missile system which can be moved into troubled areas
or international waters if necessary.</P>
      <P>In a debate between Republican presidential hopefuls in Des
Moines, Iowa on Monday, McCain said a sea-borne missile system would
achieve the same goals as a land-based system, and that if elected,
he will help Taiwan acquire necessary weapons.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "one China" policy followed by Washington is
based on the fundamental principle of peaceful reunification of
China, the senator warned that Beijing will violate this policy by
committing aggression against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Describing the Beijing regime as "a group of people hell-bent on
hanging onto power," the Vietnam War hero-turned-politician said
Washington can convince them that it is in their interest to enter
the world as a superpower, and in a peaceful, contributory fashion.</P>
      <P>Sen. Orrin Hatch, another contender for the Republican
nomination, boasted during the debate that he was one of the authors
of the Taiwan Relations Act which is aimed at supporting Taiwan
because "we don't want them walked all over."</P>
      <P>"We owe an obligation to Taiwan ... I am for keeping those
obligations," said Hatch.</P>
      <P>As for mainland China, the senator said: "We can through good
diplomacy and toughness, we can get China to back off on those types
of (intimidation of Taiwan) activities."</P>
      <P>Gary Bauer, a Reagan administration official, described his
colleagues as naive about Beijing's leaders, and said the United
States cannot duck the challenge that the mainland intends to replace

      <P>Medical care is the most urgent requirement
in Taiwan's aboriginal communities at present, according to the
results of a recent public opinion poll released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ninety percent of the aboriginal people who responded to the poll
said the establishment of clinics, hospitals and other medical
institutions in aboriginal communities is urgent and essential, as
health care provisions for this specific group of citizens have long
been neglected, said a spokesman for the private Luchu Society, which
commissioned the poll.</P>
      <P>Other urgent needs in the country's aboriginal communities
include the establishment of nursing homes, state-run nurseries,
activity centers and post offices, in that order, the spokesman
quoted the poll results as indicating.</P>
      <P>The Luchu Society is a group of doctors and other medical
specialists who donate voluntary medical services at home and abroad.
It commissioned the TVBS poll center to carry out the survey among
857 aborigines around Taiwan between May 1998 and August 1999.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, only 15 percent of the aboriginal
communities around the island have convenient piped water systems,
while 75.2 percent of the respondents said they use mountain springs
as their water source.</P>
      <P>The same poll also found that most public roads in the areas
populated by aborigines are in bad condition, with transportation
connections to "outside" areas vulnerable to heavy traffic and
natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Aboriginal people have also long been plagued by a number of
lifestyle-related problems such as alcoholism and high ratios of
liver and lung disease, which was also reflected in the poll results.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate James
Soong said late on Tuesday evening that a huge sum of money deposited
in his son's account was from the ruling Kuomintang and approved
by KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui in 1992.</P>
      <P>He told a press conference that at the time he was KMT
secretary-general and that at Lee's direction, he used the accounts
of Soong Chen-yuan, his son, and Chen Pi-yun, sister of James Soong's
wife, to deposit about NT$146,460,000 from the KMT.</P>
      <P>Soong said the money was appropriated to take care of the
families of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo and to carry out
other "special missions" on Lee's express orders.</P>
      <P>Over the seven intervening years, Soong stated, all the money
could be traced through transaction records, and he stressed that he
and his family have never used any of the money.</P>
      <P>He said that because the KMT's leaders had launched merciless
attacks against him since the second half of this year, he decided to
stop carrying out the KMT-commissioned task, and withdrew
NT$141,140,000 from his son's account on Oct. 4 for return to the KMT
through "appropriate channels."</P>
      <P>Soong apologized for the embarrassment to the Chiang family and
other relevant people caused by the disclosures.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, he said the money had been used to help
finance a trip to the United States by Mrs. Chiang Ching-kuo in 1992,
and to help with the maintenance of her residence.</P>
      <P>After news of Soong's "mystery account" was made public last week
by a KMT legislator, his presidential support rating slipped several
notches.</P>
      <P>Among the primary presidential hopefuls, Soong had enjoyed a
consistent lead in support ratings over the KMT's Lien Chan and the
Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Chih-cheng, an official at the Presidential Office,
branded Soong a liar, saying that the former Taiwan governor "is
attempting to shift the focus."</P>
      <P>Su told the media that while Lee did order the establishment of
an education fund for Chiang's children, the fund was for only NT$30
million, far less than the figure claimed by Soong.</P>
      <P>"I hope Soong will stop lying," he said.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday refuted
former Taiwan Governor James Soong's explanation about the origin of
the huge sum of money discovered in one of his son's bank accounts as
"totally groundless and full of loopholes."</P>
      <P>Asked by the media prior to a Kuomintang (KMT) Central Standing
Committee meeting whether or not at the end of 1992 he gave or
instructed the giving of NT$146 million (US$4.62 million) to Soong,
who was KMT secretary-general at the time, Lee answered by asking,
"Do you believe so? Can his (Soong's) remarks be believed?"</P>
      <P>At the KMT meeting, Lee, in his capacity as chairman of the
ruling party, condemned Soong's explanation, made during a televised
press conference Tuesday night, as completely ridiculous, saying that
"Soong thinks I am old, so he dared to fabricate such lies."</P>
      <P>At Tuesday night's press conference, independent presidential
candidate Soong, after six days of silence regarding the source of
the money, announced that "under instructions from President Lee,
NT$146 million was transferred to the accounts of my son and my
sister-in-law in order to take care of the family and descendants of
former President Chiang Ching-kuo and to conduct other political work
for the party as specifically indicated by the chairman."</P>
      <P>Ridiculing Soong's remarks, Lee said the KMT has well-established
agencies to take care of Chiang's widow, Mme. Chiang Fang-liang and
their remaining children with sufficient funds, and the funds have
nothing to do with what Soong has claimed.</P>
      <P>Lee stated that neither the KMT chairman nor the
secretary-general have bank accounts in their names for the purpose
of handling the party's funds. Lee added that anyone who uses the
party's money for personal reasons will be dealt with squarely,
indicating that Soong may be charged with the crime of embezzlement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIANG'S WIDOW WELL TAKEN CARE OF SAYS GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relevant government officials on Wednesday
said the wife of former President Chiang Ching-kuo, Mme. Chiang
Fang-liang has been well taken care of by the government since her
husband passed away in January 1988.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Ting Yuan-chao said Mme. Chiang has
been taken care of by the Presidential Office and related government
agencies over the past 11 years and has regularly received
indemnities as the surviving wife of the head-of-state.</P>
      <P>Quoting government records, Ting said Chiang's wife, a
Russian-born Caucasian who has lived in China and Taiwan for more
than five decades, has received more than NT$45 million (US$1.42
million) from the government since January 1988 under various
pension, welfare and indemnity programs for public functionaries.</P>
      <P>Ting made the remarks in refutation of former Taiwan Governor and
independent presidential candidate James Soong's explanation on
Tuesday at a press conference that he was given NT$146 million
(US$4.62 million) seven years ago by the Kuomintang for the purposes
of taking care of Mme. Chiang Fang-liang and the children of the
Chiangs and for conducting other party work.</P>
      <P>Ting said Soong's explanation that the huge sum that was
discovered in one of his son's savings accounts was meant to be used
to take care of the Chiangs' was totally groundless.</P>
      <P>Ting noted that, over the past 11 years, the government has also
footed the bill for chauffeurs, housekeeping, cars, gasoline and
security at Mme. Chiang's residence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuomintang spokesman Huang Hui-chen also refuted
Soong's explanation, saying that clear records of the money spent by
the government on Mme. Chiang and her family can be checked at the
Ministry of Personnel (MOP).</P>
      <P>According to Chen Ching-tien, director of the MOP's Department of
Retirement and Indemnity, Mme. Chiang was given some NT$8 million in
1988, during the first year after former President Chiang Ching-kuo's
death, as the surviving wife of the head-of-state and a public
functionary who had served the nation for more than 15 years.</P>
      <P>In the 10 years between 1989 and November of this year, Mme.
Chiang received about NT$34 million from the government for living
expenses, added Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMPLICATION OF CHIANG FAMILY IN SOONG MONEY SCANDAL PROTESTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A daughter-in-law of the late
Republic of China President Chiang Ching-kuo said on Tuesday that she
strongly disagrees with independent presidential candidate James
Soong's implication of her family in his funding scandal.</P>
      <P>Fang Chih-yi, widow of the late president's youngest son Chiang
Hsiao-yung, made the remarks after Soong claimed at a Taipei news
conference that NT$140 million (US$4.43 million) deposited in his son
Soong Chen-yuan's Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corp. account was
entrusted by President and ruling Kuomintang Chairman Lee Teng-hui to
care for the Chiang family.</P>
      <P>Fang said she is still trying to grasp the full details of
Soong's financial scandal. Nevertheless, she expressed her extreme
annoyance at Soong's repeated mention of her Russian-born
mother-in-law, Mrs. Faina Fang-liang Chiang, in his explanation of
the source of his son's "mystery funds."</P>
      <P>Fang, a member of the standing committee of the KMT's San
Francisco branch, said she wonders why money allegedly to be used to
care for the Chiang family would end up in the account of one of
Soong's offspring.</P>
      <P>"I especially take issue over Soong's repeated referrals to my
mother-in-law during his `mystery fund' explanation news conference,"
Fang said, adding that the Chiang family would in any case not accept
a penny that was not its due.</P>
      <P>Fang further said she holds her mother-in-law in high respect,
describing her as a woman of simplicity who has no ambition for fame
or power.</P>
      <P>"Even though my mother-in-law was once the first lady of the
Republic of China, she has always thought of herself as an ordinary
person and has led a low-profile, simple life," Fang said, adding
that she earnestly hopes that nobody will sabotage her
mother-in-law's peaceful life for political ends.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, while his three sons -- Chiang
Hsiao-wen, Chiang Hsiao-wu and Chiang Hsiao-yung -- died in 1989,
1991 and 1996, respectively.</P>
      <P>Soong, who was expelled from the KMT last month for his
insistence on running as an independent candidate against the KMT's
presidential ticket in the 2000 presidential election, told a Tuesday
news conference that in 1992, while he was KMT secretary-general,
that Lee instructed him to set up a fund to care for the Chiang
family, and that the NT$140 million in his son's account was provided
by the KMT for that purpose. As his relations with the KMT leadership
have soured, Soong said he had long planned to return the money to
the party.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cyclone John -- rated five on a
five-point scale, has forced a shutdown of offshore oil and gas
production facilities and iron ore projects in Western Australia, and
is likely to cause a temporary disruption of Australia's export
shipments to importing countries, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The cyclone was 265 kilometers west of Port Hedland, a leading
detention center for refugees in Western Australia on Tuesday, but on
Wednesday morning it was spotted crossing near Karratha, a major port
used for exporting Australian crude oil, gas and iron ore to Taiwan
and other Asian countries, according to industry sources.</P>
      <P>The cyclone has increased in force, packing winds of up to 290
kilometers per hour and forcing the evacuation of some areas after
Karratha and Port Hedland's shipping services were temporarily
halted. The strong cyclone was sending waves as high as seven meters
on Wednesday morning, causing fears of flooding in some areas.</P>
      <P>Broken Hill Proprietary Pty. Ltd. said it had to shut down
production at its crude oil facilities. "We have shut down the
process and are watching the storm. The vessel is prepared to
disconnect, but we will wait and see what the cyclone's path is," BHP
Petroleum's spokesman Malcolm Garratt told reporters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Apache Energy has temporarily closed its oil platform,
which produces 15,000 barrels of crude oil per day and Woodside
Petroleum reported that it had pulled out non-essential staff from
its production sites.</P>
      <P>Australia produces about 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day,
with Taiwan importing 10,000 barrels of that total.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUEBEC LEADER ACCUSED OF CREATING CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard's attempt to
forge a united front against Ottawa's "clarity bill" hit a snag when
the leader of Quebec's opposition Liberal Party accused him of using
the proposed referendum legislation to fabricate a crisis Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The "clarity" bill refers to the bill tabled by Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien which demands clarity on the question of
secession and calls for a majority in a secession referendum.</P>
      <P>Bouchard tried to enlist Jean Charest's support for his crusade
against the federal referendum legislation, claiming that Quebec is
facing an unprecedented attack from the federal government.</P>
      <P>But Charest said the Quebec provincial government is fabricating
a crisis in order to hold a referendum that Quebecers don't really
want. Charest noted that the premier should be spending his time
repairing government incompetence instead of promoting separatism.</P>
      <P>Bouchard dismissed the comments, saying Charest should be willing
to stand up to Ottawa and should decide where his loyalty lies- with
Jean Chretien or with Quebec.</P>
      <P>Charest countered by asking Bouchard whether his loyalty lies
with Quebec or with his separatist agenda. Charest added that he
opposes the prime minister's referendum legislation, but he also
doesn't want to give the sovereignty movement any momentum.</P>
      <P>"Their reaction has been so exaggerated since the moment that
this happened," said Charest. "This is an opportunity for them to do
what Quebecers don't want them to do and that's prepare another
referendum."</P>
      <P>The Quebec Liberals believe they can position themselves between
Bouchard and Chretien. They think most Quebecers will agree with them
that the government should focus on real issues like health care, the
creation of jobs and reducing taxes.</P>

      <P>The millennium bug, or Y2K, is not

a new assessment by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday reported that the UN

but only a few major and lasting crises.</P>
      <P>The center is working with Y2K coordinators from 190 countries.</P>

experience only limited damage from the Y2K bug," said the center's
director Bruce McConnell in a formal statement that accompanied the
release of his report on the Y2K.</P>
      <P>The report predicted "few serious" Y2K-caused effects in energy,
telecommunications, finance, transportation, customs and immigration,
food and water infrastructures because of the limited use of digital

      <P>Foreign and overseas Chinese investment in
Taiwan during the period from January to October posted 3.2 percent
growth compared with the year-earlier level, show latest statistics
released by the Industrial Development and Investment Center (IDIC).</P>
      <P>Most of the investment in the 10-month period was from the United
States, totaling US$864.13 million, up 62.07 percent from the same
period of last year.</P>
      <P>Investment from British democratic monarchies and colonies in the
Caribbean reached US$712.42 million, up 25.06 percent from the 1998

to US$394.22 million in the 10-month period.</P>
      <P>The investment from Japan posted a 14.1 percent decline, which
was blamed on the facts that Japan itself was a victim of the Asian
financial storm, and that Japan's bubble economy had come to an end,

      <P>Lin said that promoting foreign investment in Taiwan will remain
the key objective of the IDIC in the coming year, and pointed out
that his center is currently working to secure 26 major foreign

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top science official on Wednesday
repeated an attempt to quit, saying that he tendered a formal
resignation on Nov. 1 which clearly indicated his hope that the
resignation would take effect on Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Huang Chen-tai, chairman of the Cabinet-level National Science
Council (NSC), made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan, where he was
blasted by Legislator Cheng Pao-ching for allegedly having been
reluctant to take responsibility for delays in certain experimental
programs of the ROCSAT-1, Taiwan's first wholly owned and operated
satellite.</P>
      <P>Cheng, a lawmaker from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, said Huang should step down to take responsibility for the
postponement of the ROCSAT-1's Ka-band communication experiment, one
of the most important tasks the satellite is expected to do.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that he did in fact tender his resignation to
Premier Vincent Siew on Nov. 1 after the Ka-band communication
experiment failed to meet the schedule of completion by the end of
October as he had promised on March 31.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the resignation was rejected by Siew and the
letter returned to Huang's office.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the Ka-band communication experiment was
completed on Dec. 8 after the transmission wave transbonder assembly
of the remote ground terminal to be installed in the ROCSAT's
Experimental Communication Payload Ground System was repaired.</P>
      <P>The National Space Program Office under the NSC, which is in
charge of the ROCSAT-1 program, has already filed for compensation
with relevant US companies for the delay, Huang added.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-1 was successfully launched into orbit in January of this
year to begin a series of scientific experiments and tasks, including
data collection on the effects of ionosphere plasma electrodynamics,
taking pictures of the planet's oceans, and performing a variety of
communications-related experiments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT HEAD CONCLUDES TAIWAN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), said on Wednesday that the United States
does not favor any one party or any one candidate in the 2000
presidential election in the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the country will work with whomever the
Taiwan people choose to serve them as their leader.</P>
      <P>The top US liaison official with the ROC, who arrived here last
Wednesday, made the remarks at a press conference prior to his
departure.</P>
      <P>Bush said that he is not in a position to comment on the policies
of the presidential candidates he met during his visit, but stressed
that the United States "vigorously supports the transformation of
Taiwan into a democratic system, and will work with whomever wins the
election."</P>
      <P>He refused to answer a question on whether Washington will make a
move prior to the 2000 election similar to its actions in the runup
to the 1996 presidential election when it deployed aircraft carriers
in the Taiwan Strait. He said only that the US will closely monitor
the situation in the Taiwan Strait, and that Taiwan people should be
able to choose their leader without any threats.</P>
      <P>He also said that the United States is very concerned about any
rise in the level of tension across the Taiwan Strait, and expressed
the hope that both sides will show restraint and engage in
cross-strait dialogue to resolve differences in a peaceful way.</P>
      <P>Asked about the conditions required to realize the stalled visit
to Taiwan of Wang Daohan, mainland China's top negotiator with
Taiwan, Bush said that this will need to be worked out by the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The visit, scheduled to take place this autumn, was canceled by
Beijing in an angry reaction to President Lee Teng-hui July
redefinition of cross-strait ties as "a special state-to-state
relationship."</P>
      <P>Bush reiterated that cross-strait misunderstandings need to be
worked out through dialogue, and that after Taiwan and mainland China
join the World Trade Organization, "an opportunity and atmosphere"
will exist to move toward the resumption of cross-trait dialogue.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's proposed development of long-range surface-to-surface
missiles to counter the military threat from the mainland, Bush said
that Taiwan security cannot be achieved through weaponry alone,
although he admitted that "military capability and deterrence" is
important.</P>
      <P>Bush said that the United States is also concerned about the
deployment of missiles in coastal mainland China, and has expressed
Taiwan's worry to the mainland.</P>
      <P>He also addressed questions about the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act (TSEA) currently going through the US Congress, saying that some
people in Taiwan might be under the wrong impression that Taiwan will
be assured of "certain weapons systems" if the bill passes the
legislature.</P>
      <P>But he noted that the passing of the bill would raise the level
of Taiwan-United States relations from unofficial to official level,
which he said would have severe consequences.</P>
      <P>He said that the premise of the TSEA is that the Taiwan Relations
Act (TRA) does not work well, which is not the case. The TRA is the
US law governing unofficial US-Taiwan relations which provides for
Taiwan's security through the sale of defensive arms, and other
means.</P>
      <P>Bush also extended his condolences to the victims of the Sept. 21
earthquake, and lauded Taiwan for its strength and resilience after
the tragedy, saying the island's speedy recovery has made a deep
impression on the United States.</P>
      <P>Bush did not say whether he will visit Taiwan again before the
March 18 election, saying only that it is customary for the AIT head
to visit Taiwan to attend presidential inaugurations.</P>
      <P>This was Bush's fifth visit to Taiwan as AIT head. During his

    <HEADLINE>US CLARIFIES STANCE ON TAIWAN'S WHO PARTICIPATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US State Department on Tuesday
clarified its stance on the Republic of China's bid to join the World
Health Organization (WHO), saying the United States supports Taiwan's
"meaningful participation," not its membership, in the body.</P>
      <P>State Department deputy spokesman James Foley said at a regular
news briefing that the bill that President Bill Clinton signed into
law last week does not require the United States to support Taiwan's
WHO membership.</P>
      <P>Foley said the bill only requires the US secretary of state to
submit a report to Congress on the Clinton administration's efforts
to "more actively support Taiwan's participation in international
organizations, including, in particular, the World Health
Organization."</P>
      <P>In accordance with its "one China" policy, Foley said, the United
States does not support Taiwan's membership in the WHO, or any other
international organization that requires statehood as a condition of
membership.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Foley stressed that the United States believes that
"the people of Taiwan should be able to contribute to, as well as to
benefit from, the work of the WHO."</P>
      <P>Foley further said the legislation passed by Congress and signed
into law by Clinton relates to enhancing or encouraging Taiwan's
participation in international organizations, including the WHO, but
says nothing about membership.</P>
      <P>While the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in
international organizations that require statehood as a condition for
membership, Foley went on, the Clinton administration does want to
encourage Taiwan's participation in such organizations.</P>
      <P>"And we share the overall goal of the legislation, to facilitate
appropriate ways for Taiwan to participate in international
organizations," Foley said, adding that in fact, the Clinton
administration has been working actively to identify appropriate ways
for Taiwan's voice to be heard in the WHO and other international
organizations from which it is currently barred.</P>
      <P>"We have also supported Taiwan's membership in international
organizations like the World Trade Organization, where statehood is
not an issue," Foley added.</P>
      <P>The legislation, initiated by Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), supports
Taiwan's "appropriate and meaningful participation" in the WHO, but
does not push for Taiwan's full membership in the United
Nations-affiliated organization.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China-controlled island of
Kinmen off the coast of mainland China will maintain a ban on
shipments from Taiwan of cloven-hoofed animals, their carcasses,
offal or any other fresh products thereof for another six months.</P>
      <P>The original six-month ban was imposed in June when several cases
of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were reported on Kinmen, in order to
prevent the disease from being transmitted to other animals.</P>
      <P>The ban expired on Wednesday, whereupon island authorities
decided to extend it for another six months as a further
precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>The authorities noted that after the June FMD cases were
reported, 189 of the island's cattle had to be killed, and stressed
that prevention of further cases among cattle, goats and pigs, and
careful monitoring of the situation, will continue to ensure the

    <HEADLINE>US CHINA HANDS MEET ON 'ONE CHINA' AND STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A noted American China hand said on
Tuesday that the United States should drop its "strategic ambiguity"
stance on its reaction in the event of a military conflict in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at the
George Washington University, made the call at a seminar,
sponsored by Georgetown University, on the US "one China" and
strategic ambiguity policies toward Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that the US government's "strategic ambiguity" concept is
obsolete and needs adjustment, Shambaugh said mainland China believes
that the United States would certainly intervene in a cross-strait
military confrontation, and has incorporated this factor into its
military build-up plans.</P>
      <P>As for the "one China" policy, Shambaugh said Taiwan should
pursue its own status under this framework. In his opinion,
Shambaugh said, neither outright independence nor permanent
separation from the Chinese mainland is feasible for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shambaugh further warned that Taiwan's current practice of
gradually moving toward separation might be dangerous and could
cause instability in the area.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Shambaugh was quick to add that Beijing should not
ignore Taiwan's dignity and should give it great room in the
international arenas.</P>
      <P>Shambaugh also said he finds that the opportunities for Taiwan
and mainland China to reach a compromise on their disputes are
gradually fading away because mainland China is very likely to
secure in five years military supremacy that it does not enjoy at the
moment.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan fails to reach an agreement with mainland China in the
next few years, Shambaugh said it would be forced to negotiate with
Beijing by then.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Robert Kagan, a senior associate
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, echoed
Shambaugh's view that the United States should abandon its
"strategic ambiguity" stance.</P>
      <P>Kagan said the United States should let Beijing understand a
new reality that the United States will help defend Taiwan in the
event of a Beijing attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Larry Wortzei, director of the Heritage Foundation's
Asian Studies Program, said it is necessary that the United States
maintains an appropriate degree of ambiguity on its possible reaction
in the event of a cross-strait war.</P>
      <P>Alfred Wilhelm, executive vice president of the Atlantic
Council, also said maintaining strategic ambiguity on the US part
will be helpful to Taiwan's security because future developments are
difficult to predict. "Strategic ambiguity is needed to ensure
flexibility in handling related issues," he noted.</P>
      <P>Both Wilhelm and Wortzei agreed that cross-strait issues should
be resovled by Taiwan and mainland China themselves and that the
US obligation lies in stressing that the issues should be resovled
by purely peaceful means and in providing an environment conducive to
peaceful solution to thorny cross-strait disputes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Patrick Cronin, director of the research and
policy studies division of the US Institute of Peace, said
Washington, Beijing and Taipei are like "three persons traveling in a
canoe sailing in a rough, dangerous maritime area. If any of them
stands up, the canoe would capsize. This means that if any party
forsakes the "one China" policy, Cronin said, the United States,
Taiwan and mainland China could all be losers.</P>

      <P>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA): The suspended Taipei and Manila air link
will immediately resume if the Philippine side showed a
written document to recognize Taipei-Manila Aviation Pact signed in
1996 and no restriction was set, an official of the Civil Aeronautic
Administration(CAA) of the Ministry of Transportation and

addressed to them," MOTC Minister Lin Feng-cheng stressed, adding
that the door will always open if the Philippine side accepts our
proposal.</P>
      <P>He described the statement of Philippine officials who left for
home after negotiations broke down as "irresponsible".</P>
      <P>Philippine officials said before departing for home that they
were fooled by the Taiwanese side for the unsuccessful meeting on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official further pointed out that if the Philippine side
expressed in a written statement without conditions for resumption
of the 1996 Taipei-Manila Aviation Pact, the air link between Taiwan
and the Philippines will immediately resume.</P>
      <P>Delegates from Taiwan and the Philippines resumed talks on the
suspended 1996 Taipei-Manila Aviation Pact on Tuesday. However, both
parties differred on the sixth flight right for the third
destination and the character of the meeting, thus breaking down the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the Philippines have held third talks on the aviation
pact but failed to reach a concrete conclusion, forcing the
Philippines to unilaterally abrogate the pact on Oct. 2.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An Air Force official on Wednesday affirmed
that there is no security problem in safeguarding the nation's
territorial space after the Air Force General Headquarters (AFGHQ)
grounded all its French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters for thorough
safety checks.</P>
      <P>You Liao-huo of Hsinchu Air Force Base in northern Taiwan said
there are still four aircraft of other types on the base that can be
used to conduct interception missions.</P>
      <P>The grounding order was issued after a Mirage 2000-5 jet fighter,
piloted by squadron leader Chiang Chin-liang, plunged into waters off
the northeastern coast of Taiwan at around 10:53 a.m. Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Though rescuers have thus far failed to locate the pilot and the
aircraft, the Air Force had initially determined that it had crashed
and said the cause would be determined after more evidence is
collected.</P>
      <P>Though the Mirage fighters were grounded, You said four other
aircraft on the base can engage in reconnaissance or intercept enemy
missions. If necessary, the Air Force will also use Taiwan-made
Ching-Kuo indigenous defense fighters (IDF) and US-made F-16 jet
fighters to help shoulder the responsibility of guarding air security
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>People in Hsinchu could see flights by fighter jets Wednesday
afternoon, but they were IDF planes, not Mirage fighters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMICS ISSUE JOINT STATEMENT OPPOSING PASSAGE OF FARMLAND BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 105 local scholars, led by
Academia Sinica President Yuan T. Lee, issued a joint statement on
Wednesday, urging the Legislative Yuan not to deliberate any
controversial farmland bills before the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has proposed an agricultural development bill aimed
at easing restrictions on the use of farmland to boost agricultural
development, while some lawmakers have come up with another version
allowing full liberalization of the use of farmland.</P>
      <P>Noting that the proposals to liberalize farmland trade and
construction of residential houses on newly purchased farmland will
not necessarily benefit local farmers, the academics said the
legislature should wait until after the next presidential election,
scheduled for March 18, 2000, for tackling the controversial
farmland liberalization issues.</P>
      <P>The statement said the proposed release of a large amount of
farmland for commercial or industrial use could probably trigger a
dramatic decline in land and housing prices and eventually affect
the country's overall economic development.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the statement said, farmland trade liberalization
could also hinder the country's agricultural development. Stressing
that agriculture is critical to a country's overall economic
well-being, the statement said the legislature should not
mull the issue under political pressure or with any political
purposes.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the scholars said in the joint statement that
they oppose hasty passage of any farmland liberalization bill
before the presidential election.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham)
in Taipei is optimistic about Taiwan's future development and is in
favor of Taiwan joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) as soon as
possible, said AmCham President Paul Cassingham on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The head of the business organization made the remark at a
year-end press conference held at the Lai-Lai Sheraton Hotel.</P>
      <P>Cassingham said that in light of the 2000 presidential election,
Taiwan's democratization is quite mature and no matter which
candidate is elected as the new leader of Taiwan, AmCham is very
optimistic about Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>AmCham sponsored the press conference to present its goals for
the year 2000 and to donate NT$5.68 million to the Tzu Chi Foundation
and Puli Christian Hospital to help the two charity organizations'
post-quake medical service and reconstruction efforts.</P>
      <P>Cassingham said AmCham supports Taiwan in joining the WTO as soon
as possible and is optimistic that Taiwan will soon achieve its goal
of entering the world trade regulatory body, in light of the recent
signing of a bilateral agreement between Washington and Beijing on
mainland China's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>He said it is expected that both sides of the Taiwan Strait will
enter the WTO in the next few months. After Taiwan and mainland China
join the WTO, markets in the two economies will further open and
there will be greater liberalization, and that is the thing American
businessmen are glad to see, he added.</P>
      <P>Cassingham declined to comment on issues related to Taiwan's 2000
presidential election, saying AmCham is a business organization and
it is not in a position to comment.</P>
      <P>However, he added, the United States always encourages political
democratization and judging from the 2000 presidential election,
Taiwan's democratization is quite mature and no matter which
candidate wins the election, AmCham is optimistic about the island's
future development.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Being named on the list of the top 10
scandals of the year by the Canadian edition of Time magazine is the
price that Papua New Guinea (PNG) must pay for its capricious
attitude, said the spokesman of the Republic of China Ministry of
Foreign Affairs on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-cheng stated that the ROC had followed the normal
procedures of the international community to forge diplomatic ties
with PNG, and that the two had formally signed a communique on mutual
recognition.</P>
      <P>Only because PNG has a new prime minister, it denies all the
facts and switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
at the drop of a hat, Chen said. Such capricious engagement with its
so-called "friend" can only harm the country itself in the eyes of
the international community, he continued.</P>
      <P>Two days after forging formal relations with Taipei on July 5 for
an alleged ROC loan amounting to US$2.3 billion, Bill Skate, the PNG
prime minister who signed the recognition of ties, stepped down in
anticipation of facing a no-confidence parliamentary vote.</P>
      <P>In a short two weeks after that, a new government was built, and
so were its foreign relations.</P>
      <P>The top 10 scandals of 1999 listed in the latest Canadian edition
of Time include a US congressman's controversial report that accuses
Beijing of systematic actions to steal confidential US information
relating to making nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>The weekly magazine in its Dec. 20 issue blamed the report for
almost triggering a cold war between Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The events forcing former Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to
withdraw from the presidential race after being exposed for attempted
vote-buying, and former German Prime Minister Helmut Kohl's public
confession of using money from deposits in a "secret bank account" to
help his party win elections while he served as prime minister, were

    <HEADLINE>KMT REBUTS SOONG'S CLAIMS ABOUT CASH STASHED IN SON'S BANK ACCOUNT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential aspirant James Soong's
explanation about the huge sum deposited in his son's bank account
drew a salvo of disputes and criticism from the ruling Kuomintang on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>From KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui, who dismissed it as "groundless"
Wednesday morning, on down, party officials scrambled to deny or
contradict Soong's claim that the NT$140 million (US$4.37 million)
was deposited in the bank account of his son Soong Chen-yuan on the
order of Lee.</P>
      <P>Party spokesman Huang Hwi-chen issued a five-point statement
Wednesday, questioning the truth of Soong's claim.</P>
      <P>In his statement, Huang said:</P>
      <P>-- Lee definitely denied that he instructed Soong in 1991 to set
aside the money as a special fund to take care of descendants of the
late President Chiang Ching-kuo;</P>
      <P>-- neither the KMT chairman nor the KMT secretary general, the
post in which Soong served between 1989 and 1993, was allowed to
operate a parallel bank account alongside the party account. This
contradicts Soong's claim that the money in question was transferred
to his son's bank account from the account of the KMT secretary
general.</P>
      <P>-- Lee said he didn't know that the KMT-run Huashia Investment
Co. and the KMT Central Committee provided the money to Soong as he
claimed;</P>
      <P>-- Lee said he didn't know Soong's son and Soong's sister-in-law,
and wouldn't have asked Soong to keep the money in two strangers'
accounts; and</P>
      <P>-- If Lee did ask Soong to take care of Chiang's offspring with
the money, why should Soong stash it in the bank accounts of two
strangers unrelated to the matter?</P>
      <P>Huang said that Lee did ask Soong to raise money to take care of
Chiang's family when Chiang's last son died in 1991.</P>
      <P>The fund, about NT$100 million, was used to pay for educational
fees and the cost of a house for Chiang's descendants, after which
only NT$26 million was left, Huang quoted Hsu Li-teh, who served as
KMT deputy secretary-general and concurrently chairman of the Finance
Committee under Soong, as saying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu told a local radio station on Wednesday that the
money to take care of Chiang's family was raised from KMT-run firms,
and the remainder of it was deposited in an account opened by the KMT
Central Committee at the KMT-owned Bank SinoPac, where it remains
now.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who disputed Soong's claims earlier the day at a meeting of
the KMT Central Standing Committee, told the radio station that he
has suggested that KMT authorities look into the source of the money.</P>
      <P>Soong, who continued stumping in Pingtung County, remained silent
on the criticism Wednesday, saying only that he would explain the
misunderstanding to Lee later.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted immediately after Soong's explanation on
Tuesday night found that he was still supported by 29 percent of
those interviewed, despite the fact that 51 percent of respondents
considered him as having made mistakes on the whole matter.</P>
      <P>Although KMT candidate Lien Chan was favored by only 11.7 percent
of respondents, behind the 19.5 percent of Democratic Progressive
Party candidate Chen Shui-bian, 33.3 percent of those surveyed
believed he will win the presidential race, compared to 20.1 percent
for Soong, and 7.7 percent for Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS 'MYSTERY FUND' ISSUE TO HAVE ADVERSE IMPACT ON SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of respondents to a recent
Gallup poll say they believe that the "mystery fund" episode will
have an adverse impact on independent presidential candidate James
Soong's bid to win the next presidency.</P>
      <P>Gallup Taiwan Co. conducted the telephone poll of 1,095 randomly
selected adult residents throughout the island on Dec. 15 at the
request of Sanlih Entertainment Television.</P>
      <P>According to survey results, 73.4 percent of the respondents said
they think that the NT$140 million (US$4.43 million) "mystery fund"
deposited in the Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corp. account of Soong's
son would have a harmful effect on Soong's presidential bid.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 42.1 percent of those interviewed do
not buy Soong's explanation about the source of the "mystery fund."
Soong told a Tuesday news conference that the fund was entrusted by
President Lee Teng-hui in his capacity as the ruling Kuomintang
chairman in 1992 to care for the late President Chiang ching-kuo's
family.</P>
      <P>Twenty percent of the respondents said they believe Soong's
explanation, while 37.8 percent declined to express their
opinion as they thought it's not easy to verify whether Soong had
told the truth or not.</P>
      <P>While President Lee on Wednesday flatly dismissed Soong's
explanation as "a pack of nonsense," 38.3 percent said they don't
think Lee's comment was true, compared with 19.3 percent who said
they believe that Lee was telling the truth. Meanwhile, 42.5 percent
said they don't know whether Lee was telling the truth or not.</P>
      <P>Survey results further show that 69.8 percent of the respondents
believe that the "mystery fund" episode will help boost opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian's
presidential bid, and 41.8 percent said they think the incident will
benefit KMT candidate Lien Chan's presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that Chen for the first time took lead in
support rating, with 24.6 percent of those interviewed throwing
support behind him. In comparison, 23.8 percent said they would vote
for Soong if the presidential election were to take place the
following day, and 14.6 percent said they would cast ballots for
Lien. Meanwhile, 28.2 percent said they have not yet made a decision
on their choice.</P>
      <P>On the odds to win the presidential election scheduled for March
18, 2000, 32.8 percent said they think that KMT's Lien would win the
election, while 20.3 percent said they have confidence in Soong's
success and 13.1 percent said they think DPP's Chen would claim a
final victory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY BUOYANT, MORE INTEREST RATE HIKES SEEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's economy grew at an annualized
rate of 4.5 percent in September thanks to a strong housing industry
and business service sector and rising consumer spending, which is
returning to its pre-Asian financial crisis expansion pace.</P>
      <P>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Wednesday released
figures which show a rise of 1.6 percent in economic growth in the
third quarter of this year. The quarter growth translates into a
yearly growth rate of 4.5 percent in Australia's gross domestic
product, higher than the government's earlier forecast of 3.5
percent.</P>
      <P>Economists said that the strong growth was accompanied by low
inflation of less than 2 percent and moderate increases in labor
wages, and that the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to hike
its official interest rates again early next year to help prevent the
economy from overheating.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard on Wednesday
night took an unusual step by going on TV to ask all Quebecers to
line up behind him in opposing Ottawa's referendum bill.</P>
      <P>"I am inviting you to show your support to members of the
legislature so we can all, and with a single vote, say to the
parliament in Ottawa that only we (Quebecers) can decide on our
future," Bouchard said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, his cabinet tabled a bill to counter what he
called Ottawa's "frontal assault on democracy." He said the federal
government's Clarity Bill restricts Quebec's right to choose its own
destiny.</P>
      <P>Refusing to support the Parti Quebecois bill, opposition Liberal
Party leader Jean Charest accused the PQ government of creating "a
virtual crisis, an artificial crisis, which only serves its partisan
interests."</P>
      <P>Charest said Quebecers want the government to concentrate on
bread-and-butter issues and he asked people to tell the PQ members of
the legislature.</P>
      <P>"We must avoid this fresh escalation of an eye for an eye, a bill
for a bill, and an ad for ad" about Ottawa and Quebec's public
relations battle, he added.</P>
      <P>In Ottawa, Canada's "Unity Minister" Stephane Dion said the PQ
government is trying to strip Quebecers of their Canadian identity in
legislation asserting the province's right to self-determination.</P>
      <P>"It's a total negation of the Canadian dimension of Quebecers,"
Dion said. "This belongs to us. No bill, no law may eradicate our
Canadian dimension. We are too proud of it," he stated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>4TH-QUARTER GROWTH TO BE HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED: CIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's overall economic growth in the
fourth quarter of this year is expected to reach 5.37 percent, 0.3
percent higher than previously estimated, the Chung-Hua Institution
for Economic Research (CIER) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The private economic think-tank readjusted its quarterly forecast
upward after CIER researchers found that the adverse impact on
Taiwan's economy of the magnitude 7.3 earthquake which struck on Sep.
21 was lighter than expected.</P>
      <P>With the brighter forecast for the fourth quarter, CIER
researchers said the annual growth figure for 1999 will be readjusted
upward to 5.37 percent from the previous estimate of 5.32 percent.</P>
      <P>For the year 2000, the CIER forecasts a whopping growth of 6.17
percent for the first quarter and an average growth of 6.03 percent
for the second half of the new year. Meanwhile, it is roughly
estimated that growth for the whole year will be 6.05 percent.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers in mid-October concluded that the Sept. 21
earthquake would have a tremendously negative impact on the country's
economy, prompting them to lower their fourth quarter growth
estimates by 1 percentage point to 5.07 percent.</P>
      <P>However, they revised the forecast for the fourth quarter and
also for the entire year of 1999 after realizing that the impact was
not as serious as imagined.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers mentioned that what is worth noting is that
investment from the private sector grew 13.38 percent in the Oct-Dec.
period, marking the first growth in quarterly figures over the last
four quarters.</P>
      <P>Growth in the private investment sector also helped shore up
overall investment growth which hit 10.08 percent in the fourth
quarter, the researchers noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CIER forecasts that Taiwan's currency, the New
Taiwan dollar, will gradually appreciate against the US dollar over
the next year, with the average ratio posting at NT$31.32 to one US
dollar.</P>
      <P>With domestic economic activity becoming more brisk and oil
prices in the international crude market rising, Taiwan's consumer
product index is expected to soar 2.07 percent next year, compared
with this year's 0.17 percent, the researchers forecast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T TO LAUNCH HIGH-PROFILE PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN FOR Y2K</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan on Thursday passed a
provisional act calling for a publicity campaign and stepped-up
efforts to prepare for potential Y2K problems.</P>
      <P>Yang Shih-chien, the minister without portfolio in charge of
government work detecting and fixing potential Y2K problems, said all
governmental offices and related agencies are fully Y2K-compliant,
adding that Taiwan has been declared a low-Y2K-risk area by a number
of international organizations.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that the Executive Yuan still cannot be too
careful about Y2K preparedness, particularly in the private sector.</P>
      <P>The just-passed provisional act features five ways for the
government to communicate with the public over the next two weeks and
assuage any doubts about Y2K compliance, Yang said, adding that the
government hopes the general public will cooperate with preparedness
directives and any necessary instructions.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will run print and television ads over the
next two weeks to remind people of possible Y2K-related failures and
anomalies, and how and where to get help in case of an emergency,
Yang said.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 23, Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will preside over a
press conference where the Executive Yuan Y2K Committee will make a
final report on the country's Y2K preparedness.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 31, Premier Vincent Siew will make a nationally televised
appearance at noon and again in the evening to remind people about
possible crises and the country's concerted effort to detect
potential emergencies and take appropriate action.</P>
      <P>Beginning at 2:00 p.m. on Dec. 31, the Executive Yuan Y2K
Information and Contingency Center will become operational until the
Y2K rollover has safely passed, Yang said.</P>
      <P>At 1:00 a.m. on Jan. 1, Premier Siew will host a press conference
to inform the whole country how Taiwan has coped with the Y2K bug.</P>
      <P>Fears of the Y2K bug stem from older computer coding systems that
signified years using only the last two digits -- "99" for 1999, for
example. When the date switches to 2000, some computers with older
coding may misinterpret the date to mean 1900, possibly causing the
machines to malfunction or even crash, Yang noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHARE PRICES CLOSE LOWER, FUTURES DOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices declined 1.5 percent on
Thursday as foreign funds' intensive selling in the previous trading
session triggered panic as local investors feared fund managers would
dump shares as the year 2000 draws near.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index closed
120.13 points lower at 7,739.76, falling below the quarterly average,
and turnover expanded to NT$156.58 (US$4.95 billion), with 3.15
billion shares changing hands, of which selling greatly exceeded
buying by 28 million shares.</P>
      <P>The market opened firmer as sentiment was buoyed by Wall Street's
overnight gains and the government's move to allow the nation's four
major pension funds to increase their investments in stocks.</P>
      <P>But market confidence was undermined by heavy sell-offs by
foreign institutional investors, who had been net buyers for 15
consecutive sessions, causing the index to fall more than 1.5
percent.</P>
      <P>According to dealers, investors feel safer holding onto cash
before the stock market closes for the year, and the index should
head down in the near term as the market loses direction in the
absence of foreign investors who close their books for 1999 in
mid-December.</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories posted losses, with the cement
sector suffering from the largest losses of 3.6 percent; foodstuff
issues, textile shares and financial stocks also posted serious
losses greater than 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Decliners outnumbered gainers 351 to 140, with 65 shares
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market edged down 0.81 point to close at
187.91 on a turnover of NT$15.1 billion.</P>
      <P>All TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) posted serious losses in line with the undesirable
performance of the stock market, with the exception of September
futures, for which no transactions were recorded.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for January moved down 130 points to close at
7,795 with 2,224 contract transactions. Those for February declined
104 points to finish at 7,820 with 19 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for March dipped 77 points to close at 7,900
with 12 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Thursday were 7,925
points for January, 7,924 points for February, 7,977 points for
March, 8,090 points for next June, and 7,987 points for next
September.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, both reported losses.</P>
      <P>January TE futures shed 3.05 points to close at 397.95 with 882
contract transactions, and March TE futures moved up 15 points to
finish at 399 with one contract transaction.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for other months.</P>
      <P>January TF futures dropped 30 points to close at 928 with 228
contract transactions; no transactions were recorded for TF futures
for other months.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)

Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), steady
growth of foreign trade and increased investments by the private

private sectors will be key factors in Taiwan's continued economic
grow in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The study also shows that Taiwan's local economic structure
should be readjusted to adapt to the new situation resulting from the
anticipated accession of Taiwan and mainland China to the WTO. The
readjustment would not only shock the domestic economy but would also
bring opportunities to it.</P>
      <P>The issuance of NT$80 billion in public bonds for the

stimulate increased investment by the public sector, the study shows.</P>
      <P>The eighth naptha cracking plant project, a series of syndicated
industrial and commercial parks, the proposed high-speed railway

    <HEADLINE>GROCER DONATES LAND FOR HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An elderly grocer in Chinshan, a coastal
township in Taipei County, has donated a large tract of land to
accommodate a hospital to be built and operated by National Taiwan
University (NTU) Hospital.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yu-lu, 65, presented the ownership certificate for his
1,926-ping (53.5-square-foot) property to NTU Hospital President Lee
Chen-yuan in a ceremony held on Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the audience at the ceremony, Taipei County Magistrate
Su Chen-chang said he appreciates Cheng's generosity in donating
family assets for public use.</P>
      <P>The hospital president also expressed his gratitude to Cheng,
saying his generous move has helped the hospital realize its
long-time plan to open a branch in the Chinshan area to offer
convenient medical services to local residents.</P>
      <P>For his part, Cheng said he feels no regret in donating the land,
which he had inherited from his ancestors. Cheng said he used to
harvest water bamboo on the land to support his family.</P>
      <P>But now, Cheng said, all of his four children have grown up and
established their own careers. Cheng and his wife now operate a
grocery business. Since income from the grocery is enough to cover
their daily expenses, Chen said he has stopped water bamboo
cultivation and decided to donate the land for hospital construction.</P>
      <P>"My family fully supports my decision," Cheng said, adding that
he believes the souls of his ancestors would also back the donation.</P>
      <P>As there is no large hospital in the Chinshan area, Cheng said
many of his neighbors often have to make long trips to Keelung or
Tamsui to receive medical treatment.</P>
      <P>"So I'll be glad to see a hospital inaugurated in my hometown in
the near future," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Official tallies show that there are only about a dozen private
clinics in the island's four northernmost townships -- Chinshan,
Wanli, Shihmen and Sanchi, also known as the North Beach area.</P>
      <P>NTU Hospital President Lee said the hospital has long planned to
build a branch in the area to serve its 70,000-plus residents. Taiwan
Power Co., a state-owned enterprise, has agreed to offer NT$800
million to help finance the hospital project. "With the land donated
by Cheng, I believe that the project will proceed smoothly," Lee
noted.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the new Chinshan hospital will have 200 beds
for in-patients as well as out-patient and emergency departments. NTU
Hospital will send medical professionals and administrative staff to
operate the new facility.</P>
      <P>"If all goes smoothly, the Chinshan hospital will become
operational in March 2002," Lee added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BECOMES OBSERVER OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PARLIAMENT SPEAKERS FORUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama  City, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Central American nations on Wednesday
unanimously adopted a resolution to allow the Republic of China to
become a permanent observer of the Central American Parliament
Speakers Forum (CAPSF).</P>
      <P>Speakers or deputy speakers of the parliaments of Panama, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Nicaragua and Guatemala passed
the resolution at the CAPSF's ninth meeting, held in Panama.</P>
      <P>The ROC application to join the CAPSF as an observer was at the
top of the agenda. In addition to offering unanimous approval,
representatives from the seven nations of Central America also
stressed that ROC participation in the CAPSF will be conducive to the
promotion of cooperation among the nations.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of the CAPSF, Panamanian First
Vice President Arturo Vallarino and Panamanian Parliament Speaker
Enrique Garrido said the transfer of control of the Panama Canal from
the United States to Panama is closely related to regional
development as a whole, and they believe each Central American nation
will actively participate in Panama Canal affairs in the future.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng, the president of the ROC Legislative Yuan, who is
on a tour of Panama, said he, on behalf of the ROC, had the honor of
joining the CAPSF meeting and expressed the ROC's resolved
willingness to take part in the forum.</P>
      <P>Wang also thanked the Central American nations for their full
support of the ROC after the 921 Earthquake that caused severe life
and property losses in central Taiwan, saying the sincere friendship
established between the ROC and the Central American nations provides
proof of the proverb that "a friend in need is a friend indeed."</P>
      <P>He indicated that the ROC and the Central American nations have
maintained a long and close diplomatic relationship. In addition to
consensus on the upholding of democracy, freedom and people's
welfare, both sides have in common firsthand experience in the
development of politics, culture and society, and they assist each
other in economic, trade and technological development, he added.</P>
      <P>Wang told the parliament speakers of the Central American nations
that in the hope of seeking and expanding room in the international
community for the ROC, the nation has been pushing for political
democratization, economic and trade development, as well as pragmatic
diplomacy in recent years, and such efforts have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>Wang invited representatives attending the CAPSF meeting to visit
the ROC and proposed that next year's meeting be held in Taipei. The
proposal was welcomed by the representatives and will be discussed at
the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MADAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT SOONG MONEY SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By David Wang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a former Republic
of China first lady, has no knowledge of the financial scandal
involving Taiwan's independent presidential candidate James Soong,
her closest relatives said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kung Ling-yi, a niece of Madame Chiang, was responding to
statements made by Soong at a Taipei news conference on Tuesday that
ROC President and ruling Kuomintang Chairman Lee Teng-hui instructed
Soong in 1992 to set up a fund to care for the widow and children of
former President Chiang Ching-kuo, one of Madame Chiang's sons.</P>
      <P>Kung told CNA in a telephone interview that she "feels regret" at
seeing Soong in dispute with the KMT leadership over the issue.</P>
      <P>Kung and her husband, Huang Hsiung-sheng, who have been
responsible for taking care of Madame Chiang for the past 24 years,
said they would not let their 102-year-old aunt know anything about
the current KMT-Soong squabble.</P>
      <P>"We don't want Madame Chiang to be bothered by such things," Kung
said, adding that Madame Chiang has led a peaceful, reclusive life in
New York for most of the 24 years since President Chiang Kai-shek
died in 1975.</P>
      <P>Over the past years, Kung said, Madame Chiang has never involved
herself in Taiwan's politics, nor has she received any financial
subsidies from Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The only things that Madame Chiang has received from Taipei are
notices from the KMT concerning various party conferences," Kung
said, adding that Madame Chiang is still a member of the presidium of
the KMT's Central Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>Kung further said she doesn't know whether any of the offspring
of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo have received financial
assistance from the KMT.</P>
      <P>"Nobody has told us about that, and we can't make any comment on
behalf of Chiang Ching-kuo's offspring," Kung said, adding that she
did not think that Madame Chiang herself has any knowledge of the
alleged KMT financial assistance.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang currently lives in an apartment in Manhattan. Its
annual rental plus tax and management fees amounts to US$100,000,
which is footed by Kung and her husband.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the Chiang family said the ROC government has
paid for aides, nurses and security personnel who serve Madame
Chiang's apartment in accordance with its law governing privileges
for widows of the country's late heads of state. Madame Chiang
herself, however, has not received any government financial support.</P>
      <P>Born Soong May-ling in 1898, Madame Chiang became widely known in
the West as a diplomat and spokeswoman for the Chinese cause against
the invading Japanese in the 1930s.</P>
      <P>After the Chinese Communist Party took control of the mainland in
1949, the ROC government, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek,
moved its seat to Taiwan and Chiang and his US-educated wife became
Asia's foremost anti-communist symbols.</P>

opportunities to take part in development projects in the Panama
Canal area.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cardinal Paul Shan on Thursday
categorically denied reports that the Vatican will soon set up
diplomatic ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Roman Catholic Bishop of Taiwan District said that the
Vatican and Beijing have not yet set up a mechanism for future
negotiations, and added that the Vatican will not consider setting up
diplomatic ties with Beijing until the regime's religious and human
rights persecution has improved greatly.</P>
      <P>Shan said that the Vatican has not informed him of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the Vatican and Beijing. "No
news is good news," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He expressed his belief that the news was leaked by the Beijing
regime with the aim of luring mainland China's more than 10 million
Catholics to join the Beijing's official Catholic organization, The
Patriotic Catholic Church.</P>
      <P>He went to say that the Vatican knows that Beijing wants to set
up diplomatic ties with the Vatican so as to control the mainland's
Catholics. Beijing does not recognize the official Catholic Church,
and insists that only communist authorities can appoint bishops in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shan stressed that the news was released by pro-Beijing
sympathizers with the purpose of building a good image for the
stalemated Vatican-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>He warned however that a wave of pro-Beijing feeling is mounting
in the Holy See, and said that the Vatican might set up diplomatic
relations with Beijing at the expense of Taiwan if the Vatican
decides that human rights and the religious persecution in mainland
China has improved.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the cardinal stressed that the Vatican will send a
representative, a position higher than that of charge d'affaires, to
be stationed in Taiwan, signifying that the Vatican will not neglect
the existence of the more than 300,000 Catholics in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Lu, founder of a human rights
group in Hong Kong, said Thursday that he plans to go to Macau Sunday
to stage a public protest against mainland Chinese official
harassment of his office by anonymous phone calls.</P>
      <P>Lu, who founded the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China in 1993, said the telephone lines of his
office have been jammed by numerous harassing phone calls from the
mainland since May.</P>
      <P>The 35-year-old dissident, who was a student leader during the
1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement, fled to Hong Kong in 1993 and
established the center in the same year. The information center has
been a major source of information on human right violations in
mainland China since 1996.</P>
      <P>The information center said Thursday that mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin gave an order in March "to cut off Lu's sources
of information as soon as possible." From May to October, his office
received about 100 harassing phone calls from the mainland every day.
The number jumped to about 1,000 per day at the end of October,
because the office issued a lot of news about government crackdown on
the Falun Gong sect, which was outlawed in July. The harassment is
still going on.</P>
      <P>Lu will stage the public protest on the eve of Macau's handover
to mainland China, hoping that Jiang, who will officiate the handover
celebration, will take notice of the protest, the information center

January, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Board (TTWB) announced on

-- to satisfy public demand, Shih added.</P>
      <P>Demand for locally produced rice wine has surged since November

      <P>The Chung Hua Institute for Economic

next year may reach 6.79 percent if annual exports can increase by
NT$24 billion (US$750 million).</P>

the United States and Japan continue to improve and spark increased
exports from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under those conditions, he said, the private sector's consumption

      <P>US aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co.
is likely to cooperate with Taiwan air carriers to refurbish
passenger planes as cargo planes to meet market demand, a Boeing
official revealed on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remark shortly after the world's largest

procure 44 in-service passenger planes, refurbish them as cargo
carriers, and then lease them to DHL Corporation, a world-renowned
air freight company.</P>
      <P>Several of Taiwan's major airlines, such as China Airlines (CAL)
and EVA Airways Corp., as well as Aerospace Industry Development
Corp. (AIDC), Taiwan's only aircraft manufacturer, are keenly
interested in the proposed cooperative project with Boeing, the
official said.</P>
      <P>He said CAL, EVA Airways and AIDC plan to engage in the
refurbishing of passenger aircraft in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific
area into cargo transporters by forging strategic alliances with
Boeing.</P>
      <P>The official added that Boeing is currently studying the
feasibility of the idea. "In addition to Taiwan companies, Boeing is
also working to negotiate similar projects with its counterparts in
other countries and areas," he noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan ranked as the United States'
ninth biggest car export market in the first 10 months of this year,
according to statistics released Thursday by the US Department of
Commerce (DOC).</P>
      <P>DOC statistics showed that in the first 10 months of this year,
the top three US automakers -- General Motor, Ford and Chrysler --
exported a total of US$116 million worth of cars to Taiwan, a decrease
of 20 percent over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The top 10 biggest US car export markets in the first 10 months
of this year were Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, Britain, Belgium,
Saudi Arabia, Australia, Taiwan and Sweden, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>In the January-October period, US car exports to Taiwan decreased
US$29 million compared with the same period last year. Taiwan was
the seventh biggest export market for American cars last year.</P>
      <P>DOC figures also revealed that Taiwan was placed the seventh
position in terms of exports of auto parts to the US in the first 10
months of this year, behind Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany, Brazil
and Britain.</P>
      <P>During the 10-month period, the United States bought a total of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian government announced Thursday
the establishment of the Canadian Magazine Fund which will provide
C$150 million (US$102 million) to Canadian magazine publishers over
the next three years.</P>
      <P>The fund was set up after the government unsuccessfully tried to
bring in a bill to keep Canadian editions of foreign magazines known
as "split-runs" out of the country. Under US pressure, Canada backed
down from its position and instead went the subsidy route.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the magazine fund will go to publishers who create
Canadian stories -- whose publications contain 80 percent or more
Canadian editorial content.</P>
      <P>Some money will be available for professional development,
adapting to new technology, marketing and distribution. Funding will
also be available to strengthen the infrastructure of the publication
industry across the country.</P>
      <P>The subsidy is the final chapter in the protracted magazine
dispute that threatened to escalate into a full-scale trade war
between Canada and the US last spring.</P>
      <P>Under a compromise worked out in May, American publishers who
produce Canadian magazines -- known as split-runs -- can print up to
18 percent Canadian advertising per issue.</P>
      <P>Canadian publishers remain concerned that split-runs will skim
off critical Canadian advertising dollars at little cost to the
American publishers whose production costs have already been covered

    <HEADLINE>US SAID LIKELY TO DEFEND TAIWAN, BUT RELUCTANT TO PROVOKE PRC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a full-blown conflict, the United
States would probably not abandon Taiwan outright as it is
strategically too essential to US policy in the region, but
Washington will clearly do what it can to dampen independence
sentiments on Taiwan, according to a Global Intelligence Update
published Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stratfor, Inc., a private global intelligence services company
based in Austin, Texas, wrote in the analysis that the US has issued
an unofficial ultimatum to Taiwan's presidential contenders not to
provoke Beijing any further or risk losing US support.</P>
      <P>"By doing so, Washington has announced that it wants no crisis
during the upcoming US presidential campaign," said the report.</P>
      <P>More importantly, the analysis said, Washington fears that
Beijing may turn up pressure on Taiwan to deflect attention from its
own economic and social problems.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 15, Richard Bush, managing director of the American
Institute in Taiwan, sent a very clear message to Taiwan's
presidential front-runners, stating that "if the new administration's
policies converge with ours, then there won't be a problem. If they
do not, then we will discuss the differences in a spirit of
friendship." He added that the US will adhere to the "one China"
policy.</P>
      <P>Bush's statements revealed two important elements in the US
position. First, Washington's interests demand continued peace in the
Taiwan Straits. Second, Washington sees Communist China as
increasingly cantankerous and unstable, ready to pounce if provoked,
according to the analysis.</P>
      <P>Stratfor, Inc. pointed out that Bush's statements make clear that
the United States is reluctant to see cross-strait tensions escalate.
The year 2000 is also an election year in the United States and
China has already become a hot topic because of espionage and
campaign finance scandals.</P>
      <P>In economic terms as well, the United States does not want
tension to burn the bridges that connect US business interests to
mainland China. The United States has just reached an agreement with
China that paves the way for the latter's entry into the World Trade
Organization. Washington does not want a conflict to trip up the
agreement before American investors reap the economic benefits of
access to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The United States also wants to maintain peace as the waters
between mainland China and Taiwan are the most important shipping
route in the region, said the analysis. A cross-strait conflict could
halt the flow of trade through the region, potentially endangering
Asia's faltering export-driven economic recovery. And if Beijing were
to control these waters, Communist China could effectively control
the region.</P>
      <P>The analysis also mentions that Washington senses that Communist
China is on edge and could very easily respond to any provocation
with hostility. Moreover, China will regain control over Macau later
this month, freeing Beijing to focus its efforts on Taiwan, one of
its last unresolved territorial issues.</P>
      <P>Washington may be sensing as well that confrontation with Taiwan
could be a handy release valve for pressures building up within
mainland China. A nationalistic campaign to recover what is viewed as
a renegade province could successfully distract the mainland Chinese
people from the economic malaise that has triggered over 60,000
protests this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has purchased 30
Macedonian-made buses to donate to the Yugoslavian province of
Kosovo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>Kao An, an official with MOFA's European Affairs Department, said
the bus donation is part of the US$300 million aid package to the
war-torn Yugoslav province announced by President Lee Teng-hui
earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Kao said the ROC embassy in Macedonia signed a purchase contract
with the Macedonian National Bus Co. in August during an official
visit to the Balkan state by ROC Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>According to the contract, the 30 buses are worth a total of
US$2.34 million.</P>
      <P>Kao said the first batch of 10 buses were delivered in late
November, adding that more than 100 dignitaries, including
Macedonia's foreign minister and science-technology minister, as well
as Kosovo's provincial bus bureau chief, attended the delivery
ceremony held at the ROC embassy in the Macedonian capital of Skopje.</P>
      <P>The remaining 20 buses are scheduled to be delivered on Dec. 20,
Kao said. Each bus has 36 seats plus space for 64 standing
passengers.</P>
      <P>Kao pointed out that the donation signifies the ROC's goodwill
toward Kosovo, which borders Macedonia, one of the ROC's two
diplomatic allies in Europe.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the deal will also help Kosovo ease its
shortage of mass transportation vehicles, as well as help increase
the business volume of Macedonia's state-run bus manufacturing firm.</P>
      <P>"We believe this deal is in the interest of all three parties --
the ROC, Macedonia and Kosovo," Kao said, adding that the ROC hopes
this deal will have a positive effect on ROC relations with both
Macedonia and Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Kao further said the ROC will continue to implement other
programs included in the US$300 million Kosovo-related aid package.</P>
      <P>The ROC forged formal diplomatic ties with Macedonia in January
this year, making the southern Balkan state Taiwan's second ally in
Europe after the Vatican.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TTWB DENIES IMPORTED RICE WINE WILL COME FROM MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rice wine which is to be imported to Taiwan
from Singapore to overcome a shortfall in domestic production
capacity will not be produced in mainland China, the Taiwan Tobacco
and Wine Board (TTWB) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>TTWB officials noted that the winning bidder, Far East Distillers
Pte. Ltd. of Singapore, will have to include a certificate of place
of origin when it exports the rice wine to Taiwan, which will have to
be reviewed before the wine gets import approval.</P>
      <P>Local reports have noted that Far East Distillers is only a
trading company, and have claimed that while Singapore is noted for
its "Tiger" beer, it "cannot possibly" produce rice wine.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation United Daily News said the imported rice
wine might be produced in the mainland, Thailand or Cambodia, where
it is also popular.</P>
      <P>TTWB officials pointed out that current regulations ban mainland
alcohol products from being importing into Taiwan. Furthermore,
foreign bidders have to present samples and certificates of place of
origin in order to qualify to take part in the bidding.</P>
      <P>The officials said that if the Singapore rice wine was from the
mainland, they would not have been be allowed to even take part in
the bidding, let alone win the contract.</P>
      <P>The TTWB decided to address the domestic production shortfall by
importing 15 million bottles of rice wine from Singapore, with the
first batch of five million bottles arriving around Jan. 20, in time
for the increasing demand around the lunar New Year, which falls on
Feb. 5, 2000.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the taste and the flavor of the imported
rice wine is similar to that of the local red label rice wine, a
local kitchen staple, after they tested it by preparing rice wine
chicken, a popular winter dish that requires a lot of rice wine.</P>
      <P>They said local rice wine, which is currently sold at NT$24 per
bottle, is bottled in brown glass, while the imported product, which
will be sold at NT$24 or lower, is packaged in white PE bottles.</P>
      <P>In
 anticipation of Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization, when the red label rice wine will be classified as a
distillate, with a resulting high tax levy, many people have begun
hoarding the local product, resulting in serious shortages which has
forced the TTWB to adopt rationing measures.</P>
      <P>The situation has been exacerbated with the coming of winter,
when local people use rice wine much more frequently to prepare
warming soups and stews.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MUTUAL RESPECT KEY TO CHINA'S UNIFICATION: ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
met on Friday with foreign participants in the second general meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Security Forum, to whom he stated the ROC's
consistent efforts in the pursuit of stable cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee told the visitors at the Presidential Office that only if
Taipei and Beijing each respect the "fact that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are currently ruled by two separate governments with no
attachment to one another, whereby two equitable political entities
coexist," can they overcome their political differences and jointly
develop their relations to benefit the peaceful unification of China.</P>
      <P>Only if this fact is faced can the two sides engage in talks on
an equal footing, Lee said, adding that this is the reason he put
forward the "special state-to-state relationship" theory on July 9 to
explain the current cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>The president said that the ROC government believes stable
cross-strait relations is the key to maintaining peace in the
Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, it consistently promotes a pragmatic
cross-strait policy, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the ROC in 1991 renounced the use of military
force to solve the cross-cross dispute, and has since gradually
relaxed bans on exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland in the hope
of setting up a basis for cross-strait cooperation.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Beijing has never made any goodwill
response to Taipei's efforts, the ROC will continue its efforts to
ease cross-strait, Lee said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lee also outlined his opinions on regional
security, saying that the mutual military alliance headed by the
United States plays an important role, and cited the increasing
expansion of the US-Japan security mechanism in the Asia-Pacific
region as evidence of this.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SET UP IMPORT RELIEF FUND TO HELP FARMERS, URGES LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Friday
the government should set up a NT$100 billion "import damage relief
fund" to help local farmers cope with challenges brought by the
Republic of China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Lien, also the ruling Kuomintang's standard-bearer in the 2000
presidential election, made the statement at the opening ceremony of
a joint annual meeting of domestic agricultural associations.</P>
      <P>Noting that local farmers will face global competition in the
domestic agricultural market following Taiwan's imminent WTO entry,
Lien said the government should set aside enough funds to help
those who are hurt by agricultural imports.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Lien said the government should help local
farmers upgrade their competitiveness. "To reach this goal, we must
push for agricultural reengineering, including production
adjustment, ecological conservation, relaxation of restriction on
farmland use, rural reconstruction, agricultural technology
development, international and cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural
cooperation," Lien explained.</P>
      <P>In preparation for Taiwan's WTO entry, Lien said Taiwan must
reorganize its agricultural structure, with upgrading of
competitiveness as its top concern.</P>
      <P>"We must develop a market-oriented and technology-centered
agricultural production and marketing mechanism," Lien noted, adding
that the government must adopt new strategies toward farmers
organization restructuring, agricultural technology development,
products marketing and agriculture-related financial services.</P>
      <P>On the planned liberalization of farmland trade, Lien said the
liberalization is mainly aimed at introducing entrepreneurship,
business-style management and high technology into agricultural
production.</P>
      <P>Lien further said the government-proposed farmland trade
liberalization does not mean that farmland can be freely used
in the future.</P>
      <P>"The bill is based on the principle that farmland can be used
only for agricultural purposes," Lien said, adding under this
principles, prior government approval is needed for turning farmland
for non-agricultural usage.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lien said it's unreasonable to completely ban
construction of facilities on newly purchased tracts of farmland.
"No other country around the world has imposed such a restriction,"
Lien said, adding such a ban is not a good way to prevent farmland
trade speculation and damage to rural landscape and soil
conservation.</P>
      <P>"The most effective way to curb illegal land specualtion and
other farmland-related irregularities lies in the government's
determination to formulate comprehensive regulations and to
enforce all those regualtions," he added.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the vice president has
spoken out his opinion concerning the controversial
farmland trade liberalization and agricultural development
bill.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lien further urged the government to develop a new
farmland leasing system to facilitate more efficient use of farmland
and expansion of the scale of agricultural operations.</P>
      <P>Lien also called for the establishment of nationwide farmers' and
fishermen's associations, national agricultural technology research
institutes and a nationwide agriculture-related banking system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Police on Friday raided a criminal
organization from Hong Kong which was found to have stolen at least
NT$500 million (US$15.82 million) from local five-star hotels and
resorts since May using forged credit cards.</P>
      <P>The ring was headed by 24-year-old Lee Chun-hsiung, who was
arrested during the morning raid, said a spokesman for the police
task force formed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB).</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that more than 10 members of the group are
still at large, and that the CIB is expanding its investigation.</P>
      <P>The ring obtained the data required to forge the credit cards by
first stealing credit card readers from hotel shops or restaurants,
implanting a "spy" silicon chip, then replacing the machines,
according to the CIB.</P>
      <P>The modus operandi was sophisticated and would not have succeed
without high-tech knowledge, the CIB said, adding that they suspect
college or university students may have been involved.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local newspapers reported that the credit card scam,
the first of its kind discovered in Taiwan, is suspected to have been
masterminded by several Hong Kong technicians dismissed by a credit
card company in the former British colony.</P>
      <P>Shortly after they were fired, Hong Kong police received reports

    <HEADLINE>ROC DRIVE TO DEVELOP MISSILE SHIELD PROMPTED BY BEIJING THREATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei said on Friday
the Republic of China's drive to develop a missile shield is
prompted by mainland China's mounting military threats, particularly
its guided ballistic missile deployment.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the second
conference of the Asia-Pacific Security Forum, sponsored by the
Institute for National Policy Research, a local private think tank.</P>
      <P>This was also the first time that Tang has explained to the
world the principal motivation behind the ROC's efforts to beef up
its missile defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>In his keynote speech, Tang also reaffirmed the ROC's commitment
to contributing to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,
adding he hopes the ROC's consistent efforts in this regard can
receive recognition and support in the world community.</P>
      <P>Because of a lack of consensus on the post-Cold War
international order, Tang said, Asia-Pacific countries still fail to
develop a full-fledged collective security mechanism.</P>
      <P>"While the Western world has developed a 'safe community'
concept, regional security frameworks in the Asia-Pacific and their
functions still face many problems," Tang regretted.</P>
      <P>Noting that historical national splits and territorial disputes
have made the Asia-Pacific region a potential flash point in the next
century in the eyes of many international affairs experts and
scholars, Tang said a breakout of military confrontation will not
only affect Asia-Pacific countries but will also have a strong
impact on the global economy and even cause political instability.</P>
      <P>Tang further pointed out that mainland China has continued
increasing its military budget since the early 1980s with a view to
establishing modernized armed forces to prevent US military
intervention in its neighboring area so as to facilitate
solution to Taiwan and South China Sea issues or at least to
create a climate favorable to resolving these thorny issues.</P>
      <P>Warning that mainland China's military build-up has prompted
countries in the region to seek countermeasures, Tang said
Asia-Pacific countries should establish a military mutual trust
mechanism and keep defense transparency to ease mutual suspicion and
curb possible arms races.</P>
      <P>"We believe the most effective approach to tackle the post-Cold
War Asia-Pacific security issues lies in the establishment of
multilateral dialogue channels and a mutual trust mechanism," Tang
stressed, adding that consultations on regional security issues
should not exclude the ROC's participation. "Frequent compromise
with mainland China would only encourage the rise of regional
hegemony."</P>
      <P>Tang further said the development and proliferation of guided
missile technology has threatened security of the entire Asia-Pacific
region, particularly in the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan and
South Asia.</P>
      <P>"Frequent missile testing by mainland China and North Korea has
forced their neighboring countries to seek effective ways to defend
their national security and even triggered a controversy over the
development a theater missile defense system," Tang noted.</P>
      <P>As development and proliferation of guided missiles and cruise
missiles would absolutely have a detrimental effect on regional
security, Tang went on, those countries' failure to refrain from
continuing such pursuit would eventually spark an arms race in the
region.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, a CNA dispatch from San Francisco said that Pelosi
gave high marks for Taiwan's achievements in democratization and for
President Lee's contribution to promoting the country's
democratization.</P>
      <P>Pelosi said at a press conference before departing her San
Francisco district for a Taiwan trip that the progress and
achievement registered by Taiwan was one of the greatest victories of
the 20th century. The able leadership and courage of President Lee
was worthy, she said.</P>
      <P>Pelosi expressed the hope that she would have the chance to meet

Taiwan will be taken up at the time when Congress begins to
deliberate on giving mainland China permanent normal trade relations
status (PNTRS), so as ensure Taiwan's WTO entry without political

      <P>Speaking on the current cross-strait situation, she said the

    <HEADLINE>US ENVOY REAFFIRMS SECURITY COMMITMENTS TO TAIWAN UNDER TRA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The de facto US ambassador to Taiwan said
on Friday that the United States will continue to uphold its security
commitments to the Republic of China under the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Raymond F. Burghardt, director of the Taipei Office of the
American Institute in Taiwan, which represents US interests in
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, made the statement
in a speech delivered at a seminar on Asia-Pacific security issues.</P>
      <P>In his speech, titled "the Dynamics of Asia-Pacific Security: A
Fin-de-siecle Assessment," Burghardt promised that the United States
will help to maintain a climate of peace and stability in this
region now and into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Burghardt also took the occasion to reiterate the
Clinton administration's strong opposition to the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act (TSEA).</P>
      <P>Quoting US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth's testimony to Congress in August this
year, Burghardt said the Clinton administration believes the TSEA
could actually weaken Taiwan's security and have a negative effect
on US security interests in the region.</P>
      <P>"It certainly would be seen as a significant revision of the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA)," noted Burghardt. The TRA is the US law
that regulates exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of official
ties.</P>
      <P>Noting that the mechanisms that are already in place for
US-Taiwan security cooperation are strong, proven and comprehensive,
Burghardt said mainland China would interpret the TSEA as a direct
challenge and would build up its missile deployments.</P>
      <P>"So, rather than improving Taiwan's security situation, the new
mechanisms under the TSEA could actually lead to an arms race that
would move all parties one step farther from a peaceful
cross-(Taiwan) Strait resolution," Burghardt said, adding: "We need
to look objectively at the so-called Security Enhancement Act and
whether it would really be in Taiwan's interests."</P>
      <P>Touching on the topic whether Taiwan should take part in the
theater missile defense (TMD) system, Burghardt said the TMD is
still very much in conceptualization and development stage, and that
deployment is still years away.</P>
      <P>"We have briefed Taiwan, as we have other friends, on TMD. We do
not preclude providing TMD to Taiwan, but it is premature to make
the decision now," Burghardt said.</P>
      <P>He further said security is more than military capability.
"There are political, economic and social aspects that are just as
important, or perhaps more important, than military hardware in
maintaining the peace and in resolving differences."</P>
      <P>Burghardt also said the Koo-Wang talks represented a
significant step toward cooperation between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait. "We hope the two sides will be able to resume the
series of talks in the near future," he added.</P>
      <P>The "Koo-Wang talks" referred to meetings between Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Wang
Daohan, president of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS). The two elders were authorized by their
respective governments to meet in Singapore in 1993 and in Shanghai
in 1998 to discuss some bilateral issues in the absence of official
contact.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC UNVEILS POSITION PAPER ON MACAU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will continue to
serve the people of both Taiwan and Macau, according to a government
position paper on Macau unveiled Friday in the runup to the impending
handover of the Portuguese colony to the rule of mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), in presenting
its paper entitled "A Stable and Mutually Beneficial Relation -- The
ROC's Stance on Macau in 1999," said it is happy to see that more
than four centuries of colonial rule of Macau will end on Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>MAC officials noted that around 6,000 Macau students have studied
in Taiwan over the past decade, and that around 30,000 Macau laborers
are now working in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan tourists made around 822,000 visits to Macau last year.
Taiwan businessmen investing in the mainland from Macau totaled more
than 700. All these figures show that Macau's relations with Taiwan
have played an important role in the development of the casino
enclave, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>To protect the stability and prosperity of Macau, the MAC said,
"we don't wish to see any backpedaling in Taiwan-Macau relations, nor
do we wish to see the development of future Taiwan-Macau relations
subject to any undue intervention or restraint."</P>
      <P>Responding to the changed status of Macau after the handover, the
MAC said the development of relations with Macau will be governed
under the framework of the Hong Kong-Macau Relations Act and related
regulations.</P>
      <P>The MAC expressed the hope that Taiwan-Macau relations could
contribute more to the stability and development of Macau after the
handover. Therefore, the MAC hopes that bilateral relations will move
along the following lines:</P>
      <P>-- Establishing formal, systematic and multilateral communication
channels so as to work out problems effectively and promote bilateral
interests;</P>
      <P>-- upgrading the service functions of Taiwan's representative
office in Macau so as to provide better service to the people of both
Taiwan and Macau; and</P>
      <P>-- stepping up exchanges between Taiwan and Macau to promote
understanding and cooperation.</P>
      <P>The government body that is in charge of mainland policy also
appealed to the mainland to abide by its pledge that "Macau people
can rule Macau" and its "high autonomy" promise so as to lay the
foundation for the development of Macau.</P>
      <P>It said that mainland China, with its authoritarian system, may
consider it a big step forward to practice its "one country, two
systems" formula in Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>However, the MAC continued, to impose the "two systems" policy on
a democratic Taiwan would be a regression, stressing that the freedom
and democracy of the ROC are not only lacking in Hong Kong and Macau,
but are something that mainland authorities could not provide.</P>
      <P>The MAC said the latest poll showed that up to 87 percent of
Taiwan people do not favor the "one country, two systems" formula as
a way to sort out cross-strait problems.</P>
      <P>Rather than peddling the unpopular formula, the mainland should
commit itself to democratic reforms so that the union of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will come naturally as the mainland
gradually moves along the road to freedom, democracy and equal
prosperity, the MAC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S WTO ENTRY A CHANCE FOR TAIWAN BIZMEN TO TRANSFORM BUSINESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's World Trade Organization
(WTO) accession will give Taiwan businessmen the chance to transform
their businesses into advanced enterprises, said the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) on Friday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD cited the latest analysis by Prof. Chen Tien-chih of
National Taiwan University as the source of the supposition.</P>
      <P>Prof. Chen said that after mainland China enters the WTO,
Taiwan's traditional small-sized industries could create product
brands of their own on the back of the vast hinterland of mainland
China, or develop regional-characteristic production nets with the
help of electronic commerce (e-commerce).</P>
      <P>He also thought that Taiwan businessmen could establish
production strongholds in mainland China or Southeast Asia through
investing in the two regions, and could join forces with Western
multilateral enterprises in the fields of marketing and design to
take a seat in the international market.</P>
      <P>Chen outlined the main reasons for the difficulties that Taiwan's
traditional industries have faced in a report on "The Reconstruction
of Traditional Industries."</P>
      <P>He indicated that Taiwan's traditional small industries mainly
play the role of manufacturing in the international division of labor
system in the form of OEM (original equipment manufacturing), with
product design and marketing being in inferior positions.</P>
      <P>The lowering of manufacturing costs does have a limit, and once
the traditional manufacturing industries can no longer cut costs,
they teeter on the brink of being eliminated, he said.</P>
      <P>Since 1986, Taiwan's government has unceasingly advocated the
upgrading of traditional industries, but its effort has had little
effect. This is mainly because emerging high-tech industries
continuously sprang up like mushrooms, the report said.</P>
      <P>Chen thought the problems that Taiwan's traditional industries
have faced in recent years reveal that the government regulations
concerning the upgrade of industries have their shortcomings because
the regulations mainly encourage those high-tech industries to engage
in research and development and automation of production.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that there are three ways to upgrade traditional
industries dominated by small- and medium-sized enterprises:</P>
      <P>-- creating product brands of their own;</P>
      <P>-- establishing regional-characteristic production nets via
e-commerce; and</P>
      <P>-- investing abroad and forming strategic alliances with Western
multilateral enterprises in the fields of design and marketing to
establish positions in international markets.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will combat its problem of visa
overstayers who compete in the labor market with Australians, the
Immigration Department said on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA, Immigration Minister Philip
Ruddock said the government will try to make Australia less
attractive to people working illegally because "they take jobs
belonging to Australians, and can be used by unscrupulous employers
to undercut responsible, law abiding organizations."</P>
      <P>"A significant source of the problem has been with people who
have overstayed their visas, and it is estimated that up to half of
the overstaying population is working," Ruddock said.</P>
      <P>In 1998-99, he said, 13,472 overstayers were found, representing
a 6-percent increase over the previous year. In addition, more than
2,000 people in Australia lawfully were found working in
contravention of their visa conditions, he added.</P>
      <P>Most of the overstayers were British, a department spokesman
said, followed by people from the United States and mainland China,
and he added that the number is expected to increase with people
coming to seek work opportunities opened up by the 2000 Olympic Games
in Sydney.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said the government would make it tougher for both
Australian employers and tourists who work illegally by boosting
fines and imposing prison terms of up to two years for violators.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Lancet, a prestigious British medical
journal, has lent its voice to support Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>In its Dec. 18 issue, the journal ran an article contributed by
the Taipei representative office in London addressing the issue of
why the Republic of China must join the WHO.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the article, the journal ran an editorial in
support of Taiwan's bid to join the organization. The editorial urged
the international community to address and rectify the injustice of
Taiwan being excluded from the United Nations agency due to political
factors and the resulting problems.</P>
      <P>The editorial said that in order to continue improving the health
of people in Taiwan, and for the added reason that it can contribute
to the improvement of medical care worldwide, the ROC must be allowed
to rejoin the WHO so that the organization can live up to its goal of
seeking the greatest benefit for all the people of the world.</P>
      <P>The editorial also stressed that the ROC, after being excluded
from the WHO, has been denied access to exchanges of both information

    <HEADLINE>INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EXPLAINS USE OF 'SECRET FUND'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate James
Soong said on Friday night that the so-called "secret fund" he
obtained seven years ago on instructions from Kuomintang Chairman Lee
Teng-hui totaled NT$240 million.</P>
      <P>That figure is NT$100 million higher than the one he gave at a
press conference early this week.</P>
      <P>Soong told reporters that Lee instructed him to use the fund to
take care of family members of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo
and to pay for expenses required for the smooth management of party
and political affairs.</P>
      <P>Due to his special relationship with Lee, the former KMT
secretary general said, Lee entrusted him with the secret fund, which
until recently was deposited in the accounts of Soong Chen-yuan,
Soong's son, and Chen Pi-yun, sister of Soong's wife.</P>
      <P>Of the secret fund, according to Soong, the NT$100 million for
care of the Chiang family came from the Broadcasting Corporation of
China, and so far about NT$90 million has been used, with NT$47
million (including interest) remaining unused.</P>
      <P>Regarding the NT$146 million fund for management of political and
party affairs, Soong said that about NT$60 million came from a
special account which he used when he was KMT secretary general, and
the remaining NT$86 million came from a KMT-run company.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Soong produced the certificate
of a special account for the KMT secretary general issued by the Bank
of Taiwan to rebut the KMT side's allegation that there was no such
an account in existence.</P>
      <P>He also said that the fund for the special account was from
the contributions from the private sector.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Huang Hui-chen criticized Soong, calling him
"dishonest" because Soong's statement earlier Friday conflicted with
his previous statement.</P>
      <P>Former Foreign Minister Jason Hu, now serving as general
executive of the campaign headquarters for the KMT's presidential
nominee Lien Chan, said that the Lien camp has no intention of
intervening in this matter.</P>
      <P>He urged Soong "to face the truth with sincerity, and to shoulder
responsibility with courage."</P>
      <P>Soong denied allegations that he had "embezzled" the KMT fund,
and stressed that almost all transactions relating to the fund could
be traced through records. He especially listed some use of the fund
for the Chiang families with concrete figures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OFFICIAL BLAMES MEDIA FOR WORSENING TIES WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official on mainland China
affairs on Saturday blamed the media "in a certain place" for
misleading reports which have poisoned Taiwan's ties with mainland
China rather than improve mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Without naming names, Su Chi, chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), said certain media sources are responsible for bending
facts to make sensational stories to the extent that they have thrown
accuracy to the wind.</P>
      <P>In a veiled denunciation of the Hong Kong press, which often
releases false news about Beijing's military exercises in attempts to
intimate Taiwan, Su said those newspapers have unwittingly played
into Beijing's hands and have helped in its war of nerves with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the important role in a democracy of a free press
-- including the right to make mistakes -- Su said the fragile ties
between Taiwan and mainland China will brook no false reports.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a prize-giving ceremony in honor of distinguished
journalist coverage of bilateral ties, Su lauded the local media as
"more balanced" than their counterparts in "a certain place" in
reporting stories about Taiwan and mainalnd china.</P>
      <P>He praised local journalists posted in mainland China for their
"marvelous" coverage of mainland affairs given the numerous
limitations imposed on their activities by Beijing, and the
omnipresent threat of being accused of "leaking state secrets"
hanging over their heads as they investigate stories.</P>
      <P>In a prepared written statement, Su excoriated Beijing for what
he called reducing the media into a government mouthpiece rather than
making it a valuable instrument catering for the people's right to
know.</P>
      <P>Beijing's attitude has resulted in an unbalanced flow of news
between Taiwan and mainalnd China, with Taiwan covering mainland
Chinese affairs but mainland Chinese newspapers rarely publishing any
news about Taiwan, said Su.</P>
      <P>Mainland journalists chosen by Beijing to visit Taiwan under
bilateral exchange programs often retire or give up their jobs after
their journeys, suggesting that Beijing considers the exchange of
visits as nothing more than a reward for outgoing press officials,
said Su.</P>
      <P>Taiwan leaders rarely make headlines in mainland Chinese
newspapers. Although this situation altered somewhat after President
Lee Teng-hui made his "special state-to-state relationship" claim
regarding cross-strait ties, Taiwan leaders are cast in a negative
light by mainland Chinese media, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Much to Taipei's chagrin, Su said, some of those journalists who
have visited Taiwan have also led in criticizing Lee for his advocacy
of Taiwan's statehood status.</P>
      <P>Su urged Beijing to open negotiations with Taipei on the
permanent exchange of reporters, and he also called on mainland
Chinese journalists to treat Taiwan fairly in their reports, in order
to foster mutual trust.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT STABILITY NEEDS RESOLUTE US: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the United States is resolute, peace
can be maintained in the Taiwan Strait until a political settlement
is reached, according to a foreign policy adviser to US Republican
presidential hopeful George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>Condoleezza Rice, professor of political science at Stanford
University, wrote in the latest issue of "Foreign Affairs" quarterly
magazine that only the US military has the power needed to deter
trouble on the Korean peninsula or across the Taiwan Strait, with the
goal being to make it inconceivable for North Korea or communist
China to use force.</P>
      <P>She said that for America and its allies, the most daunting task
is to find the right policy balance toward Russia and communist
China. Both are equally important to the future of international
peace, but the challenges they pose are very different.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is a rising power. In economic terms, that should
be good news, because in order to maintain its economic dynamism, it
must be more integrated into the international economy. This will
require increased openness and transparency and the growth of private
industry.</P>
      <P>The political struggle in Beijing now is over how to maintain the
Communist Party's monopoly on power. Some see economic reform, growth
and a better life for the mainland Chinese people as the key. Others
see the inherent contradiction in loosening economic control and
maintaining the party's political dominance. As mainland China's
economic problems multiply due to slowing growth rates, failing
banks, inert state enterprises and rising unemployment, this struggle
will intensify, noted Rice.</P>
      <P>Even if there is an argument for economic interaction with
Beijing, she said, "China is still a potential threat to stability in
the Asia-Pacific region. Its military power is currently no match for
that of the United States. But that condition is not necessarily
permanent. What we do know is that China is a great power with
unresolved vital interests, particularly concerning Taiwan and the
South China Sea."</P>
      <P>Mainland China resents the role of the United States in the
Asia-Pacific region. This means that mainland China is not a "status
quo" power but one that would like to alter Asia's balance of power
in its own favor. That alone makes it a strategic competitor, not the
"strategic partner" the Clinton administration once called it.</P>
      <P>Add to this mainland China's record of cooperation with Iran and
Pakistan in the proliferation of ballistic missile technology, and
the security problem is obvious. "China will do what it can to
enhance its position, whether by stealing nuclear secrets or by
trying to intimidate Taiwan," wrote the senior fellow at the Hoover
Institute.</P>
      <P>Rice said mainland China's success in controlling the balance of
power depends in large part on America's reaction to the challenge.
The United States must deepen its cooperation with Japan and South
Korea and maintain its commitment to a robust military presence in
the region.</P>
      <P>The United States also has a deep interest in the security of
Taiwan, she stressed. It is a model of democratic and market-oriented
development, and it invests significantly in the mainland's economy.
The long-standing US commitment to a "one China" policy that leaves
to a future date the resolution of the relationship between Taipei
and Beijing is wise.</P>
      <P>But that policy requires that neither side challenge the status
quo and that Beijing, as the more powerful actor, renounce the use of
force. US resolve anchors this policy.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration tilted toward Beijing, when, for
instance, it used mainland China's formulation of the "Three Noes"
during Clinton's trip there, and Taiwan has been looking for
attention and reassurance since then, Rice concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO ENTRY TO OFFER NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR TAIPEI-BEIJING EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The de facto US ambassador to Taiwan said
on Saturday that the United States hopes the World Trade Organization
(WTO) will provide a new forum for exchanges and interaction between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Raymond F. Burghardt, director of the Taipei Office of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which represents US interests in
the Republic of China in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, made
the statement at an annual conference of the ROC's US Study Society.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Taiwan and mainland China might be admitted to
the WTO in the first half of next year, Burghardt said the United
States will take delight in seeing the two sides become full members
of the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that the WTO will offer new opportunities for
cross-strait exchanges and interaction so as to reduce tension in the
region," Burghardt said.</P>
      <P>The top US representative in Taiwan further said the United
States has worked out sound yet flexible policies and measures that
meet its goal of promoting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait
and the entire Asia-Pacific region in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>In addition to upholding its security commitments to Taiwan under
the Taiwan Relations Act, Burghardt said, the United States will also
actively expand relations in political, economic and social
dimensions.</P>
      <P>Touching on the triangular Washington-Taipei-Beijing relations
over the past 20 years, Burghardt said that in today's world,
economic exchanges often precede political exchanges, adding that he
believes booming commercial exchanges will help accelerate economic
globalization in the coming century.</P>
      <P>"And this is why the WTO has become increasingly important in the
world economy," Burghardt said, adding that the United States
encourages all countries around the world to take part in the WTO.
Nevertheless, he admitted, the WTO cannot resolve all the world's
trade issues.</P>
      <P>Burghardt also referred to the fact that when AIT Chairman
Richard Bush visited Taipei from Dec. 7-15, many local people asked
him which Taiwan presidential candidate the United States most favors
and least likes, and their odds for victory in the March 18, 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>No matter how the question is pursued, Burghardt said, the US
answer is the same: "The United States does not favor or oppose any
political party or individual candidate in Taiwan's 2000 presidential
election, and will work with whomever the people of Taiwan choose to
serve as their leader through a free, fair and open election."</P>

TAIWAN OFFICIAL BLAMES MEDIA FOR WORSENING TIES WITH MAINLAND CHINA</P>
      <P>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA) Taiwan's top official on mainland China
affairs on Friday blamed the media "in a certain place" for
misleading reports which have poisoned Taiwan's ties with mainland
China rather than improve mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Without naming names, Su Chi, chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), said certain media sources are responsible for bending
facts to make sensational stories to the extent that they have thrown
accuracy to the wind.</P>
      <P>In a veiled denunciation of the Hong Kong press, which often
releases false news about Beijing's military exercises in attempts to
intimidate Taiwan, Su said those newspapers have unwittingly played
into Beijing's hands and have helped in its war of nerves with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the important role in a democracy of a free press
-- including the right to make mistakes -- Su said the fragile ties
between Taiwan and mainland China will brook no false reports.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a prize-giving ceremony in honor of distinguished
journalist coverage of bilateral ties, Su lauded the local media as
"more balanced" than their counterparts in "a certain place" in
reporting stories about Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>He praised local journalists posted in mainland China for their
"marvelous" coverage of mainland affairs given the numerous
limitations imposed on their activities by Beijing, and the
omnipresent threat of being accused of "leaking state secrets"
hanging over their heads as they investigate stories.</P>
      <P>In a prepared written statement, Su excoriated Beijing for what
he called reducing the media into a government mouthpiece rather than
making it a valuable instrument catering for the people's right to
know.</P>
      <P>Beijing's attitude has resulted in an unbalanced flow of news
between Taiwan and mainland China, with Taiwan covering mainland
Chinese affairs but mainland Chinese newspapers rarely publishing any
news about Taiwan, said Su.</P>
      <P>Mainland journalists chosen by Beijing to visit Taiwan under
bilateral exchange programs often retire or give up their jobs after
their journeys, suggesting that Beijing considers the exchange of
visits as nothing more than a reward for outgoing press officials,
said Su.</P>
      <P>Taiwan leaders rarely make headlines in mainland Chinese
newspapers. Although this situation altered somewhat after President
Lee Teng-hui made his "special state-to-state relationship" claim
regarding cross-strait ties, Taiwan leaders are cast in a negative
light by mainland Chinese media, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Much to Taipei's chagrin, Su said, some of those journalists who
have visited Taiwan have also led in criticizing Lee for his advocacy
of Taiwan's statehood status.</P>
      <P>Su urged Beijing to open negotiations with Taipei on the
permanent exchange of reporters, and he also called on mainland
Chinese journalists to treat Taiwan fairly in their reports, in order
to foster mutual trust.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FUTURE TAIWAN-MACAU TIES NOT TO BE SUBJECT TO `HONG KONG FORMULA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior mainland China affairs official
said on Saturday that Taiwan-Macau relations will absolutely not be
subject to the so-called "Hong Kong formula" after the Portuguese
colony's reversion to mainland rule on Monday.</P>
      <P>"Post-handover relations between Taiwan and Macau must be based
on the principles of dignity, reciprocity and pragmatism," said Su
Chi, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
which charts the Republic of China's policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in response to a press inquiry as to whether
the ROC representative office in Macau will be closed or changes made
to its official title to ensure its continued existence after the
enclave's handover.</P>
      <P>If the so-called "Hong Kong formula" were to be adopted, the ROC
representative office would have to change its official designation
from the current "Taipei Trade and Tourism Office, Macau" to "Chung
Hwa Travel Service, Macau," and its liaison with the post-handover
Macau government would rely on a special adviser to Macau Chief
Executive Edmund Ho.</P>
      <P>After Hong Kong reverted to Beijing's rule on July 1, 1997, Hong
Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa appointed his adviser, Paul Yip,
to handle exchanges with Taiwan, while Taiwan's representative office
there was named "Chung Hwa Travel Service, Hong Kong."</P>
      <P>Noting that present Taiwan-Macau relations are very close, Su
urged the Macau authorities to consider the issue of bilateral ties
on a reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that about 6,000 Macau students have received
education in Taiwan over the past 10 years. At present, more than
30,000 Macau residents are working in Taiwan, and Taiwan people made
822,000-plus visits to the enclave last year. In addition, more than
700 Taiwan companies have invested in mainland China via Macau.</P>
      <P>"All these figures point to the fact that Taiwan has played an
important role in Macau's development over the past decade," Su
stressed.</P>
      <P>To help maintain Macau's stability and prosperity, Su went on,
the ROC does not want to see a downslide in its relations with Macau
after the enclave's handover. "We also don't want to see future
Taiwan-Macau relations impeded by any improper interference or
restrictions."</P>
      <P>In preparation for Macau's imminent handover, Su said the MAC
will open a Macau affairs bureau on Dec. 20 to handle post-handover
exchanges with the territory.</P>
      <P>He also outlined three principal guidelines for promoting
post-handover ties with Macau:</P>
      <P>-- Establishing institutionalized, formalized and diversified
communication channels to facilitate the solution of bilateral issues
and boost mutual benefits;</P>
      <P>-- Upgrading the services and functions of the ROC's
representative office in Macau to better serve Macau residents; and</P>
      <P>-- Beefing up exchanges with Macau to enhance mutual
understanding and cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF OUTLINES KEY ISSUES IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Disputes across the Taiwan Strait can be
resolved only when mainland China has the courage and self-confidence
to face a democratic new Taiwan, a senior mainland affairs official
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, made the
remarks in a speech he delivered at the second conference of the
Asia-Pacific Security Forum sponsored by the Institute for National
Policy Research, a local think tank.</P>
      <P>Su told scores of China affairs experts from around the world who
attended the Taipei conference that mainland China has steadily
shrunk its definition of "one China" while expanding its
interpretation of "Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>In 1993, Su said, the two sides reached a consensus that each
side could uphold its own definition of "one China." However, he went
on, Beijing has unilaterally forsaken this consensus in recent years,
saying it should not be applied to international relations or to
political negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China even demands that Taiwan accept its `one China'
definition as a prerequisite for cross-strait exchanges and
consultations," Su said.</P>
      <P>Beijing defines "one China" as the People's Republic of China,
and downgrades the Republic of China to the level of a local
government under PRC sovereignty.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Su said, Beijing continues to expand its
definition of Taiwan independence. "It even interprets our
explanation of the ROC's existence as a move to advocate Taiwan
independence," he noted.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that President Lee Teng-hui's definition of
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" merely
affirms a long-existing reality and is a defensive strategy to cope
with Beijing's increasingly aggressive moves to minimize Taiwan's
international space and diplomatic frontiers.</P>
      <P>He further said that cross-strait issues cannot be resolved until
mainland China can flatly face the facts of separate rule of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's full democratization.</P>
      <P>Another key problem lies in mainland China's "blind belief" in
military force, Su said, adding that Beijing has begun evaluating
Taiwan's importance from a regional strategic perspective since
managing to upgrade its economic strength and improve its relations
with its two closest neighbors -- Russia and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>"We believe that mainland China's resistance to renouncing the
use of force against Taiwan and its intensified military deployment
in the Taiwan Strait are part of its strategies to seek a leading
role in regional affairs," Su explained.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top mainland policy planner further said mainland China
has increasingly believed that it can ignore Taiwan and instead
discuss Taiwan Strait issues with the United States.</P>
      <P>In addition to blocking Taiwan's participation in international
activities, Su said, mainland China is now attempting to pressure
Taiwan via the US government to open direct cross-strait trade, mail
and transport links. Mainland China is also pushing the United States
to stop or reduce its arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su said that even though the United States has a clear policy of
maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and encouraging
cross-strait dialogue, it should still pay more attention to mainland
China's new strategies or moves regarding cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"Only when regular cross-strait dialogue and consultations fully
resume can Taipei-Beijing relations really improve," Su added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative to the United States
Stephen Chen is slated to make a report to the legislature late this
month on his role in the US Congress' efforts to promote the passage
of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA).</P>
      <P>Under strong pressure from lawmakers of the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the Foreign Affairs Committee
under the Legislative Yuan has decided to recall Chen to make a full
report on the issue on Dec. 29.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus visited then-Foreign Affairs Minister
Jason Hu in November to demand Chen's removal from his current post
because of his "indifference" when certain US Congress members were
pushing for the passage of the TSEA at the Senate and House of
Representatives early this year.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Tawei David Lee and spokesman Henry
Chen explained to the committee that it was better for Taipei not to
"meddle in" the matter, although the Republic of China government
welcomes the legislation by the US Congress of any bill which is
conducive to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi-jen, a DPP representative stationed in the United States,
also claimed that he would welcome the passage of the TSEA, but
pointed out that it is not appropriate for the DPP to lobby for it
publicly as it is an internal political matter which would have a
profound impact on Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Chen also told a group of visiting ROC lawmakers which traveled
to Washington last month to lobby for US congressional support for
the approval of the TSEA that it is not appropriate for his office --
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United
States -- to interfere in the legislation of a US domestic law.</P>
      <P>The TSEA, initiated by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) at the Senate
and Representative Tom DeLay (R-TX) at the House in spring this year,
required the US administration to report to Congress every year on
Taiwan's defense needs and related issues. However, the act failed to
pass the floor of the Capitol Hill.</P>

number of crops have withered and died, much as if they had been
struck by a drought.</P>
      <P>The phenomena is most obvious in regions where there are faults
or where the surface has moved, the report said.</P>
      <P>In addition, crop growth appears to have slowed, evident in
immature fruit crops and unhealthy rice.</P>
      <P>Some plants have bloomed before the normal time, with peaches on
Chushan (bamboo mountain) in central Taiwan's Nantou County coming
into flower one month earlier than usual.</P>
      <P>The report went on to say that due to liquefaction of the earth
in Yuanlin, Chunghua County, flowers have actually changed color.</P>
      <P>The report cited one Yuanlin resident who planted a red rose
which produced a light yellow bloom, describing it as an unusual
occurrence.</P>
      <P>The report analyzed that the withering and slowing down of plant
growth could be the result of the loss of irrigation water or changes
to underground water caused by alteration to the terrain.</P>
      <P>As for the early blooming and drastic changes in growth cycles,
the report said that they could be the results of dramatic changes in
the moisture and hardness of the earth, and in the concentration of
carbon dioxide in the soil caused by the quake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER COMMENTS ON AIT CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Chen
Chien-jen said on Saturday that American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Richard Bush's recent statement on Taiwan's presidential
election carried no special message.</P>
      <P>During a just-concluded visit to Taipei, Bush held separate talks
with the top three leading presidential hopefuls -- independent
candidate James Soong, Lien Chan of the ruling Kuomintang and Chen
Shui-bian of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Before his departure early this week, Bush stated that the United
States would not support any specific candidate over another in the
2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen told the Broadcasting Corporation of China's "Face the
Public" program that Bush had no special agenda in mind when he made
the remarks, because "a diplomat usually refrains from commenting on
the internal affairs and general elections of other countries."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Bush's attitude reflected the consistent
policy of the US government.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that Washington is adopting a "vague policy" on
cross-Taiwan Strait issues by speaking more clearly on certain
topics, while maintaining a flexible stance on others.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that a letter by an American columnist that
appeared in the Los Angeles Times recently which slammed President
Lee Teng-hui "was the personal view of the columnist, not the US
government."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MACAU TO PLAY INCREASING ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT TRADE AFTER HANDOVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Mandy Wong and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Macau is expected to play an increasing
role in indirect trade across the Taiwan Strait after its reversion
to mainland China's rule on Dec. 20, local observers said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan business people in Macau also hope that the public
order and business environment in the territory can be improved
after the new Macau government is inaugurated.</P>
      <P>Before the 1980s, Taiwan-Macau commercial exchanges were limited
because of political factors. Trade and civilian exchanges between
Taiwan and the Portuguese colony saw a breakthrough after the
Republic of China allowed its nationals to visit mainland China via
Hong Kong in 1987.</P>
      <P>At that time, Portuguese colonial rulers in Macau also eased
visa regulations to attract ROC visitors. They offered
landing visas to ROC nationals to facilitate their
travel to the mainland for family reunions.</P>
      <P>In January 1990, the Macau colonial government even
approved an ROC application to set up a representative office on the
enclave to handle bilateral trade and tourist affairs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-Macau exchanges entered a new stage in October 1995 when
direct flight services were inaugurated. Since then, Taiwan
travelers can stay in Macau for up to 20 days with landing visas and
can fly from Taiwan to mainland China after a stopover in Macau
where the airplane from Taiwan just needs to change its flight
number before flying to the mainland.</P>
      <P>As the ticket price for Taiwan-Macau flight is 10 percent lower
than that for Taiwan-Hong Kong flight and hotel and other service
charges in Macau are also cheaper than in Hong Kong, many
mainland China-bound Taiwan tourists and business people have chosen
Macau as their transit stop. Taiwan is now Macau's third largest
source of tourists.</P>
      <P>According to Macau's official tallies, the number of Taiwan
visitors to Macau has increased steadily since 1995 and reached
812,000 in 1998. In the first half of this year, the number stood at
474,000, up 24 percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>As a Portuguese colony, Macau enjoys many trade privileges in
exporting goods to the European Union. An increasing number of
Taiwan firms have shipped semi-finished products from the mainland
to Macau for final assembly and then exported those finished
products to EU countries. As a result, Taiwan-Macau trade has
increased steadily in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's tallies, Taiwan-Macau trade totaled a mere
US$1.4 million in 1983 and surged to US$360 million in 1998. In the
first eight months of this year, Taiwan-Macau trade amounted to
US$243 million, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$200
million. Taiwan is now Macau's fourth largest trading partner, after
Hong Kong, mainland China and Japan.</P>
      <P>However, direct Taiwan investment in Macau remains limited
because of a combination of factors, including Macau's failure to
adopt any incentives to attract foreign investors official
corruption, low administrative efficiency, limited supplies of parts
and components, language barriers, and worsening public order.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, an estimated 1,500 Taiwan companies have made
investment in the Pearl River Delta and other neighboring mainland
areas via Macau, with an accumulated capital of US$1 billion.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan business people said they expect new trade
opportunities and better business environment to follow the
inauguration of the new Macau government which will adopt Chinese as
its official language.</P>
      <P>Many of them also urged the post-handover Macau government
to give the top priority to improving the public order and investment
climate. If so, they said Taiwan investment in Macau will increase
and the territory will also be able to play a more important role in
indirect trade across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOONG STILL LEADS SUPPORT RATE AMID SCANDAL: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate James
Soong still leads the other presidential hopefuls in support ratings
despite the recent financial scandal, results of the latest poll
showed.</P>
      <P>However, the poll found, the gaps between the support ratings of
the three main presidential candidates -- Soong, Vice President and
Kuomintang presidential nominee Lien Chan, and opposition Democratic
Progressive Party hopeful Chen Shui-bian -- have increasingly
narrowed.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, conducted by EX International P.R.
Consultants, 24.5 percent of respondents said they would vote for
Soong if the presidential election were held the following day, down
a whopping 14 percent from a similar poll held in early November.</P>
      <P>Twenty-three percent of respondents said they would vote for the
DPP's Chen Shui-bian, while 20.2 percent supported Vice President
Lien Chan, the poll found.</P>
      <P>However, 24.5 percent of respondents stated that they have not
decided whom they will support.</P>
      <P>What is worth noting is that Lien is considered most likely to be
elected, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Asked who they thought would win the election, 40.7 percent of
respondents said Lien would be the next president, up 9.6 percent
from a poll held in late November.</P>
      <P>Odds for Soong trailed far behind, with 17.7 percent predicting
he would win, while 8.4 percent said Chen would be victorious. Some
33 percent of respondents would not venture a guess as to the outcome
of the March election.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted between Dec. 13 and 15, when the financial
scandal involving Soong's alleged use of Kuomintang money for
unexplainable reasons was beginning to loom, also found that most
people were fretting over the significant influence of "black gold"
money and organized crime on Taiwan politics.</P>
      <P>Nearly 71 percent of respondents think the country's politics are
"very seriously" influenced by "black gold" dealings, while 10.1
percent said the influence is "serious."</P>
      <P>Asked who among the presidential hopefuls might be most capable
of eradicating corruption and violence from politics, 33.8 percent of
respondents said they believe the DPP's Chen is most capable,
followed by Soong with 9 percent favoring his abilities, and Lien
with 6.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The same poll also found that 24.8 percent of respondents turned
from "liking" Soong to "disliking" him in the wake of the eruption of
the scandal.</P>
      <P>Soong was accused of using KMT party funds for building private
connections, and he seemed unable to provide convincing explanations
in response to questions about the huge sums in his son's and
sister-in-law's bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,220 adults polled islandwide, 38.6 percent did not
believe Soong's statement at a Dec. 14 press conference that the
NT$140 million (US$4.43 million) that had been kept in those two
accounts was transferred there from the KMT on the instruction of
party Chairman Lee Teng-hui in order to care for the widow and family
of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo and for other party
activities.</P>
      <P>Only 5.6 percent of respondents said they "very much believe"
Soong's explanation about the money, while 13.9 percent said they
"believe" that Soong was telling the truth. About 22 percent of
respondents said they have no idea about the veracity of his story.</P>

      <P>The latest public opinion poll showed that
more than 40 percent of Taiwan's people approve of Vice President
Lien Chan's remark that the nation should develop long-range missiles
in the face of increased military threats from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by EX International P.R. Consultants, found
that 42.1 percent of respondents said the Republic of China should
develop long-range missiles, while 26.2 percent said Taiwan
shouldn't.</P>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of respondents said they worry that such
missile development might cause an arms race across the Taiwan
Strait, compared with 45.3 percent who said they don't.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 10.2 percent of respondents "very much
approve" of the initiative to develop long-range missiles, while 31.9
said they "approve" of the initiative. Nineteen percent of
respondents said they "sort of disapprove" of the idea, while 7.2
percent said they "very much disapprove" of it.</P>

justification of Taiwan's development of long-range missiles.</P>

development would trigger an arms race between the two sides of the

    <HEADLINE>THREE MAINLAND CITIES TARGETED AS TOP CHOICES FOR DIRECT AIR LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are the
three mainland Chinese cities targeted by a government-run agency as
the top destination choices for direct air links between Taiwan and
mainland China once such relations become possible and feasible.</P>
      <P>Describing the likelihood of direct air links between Taiwan and
mainland China as "only a matter of time," researchers at the
Institute of Transportation (IOT) under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications said Taiwan should make relevant
preparations for that possibility, although the existing political
atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait makes it hardly feasible.</P>
      <P>Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, forming a golden triangle in the
eastern part of mainland China, as a whole command about 80 percent
of air transport for the entire mainland.</P>
      <P>Beijing, taking the former place of Guangzhou, is now the busiest
airport in mainland China, with the number of departures and arrivals
growing at a pace of 12 percent yearly.</P>
      <P>The annual total of departing and landing flights is expected to
reach 180,000 by the year 2000, while the number of passengers
traveling through Beijing's Capital Airport is expected to reach 35
million by 2005, with cargo transport amounting to 780,000 metric
tons that year, according to IOT specialists.</P>
      <P>Guangzhou's White Cloud airport is the most important air gateway
in southern China. The capacity of the international airport is
expected to be expanded substantially when its new terminal is
completed in 2002, the specialists said.</P>
      <P>The Shanghai New Airport, which opened in September this year, is
currently the largest and most advanced airport in mainland China,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STOCK PRICES TO UNDERGO WIDE FLUCTUATION DUE TO WTO IMPACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the long term, Taiwan's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is expected to affect the local
foreign exchange, capital and insurance markets, as well as the
banking sector, according to a recent financial report by the
Finance Ministry.</P>
      <P>Domestic stock prices are expected to undergo wide fluctuation
for a period of time after the island enters the world trade
regulatory body, due to Taipei's lifting of most restrictions on
capital investment, which will allow more funds to flow into the
stock and futures markets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to become a WTO member by next year, because
its efforts to open its markets have been recognized by most members
of the WTO, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.</P>
      <P>The report on the impact of WTO membership on Taiwan's financial
sectors, which was published on Sunday, predicted that the local
capital market will further merge with the international financial
market after Taiwan joins the WTO, whereby the island's globalization
will be further developed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the banking sector, the report said WTO membership will
lead foreign competition directly to the island. No domestic bank
that has never sought to enhance competitiveness can be spared from
the impact, the report warned, saying the government is developing a
program to encourage local banks to merge with each other, a strategy
that could help strengthen the industry's competitive edge.</P>

      <P>Seventy percent of people surveyed said
independent presidential candidate James Soong has not provided a
full explanation of the "mystery fund" at Chuang Hsing Bills Finance
Corp., the latest poll showed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted by New Image Opinion Center Dec. 15 - 17,
right after Soong first tried on Tuesday to explain deposits in his
son's account. The survey's effective sample totaled 971, with a
margin of error of 3.21 percent.</P>
      <P>Only 9.1 percent of respondents believed that Soong has fully
explained the mystery fund, while 20.9 percent said they had no
opinion.</P>
      <P>Some 48 percent of those polled also said they do not agree that
Soong is honest and a man of integrity as he claims to be; 21.1
percent said they believed his statements about his character, and
20.9 percent said they had no opinion.</P>
      <P>Some 47.1 percent of respondents said they didn't believe that
the money was turned over to Soong by now President Lee Teng-hui,
while 19.3 percent said they believe Soong's claim. Some 33 percent

      <P>On the question of whether it is reasonable for Soong to have put
the money, supposedly earmarked for taking care of the family of the
late President Chiang Ching-kuo, into his son's account, 65.1 percent
of those polled said it was unreasonable. Some 11.3 percent deemed it
reasonable, and 23.7 percent had no opinion.</P>
      <P>Professor Lee Kuo-hsiung, in analyzing the poll, said the results
showed that around one third of those polled could not make heads nor
tails of the "mystery fund," illustrating the complexity of the case.</P>
      <P>The controversial "mystery fund" has dealt a blow to the
popularity of Soong, the front-runner in past polls, the survey
showed, revealing that if the presidential election were held the
following day, Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic

      <P>Chen lead with 22.3 percent saying they would vote for him,
followed by 21.6 percent supporting Vice President Lien Chan of the
ruling Kuomintang, and Soong's 20 percent. The other presidential
hopefuls Hsu Hsin-liang and Li Ao garnered distant 1.1-percent and

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL CRITICIZES KMT BUSINESS OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, the presidential candidate
of Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), on
Sunday strongly criticized the ruling Kuomintang for its huge
financial holdings and said he was ashamed of what the KMT had done.</P>
      <P>Chen called on voters to support the DPP's Chen-Lu ticket in the
March 18 general election, and said he will do whatever he can to
finish off the KMT's "black money" dealings and to distribute the
money held by the KMT to the populace.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out in his campaign speech in Taipei County on
Sunday morning that Macau's handover to mainland China rule is not in
line with the will of the people of Macau.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the future destiny of Taiwan will be decided
by its own people.</P>
      <P>Chen said the KMT has accumulated a lot of historical burdens,
such as running enterprises, creating a privileged class, engaging in
"black money" politics and establishing a conservative government,
during its many long years of power.</P>
      <P>The upcoming vote will be the only way to implement political
reform by exchanging the ruling party for another political party, in
line with the system adopted by the democratic countries of the

    <HEADLINE>RAND CORPORATION RELEASES REPORT ON TAIWAN'S SECURITY POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Dec.  18   (CNA)
(By Shu Lu-sheng &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A report released by the Rand
Corporation on Saturday advises that the US military maintain close
contact with Taiwan's defense policy makers and strengthen relations
with the Taiwan military authorities.</P>
      <P>But it also cautions that excessive closeness in the bilateral
military relationship may irritate mainland China.</P>
      <P>The report, commissioned by the Pentagon, was authored by a group
headed by Michael D. Swaine, director of Rand Corporation's
Asia-Pacific Policy Research Center.</P>
      <P>It touches on Taiwan's national security, defense policy and arms
procurement.</P>
      <P>According to Swaine, Taiwan's defense policy and arms procurement
have been influenced by some non-military factors, which have to some
extent affected the actual usage of foreign-made arms.</P>
      <P>He also asked those in charge of arms sales on the US side to
make an effort to better understand, and therefore meet, Taiwan's
actual requirements in terms of arms procurement.</P>
      <P>Swaine said the formulation of Taiwan's security policy should be
further strengthened, especially in terms of coordination between its
security section and its military.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that the US arms-sale policy has solidified
the basis for stabilizing the East Asian situation over the past
decade, but warns that it could also encourage an arms race between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DDP) traded charges Sunday on the
results of public opinion surveys.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan charged that several
public opinion survey centers directly or indirectly controlled by
the Public Opinion Association of the Republic of China, have
allegedly been involved in conducting polls in favor of a particular
candidate.</P>
      <P>Those polling institutes included: the survey center of the
Business Faculty of National Taiwan University, the Mass
Communications Institute of National Taiwan Normal University, and
the Political Science Institute of National Chungshan University.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai (DPP-Kaohsiung City) said at a press conference
Sunday that the support rating for DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian was
reported at 12.4 percent and 16.3 percent in polls conducted by the
Public Opinion Association of the Republic of China on Aug. 28 and
Dec. 9, respectively.</P>
      <P>At those same times, polls by TVBS showed a 28-percent and a
30.9-percent rate of support for the DPP candidate, said Chen
Chi-mai.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that results released by the aforementioned
centers have not only differred from those of other polling
institutes, but have also favored the ruling KMT's candidate, Vice
President Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai further charged that the ruling KMT spent a large
sum of money to purchase these survey institutes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ting Yuan-tsao, spokesman for the Presidential Office,
categorically refuted the DPP's charges and called on the opposition
party to produce evidence of its claims.</P>
      <P>Prof. Hsien Chang-bang, who was in charge of the surveys by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese journalist Ming-chen Chen was
released by Macau police Sunday evening after being held in custody
for seven hours.</P>
      <P>Chen, a news reporter with the Taiwanese evening paper, the Power
News, was taken away by police Sunday morning while covering a story
in front of a downtown Macau hotel where Falun Gong practitioners
were staging a demonstration against Beijing's suppression of the
religious group.</P>
      <P>Chen was hauled away together with a Hong Kong journalist and
scores of Falun Gong members.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office, the de facto
liaison office of the Republic of China in Macau, said they quickly
came to Chen's assistance soon after her arrest.</P>
      <P>Chen was released after the Macau authorities became aware that
she was not involved in any illegal activities and had only forgotten
to carry her identification papers with her while covering the story,
said the Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>Chen was among some 2,100 journalists and news workers from
around the world who swamped into the tiny enclave of Macau in
southern China to cover its return to mainland Chinese control after
442 years of Portuguese rule.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS' UNACCEPTABLE TO ROC: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's "one country, two
systems" unification scheme is unacceptable to the Republic of China
on Taiwan, Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen said categorically on
Money.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
speech delivered at the Macau handover ceremony, in which he said:
"the implementation of the concept 'one country, two systems' in Hong
Kong and Macau has played and will continue to play an important
exemplary role for our eventual settlement of the Taiwan question."</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's status is completely different from that
of Macau and Hong Kong, Chen said both the ROC government and people
cannot accept the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems"
unification formula.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Hong Kong and Macau used to be colonies of
Western countries, Chen said their residents had no choice but to
accept their colonial rulers' decision on the territories' status.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chen said, the ROC is a sovereign democratic state.
"We have strength to safeguard our national security. Our people
can make choices out of their free will," Chen said, adding that
the Beijing leader was absolutely wrong in attempting to apply to
Taiwan the formula it had used to take over Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, the results of a series of public opinion
surveys conducted over the past decade consistently show that the
majority of Taiwan people do not accept Beijing's "one country, two
systems" unification formula.</P>
      <P>Chen further said Hong Kong's reversion from British rule to
mainland China's jurisdiction in 1997 has not had any significant
impact on Taiwan's diplomatic relations nor its interaction with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said Macau's handover will have
limited impact on Taiwan's external ties and its relations with
mainland China as the former Portuguese colony possesses far less
clout than Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said the international community generally
understands the ROC's negative stance toward Beijing's "one country,
two systems" scheme. Even the results of opinion polls conducted in
Hong Kong a couple of years ago show that more than half of Hong Kong
residents do not think that the formula is applicable to Taiwan, the
minister added.</P>
      <P>In related news, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman
Cheng An-kuo also said on Monday that Macau's handover is not
expected to have great impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the former ROC representative to Hong Kong, said
the MAC, a Cabinet-level agency which charts Taiwan's policy
toward the mainland, will work out measures to cope with Beijing's
renewed advocacy of the so-called "one country, two systems"
unification scheme.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ATTEMPT TO EXPAND HK, MACAU FORMULA TO TAIWAN `INSULTING': MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's attempt to expand the "one
country, two systems" formula in Hong Kong and Macau to Taiwan is
both "insulting and provocative," the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The MAC was responding to mainland China President Jiang Zemin's
speech during the Macau handover ceremony early Monday when he said
"the implementation of the concept of `one country, two systems' in
Hong Kong and in Macau has played and will continue to play an
important role for our eventual settlement of the Taiwan question."</P>
      <P>The government body in charge of working out mainland policy said
that it can understand why Beijing keeps harping on the "one country,
two systems" formula, but it hopes that mainland authorities will
understand that the majority of Taiwan's people won't accept it.</P>
      <P>For the people on the island, who have long enjoyed freedom and
democracy, the MAC said that to expand the same formula to Taiwan
would be both "insulting and provocative."</P>
      <P>The MAC noted that the concept was first broached by mainland
leader Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s to handle the Hong Kong and Macau
turnovers, and that the mainland is now trying to force cross-strait
unification by imposing the same formula on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC pointed out Beijing's total disregard of the fact that
both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been ruled separately for a long
period of time. If Beijing does not face the issue pragmatically and
continues to harp the same tune, it will not be conducive to
cross-strait development, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>The MAC expressed the hope that mainland authorities will
"address the cross-strait situation, respect the wishes of the people
of Taiwan, and forego its rigid way of thinking" in order to handle
relations in a pragmatic manner and create a favorable situation for
the positive development of cross-strait relations in the next
millennium.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MACAU'S HANDOVER TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Macau's return to mainland Chinese rule
will have little impact on cross Taiwan Strait relations, a
government official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng An-kuo, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), Taiwan's top agency in charge of mainland Chinese affairs,
said that although mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's statement
during the hand-over ceremony that "the Taiwan issue will be solved
with the `one China, two systems' formula" is nothing new, it is
causing concern in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Jiang's remarks that Beijing is confident and is
capable of handling the cross-strait issue with the "one country, two
systems" formula, Cheng said it clearly shows that Beijing
authorities still don't understand what the Taiwanese people are
thinking.</P>
      <P>Or else, Cheng said, it simply shows that Beijing does not
respect the will of the people of Taiwan and cannot face the fact
that Taiwan and mainland China exist as two separate political
entities across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who was Taiwan's chief liaison officer in Hong Kong before
being appointed the MAC vice chairman early this month, reiterated
that the "one country, two systems" formula, which was imposed by
Beijing on Hong Kong, cannot be applied to Taiwan because the ROC on
Taiwan is a sovereign state and not a colony like Hong Kong or Macau
before the handovers.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the "one country, two systems" formula is not
conducive to better cross-strait relations and will also never be
acceptable to the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Currently, the ROC's cross-strait policy remains the same, to
facilitate bilateral exchanges and consultations so as to help remove
hostility and build mutual trust between the two sides, Cheng noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng, who maintains close connections with both Hong
Kong and Macau, said he hopes that Taiwan's office in Macau will be
allowed to maintain normal operations after Macau's return to Chinese
control.</P>

the Republic of China's ultimate goal of seeking peaceful

    <TEXT>
      <P>The future looks bright for development of
substantial relations between Australia and the Republic of China,
the ROC representative to Australia said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu Po-lun, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
in Australia, made the remarks when he reported on current relations
between the ROC and Australia to a committee at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Liu said the ROC and Australia are both democratic countries and
share the same ideals of upholding freedom and rule of law.</P>
      <P>He also noted that during mainland China President Jiang Zemin's
trip to Australia three months ago, Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said in a luncheon speech on Sept. 8 that while Australia will
uphold its "one China" policy, it will also continue its commercial
and economic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Howard said any issue between the ROC and Australia will be
resolved in a friendly and peaceful way, as that solution would be in
the best interest of the region.</P>
      <P>Liu said that at a joint press conference on the same day, Howard
both reaffirmed that point and said Australia encourages both sides
of the Taiwan Strait to settle their differences by non-military
means.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices edged down 0.2 percent
Monday on sluggish trading as investors took quick profits after
Saturday's rebound.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index closed
14.93 points lower at 7,782.94 on a largely shrinking turnover of
NT$90.50 (US$2.86 billion), with only 1.8 billion shares changing

      <P>In the near term, there is not expected to be any strong movement
in the market, dealers added.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The return of Macau to China will not end
the territorial disputes in East Asia as Beijing is working hard to
resume sovereignty over its next target, Taiwan, according to
Australian experts.</P>
      <P>Greg Sheridan, foreign editor of the Australian, and other
experts believe the handover of Macau early Monday morning is
significant to a new, sovereign China, which sees this as the final
step before the return of Taiwan to its fold.</P>
      <P>The return of Macau marks the end of more than four hundred years
of European colonization and will act as a salve to the nationalism
which is the most powerful popular force in China today, he said.</P>
      <P>In an article in the daily on Monday, Sheridan said that "one
thing Macau does not do is bring a resolution to the tension between
China and Taiwan any closer."</P>
      <P>He added that "Taiwan, unlike Macau and Hong Kong, is not and has
not in recent times been a colony of a Western power and is instead
entirely self-governing. It will not accept any similarity between
itself and Macau or Hong Kong and continues to reject the "one
country, two systems" approach on offer from Beijing."</P>
      <P>Sheridan and other experts agree that Chinese adherence to the
"one country, two systems" approach in Macau, like Hong Kong, will be
intensely scrutinized by the international community after
Macau returns to Chinese rule</P>

(By Mike Chang &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara on Monday
praised Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's able leadership,
especially his role in implementing relief measures in the wake of
Taiwan's Sept. 21 earthquake, which claimed more than 2,400 lives.</P>
      <P>Meeting with more than 150 local and foreign correspondents at
Japan's National Press Club, the writer-turned-politician said he
will visit Taiwan again if he is invited.</P>
      <P>He rejected Beijing's criticism of his recent trip to Taiwan and
publicly requested that Beijing authorities explain why they termed
his trip to Taiwan "criminal." He furiously told the Beijing
authorities to shut up because the matter was none of their concern.</P>
      <P>Ishihara said he visited central Taiwan on his trip and found
that the government, under the leadership of Lee, was efficiently
carrying out reconstruction of those areas affected by the quake,
which was 10 times more grave than the one which hit the Kobe area in
1995.</P>
      <P>Ishihara also made a field visit to Shikang Dam, which was
heavily damaged by the quake, and saw the hard work of soldiers who
reached the earthquake-stricken areas three hours after the disaster
occurred.</P>
      <P>The appropriate ROC government agencies have amended or modified
the relevant regulations and rules to more efficiently carry out
rescue and reconstruction work, he observed, saying that Japan has a
lot to learn from Taiwan on these points.</P>
      <P>Remarking on Taipei-Tokyo-Beijing ties, Ishihara said Japan
should maintain good relations with Taiwan and mainland China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Wang Kuan-ying Library, dedicated to a
public-spirited ordinary man who collected garbage for 35 years and
used the money he earned to buy books and donate them to local and
overseas institutions, was inaugurated in Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>The new library has been set up in a section of the Taipei
Municipal Library's Kuting branch which was extensively renovated
using donations from various social quarters, and now accommodates
the books and artifacts left by Wang.</P>
      <P>A memorial park bearing Wang's name has been constructed in a
courtyard adjacent to the library, on one wall of which is inscribed
a poem extolling Wang's philanthropic spirit and deeds.</P>
      <P>The inaugural ceremony was jointly presided over by Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou and Lin Cheng-chih, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level
Council of Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Ma said at the ceremony that Wang overturned two conventional
Chinese concepts in his lifetime -- a "small potato" cannot achieve a
great task and an individual person's strength is minimal.</P>
      <P>"Wang's life story proves that a small potato can accomplish a
great mission and that an individual person's strength can be great,"
Ma said, adding that so long as a person works diligently toward a
single ultimate goal, he or she will eventually succeed.</P>
      <P>Wang, born in 1905 in a small township in Shandong province in
northeastern mainland China, moved to Taiwan in 1949 along with the
Kuomintang (Nationalist) government after the Chinese Communist Party
took control of the mainland.</P>
      <P>After retiring from the military, Wang began his scavenging
business at the age of 50, with purchasing books for donation to
domestic or overseas institutions as his only goal.</P>
      <P>He led a simple life but was generous in donating books, and
during his lifetime donated more than 400,000 books to over 30
nations, including Britain, Germany, France, Uruguay, Paraguay, the
United States, Canada, Australia and Argentina.</P>
      <P>Wang died of heart failure at the age of 94 on Dec. 15, 1998, and
he was given a posthumous medal by the ruling Kuomintang in
recognition of his long-term contribution to the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WOMEN'S RIGHTS NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECTED; 4.66 RAPES PER DAY LAST YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Women's rights are still not adequately
protected, and their degree of personal safety is actually declining,
a women's group said in a report on Monday.</P>
      <P>The Awakening Foundation in its 1999 report reviewed women's
marriages and family life, job rights, personal safety, and their
participation in political affairs last year.</P>
      <P>The foundation reported that there was an average of 4.66 rape
cases reported each day last year, and the success rate for solving
those cases declined.</P>
      <P>The foundation cited statistics from the National Police
Administration to show that reported rape cases rose to 1,701 in 1998
from 605 in 1989. But the success rate for solving the crimes slipped
to 63.6 percent in 1998 from 84.6 percent in 1989.</P>
      <P>Women not only have to worry about personal safety in public
places, they are not even safe in their own homes.</P>
      <P>Tallies from a hotline set up to help protect women's rights
showed that last year 15 percent of all women who called for
assistance had been abused by their spouses; 2 percent were so
severely abused that they could no longer tolerate the violence.</P>
      <P>One month after the implementation of the domestic
violence prevention law, local courts had received 886 applications
for restraining orders, illustrating the extent of rampant domestic
violence in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Statistics from a consultation hotline established by the
foundation showed that inquires regarding divorce accounted for 30
percent of all questions over the past year, and in most cases the
trouble could be attributed to extramarital affairs by the husband or
the husband refusing to provide living expenses.</P>
      <P>The report did find that the number of college and university
lecturers was roughly evenly divided between men and women, but the
number of female assistant professors was sharply lower than that of
men employed at the same level . The number of male full professors
is seven times that of their female counterparts.</P>
      <P>On job rights, the low participation rate of Taiwan women has to
do with the societal expectation that women shoulder the
responsibility of taking care of the family, the report said.</P>
      <P>Last year's government survey said that of 4.49 million
non-working women, 58.6 percent have not sought jobs because they
want to take care of their families, and 25.8 percent women do not
solicit jobs at the request of their families.</P>
      <P>Those who venture into the job market face such difficulties as
sex discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.</P>
      <P>Women's participation in politics made great strides over the
past decade. In 1998, the ratio of women legislators voted into
office rose to 19.1 percent from 14 percent in the previous election
three years before, ranking Taiwan 22nd in terms of women's
participation among parliaments worldwide.</P>
      <P>Just last year Wu Pi-chu made political history when she was
elected speaker of the Taipei City Council, becoming the first woman
in all of Taiwan to ever hold such a post.</P>
      <P>Currently five women serve as government Ministers, accounting
for 15.6 percent of the Cabinet headed by Vincent Siew. The figure is
the highest it has ever been in the history of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foundation concluded that with the promulgation of such laws
as the sexual abuse prevention law, the domestic violence prevention
law and others, the inequality that women have suffered under
Taiwan's legal system has been somewhat corrected, but those efforts
are not sufficient enough to really improve women's plight.</P>

      <P>CETRA Chairman Lin Chen-kuo said on Monday that the planned

bridge allowing information exchanges on trade and investment and the
launch of trade orders between local and foreign enterprises.</P>

      <P>The planned network will contain e-mail addresses and company
data of Taiwan businesses overseas, and will lead to the emergence of
a comprehensive Taiwan business society, which could provide fertile
ground for creating trade opportunities, Kuo added, noting that the
network is expected to be on line within the next six months.</P>
      <P>In related news, meanwhile, CETRA statistics show that since the
council's opening of Taiwan's first e-commerce operation in March,
30,000 business deals have been clinched through the new channel.</P>
      <P>At present, nearly 50,000 domestic and foreign enterprises use

    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party presidential
candidate Chen Shui-bian on Monday announced his constitutional
policy, and said that if elected president in March, he will call a
national conference on constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>The conference would bring together representatives from all
parties, scholars and experts, as well as civic leaders, to
thoroughly discuss relevant issues, he said.</P>
      <P>Describing the present constitution as "full of loopholes," Chen
said that he intends to adopt a political system based on the three
government powers -- administration, legislature and judiciary --
instead of the existing five powers -- administration, judiciary,
legislature, examination and control.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that he hopes to combine the functions of the
Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan (Cabinet) and the Examination
Yuan into an administrative branch, while forming a more powerful
parliament through the merger of the Legislative Yuan, the Control
Yuan and the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>On the status of Taiwan's identity, the former Taipei mayor said
that the renovated constitution should acknowledge the fact that
Taiwan is a sovereign country, and any change to that status must be
decided by public plebiscite.</P>
      <P>The presidential hopeful said that Beijing's claim that Taiwan is
no more than a regional government is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>He also said that he wants to adopt a presidential system rather
than the present dual-leadership system which places political power
on the president and the premier.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the present constitution was introduced when the
Republic of China was still based in mainland China over half a
century ago, and that despite revisions by the ruling Kuomintang over
the years, many constitutional problems remain unresolved.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei said on Monday
that he feels deep regret over a string of flight mishaps involving
military aircraft over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Tang, a former air force commander-in-chief and chief of the
General Staff, said he wishes the civilian sector would give military
servicemen more encouragement and less condemnation in order to boost
their morale.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks in an interview with a radio station
concerning the Ministry of National Defense's stance on handling
flight accidents involving the country's second-generation warplanes.</P>
      <P>Since March 1998, four of Taiwan's US-made F-16 jet fighters and
two French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters have crashed during
training flights, causing widespread concern over the air force's
flight safety control measures.</P>
      <P>Tang said the Republic of China Air Force, like many of its
foreign counterparts, faces manpower shortage problems which result
mainly from the low pay and heavy work pressure in the military.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force faces even heavier work pressure than its
foreign counterparts because it took delivery of four different types
of aircraft -- locally developed Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDFs),
F-16s, Mirage 2000-5s and E2T early warning/command aircraft -- at
almost same time, Tang said, adding that nearly no other country's
air force is burdened with this kind of workload.</P>
      <P>Because of structural and budgetary restrictions, Tang said, the
air force was not well prepared to cope with the challenges presented
by the almost simultaneous delivery of four different types of
warplane, all requiring specialist maintenance and pilot training.</P>
      <P>Tang said he has discussed feasible ways to tackle the issues
with Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming. "We have tentatively
decided not to let the air force investigate flight mishaps and study
preventive and improvement measures alone. We agree that the defense
ministry and even the entire government should use their resources
and strengths to assist the air force to improve flight safety."</P>
      <P>As commercial airline companies have offered higher pay to lure
air force pilots and aircraft maintenance personnel, Tang said, the
air force faces a serious manpower shortage problem. Heavy workload
and pressure from the public's high expectations of their performance
are also factors prompting air force pilots and maintenance
technicians to leave the military, Tang added.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Tang said the government should work out
effective ways to retain trained military pilots and maintenance
officers. In addition to raising pay, fringe benefits and welfare
services, Tang said the public should give military servicemen more
respect and encouragement to boost their morale and sense of honor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REVISES REGULATIONS TO ALLOW POLICEMEN TO VISIT MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Interior Ministry on
Monday approved revised regulations which will allow more than 75,000
local policemen to visit mainland China for family reunions or to
visit sick relatives.</P>
      <P>The old regulations prohibited Taiwan policemen from visiting the
mainland for any purpose.</P>
      <P>Under the revised regulations, the restrictions will be limited
to around 340 officers with "special" administrative responsibilities
and those with sensitive missions.</P>
      <P>These policemen will still be able to apply to visit the

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD LEARN FROM ITS OWN REUNIFICATION FORMULA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing should use the "one country, two
systems" formula to catch up with Macau and Hong Kong in democratic
and economic development rather than use it to woo Taiwan into
reuniting with mainland China, a Kuomintang official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, KMT director-general of the Mainland Affairs
Research Department made the statement to dispute Beijing leader
Jiang Zemin's statement on Sunday night that the implementation of
"one country, two systems" in Hong Kong and now in Macau should play
an exemplary role for the settlement of the Taiwan question.</P>
      <P>Chang said the fact that the formula coined by late Beijing
leader Deng Xiaoping as a way to reunify with Taiwan had to be tested
in Hong Kong and Macau first indicates the complexity and difficulty
of unifying Taiwan. However, he went on, Taiwan is beyond the control
of Beijing and its situation is not all like the historically
inevitable return of Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Beijing should learn from the economic prosperity and democracy
of Hong Kong and Macau under the formula, rather than pitch it to
Taiwan, because Taiwan is more developed than Hong Kong and Macau in
both these fields, and has nothing to learn from either the former
British colony or the Portuguese enclave which was handed back to
Beijing on Sunday after 442 years of Western rule, said Chang.</P>
      <P>With Hong Kong and Macau returning to the mainland fold, Chang
said it is understandable that Beijing is raring to also take over
Taiwan, the last piece of its claimed territory still outwith its
control, and he added that he will not be surprised if Beijing
reiterates its determination to claim the island.</P>
      <P>Although Jiang could be pressed by his more hawkish colleagues to
consider the idea of a deadline for taking over Taiwan, the mainland
affairs expert said he does not expect Beijing to announce any time
schedule for reunification, because this would only further alienate
Taiwan, and rob the communist regime of any leeway regarding a
recovery action.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE FOREIGN MINISTER COLD TO JIANG'S TAIWAN COMMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Foreign Minister threw cold
water on China's goal of an early reunification with Taiwan after
President Jiang Zemin's comments during the Macau handover ceremony
that Beijing could apply the "one country, two systems" formula to
Taiwan at an earlier date.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Macau, the Sydney Morning Herald's China
correspondent David Lague on Monday quoted Downer as saying that he
did not see any prospects of such a development in the foreseeable
future.</P>
      <P>"I certainly don't think at this stage in history that Taiwan is
quite ready to endorse the `one-country, two systems' approach that
has been embraced by Hong Kong and Macau," he said.</P>
      <P>Downer's comment was in response to the Herald's question after
Jiang's comment on Monday that "the implementation of the `one
country, two systems' concept in Hong Kong and Macau has played and
will continue to play an exemplary role for our eventual settlement
of the Taiwan question."</P>
      <P>"The Chinese government and people are confident and capable of
an early settlement of the Taiwan question and complete national
reunification," Jiang added.</P>
      <P>But Downer, who led the Australian delegation to the handover
ceremony, said he did not see any likelihood of such a reunification
any time soon and instead mentioned that Australia was "anxious" for
a reduction in tension between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tension between Taiwan and China remains high with Beijing
threatening to use force if Taipei resorts to independence.</P>
      <P>Jiang's goal of expanding the present formula to Taiwan's
reunification with the mainland is "unacceptable," said Republic of
China Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen in response to Jiang's speech.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council in Taiwan even described Jiang's
statements during the speech as "insulting and provocative."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DEPUTY SPEAKER URGES AUSTRALIA TO SEND MINISTERS TO BOOST TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's vice president Yao
Yin-chi, leader of the Republic of China delegation to the World
League for Freedom and Democracy conference in Brisbane, has asked
Australian parliamentarians and senior officials to urge their
government to send ministers to help boost trade ties between
Australia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA prior to his return to Taipei
following the two-day conference, Yao said he held talks with MPs,
including Ray Hollis, speaker of the Queensland Parliament, and also
with Brisbane's Lord Mayor Jim Soorley in separate meetings.</P>
      <P>Yao said he encouraged them to urge their federal government to
send ministers to Taiwan so that they could work toward strengthening
economic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He also told them that the Legislative Yuan is expected to
approve legislation aimed at further liberalizing agricultural
imports for many countries, including Australia, ahead of Taiwan's
likely entry into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>"I told Australian MPs and officials that the liberalization
would offer huge opportunities to Australia in their agricultural
exports to Taiwan. They were impressed with my information and look
forward to the opportunity of selling more farm products to our
country," Yao said.</P>
      <P>Yao led a 20-member delegation to the World League for Freedom
and Democracy conference. Scores of delegates from 15 other
countries, including Russia, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore,
South Korea, India, Indonesia and the United States, also attended
the meeting, which focused on discussions for further promoting
freedom and democracy around the world.</P>
      <P>At a speech on Monday, Yao said many MPs and government officials
from other countries are not denied the right to speak and meet with
their counterparts while visiting other countries. But MPs and
officials from Taiwan are restricted in their activities during their
visits to other countries because the hosts want to appease mainland
China.</P>
      <P>China always tries to strangle Taiwan's international presence by
pressuring other countries with its political and economic clout, Yao
said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan, a newly developed country, also has a lot
of economic clout and strong purchasing power.</P>
      <P>He said that although Taiwan is not a big country, it is a major
economic power with huge foreign exchange reserves of more than
US$103 billion that also ranks as the 14th biggest trading country in
the world.</P>
      <P>"How can so many countries bend to Chinese demands and threats in
such an unreasonable way and keep their distance from Taiwan, which
is a free and democratic country," he asked.</P>
      <P>Yao and the rest of the ROC delegates are heading back to Taipei
on Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OECD SAYS AUSTRALIA'S NEW GST WILL INCREASE INFLATION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will face sustained inflation
if it implements a new 10 percent goods and services tax in July
2000, according to a survey by the Organization for Economic and
Cooperation Development (OECD).</P>
      <P>The OECD said authorities must be wary of the higher prices that
the 10 percent GST will lead to and it called on the Australian
government to boost assistance to the unemployed and unskilled
workers.</P>
      <P>The OECD predicts that Australia's unemployment rate could fall
to 6.5 percent from the current 6.7 percent in 2001 but its inflation
would stand at around 2.25 percent, excluding the impact of the GST.
Its economy is expected to grow at an average if 3 percent, dragged
down by lower business investment as a result of the introduction of
the GST.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESEARCHER REPORTS ON PROPAGATION OF ASIA'S BIGGEST GROUPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A researcher in eastern Taiwan has reported
the first successful artificial breeding of the biggest giant grouper
found in Asian waters, after more than two years of effort.</P>
      <P>Ho Yuan-shing, a researcher at the Taitung branch of the Taiwan
Fisheries Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture, said
the first batch of adult Epinephelus lanceolatus, each weighing
around 50 kg, have already been exported to Hong Kong and Japan.</P>
      <P>The giant grouper (called lungpan by local fishermen), which can
grow to at least 288 kg, is treasured for its delicate meat, while
its gall is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach
ailments.</P>
      <P>Because of the exorbitantly high prices which the fish commands
-- between NT$800-NT$1,000 per catty, although prices have gone as
high as NT$1,250 per catty on occasion -- most of the giant groupers
caught by Taiwan fishermen are sent to Japan, Hong Kong or Singapore,
and local people rarely have the opportunity to taste the delicacy.</P>
      <P>Ho said that he is now providing counseling for aquaculturists in
Taitung and Pingtung counties, and will soon do the same in eastern
Taiwan's Hualien County, before promoting full-scale E. lanceolatus
breeding around the island.</P>
      <P>Ho noted that a successful breeding program for the giant grouper
will mark a step forward in turning Taiwan into a high-value brood
fish hub in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The giant grouper is common throughout Southeast Asia, although
numbers are limited in the waters around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that Singapore and Australia began research into the
artificial breeding of the giant grouper in the early 1990s, but
have made no breakthrough in their research work.</P>
      <P>Ho said that with the high economic value of the fish, the
institute started experimenting with artificial propagation in
mid-1996 after obtaining a government subsidy to carry out the work,
which involved importing brood fish from Indonesia and embarking on
the complicated process of finding the most suitable water
temperature and salinity to create a viable environment for hatching
the eggs and raising the fry.</P>
      <P>Other problems which Ho had to overcome were the facts that the
gender of the fish is unidentifiable outside the spawning season,
while it is also difficult to establish doses when administering
fertility hormones.</P>
      <P>However, he said that his techniques can be used in tuna and
other high-value fish to produce fry for export to other countries,
thereby enhancing the competitive edge of local fish breeders.</P>

      <P>The ratio of senior citizens to youngsters
in Taipei is higher than that in Taiwan and in the world in general,
announced the Taipei City government on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taipei City government officials said the ratio of those over 65
to those under 15 is 1-to-4.4 worldwide, while in Taiwan the
proportion was 1-to-2.8, and in Taipei City the figure was 1-to-2.2
last year.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the number of elderly people rises every
year in the capital city, and they accounted for 9.22 percent of
the total population last year. Among seniors, those without spouses
accounted for 36.62 percent. While the number of unmarried senior
citizens has dropped gradually, the number of those who are divorced
rises every year.</P>
      <P>The number of senior citizens in Taipei City who live alone
totaled 5,616 as of October this year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Last year the number one cause of death among the elderly was
cancer, while cardiopulmonary diseases, such as high blood pressure,
bronchitis, emphysema and other diseases also accounted for a great
number of deaths.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that most elderly men who passed away last
year had suffered physically before their deaths, even losing their
ability to take care of themselves and becoming completely dependent
on their families.</P>
      <P>The officials estimated that seniors who have lost the ability to
live independently and must rely on others to care for them account
for five out of every 100 elderly people. The long-term
responsibility of families having to care for them has become a
consistent pressure, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative to Macau still hoped
Monday that the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
would set up an ad hoc organization to deal with affairs relating to
Taiwan following the Portuguese enclave's return to mainland Chinese
rule.</P>
      <P>William Li made the statement in response to Macau Chief
Executive Edmund Ho's remarks at a post-handover press conference
that the Republic of China can maintain contact with the appropriate
Macau government departments regarding affairs involving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In other words, Ho will not follow the example of Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, who
assigned a specialist to communicate with Taiwan's representative to
Hong Kong in dealing with affairs involving the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Ho explained that because exchanges between Macau and Taiwan are
mainly in the fields of trade, tourism and culture, relevant
departments of the Macau SAR government can maintain contact with the
Republic of China in dealing with affairs involving Taiwan, instead
of setting up any ad hoc department or appointing any person
expressly for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Li told the CNA that just having the various departments of the
Macau SAR government deal with affairs involving Taiwan would
probably result in unharmonious operations when such issues arise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER STRESSES WORLD PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday stressed
world peace as the Republic of China government's ultimate goal in
Taiwan's development of relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Delivering a speech to more than 300 attendees from the local
medical community at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Siew said
the ROC's basic stance on cross-strait ties encompasses the following
points:</P>
      <P>-- resolving bilateral disputes while sticking to the ROC stance;</P>
      <P>-- pursuing world peace while safeguarding Taiwan's security;</P>
      <P>-- seeking continued progress for Taiwan while developing
mutually beneficial ties with the mainland;</P>
      <P>-- strengthening Taiwan-mainland exchanges;</P>
      <P>-- pushing for two-way dialogue without attached preconditions.</P>
      <P>Siew, who once served as chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, the ROC government's highest agency charting
Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, said the mainland remains
hostile toward Taiwan even now, although it has been a decade since
the ROC government terminated the period of National Mobilization for
Suppression of the Communist Rebellion in 1989.</P>
      <P>Beijing's continued bullyragging of Taipei in the international
community is what causes the greatest concern among ROC government
officials posted overseas, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, reducing hostility between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait will be the top issue on Taiwan's agenda in
promoting ties with the mainland, the premier stressed. He warned,
however, that Taiwan cannot compromise its defense needs in the face
of the mainland's growing military clout.</P>
      <P>Pointing to Switzerland as an example, he claimed that even a
neutral nation needs a strong defense capability to maintain its
status.</P>
      <P>Refuting some media reports that Taiwan is Beijing's next target
following Macau's reversion to mainland Chinese rule on Monday, Siew
argued that Taiwan is not a colony as Macau was, and that
Taiwan-mainland links are effectively as same as what President Lee
Teng-hui described as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>The premier, who has been fielded by the ruling Kuomintang as
Vice President Lien Chan's running mate in Taiwan's upcoming
presidential race slated for March 2000, vowed that the ROC
government will continue its current mainland policy if the pair wins
the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDITOR'S NOTE:</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>A researcher in eastern Taiwan has reported
the first successful artificial breeding of the biggest giant grouper
found in Asian waters, after more than two years of effort.

Ho Yuan-shing, a researcher at the Taitung branch of the Taiwan
Fisheries Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture, said
the first batch of adult Epinephelus lanceolatus, each weighing
around 50 kg, have already been exported to Hong Kong and Japan.

The giant grouper (called lungtan by local fishermen), which can
grow to at least 288 kg, is treasured for its delicate meat, while
its gall is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach
ailments.

Because of the exorbitantly high prices which the fish commands
-- between NT$800-NT$1,000 per catty, although prices have gone as
high as NT$1,250 per catty on occasion -- most of the giant groupers
caught by Taiwan fishermen are sent to Japan, Hong Kong or Singapore,
and local people rarely have the opportunity to taste the delicacy.

Ho said that he is now providing counseling for aquaculturists in
Taitung and Pingtung counties, and will soon do the same in eastern
Taiwan's Hualien County, before promoting full-scale E. lanceolatus
breeding around the island.

Ho noted that a successful breeding program for the giant grouper
will mark a step forward in turning Taiwan into a high-value brood
fish hub in the Asia-Pacific region.

The giant grouper is common throughout Southeast Asia, although
numbers are limited in the waters around Taiwan.

He said that Singapore and Australia began research into the
artificial breeding of the giant grouper in the early 1990s, but
have made no breakthrough in their research work.

Ho said that with the high economic value of the fish, the
institute started experimenting with artificial propagation in
mid-1996 after obtaining a government subsidy to carry out the work,
which involved importing brood fish from Indonesia and embarking on
the complicated process of finding the most suitable water
temperature and salinity to create a viable environment for hatching
the eggs and raising the fry.

Other problems which Ho had to overcome were the facts that the
gender of the fish is unidentifiable outside the spawning season,
while it is also difficult to establish doses when administering
fertility hormones.

However, he said that his techniques can be used in tuna and
other high-value fish to produce fry for export to other countries,
thereby enhancing the competitive edge of local fish breeders.</TEXT>

      <P>Former Speaker of Chiayi County Council
Hsiao Teng-piao, among others, was charged with extortion on Tuesday,

      <P>In the indictment unsealed on Tuesday, the prosecutors accused
Hsiao of involvement in gambling on professional baseball in 1996,
and trying to rig the outcomes of baseball games by using violence
and extortion.</P>
      <P>He was therefore listed as a gangster in 1996, but has eluded

      <P>Hsiao, who has been held in custody since turning himself in, was
transferred to the Chiayi District Court for continued detention.</P>
      <P>Since several of the six counts of charges against Hsiao are for

    <HEADLINE>DASSAULT EXPERTS IN TAIWAN TO HELP PROBE MIRAGE 2000-5 ACCIDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two aircraft specialists from France's
Dassault Corp., the builder of Mirage 2000-5s, flew to Taipei Tuesday
to help probe the cause of the recent disappearance of one of the
French-made jet fighters belonging to the ROC Air Force.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman Kung
Fan-ting, the two French specialists will compile information
gathered from radars, and by using flight simulations, try to
determine the spot where the single-seat Mirage 2000-5 went missing.</P>
      <P>The specialists will particularly examine information regarding
the missing jet's sudden descent from a height of 15,300 feet to
3,300 feet, which could provide some clues about the accident, Kung
said.</P>
      <P>Answering a reporter's question at a press conference on why the
missing Mirage 2000-5 had not been equipped with a position beacon to
allow it to be located after a mishap, a spokesman for the Air Force
said the position beacons were not requested by the ROC Air Force
when it first placed its orders with Dassault.</P>
      <P>But after assessing the equipment's importance, the Air Force
asked for a supply this year. So far 15 of the French-made fighters
have been equipped with the devices, and 32 other position beacons
are scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Wednesday to be delivered to the
Air Force, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The single-seat Mirage 2000-5 plunged into waters off the coast
of the northern county of Ilan on Dec. 14 during a simulated air
intercept exercise. The jet lost contact with the control tower when
it went down.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 15, a twin-seat Mirage 2000-5 crashed on a routine
training mission, offshore from Hsinchu. The two pilots ejected to
safety and were rescued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Air Force spokesman said that among other reasons
behind the five accidents involving Air Force fighters this year, the
great pressure that the Air Force pilots have sustained amid tension
across the Taiwan Strait should not be ignored.</P>
      <P>Sustaining immense physical and psychological pressure, the
pilots usually carry out their flying duties under tight schedules
without complaint. The spokesman said the wives and families of the
Air Force pilots should be offered the deep gratitude of the nation
for their thoughtfulness and cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EVOLVING INTO ELDERLY SOCIETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 1999 percentage of elderly people among
Taiwan's population surged to 8.5 percent, marking the island's
evolution into a geriatric society, official statistics show.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) released
the news on Tuesday, saying that at present in Taiwan, each pensioner
aged 65 or above is supported by an average of eight workers aged
between 20 and 64.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials predicted that in the next 30 years, the number of
supporters per senior citizen will drop to four because of a gradual
decline in the island's birthrate.</P>
      <P>In the next 50 years the growth rate of Taiwan's population aged
over 15 is expected to drop to negative 0.2 percent from the current
1.5 percent, while the island's proportion of people aged between 45
and 64 will increase to 40 percent from 26 percent now.</P>
      <P>The CEPD officials warned that the indices of aging signify that
Taiwan will in the future be challenged by increases in welfare
spending, expansion of demand for social care, and declines in the
labor force and the size of its school-aged population.</P>
      <P>However, viewed from a different angle, the officials said, the
expected decrease in the school-aged population could help reduce
spending on the country's educational resources.</P>
      <P>The CEPD assessed that in the next half-century, the number of
Taiwan's primary school children will sustain a decline by 190,000,
while that of junior and senior high school students will drop by
370,000, and that of college and university students will fall by
about 400,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WIPE OUT MONEY, GANG IN POLITICS TO SAVE TAIWAN: FORMER MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China must wipe out money-
and gang-linked politics, otherwise its national strength will
decline, former Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao made the appeal at a seminar on the influence of gangsters,
local political factions and large buisness groups in domestic
politics, sponsored by the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Noting that money power and gang influence are inextricable
in domestic politics, Liao said he had placed the top priority
on eradicating such complexes during his stint as justice minister.</P>
      <P>However, Liao lamented that many of his anti-organized crime and
anti-corruption programs were not continued after his departure from
the top law enforcement officer post.</P>
      <P>Liao warned that if Taiwan fails to face such problems flatly
and work out measures to improve the situation, criminal rings could
first control township politics and then gradually expand their
influence to county-level politics and eventually to national-level
political arenas. "Many countries lost their competitiveness
and glamor due to corruption and gang influence in politics," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Liao further said determination and courage are needed to fight
official corrpution and gang influence in politics. "Anti-corruption
and anti-crime missions are tough jobs which will certainly face
great pressure from various social quarters and encounter many
hurdles," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Liao resigned as justice minister in July 1998 amid controversy
surrounding then-Investigation Bureau chief Cheng Chuan's sexual
harassment scandal. Speculation is rife in recent months that Liao
may throw his support behind independent presidential candidate James
Soong instead of behind the ruling Kuomintang ticket of incumbent
Vice Lien Chan and Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Liao clarified that he has yet to make a final
decision on for whom to support in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Liao explained that the presidential candidate for whom he will
support must have an unswerving love for the land and people of
Taiwan and must be able to pragmatically face issues troubled Taiwan
and present effective ways to cope with those problems.</P>
      <P>"The candidate that I will support must also have the
determination, courage and capability to broach and complete various
reform programs," Liao said, adding that he will unveil his
presidential choice at an appropriate time.</P>

      <P>Thousands of people around the island
braved the chill of the latest cold front on Tuesday to try to get
hold of one of the 100,000 silver coins struck to commemorate the new
millennium.</P>
      <P>The coins were reported to be selling like hot cakes, and only
those who were very lucky and patient were able to lay hands on one.</P>
      <P>The coins, issued by the Central Bank of China, are made of 99.9
percent silver, weigh 15.568 grams, have a diameter of 3.3 cm and a
thickness of 0.225 cm.</P>
      <P>One side of the coin features the celestial model created by
ancient Chinese astrologers, and is dated the "88th year of the
Republic of China," along with the inscription "ushering in 2000."
The other side bears an illustration of a dragon which is both the
symbol of ancient China and the sign of the Chinese zodiac for 2000.</P>
      <P>As sales were limited to one coin per person at a cost of NT$750

    <TEXT>
      <P>Excessive academic pressure on primary and
junior high school students is the most urgent issue concerning
education and educational reforms in Taiwan, according to the results
of a recent opinion poll.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, conducted by National Taipei Teachers'
College (NTTC), 47 percent of the respondents said the academic
pressure on primary school students is too heavy, while 66 percent
said junior high students are subject to excessive academic pressure.</P>
      <P>Pressure to succeed academically among Taiwan's primary school
and junior high students has become more severe over the years,
evident in the fact that a 1992 poll gave results of 37.3 percent and
47.9 percent, respectively, for the same question, said NTTC
pollsters.</P>
      <P>NTTC conducted the poll on the commission of the Ministry of

students, parents and scholars, with 2,063 responses from primary
schools and 1,162 from junior high schools.</P>
      <P>The 1999 survey found that the top three most pressing issues of

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, secretary-general of the
Republic of China's presidential office, apologized on Tuesday for an
extra-marital affair with an unnamed woman which has shocked Taipei
political circles.</P>
      <P>Speaking through Presidential Office spokesman Ting Yuan-chao,
the former Kuomintang secretary-general who was reassigned to his
current job on Nov. 15 issued a five-point apology in which he
admitted that he "made a mistake" in being unfaithful to his wife.</P>
      <P>The spokesman quoted Chang as apologizing to his family,
especially his wife Huang Mei-lun, his unnamed mistress, and the
general public.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed his infidelity to indiscretion in his
associations, and said he feels deeply sorry for having "sowed wild
oats," despite the fact that his wife has forgiven him.</P>
      <P>Ting said Chang has briefed President Lee Teng-hui on the scandal
which began about six month ago, and that he has no intention of
taking a leave of absence or quitting his job because of his
debauched private life.</P>
      <P>Ting was speaking at a press conference called after a local
evening newspaper broke the news on Tuesday afternoon that Chang had
signed a written memorandum promising to divorce his wife before next
June.</P>
      <P>The memorandum, dated Nov. 10, allegedly reads: "I promise to
finish divorce proceedings with her before June of next year, John
Chang."</P>
      <P>The newspaper said Chang's mistress is a well-educated woman
teaching at a local university who obtained the written promise after
negotiations with Chang which were mediated by a third party.</P>
      <P>The newspaper quoted anonymous sources as saying that after
learning of the report, Chang's wife refused to believe that her
husband could do such a thing, and vigorously denied that Chang had
ever asked for a divorce.</P>
      <P>Neither Chang nor Huang could be immediately reached for comment.</P>
      <P>Chang, himself the illegitimate son of late President Chiang
Ching-kuo, is a political star of the ruling Kuomintang. He served as
minister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, minister of
foreign affairs, and vice premier before being named KMT
secretary-general in 1997. He and his graceful wife are considered an
attractive pair in Taipei political circles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S CELLULAR TELEPHONE USERS TOP 10 MILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)

      <P>The number of cellular telephone users in
Taiwan totaled 10,173,000 as of the end of October, the Executive
Yuan's Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics

      <P>The figure represents a three-fold increase over March 1998, when
the government opened the portable telephone market to the private
sector.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said that the private sector now occupies 68.9 percent
of the island's cellular telephone market, compared with 28.8 percent
in March 1998.</P>
      <P>It further said that it expects cellular telephone users to

    <HEADLINE>ROC OFFICIALS IN MACAU STRONGLY OPPOSE NEW ENTRY RULES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China representative in
Macau said on Tuesday in Taipei that he strongly opposes new Macau
rules for ROC passport holders wishing to enter Macau.</P>
      <P>Li, head of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau, who
arrived in Taipei on Tuesday for home consultations, stressed that
Taiwan will not accept the new measures adopted by the new Macau
Special Administrative Region government regarding the entry to the
former Portuguese enclave by ROC nationals.</P>
      <P>Li suggested that Macau, which returned to mainland Chinese rule
on Dec. 20, should maintain the current system of recognizing ROC
passports because interchanges between Taiwan and Macau are based on
mutually beneficial principles.</P>
      <P>If ROC passports are no longer permitted for entry to Macau and
ROC nationals have to use a travel document called the "Taiwan
Compatriot Certificate" instead, it will not only cause inconvenience
to the people of Taiwan but will also heavily affect the rights and
interests of Taiwan people who travel to Macau for cultural, economic
and tourist interchanges, Li said.</P>
      <P>He confirmed that the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau
has already been forced to take down its nameplate as the Macau SAR
government has yielded to Beijing's political pressure.</P>
      <P>Officials took down the nameplate one hour before Portugal
formally handed over Macau to mainland China after receiving a
warning from an official of the newly established SAR government, Li
said.</P>
      <P>Ever since the Macau authorities began allowing ROC nationals to
enter the enclave on their own passports, it has emerged as a bridge
serving travelers going between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOONS TO HAVE NEW DESIGNATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoons will have new designations along
with the dawn of the new millennium, with Western names giving way to
serial numbers and Oriental monikers, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In line with a decision by the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) to do away with the old system of names for the violent
tropical storms and ring in some changes, the bureau said it will
mainly use serial numbers to designate typhoons.</P>
      <P>For instance, the first typhoon to form in the northwestern
Pacific and South China Sea areas in 2000 will be given the
designation No. 0001.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the bureau said it will also refer to a new
WMO-sanctioned list of 140 different names for identifying typhoons
which only appear in the northwestern Pacific and South China Sea
areas.</P>
      <P>The 140 names were provided by 14 WMO members, including Hong
Kong, mainland China, Japan, and North Korea. As the Republic of
China is not a United Nations member, it was denied the right to
provide opinions on typhoon name changes. The WMO is a UN affiliate.</P>
      <P>According to a WMO decision, countries are free to decide how
they will identify typhoons in their domestic news reports.</P>
      <P>After extensive internal discussions and public opinion surveys,
the CWB said it has decided to designate typhoons mainly with serial
numbers.</P>
      <P>"Of course, we'll also refer to international designations in
reporting typhoon-related news," said Chen Lai-fa, director of the
CWB's weather forecast center.</P>
      <P>The new international designations include names of animals,
plants, places, people, and mythological characters. As the names
came from different sources, the bureau translated them into Chinese
based mainly on their pronunciations.</P>
      <P>The new WMO-sanctioned typhoon names will include Wu-kung -- the
Monkey King from the ancient Chinese epic Journey to the West -- and
Lung Wang, or Dragon King, who is portrayed as the king of the seas
in Chinese mythology.</P>
      <P>These two names are particularly apt, CWB officials pointed out,
because in ancient Chinese legend, both characters are endowed with
the power to control the weather.</P>
      <P>Other new typhoon names include Hai-ma (sea-horse), Mei-hua (plum
flower), Chen-chu (pearl), Lien-hua (lotus), Shan-hu (coral), and
Yu-tu (the magic rabbit in the moon).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>White feather-like snowflakes fell on the
the Chinese Culture University's campus on Yangmingshan on Wednesday
morning, marking the first snowfall of this year anywhere in the area
near Taipei.</P>
      <P>The snowfall was the first ever in the university's 37 year
history. Such a phenomenon is so rare that some students at first
wondered what it was and were later amazed when peers from the
Meteorology Department confirmed that it was snow.</P>
      <P>The snowfall lasted for about one hour.</P>
      <P>Central Weather Bureau forecasters on Wednesday continued to warn
that Taiwan will get a taste of genuine winter weather this week,
with temperatures dropping to as low as 6 degrees Celsius in
low-lying areas.</P>
      <P>The forecasters said that the air was wet enough Wednesday
morning on Yangmingshan and Tahchienshan in northern Taipei to allow
it to snow.</P>
      <P>In central Taiwan, snow has covered all mountain peaks over 2,000
meters since Sunday. Hohuanshan has been blanketed in a
60-centimeter-thick white shroud of snow.</P>
      <P>Tamshui, a coastal township in Taipei County, recorded a
temperature of 6.2 degrees Celsius in the early morning hours
Wednesday, the lowest reading islandwide, excluding mountains, said
CWB meteorologists.</P>
      <P>They said that with the increasingly strong cold air mass from
mainland China continuing to affect Taiwan's weather, temperatures
are expected to be as low as 7 to 10 degrees Celsius islandwide on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Low temperatures are expected throughout this week, with the
weather not beginning to get warmer until Saturday, they said.</P>
      <P>Sources from southern and eastern Taiwan said that large amounts
of milk fish raised in beach-side fresh water ponds in Chiayi, Yunlin
and Ilan were frozen to death Tuesday, incurring losses of over NT$70
million (US$2.2 million) for fishermen there.</P>

replaced water discharged by industries as the leading source of
Taiwan's water pollution, the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The EPA attributed this to the low installation rate of sewage
systems on the island and the poor handling of waste water discharged
from general households, pointing out that Taiwan's sewerage
installation rate is only 6.4 percent. It added that rivers and
buildings located on the fringes of major Taiwanese cities produce
more than 60 percent of the island's overall waste water.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER THANKS WHO FOR EARTHQUAKE HELP, URGES TAIWAN'S ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The premier of the Republic of China,
Vincent C. Siew, thanked the world community for its swift and
generous rescue assistance in response to the devastating earthquake
that struck Taiwan on Sept. 21 and urged support for Taiwan's
participation in the World Health Organization in an article
published in the Daily Oklahoman on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Siew wrote in the major mid-West US newspaper that such an
altruistic response to a natural disaster reflects the spirit behind
the everyday activities of the WHO, whose mission is to ensure the
health and safety of people around the world by coordinating medical
resources.</P>
      <P>Yet, Siew pointed out, when it comes to Taiwan, the WHO must rely
on non official, private sector channels to offer assistance because
Taiwan has been excluded from this world body since 1972, and the UN
remains under pressure from Beijing to keep things that way, despite
all the changes in the world order since then.</P>
      <P>Unable to offer direct help to Taiwan, the WHO used indirect
channels to assess the magnitude of the earthquake disaster and
donated US$50,000 to the Red Cross for use in relief aid, said Siew.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that although Taiwan's medical and disaster relief
resources were appraised by the WHO as being up to the challenge posed
by the earthquake, "it is a great pity that the important long-term
mission of the WHO remains compromised by Taiwan's exclusion."</P>
      <P>As a non member, Taiwan has no access to information concerning
global regulations on the laboratory testing of bioproducts. It
cannot participate in the development of bioproduct standards, and
its own bioproducts cannot be recognized by other countries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's massive earthquake dramatically underscored how strong
our ties are with other countries in the international community. My
country has applied for observer status in the WHO, a humanitarian
organization where common global medical and public health concerns
should take priority over pedestrian political issues," stressed
Siew.</P>
      <P>He concluded that there could be no more appropriate time than
the present to eliminate the artificial barriers hampering the WHO's
coordination of global resources to ensure the safety of all people
in all countries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO not only compromises the public
health interests of the 22 million people living in Taiwan, but also
represents a loss for the entire world. There is a role in the WHO
for Taiwan to play that will make the world a healthier and safer
place."</P>

reported to government authorities every year, the Children's Affairs
Bureau under the Ministry of the Interior said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a bid to provide more comprehensive protection to children
islandwide and hammer out an efficient way to deal with the issue,
the government is working out legislation to ensure children's
personal safety and interests, Bureau head Liu Pang-fu said in an
address at the opening of a seminar on child protection being held at
Tunghai University in the central Taiwan city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the ministry's Social Affairs
Administration, Liu said that as of the end of 1998, a total of 4,112
cases related to abused children were reported to government
authorities islandwide.</P>
      <P>Some 2,915 of these cases occurred in Taiwan Province, followed
by 884 and 313 in Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan's two largest cities,
according to Liu. More boys were abused than girls, with children in
the 6 - 11 age group making up the bulk of the victims, and parents
and caregivers were usually the abusers, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOVEMBER EXPORT ORDERS SECOND HIGHEST SINGLE-MONTH TOTAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   22   (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Export orders received by Taiwan
manufacturers and exporters in November amounted to US$11.56 billion,
marking the second highest single-month total in Taiwan's foreign
trade history, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The figure was a 18.59 percent increase over the previous
November, with orders received by electronics, information technology
(IT), and telecommunications manufacturing sectors posting
record-high monthly growth rates, said Chang Yao-tsung,
director-general of the MOEA's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>The November figure was the second highest for any single month
in history, behind only the record US$11.75 billion in export orders
posted in October of this year, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang added that, with the brilliant performance in November and
with a continued upward trend in December, Taiwan's annual export
order growth could reach 6.5 percent or higher for 1999.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, Taiwan received US$116.33 billion worth of orders
from abroad in the first 11 months of this year, up 6.88 percent over
the same period the previous year, according to MOEA statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, industrial production in November increased by 11.39
percent over the same month the year before. Chang forecasts that the
country's industrial production for 1999 may post a growth of 7
percent or 7.5 percent if both export orders and industrial
production remain as brisk in December as in November.</P>
      <P>If the annual growth rate of industrial production reaches 7.5
percent this year, it would represent a 12-year high, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Responding to worries that the rising value of Taiwan's currency
may drag down the volume of exports, Chang said the chances are slim.</P>
      <P>Chang added that if the currencies of Japan and South Korea,
Taiwan's two major rivals in export trade, also appreciate against
the US dollar, the NT dollar's rise against the greenback should not
affect Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, export orders for Taiwan-made products,
particularly electronics-related goods, will remain steady, given
that Taiwan's products are high in quality and are delivered
punctually, making them difficult to replace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIA'S RATE OF RETURN ON REAL ESTATE HIGHEST IN ASIA: RICHARD ELLIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,   Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The best country for real estate
investment in Asia over the next year will possibly be India,
according to the Global realty research firm, Richard Ellis.</P>
      <P>"Returns on housing or commercial property investment in India
are 13 to 15 percent by way of rentals alone. This is 4 to 5 percent
higher than returns in other Asian countries," Siddharth Yog,
Associate Director with Richard Ellis said.</P>
      <P>Despite the 13 to 15 percent returns, which do not include
capital appreciation, foreign investment in the sector has been
minimal.</P>
      <P>The yields in 1999 for the commercial areas in Delhi and Mumbai
stood at 13.20 percent and 13.60 percent respectively, while for Hong
Kong and Bangkok they ranged from 10.6 to 11.1 percent, the report
said.</P>
      <P>The yields have withstood the property value erosion witnessed in
the mid-90's, with returns showing an upward trend of 9 to 10
percent in 1995 and 13.3 to 13.9 percent in 1998.</P>
      <P>Similar trends prevailed for residential premises where yields in
Delhi stood at 15.11 percent, behind only the Jakarta market at
19.20 percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>Though non-resident Indians and overseas corporate bodies were
free to invest in the real estate sector, not even 10 percent of the
projected foreign investment has flowed in.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA SUES TOBACCO GIANTS FOR C$ 1 BILLION IN DAMAGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's federal government has filed a C$1
billion lawsuit against some giant tobacco companies, announced
Justice Minister Anne McLellan on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>She said the government is taking R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings
Inc., RJR- Macdonald Canada, the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers
Council, and several related companies to court in the US on charges
of fraud and racketeering.</P>
      <P>Ottawa made the unprecedented move following a court case that
wrapped up in Binghampton, New York on Monday where six men were
convicted of taking part in a multimillion-dollar smuggling ring that
brought tobacco and liquor into Canada illegally. The ringleader was
sentenced to 17 and a half years in jail and fined US$20,000.</P>
      <P>McLellan said there is evidence to prove that in 1991 the big
tobacco companies established an "elaborate network of smugglers and
shell companies." Their aim, she noted, was to "undermine" Canada's
policy to reduce tobacco use by increasing the price of cigarettes.</P>
      <P>That policy, especially aimed at preventing young Canadians from
starting to smoke, was "frustrated by tobacco smuggling," said the
minister, and Canada was "forced to reduce taxes and duties."</P>
      <P>She said the case was filed in the US because much of the
smuggling took place there and many of the witnesses are US citizens.</P>
      <P>Her government will seek to restrain the defendants from engaging
in further smuggling, compel them to surrender their profits, and
force them to pay substantial damages of at least C$1 billion.</P>
      <P>Allan Rock, Canada's health minister, said the lawsuit should
send a clear message to the tobacco industry that it "cannot and will
not be allowed to frustrate Canadian health policy."</P>
      <P>Lawyers for the Canadian government filed papers at the US
Federal Court in Syracuse, New York. The lawsuit is being launched
under the statute known as the Federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).</P>
      <P>The lawsuit also names the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council
because it was used to throw the Canadian government off the
smuggling trail. The government alleges that RJR-Macdonald used the
Council to blame organized crime while pretending it was trying to
stop smuggling. At the same time it was alleged that RJR-Macdonald
set up a shell company in the US to deceive investigators.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATION URGED TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan people, both male and female, want
legislation to punish and prevent indecent assault and sexual
violence, according to the results of a recent public opinion poll.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Chinese Television Network (CTN) and
commissioned by the Modern Women's Foundation, found that 90 percent
of the respondents think there should be distinct laws enacted by the
Legislative Yuan to deal with sexual harassment and indecent assault.</P>
      <P>In addition, 92 percent of the respondents said an exclusive
government agency should be set up to take charge of the eradication
of sexual violence and related crimes.</P>
      <P>CTN conducted the poll of adults islandwide by telephone in
September, and received 1,068 valid responses equally distributed
between men and women, according to a foundation spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that Taiwan's general public have diverse
perceptions of what constitutes sexual harassment and sexual
offenses, with 34.5 percent of the respondents saying sexual
harassment is a physical act, 33.4 percent saying they consider
threats or demands for sexual services as sexual harassment, 9.8
percent describing the telling of dirty jokes as harassment, and 22.4
percent thinking public exposure of the sex organs or the display of
obscene pictures is a sexual offense.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Pan Wei-kang said the results of the poll
should serve as a basis on which sexual assault legislation can be
promulgated, although she admitted that the poll results reflect the
difficulty of properly defining sexual harassment and sexual
offenses.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 75.9 percent of the respondents worry
about themselves or members of their families being sexually harassed
or assaulted.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that 63 percent of sexual harassment occurs on
public transport, while three times as women as men complain that
they have been victims of sexual harassment.</P>

affairs said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent poll conducted in the United States, Lin

China poses the biggest threat to America, ahead of 21 percent who
cited Iraq as America's bogeyman.</P>
      <P>In addition, some 55 percent of the respondents voiced support
for Taiwan independence because the island is a democracy, while 37
percent of them support current US policy which does not condone
Taiwan independence, but also does not condone mainland China's
military threats against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Around 61 percent of Republican Party members expressed support
for Taiwan independence, while 51 percent of Democratic Party members
voiced the same opinion, Lin said, citing the poll results.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STRAITS GREATEST THREAT TO ASIAN STABILITY: US THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the economic fortunes of many
Asian nations began to brighten over the past year, long-festering
standoffs continue to prevent the advancement of peace and stability
in Asia, and the serious deterioration of relations across the Taiwan
Straits marks perhaps the gravest threat to security in the region,
according to a Washington-based think tank.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Foundation wrote in its newly published "US and Asia
Statistical Handbook 1999-2000" that the latest round in the
decades-old tug-of-war over the sovereignty of Taiwan was set off in
July 1999 when Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui indicated that
Taipei's relations with Beijing should be conducted on a "special
state-to-state" basis.</P>
      <P>The Communist leadership viewed President Lee's statement as
tantamount to a declaration of independence and promptly instituted a
campaign of intimidation against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the face of tensions that threatened to spin out of control,
the conservative think tank pointed out, "the Clinton administration
remained strangely aloof, seemingly nonplused and offended by
President Lee's statement of reality."</P>
      <P>Instead of dispatching aircraft carrier battle groups to the
area, as it had done in 1996 when missile tests by Communist China
threatened to disrupt Taiwan's presidential election, the Clinton
administration spoke of canceling all visits to Taiwan by US
officials as well as shipments of defense-related spare parts, said
the think tank.</P>
      <P>The upshot of the administration's performance in the crisis,
however , was to energize the US Congress once again to consider the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA), which would authorize the
sale of advanced defensive weaponry to Taiwan, such as satellite
early warning data, missile defense systems, modern air defense
equipment, said the foundation.</P>
      <P>It stressed that the TSEA has gained support in Congress
precisely because of growing doubts about the Clinton
administration's willingness to live up to the letter and not the
spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act, which requires the US to sell
Taiwan sufficient defensive weapons for the island to provide for its
defense.</P>
      <P>Because Beijing has reacted harshly to congressional calls to
step up efforts to provide for Taiwan's defense, warning against
interference in mainland China's "domestic affairs," the debate over
the TSEA is likely to become politically charged as it will be played
out during the presidential campaign seasons in both Taiwan and the
United States, said the think tank.</P>
      <P>But the question of the US role in the defense of Taiwan is just
one of a host of sticking points plaguing an already contentious
US-PRC relationship, noted the foundation.</P>
      <P>Relations were strained by the House Cox Committee's
investigation into Beijing's theft of US nuclear weapons secrets.
Then the accidental bombing by US planes of the Communist Chinese
embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 sent US-PRC relations plummeting to
depths unseen since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, and
perhaps since the Korean War in the early 1950s.</P>
      <P>Tensions also persist over human rights concerns, as Beijing
continues to crack down on religious leaders, Tibetans, and any other
perceived threat to the dominance of the Communist Party, such as the
Falun Gong meditation sect, added the think tank.</P>
      <P>Even the ongoing efforts to bring mainland China into the World
Trade Organization have increased frictions rather than eased them.
The Communist Chinese were greatly offended when President Bill
Clinton, reportedly for political reasons, rejected Premier Zhu
Rongji's accession proposal and then publicly revealed Zhu's
concessions.</P>
      <P>Finally, The Heritage Foundation added, the large and growing US
trade deficit with mainland China threatens to become yet another
sore spot, especially if problems in other aspects of the overall
relationship continue.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Doctors in the southern Taiwan city of
Kaohsiung reported on Wednesday that three sisters undergoing
treatment for a rare chromosomal anomaly have broken off contact with
the hospital.</P>
      <P>The three siblings were raised as girls until puberty, when the
anomalies became apparent, said Dr. Juan Cheng-chao of the Kaohsiung
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>The oldest sister first came to the hospital at the age of 17,
when her condition, which included no sign of menstruation,
continuing growth, and a prominent Adam's apple, became increasingly
serious, Juan noted.</P>
      <P>Juan conducted tests on the young woman and discovered that in
fact she had male chromosomes, together with cryptorchism, a
developmental defect marked by the failure of the testes to descend
into the scrotum.</P>
      <P>Her two younger sisters, who checked into the same hospital at
the ages of 14 and 12, respectively, were found to have the same
condition, which Juan described as a first in Taiwan, and probably an
extreme rarity anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>Juan was then appointed by the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital to head up a research team to exclusively study the case of
the three "sister men."</P>
      <P>After receiving some medical treatment and psychological
counseling, all three decided to undergo sex change operations to
allow them to continue to live as women.</P>
      <P>However, they stopped attending the hospital for follow-up
treatment soon after the sex change procedure, and now, over three
years later, they are 20, 17 and 15 years old, respectively, and the
hospital has been unable to contact them, said Juan.</P>

      <P>A problem surrounding the signboard for
Taipei's de facto consulate in Macau was resolved on Wednesday after
one of the office's sign plaques was rehung after being tampered
with.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Trade and Tourism Office is located in the former
Portuguese enclave's Commercial Central building. One hour before
Macau reverted to Beijing's rule on Sunday, the sign in the
building's lobby was flipped over, said Tsai Jy-jon of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Tsai told local reporters that office chief William Li was to
blame for not stopping the move, which apparently was prompted by
"unfriendly" warnings over the name of the organization.</P>
      <P>Before the incident, Li had removed signs from the hallways of
the ninth and 15th floors of the building, placing them inside the
offices out of safety considerations.</P>
      <P>But the sign in the lobby was interfered with without Li's
instruction or consent, and he was required to fly back to Taiwan to
give an explanation to his superiors on Tuesday. At a news
conference, the Taipei envoy to Macau admitted his error.</P>
      <P>Asked whether or not Taipei will have to rename the office due to
demands from Beijing, which regards the present name as too official,
Tsai said discussions of the issue are still under way.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD'S TALLEST PERSON ARRIVES FOR 4-MONTH VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nasir Ahmed Sooro, listed as the world's
tallest person by the Guinness Book of World Records, met the local
press Wednesday as he started his four-month visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old Pakistani, who stands 236.2 cm tall, arrived in
Taipei Tuesday evening at the invitation of the Guinness museum in
the central Taiwan city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Sooro told local journalists that he once felt ashamed of his
height. "But now I have overcome my 'inferiority complex' and dare to
serve as a sports promoter," he explained joyfully and
optimistically.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Sooro wished all Taiwan people a Merry
Christmas and sang a Pakistani folk song in his mother tongue. He
also jokingly said he hopes he will be able to find a tall girlfriend
during his stay here.</P>
      <P>Sooro recalled that he was of average height before age 10, but
has since grown continually because of abnormal secretions of his
pituitary gland. "One of my current troubles is that doctors had told
me that I'll gain at least an additional eight centimeters in height
in the future," he said, adding that all of his siblings are of
average height.</P>
      <P>Sooro and his elder brother now work for Pakistan Airlines.
"Because of my work, I have managed to make trips to five countries.
I felt most inconvenienced while I was in Japan, as all things there
are small."</P>
      <P>To welcome the guest of distinguished height, the hotel Westin
has made special arrangements for an extra-long bed to offer Sooro a
comfortable night's sleep. According to hotel staff, Sooro doesn't
eat meat, except for fish.</P>
      <P>Sooro will soon travel to the Guinness Taichung museum which has
ordered special furniture to meet Sooro's needs.</P>
      <P>Over the next four months, visitors to the Taichung museum can
play basketball with Sooro and try on his extra-large outfit.</P>
      <P>Sooro will greet the dawn of the year 2000 and spend the lunar
Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day in Taiwan. In addition to taking
part in various festivities, Sooro will also play the role of roving
ambassador and visit primary and middle schools to encourage local
youngsters to do more exercises so that they can grow tall and
strong.</P>
      <P>Sooro will also meet with Taiwan's tallest and shortest persons
during his stay here. Medical experts said the probability of a
person growing taller than 230 cm is one in 1 billion. A man from the
United States and a mainland Chinese woman both surpassed Sooro's
height, measuring 272 cm and 248 cm, respectively, but neither of
them is still living.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S AIR FORCE TO ESTABLISH 'ELECTRONIC WAR' UNIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Air Force will soon inaugurate an
electronic war unit to enhance combat capability, Air Force Chief
Staff Chou Wen-chung said on Wednesday,</P>
      <P>"We will formally establish the electronic war unit next month as
part of our efforts to streamline our air defense," Chou said at a
legislative hearing session on Taiwan's new-generation fighters.</P>
      <P>Chou also said that the United States is scheduled to deliver
air-launched harpoon missiles to Taiwan next month, and the missiles,
to be installed on Taiwan's F-16 fighters, will largely enhance the
fighters' long-distance strike capability.</P>
      <P>On the development of Taiwan's "stealth" fighters, Chou said the
Air Force has contracted several institutes to conduct research on
the issue and has achieved "positive results," especially in plans
for the structure and coating of the proposed aircraft.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the session, Vice Defense Minister Sun Tao-yu
denied allegations that the new-generation fighters that Taiwan has
purchased from foreign countries are all "outdated" and are not
nearly as efficient as had been claimed.</P>
      <P>Sun said the F-16 has been proven in previous battles as one of
the most advanced warplanes, and the French-made Mirage 2000-5s are
the best in free world.</P>
      <P>Sun said the untrue allegations may have been generated by
Beijing because Taiwan's newly-acquired fighter jets are better than
theirs.</P>
      <P>In addition to its 130 locally developed IDFs (Indigenous Defense
Fighters), Taiwan has bought 150 F-16s and 60 Mirage 2000-5s,
enabling the Air Force to retire its aging fleet of F-5Es.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'ONE CHINA' POSSIBLE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW: PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui has said in a
recent interview with a Japanese weekly that "one China" is possible
but not right now.</P>
      <P>Lee said in the interview, published in the latest issue of the
"Shin Cho (New Wave)" weekly magazine which hit newsstand on
Wednesday, that "one China" could be a reality in the future.</P>
      <P>But Lee said he still cannot answer the question at the moment
whether the possible future "one China" would be a cultural
existence or a geographic one.</P>
      <P>Lee gave the interview in Taipei on Dec. 11 with Yoshiko
Sakurai, a Japanese columnist who had served as a television news
anchor before beginning her writing career.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Lee pointed out unequivocally that
cross-Taiwan Strait ties must be on a "special state-to-state"
basis, noting that the Republic of China, established in 1912, is
like a father while the "People's Republic of China," founded in
1949, is like a son. The "PRC" separated from the ROC to become
a new country after the Chinese communists took control of the
Chinese mainland, and the ROC continues to exist in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that Taiwan must develop a new culture
different from the Chinese culture. "It must be a culture of
integrity and sincerity, charactered by respect for freedom,
democracy, equality and human rights," Lee said, adding: "In other
words, Taiwan must become a mature, full-fledged democracy."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan must signifies its existence through
democratization, Lee said the ROC as a sovereign state must exercise
wisdom, prudence and patience to avoid provoking a military
attack from mainland China.</P>
      <P>While stressing the importance of beefing up Taiwan's military
strength to safeguard its national security, Lee also said he
believes freedom and democracy can better protect Taiwan than
military forces.</P>
      <P>As for the US-proposed theater missile defense (TMD) program,
Lee said it's still premature to discuss whether Taiwan should take
part in the TMD project since the system is still in the planning
stage. Nevertheless, he added that Taiwan must forge a missile
defense shield in view of mounting missile threats from the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Lee also said the "Taiwanization" means a Taiwanese
cultural renaissance or revival. "We must teach our younger
generation valuable Taiwanese cultural heritage and relics," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said "Taiwanization" also means "democratization."
Lee said he believes that making Taiwan a model of democratization
for entire Asia could help safeguard Taiwan's security in the face
of mainland China's threat in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Lee further suggested that Japan revise its constitution to give
more powers to its prime minister in policy decisions. "I believe
it is necessary for Japan to establish a system under which its
prime minister can play a leading role in policy making so
that it will be able to more actively participate in regional
affairs in the face of quickly changing Asian situation."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MILITARY PREPARED FOR Y2K CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The military has completed its Y2K tests on
all computer systems, said a spokesman of the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) Wednesday, expressing that the military is confident of
passing through the rollover to the year 2000 safely.</P>
      <P>Some of the tests were particularly designed for the air-raid
warning systems as well as the warfare monitoring and guiding systems
at the central warfare command headquarters, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>In the days leading up to the beginning of the year 2000, MND
special personnel will be standing by at the Executive Yuan's Y2K
crisis management center, on full alert for sudden incidents.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 1, the MND established a command headquarters for urgent
missions, with operations divided into two stages, the first
beginning at 10 a.m. on Dec. 31 and ending at noon on Jan. 4, said
military officers involved in the project.</P>
      <P>The first-stage work, to be in operation round-the-clock, is
aimed at ensuring that all public and civil institutes will operate
normally, sustaining no assault from the Y2K computer bug.</P>
      <P>The Y2K bug refers to the possibility that older computer systems
using two digits to record dates may sustain malfunctions or crashes
on Jan. 1, 2000, after confusing 2000 with 1900.</P>
      <P>The potential Y2K disruptions have been regarded as a "time
bomb," able to paralyze a country's military, financial and economic
systems, triggering civil unrest.</P>
      <P>The second stage of operations for the military's Y2K
headquarters was designed because 2000 is a leap year. Stage two,
which will be in effect from 10 a.m. on Feb. 28 to noon on March 1,
is designed to secure all military systems for Feb. 29, according to
the officers.</P>

coastal patrol boat was launched at the southern port of Kaohsiung on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Presiding over a ceremony marking the launch of the new boat,
christened "Pochiang," at the shipyard of the China Shipbuilding

it is formally delivered to the Navy.</P>
      <P>With the latest addition, the Navy will have a total of 11
Chinchiang-class vessels.</P>
      <P>The boat is 61.4 meters long, and has a beam of 9.5 meters and a
displacement of 540 tons. It will be able to travel at a speed of 25
knots.</P>
      <P>The vessels will be used for patrolling Taiwan's coastal waters
and for conducting patrol and protection missions in certain other
areas. In times of war, they will be equipped with additional weapons
systems and deployed on combat operations with the Navy's much larger

      <P>Taiwan's two-way trade has expanded stably,

first half of December, official data showed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance

percent, compared with the 1998 figure, to US$7.08 billion, while
imports grew 17.4 percent to US$6.64 billion, thus leaving a trade
surplus of US$440 million in favor of the island nation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports and imports for the whole month of December are
expected to move up 20 percent and 13 percent, respectively, due to
the ongoing recovery of the global economy, an official with the
ministry said.</P>
      <P>During the period from Jan. 1 to Dec. 18 this year, the country's
exports amounted to US$116.83 billion in total, up 9.5 percent from
1998, while imports reached US$106.19 billion, up 6 percent from the
same period last year, the MOF-compiled data showed.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan has recorded a trade surplus of US$10.640
billion for the year so far, the statistics revealed.</P>
      <P>The ministry pointed out that Taiwan's foreign trade will
continue prospering thanks to the sustained global economic growth, a
robust US economy, steady growth in Europe and stronger recovery in
Asian economies.

    <HEADLINE>GIO REJECTS LA TIMES' CRITICISM OF LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Los Angeles Times on Tuesday ran a
letter from the Government Information Office (GIO) of the Republic
of China rejecting the Dec. 15 criticism of President Lee Teng-hui in
an article by Washington, D.C., correspondent Jim Mann, the GIO said.</P>
      <P>Mann, in his article titled "President Caught in a Whopper,"
accused Lee of stretching the truth during a recent campaign rally
for Kuomintang presidential candidate and Vice President Lien Chan,
by saying that "Taiwan's friends overseas, especially the United
States and Japan, want to see the Kuomintang win the presidential
election next March," lest Asia become unstable.</P>
      <P>Mann said that in fact "not a single US official, scholar or
expert has voiced the fear of instability if your party (the KMT)
should fall from power. Not one."</P>
      <P>The GIO said the senior journalist's citation was not totally in
line with the statement in Lee's speech, which read: "Friends in
America, Japan and other countries are extremely concerned about
Taiwan's election, because the stability and development of Asia and
the rest of the world will be greatly affected should the KMT fail to
win. So everyone is really concerned."</P>
      <P>With regard to Mann's remarks that some Americans "are afraid
that you (Lee) might try to touch off a military conflict with China
during your last months in office, or that you might even come up
with some excuse for putting off the elections and keeping yourself
in power as president," the GIO said Taiwan has experienced a
peaceful transition of power with each new ROC president for the past
five decades.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will hold its second direct presidential election on March
18 next year, and Lee's tenure expires two months later on May 20.</P>
      <P>"Mann can rest assured that the voters of Taiwan will exercise
their will at the ballot box next March just as they did four years
ago. And however they vote, Asia and the world will witness Taiwan's
democracy becoming stronger and more mature than ever," the GIO
continued.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Kuo Fangc hih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vietnam continues to suffer from a drop in
foreign investment despite a decision by the Vietnamese government in
March on incentives for foreign direct investment (FDI) activities in
the country.</P>
      <P>Foreign investment in Vietnam in 1998 and 1999 was only half the
annual average recorded a decade ago, which was over US$ 3 billion,
according to the official Vietnam News Agency.</P>
      <P>There are now nearly 2,300 valid foreign-investment projects in
operation in Vietnam with combined registered capital of over US$
35.5 billion.</P>
      <P>At present, there are about 290,000 people working in this sector
and hundreds of thousands of others in related businesses. The
sector's production value makes up nearly 35 percent of Vietnam's
total industrial production value while its export turnover
represents 22 percent of the country's total.</P>
      <P>Businesses with foreign direct investment are expected to obtain
a combined revenue of US$ 3.5 billion and an export value of US$ 2.4
billion this year for an increase of between 21 and 25 percent over
last year. The growth of the FDI sector becomes more impressive as
other sectors of the country's economy face declining growth rates.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors have brought advanced technology to the
country's various industries such as motorbike and car assembling,
electronics, pesticide and fertilizer production, and chemicals to
name a few.</P>
      <P>The garment-textile and footwear sectors are expected to export a
combined US$ 3 billion worth of products in 1999. The increase is
attributed to capital sources coming from over 240 FDI projects in
these sectors.</P>
      <P>However, according to economic experts, the number of FDI
businesses investing in export production development made up only 20
percent of the total, far below the government's expectations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOOMSDAY CULTS MAY TRIGGER Y2K VIOLENCE: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian Security and Intelligence
Service (CSIS) has warned that some doomsday cults may trigger
violence as the year 2000 arrives.</P>
      <P>"One estimation indicates that there are 1,200 active cults
throughout the world, and that roughly 400 subscribe to doomsday
philosophies which foresee catastrophe on or around the year 2000," a
CSIS report says.</P>
      <P>"While it is not known which cults have the potential for
violence, this does not imply that possible threats posed by doomsday
religious movements should be ignored, as they can quickly manifest
themselves in a variety of forms," the report adds.</P>
      <P>The spy agency warns that there is an increased danger of
terrorist incidents in Canada over the next few months.</P>
      <P>The study, titled "Doomsday Religious Movements" says that
several irrational groups foresee catastrophe on or around the year
2000. Given the controversy over when the millennium ends, with most
experts agreeing that it doesn't happen until next year, CSIS says
it's not clear when trouble might occur.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HISTORIC CHANGE IN AUSTRALIAN MILITARY POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a historic policy change, Australia is
stepping up its military readiness in order to prepare for active
duty overseas, including combat, peace-keeping and disaster relief.</P>
      <P>The policy change ends a 50-year period where the call-out of
reserve units was prohibited unless it was for the direct defense of
the country.</P>
      <P>The policy change was announced on Wednesday by Defense Minister
John Moore, who called for an increase in the recruitment of reserves
following the leading role Australia played in the UN peacekeeping
force in East Timor.</P>
      <P>The move is seen as crucial to the long-sought integration of
reserves into the active force. Moore said the government would be
negotiating with employers over compensation for the loss of staff
who are reservists who could be called up for service for months at a
time.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To resolve the military's oversupply of
human resources, Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior is working on a
scheme for substitute service by some of those who are obliged to
participate in compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen revealed at a legislative meeting
that the plan is part of the military's effort to downsize its ranks,
a move aimed at seeking operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>By studying similar programs in European countries, such as civil
service schemes, and considering Taiwan's needs, the ministry has
drafted a bill which includes plans for implementation of substitute
service for those who cite religious reasons for not participating in
traditional military service.</P>
      <P>There will be an examination committee to screen applications for
the proposed service, Huang told legislators, stressing that the
planned examination and review procedures are designed out of
consideration for freedom of religion.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that according to the bill, the substitute service is
set to be implemented on July 1, 2000. There will be room for 10,000
participants per year in alternative conscription, the minister said.</P>
      <P>The substitute service bill is now under legislative review.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou revealed Thursday
that in the coming year his administration will focus on the job of
cracking down on corruption among public servants.</P>
      <P>Ma assumed the office of mayor last Dec. 25. On Thursday, two
days before his one-year anniversary at the post, Ma called a meeting
with local reporters to talk about his policy over the past year and
his future administrative plans.</P>
      <P>As part of his efforts to improve social order, Ma indicated that
he will promote the establishment of an anti-corruption department at
the Taipei City Police Headquarters to implement plans to eliminate
bribery, especially that involved with public construction projects.</P>
      <P>Asked about reports charging that under Ma's administration,
problems with the capital city's traffic and social order have gotten
worse, the mayor explained that he was lacking knowledge of the
city's affairs when he took the post one year ago.</P>
      <P>Now he is better able to handle the situation, and believes he
will become even more efficient in managing city affairs, Ma said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the mayor also disclosed new strategies for
the promotion of city-to-city diplomacy, which include promoting
cultural and technology exchanges among major Asian cities.</P>
      <P>Ma will not exclude mainland Chinese cities from the city-to-city
exchange scheme, he stated.</P>
      <P>The mayor also revealed that with the goal of strengthening
Taipei's international profile, he will embark on visits to a number
of European, Asian and American countries in the year 2000, possibly
including Iceland and Russia.</P>
      <P>Taipei now maintains sister-city relations with 44 metropolitan

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CHECKING REPORTS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF BEIJING-VATICAN TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen said on
Thursday that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the
Republic of China Embassy in the Vatican to check reports that the
Holy See and mainland China are ready to forge ties.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement after the French daily Le Figaro reported
on Wednesday that the Vatican and Beijing are negotiating a joint
communique on the establishment of formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>According to the French paper, Beijing and Vatican officials have
over the past year held more than 20 rounds of talks at the mainland
embassy in Rome on mutual recognition. It said the two sides have
reached the stage of negotiating the wording of a joint communique on
the exchange of diplomatic recognition.</P>
      <P>Le Figaro said Cardinal Claudio Celli is the Vatican's chief
negotiator with the mainland and is waiting for a Beijing invitation
to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>The daily further said Celli has tentatively agreed to Beijing's
demand that the Vatican cut diplomatic ties with the ROC. At
Beijing's insistence, Le Figaro said, the Vatican also plans to
downgrade Taiwan's Catholic bishop curia to local-level status.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said a Vatican spokesman just last week denied
a Hong Kong newspaper report that the Vatican has negotiated terms
for establishing diplomatic ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"At that time, ROC Ambassador to the Vatican Ramond Tai also said
the report concerning the Vatican drafting a joint communique with
the mainland was unfounded," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said the Foreign Ministry has ordered the ROC
Embassy in the Vatican to carefully check the latest Le Figaro
report.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that the Vatican, while showing concern about the
rights of Catholics on the mainland, will also not forget Taiwan
Catholics' rights," Chen said, adding that the ROC hopes Pope John
Paul II will uphold religious freedom and the Holy See's right to
name Catholic clergy when considering ties with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Beijing regularly persecutes mainland people who follow religions
not sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party, and insists that only
Beijing can appoint Catholic bishops in the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of foreign conservation scholars
have come to Taipei to look into Taiwan's blackfaced spoonbill
conservation measures.</P>
      <P>The 10-plus conservation experts from the United States, Japan,
South Korea, Holland, Hong Kong, Vietnam and several other countries
were invited by the Republic of China's Council of Agriculture
(COA) to attend a seminar on blackfaced spoonbill conservation.</P>
      <P>Nearly all of them expressed concern about the ROC
government's approval of a plan to build an industrial park in
the southern Tainan county's coastal Pingnan area near the Chiku tial
pond and the mouth of the Tsengwenchi River where a number of
endangered blackfaced spoonbills visit every winter to shun rigid
cold in the north.</P>
      <P>An international survey conducted a few years ago shows that the
number of surviving blackfaced spoonbills worldwide is about 600 to
700. As 300 to 400 of them consistently take shelter in Taiwan,
mainly in the Chiku and Tsengwenchi River mouth area, both local and
foreign conservation scholars are worried about possible damage to
the area's natural ecology after the controerial Pingnan industrial
park is built.</P>
      <P>The private Tainan Blackfaced Spoonbills Conservation
Association reported last week that a record number of blackfaced
spoonbills have graced Taiwan this winter. As of Dec. 10,
the association said, 463 of the species had been discovered in
the Chiku area. The number of marked an increase of about 100 birds
over the figure recorded last year, the association added.</P>
      <P>"The arrival of a record number of blackfaced spponbills is
encouraging news, but it's worrisome that the government has
given a green light to the construction of an industrial park near
one of the world's most important natural habitat of the rare bird,"
said an asociation spokesman.</P>
      <P>The foreign participants to the COA-sponsored blackfaced
spoonbill conservation seminar will pay a visit to COA Chairman Lin
Shiang-nun on Friday to express their concern about the Pingnan
industrial park project.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Wild Birds Society said it plans to organize
a demonstration against the Pingnan industrial park project which
the society said will have a detrimental effect on the Chikuo area's
natural ecology and may discourage the endangered rare species from
visiting Taiwan again.</P>

      <P>Temperatures in flatland areas of Taiwan
dipped to the year's low on Thursday morning, with the mercury
dropping below 10 degrees Celsius in western Taiwan, and hitting 4.1
degrees Celsius in Chiayi, said the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>Owing to the "radiation chill effect" -- the land giving off heat
after sunset -- temperatures in central and southern Taiwan kept
falling throughout Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, CWB
officials said.</P>
      <P>Besides Chiayi, the thermometer plummeted to 4.7 degrees Celsius
in Taichung, 6.1 degrees Celsius in Tainan, 6.9 degrees Celsius in
Tamshui, 7.6 degrees Celsius in Hsinchu, and 8.2 degrees Celsius in
Taipei, according to the CWB.</P>
      <P>The cold snap which has gripped the island since last week has
caused serious damage to milk fish aquaculturists in Tainan County,
which has about 4,000 hectares of fishponds.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Fishery Association estimated that 80 million milk
fish, with a total market value of between NT$500 million and NT$600
million (US$15.62 million and US$18.75 million), had died of cold as
of Thursday morning, as the fish cannot survive in water of less than
10 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the cold snap has brought shoals of young eels
to the coast of northern Taiwan, much to the delight of anglers in
Keelung Harbor.</P>

      <P>Taiwan led the other three Asian dragons in
export growth in 1999, posting a 9.5 percent increase rate as of the
middle of December, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) estimated
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Sept. 21 earthquake, the worst natural disaster to hit Taiwan
in a century, did not hinder Taiwan's overall exports from January to
the middle of this month, according to a panel set up under the MOEA.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that Taiwan's outbound shipments had a total worth
of US$116.8 billion from January to Dec. 18, up 9.5 percent over the
same period of 1998, an indication that the tremor did not affect the
island's exports.</P>
      <P>The panel added that export expansion has become the major factor
behind the continued growth of Taiwan's gross national product.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top five export items are electronics, information and
telecommunications products, yarn, machinery and steel, in that
order, with increases registering between 27.6 percent to 2.6
percent, it noted.</P>
      <P>The United States, Hong Kong, Europe, the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and Japan are Taiwan's leading five export
markets, and exports to these regions have all posted growth over the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei will rename its representative
office in Macau as the Taipei Economic and Culture Center, effective
from Dec. 27, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei's representative to Macau, William Li, who
caused an uproar in Taipei for removing the name plate of his office
before the Dec. 20 handover of Macau to Beijing, will stay on in his
job for the time being, according to the Cabinet-level organization
which charts Taiwan's mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>Li was recalled by Taipei for an explanation as to why he removed
the name plate of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau on
Dec. 19 just an hour before Macau was due to return to Beijing's
rule.</P>
      <P>Macau had warned Taipei to rename its representative office to
play down any official overtone in the existing name before the
Portuguese colony was handed over, but Taipei had not done so by Dec.
20 because Beijing has shut down all channels of contact with Taiwan
since President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state relationship"
statement in July.</P>
      <P>Li therefore removed his office's name plate before midnight on
Dec. 19, when Beijing leaders descended on the Portuguese colony in
flocks for the handover ceremony.</P>
      <P>Li's move, which was not approved by Taipei in advance, drew fire
from critics at home who blamed him for "running ahead of himself,"
and there were suggestions that he would be sacked for his mistake.</P>
      <P>The new name of Taiwan's representative office is consistent with
Taipei's offices in other countries which have no official ties with
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's household-used natural gas prices
are expected to be hiked by the beginning of the year 2000, state-run
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) officials revealed on Friday.</P>
      <P>The current prices have been maintained for the past six months,

They disclosed that prices might be hiked by more than 3 percent, and
even as high as 5 percent.</P>
      <P>A CPC executive explained that since July, the company has
increased industry-used natural gas prices three times, for an
accumulated increase of nearly 9 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's arms build-up is
aimed solely at securing an effective deterrent to military threats
from mainland China, but absolutely not at igniting an arms race in
the Taiwan Strait, Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent analysis compiled by the Pentagon, Siew said the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) will hold military superiority over
Taiwan by the year 2005. Taiwan's seeking to beef up its military
muscle is only a natural development in consequence of the PLA's
accelerated arms modernization and build-up, he noted.</P>
      <P>Siew, making his remarks while fielding questions at the
Legislative Yuan, stressed that Taiwan is virtually racing against
time in the face of the growing threat from Beijing as its military
capabilities are expected to increase at a startling pace over the
next six years.</P>
      <P>To beef up Taiwan's defensive prowess, Siew said the military is
making an effort to upgrade its pre-warning and surveillance
capabilities, strengthen its anti-missile muscle, and sharpen up the
combat capabilities of the three branches of its armed forces.</P>
      <P>Siew also stressed that Taiwan will never develop or research the
development of nuclear weapons under any circumstances.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Friday it is closely watching developments in relations between
the Vatican and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the statement amid reports that mainland China
and the Holy See are ready to forge diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry M.C. Chen said the Republic of China has
consistently attached great importance to its relations with the
Vatican and is concerned about any reports concerning changes in the
Vatican's attitude toward the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen said initial contacts between MOFA and a Vatican official in
charge of China affairs on Thursday show that there is a wide gap
between the press reports and the actual situation regarding current
ROC-Vatican ties.</P>
      <P>The French daily Le Figaro reported on Wednesday that the Vatican
and Beijing are negotiating a joint communique on the establishment
of formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong newspaper also reported last week that the Vatican
has negotiated terms for establishing diplomatic ties with mainland
China. However, a Vatican spokesman has flatly denied the report.</P>
      <P>As the Vatican is one of the ROC's only two diplomatic allies in
Europe, Chen said the ROC never ignores reports concerning
ROC-Vatican ties.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the prospects for ROC-Vatican relations are
brighter or gloomier than the picture painted by foreign news media,
Chen did not respond directly, but stressed instead that the ROC
treasures its ties with the Vatican and respects religious freedom
and the Holy See's right to appoint Catholic clergy.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has never ceased its attempts to squeeze the
ROC's diplomatic frontiers and block its participation in
international organizations and activities, Chen said MOFA has
ordered ROC Ambassador to the Vatican Ramond Tai to carefully check
the recent press reports concerning Vatican-Beijing engagements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOW MORE THAN EVER, TAIWAN BELONGS IN WHO, SAYS ROC PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exclusion from the World Health
Organization (WHO) not only compromises Taiwan's public health, it
also represents a loss for the entire world, Republic of China
Premier Vincent Siew said in an article published on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an article carried in The Providence Journal of Rhode Island,
Siew said there could be no more appropriate time than now to
eliminate the artificial barriers hampering the WHO's coordination of
global resources to ensure the safety of people in all countries and
to make possible Taiwan's access to the WHO.</P>
      <P>In the article titled "Now more than ever, Taiwan belongs in
WHO," Siew said when a 7.3-magnitude earthquake shook central Taiwan
on Sept. 21, 1999, the world immediately recognized that a concerted
and immediate effort was necessary to save lives and limit collateral
damage.</P>
      <P>The international community responded swiftly with generous
support and expert assistance for locating survivors. For this, the
people and government of the ROC are very grateful, he said. The
arrival of rescue specialists from all over the world was a powerful
reminder of the basic human impulse to come together in the face of
adversity, he went on.</P>
      <P>This is in fact the same spirit behind the everyday activities of
the WHO, he said, adding that its mission is to ensure the health of
people around the world by coordinating medical resources. To do
this, it works to save lives and limit damage caused by disease
outbreaks on a daily basis in the absence of such high-profile events
as earthquakes, hurricanes or volcanic eruptions.</P>
      <P>This is the same spirit as that demonstrated by international
search and rescue specialists working alongside Taiwan's emergency
response workers -- an unselfish sharing of resources and expertise
for the benefit of all, he said.</P>
      <P>WHO assistance and expertise would be very welcome in Taiwan in
the aftermath of the earthquake, he said. "My country has completed
the first phase of earthquake disaster response, but the next step
involves housing victims and continuing efforts to contain the health
threat posed by the earthquake and its aftermath. The greatest threat
to the well-being of survivors now is no longer structurally unsafe
buildings, but rather a disrupted public sanitation infrastructure
that inevitably follows in the wake of such a large-scale disaster."</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, he said, any country would turn to the
WHO for expert consultation and coordination. Yet, when it comes to
Taiwan, the WHO must rely on non-official, private-sector channels to
offer assistance. "My country has been excluded from the organization
since 1972, and the UN remains under pressure from Beijing to keep
things that way, despite all the changes that have taken place in the
world order since then."</P>
      <P>Fortunately, this time the WHO was able to make use of indirect
channels to assess the magnitude of the problem and offer its help.
For instance, it donated US$50,000 to the Red Cross for use as relief
aid. The people and government of the ROC greatly appreciate this
gesture of concern.</P>
      <P>And by not being permitted a role in the WHO, Taiwan has no
access to information concerning global regulations on the laboratory
testing of bio-products. It cannot participate in the development of
bio-product standards, and its bio-products cannot be recognized by
other countries. This is a particularly unfortunate way to start the
21st century when this technology will have such an important role to
play for many decades to come, Siew said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan has applied for observer status in the WHO,
an organization where common global medical and public health
concerns should clearly take priority over pedestrian political
issues.</P>
      <P>There could be no more appropriate time than this to eliminate
the artificial barriers hampering the WHO's coordination of global
resources to ensure the safety of people in all countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO not only compromises the public
health interests of the 22 million people of Taiwan, but also
represents a loss for the entire world, he said, adding that the
exigencies of disaster have demonstrated that its non-political
priorities accord with the human heart.</P>
      <P>"Let us go on listening to our hearts," he said, adding: "There
is a role in the WHO for Taiwan that will make the world a healthier
and safer place."</P>

    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>High-tech manufacturing lines in the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan sustained
losses estimated at millions of new Taiwan dollars on Friday
following two sudden drops in the power supply.</P>
      <P>The first drop occurred at 6:45 p.m. on Thursday, while the
second incident occurred on Friday at 1:14 a.m., when the electric
power vital to the park's round-the-clock operation dropped suddenly
by between 10 percent and 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Although the plunge lasted only several seconds, it affected the
whole park, home to most leading semiconductor manufacturers in
Taiwan, according to the park administration.</P>
      <P>Macronix International, which makes silicon wafers, lost the use
of several vital pieces of machinery, forcing the plant to
temporarily close down, leading to losses of several million Taiwan
dollars, the company said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company technicians said that based on a preliminary
investigation, the power drops occurred after two electric wires
touched, tripping a circuit-breaker. An in-depth investigation is now
under way to discover the cause of the short, they said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed higher for the
fourth straight day on Friday on news of the merger of three major
state-run banks and overnight gains on Wall Street.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index closed
135.96 points, or 1.7 percent, higher at 8,219.45, on a huge turnover
of NT$170.44 billion (US$5.41 billion), even larger than Thursday's
NT$133.86 billion.</P>
      <P>The index has added 5.61 percent over the four-day rise.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday confirmed a merger between three
major banks in order to consolidate Taiwan's overcrowded financial
industry.</P>
      <P>According to dealers, the first merger between major banks
triggers hopes that more tie-ups will follow in the near future. The
move, though it may not show an immediate effect in improved
profitability, will surely help banks upgrade their competitiveness
and promise for future profitability.</P>
      <P>Led by the cement sector, which registered gains of 4.09 percent,
the majority of the eight major stock categories posted gains, with

    <HEADLINE>UN EFFECTIVELY FORCES DELAY OF HEROIN INJECTING ROOMS IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The UN Narcotics Control Board has
effectively forced the delayed opening of planned heroin injecting
rooms in New South Wales, Victoria and Canberra after it warned that
the rooms would be illegal and would be damaging to the image of the
Sydney Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The governments of NSW, Victoria and Canberra are likely to
cooperate with the UN body and delay their plans to begin operating
the injecting rooms by reexamining the scheme, which is designed to
help drug addicts find a venue to reduce their addiction and finally
eliminate it.</P>
      <P>Drug addiction is one of the most serious problems in Australia
as the suicide rate among drug-users is on the rise and the age of
drug-users is getting younger and younger. Crime rates are also on
the rise in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and other cities due to the
impact of drug addiction and gambling.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TAIWAN EXPORTS REPORTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has for the most part recovered from
the September earthquake as its exports have increased significantly,
the leading French newspaper Le Figaro reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>It has done so by taking advantage of the on-going Asian recovery
and the rising investment trends from Europe and the United States
regarding information technologies and electronic products, the paper
reported.</P>
      <P>Quoting the most recent statistics published by the Taipei
government, Le Figaro said that exports from the island in November
were 18.6 percent higher than the same month last year, reaching US$
11.56 billion.</P>
      <P>These figures are impressive given the seriousness of the quake,
which caused an estimated US$ 2.15 billion in losses to the
manufacturing sector, with US$ 400 million worth of damage to
equipment. The government has estimated that reconstruction efforts
will cost a total of about US$ 12.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Yet Republic of China government authorities have calculated that
the earthquake will only have a limited overall effect on the
country's economy, with the growth rate for this year expected to
stay at 5%, the French daily said.</P>
      <P>For the month of November, total exports to the United States,
Taiwan's biggest market, increased 4.5 percent to US$ 28.2 billion
and exports to Europe rose 2.5 percent to US$ 18.4 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a positive balance of trade and a regular inflow of
foreign capital have enabled Taiwan to reach a record-high foreign
currency reserve level of US$ 103.5 billion at the end of November,
representing a rise of over US$20 billion from the end of October,
reported the paper.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the people of Taiwan are also still continuing
to invest, according to La Figaro, while companies continue to expand
and open new plants. Microelectronics, the second largest
semi-conductor producer in the country, is about to open a new plant
worth several hundred million US dollars.</P>
      <P>Le Figaro recalled that while Communist Chinese President Jiang
Zemin re-affirmed during a speech at the Macau handover ceremony that
he wants to see the island "come back to China as soon as possible,"
Taiwan, which has just recently obtained a wider access to mainland
capital markets, is presently focusing all its energy on gaining
entry into the World Trade Organization to further strengthen its
already strong economy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  23 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>USA Today published Thursday a letter
from the Republic of China representative office in Washington, D.C.
criticizing a British reader for comparing Taiwan's status to that of
Macau and suggesting that those who don't want to live under mainland
Chinese rule should leave Taiwan now to facilitate the reunification
of China.</P>
      <P>Eric Chiang, information division director of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Representative Office, responded to the Dec. 7
letter-to-the-editor by saying that "it is incomprehensible that an
Englishman, whose ancestors drafted the Magna Carta, should make such
a suggestion to clear up unfinished business" over the future of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"How in the world could one who enjoys the blessings of civil
liberties and democracy propose that the 22 million peace-loving free
citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan be subjected to the
ruthless rulers of a Communist dictatorship?" Chiang questioned.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the ROC has been a sovereign state since its
founding in 1912, even though it now only effectively controls Taiwan
and a few other islands, and has worked to realize its goal of a
democratic government and free-market economy.</P>
      <P>He stressed that according to opinion polls, more than 80 per
cent of Taiwan's population opposes Beijing's "one country, two
systems" formula, and for obvious reasons.</P>
      <P>"There is no convincing argument to sacrifice our hard-earned
democracy in exchange for trusting our future to the same regime that
readily persecutes religious followers and guns down its own people.
We all know that Beijing does not have a sterling track record in
such areas as human rights or the rule of law," said Chiang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERIOR MINISTRY TO PROMOTE BURIAL ROTATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is
working to promote an alternative way of using public cemeteries by
introducing a rotation scheme, to allow limited burial space to be
distributed more fairly, MOI sources said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>After years of deliberation, the MOI has recently completed
drafting an amendment to the existing cemetery management bill, which
is expected to help rectify the long-insufficient regulation of
burial practices in Taiwan, MOI officials said.</P>
      <P>With the number of annual deaths increasing steadily, expected to
total 170,000 for the year 2001, while the acreage of public
cemeteries remains the same, about 11,000 hectares islandwide, the
areas used for burying the dead must be regulated more efficiently
and rationally to meet demand, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The amended bill stipulates that graveyard plots must be vacated
after being used for eight to 10 years so as to allow the spaces to
be used in rotation.</P>
      <P>The bill encourages private business groups to join the
government in developing and managing public cemeteries under a
build-operate-transfer (BOT) program.</P>
      <P>Private companies will also be allowed to operate privately-owned
public cemeteries, each with an area of at least five hectares, if
they are found to meet specifications, according to the bill.</P>
      <P>The bill prohibits burial on private land or in neighborhood, and
violators will be dealt with according to guidelines outlined in the
bill.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bill for the first time recommends "ocean
burial" -- spreading ashes of the deceased over the sea -- as an
alternative to traditional burial.</P>
      <P>The amended bill is expected to be approved by the Legislative
Yuan and become effective immediately, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN PROMISES TO MAKE TAICHUNG SPECIAL ZONE IF ELECTED PRES.</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan, the
Kuomintang's presidential candidate, on Sunday promised to make the
central city of Taichung a special business operation zone if he is
elected the next president of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Soliciting support at a campaign rally in Taichung, the third
largest city in Taiwan, Lien promised potential voters that if he is
elected the next president, he will see to it that an international
airport and a mass rapid transportation system are developed in the
greater Taichung area.</P>
      <P>Lien said Taichung should also have a science-based industrial
park to further develop industries and businesses.</P>
      <P>With its relatively close proximity to mainland China, Lien
added, Taichung can be developed into a special business operation
zone as a base where direct and more frequent bilateral business
interchanges between Taiwan and mainland China can be carried out
when the time is ripe.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien promised to upgrade the government's
classification of Taichung to the level of "metropolis," making it
the Taiwan's third behind Taipei and Kaohsiung, since the city's
population now exceeds 1 million and improvement projects are in
order.</P>
      <P>Lien made a campaign speech on the occasion of the founding of
his central Taiwan campaign headquarters in downtown Taichung, as a
sea of campaign banners swayed in the background.</P>
      <P>Lien said he and his running mate, Premier Vincent Siew, are the
only ticket that the people can rely on for a brighter future.</P>
      <P>Together, Lien added, he and Siew have held the posts of eight
ministry heads and two premierships, making them seasoned and
experienced government executives who have been largely instrumental
in making possible Taiwan's national health insurance program, the
national defense's "lean and mean" plans, telecommunications
liberalization and the Asia-Pacific business operations center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC URGED TO ABANDON ONE-PARTY RULE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  24  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The China Democracy Party banned by
Beijing a year ago issued a bold call Friday to end one-party rule,
challenging both the Communist Party's constitutional hold on supreme
power and the Beijing regime's threat to use force to reunify Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "Voice of America" radio station reported from Beijing that
the China Democracy Party sent a lengthy declaration to foreign news
media in the mainland capital Friday, rejecting key Chinese Communist
doctrines as well as accusing Beijing of using the defense of
national sovereignty as an excuse to commit human rights abuses.</P>
      <P>The China Democracy Party stopped short of calling for the
overthrow of the Communist Chinese government, but it argued that
people have the right to abolish the government when their human
rights are systematically and persistently violated, said the VOA,
which expresses the policies of the United States government.</P>
      <P>The VOA quoted He Depu, a China Democracy Party member in
Beijing, as saying that there was no immediate government response,
but he believed the declaration could bring on more repression.</P>
      <P>The Beijing regime has cracked down on the group, which it has
declared illegal, arresting many members and handing down stiff jail
sentences, the radio station told listeners.</P>
      <P>When it was founded in June 1998, the China Democracy Party said
it had 500 members across the mainland. But Mr. He declined to say
how many members the opposition party has now, reported the VOA.</P>
      <P>He noted that the declaration released Friday was written by a
group from the China Democracy Party's Beijing headquarters, and was
based on the ideas of longtime dissident and Party leader Xu Wenli,
who was sentenced last year to 13 years in prison.

    <HEADLINE>VIETNAM AND INDONESIA DRAWING ATTENTION OF TAIWAN INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Southeast Asian countries, like Vietnam and
Indonesia, could take mainland China's place in the spotlight of
Taiwan investors sometime in the near future, said an economics
official of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Director General Lin Neng-chung of the Industrial Development and
Investment Center (IDIC) was cited by the Economic Daily News on
Sunday as saying that that trend is emerging as the investment
environment on the mainland is becoming worse for Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>Recently, Beijing has adjusted its trade and economic policy, and
its policy on foreign investment in mainland China, numerous times
without prior notice, Lin stated, noting that Taiwan business leaders
are quite confused by the changes, according to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>Lin, leading an economic and trade delegation, left Taiwan Sunday
on a trip to Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia, Indonesia,
and Vietnam. During the journey, the mission is planning to visit
factories owned by Taiwan enterprises to study their operation.</P>
      <P>The group is also scheduled to call on relevant officials during
its stay, to discuss operational difficulties and investment
challenges facing Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>Lin indicated that Taiwan's current investment in Southeast Asia
accounts for 40 percent of the island's total foreign investment.
Most of the island's Southeast Asian investment is concentrated in
Indonesia, followed by Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, IDIC
statistics show.</P>
      <P>As Southeast Asian countries are gradually walking out of the
shadow of the Asian financial storm, which broke out in July 1997,
they are at the same time promoting investment incentives, such as
tax reductions, to draw foreign capital in the hope of speeding up
their economic recovery, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official said, in a country like Vietnam, there
is a diligent labor force, and sometimes production costs there are
lower than those in mainland China.</P>
      <P>If a particular country has signed a trade accord with the United
States to qualify for reductions in US import tariffs, any Taiwan
investment in that country could potentially benefit from such an
agreement, Lin added.</P>
      <P>As for the current investment climate in Indonesia, Lin said
production costs and prices of raw materials there have sustained big
drops after the two-year-long political and economic disturbance.</P>
      <P>If the country's new government, which was formed in early
November, can maintain stable political development and appear
friendly to Chinese people, Indonesia would be an ideal place for
Taiwan businesses to build factories which rely on an intensive labor
force for operations, Lin noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MIXED REACTIONS TO POST-HANDOVER MACAU SITUATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars' reactions to the effect on
Taiwan-Macau relations and cross-strait relations after Macau
reverted to the rule of mainland China on Dec. 20 were mixed.</P>
      <P>On one hand, scholars said there is more room for developments
between Taiwan and Macau after the handover. On the other hand,
Beijing may feel it is more urgent to try to unify with Taiwan after
its two former colonies have rejoined the fold, said the scholars on
Sunday at a seminar sponsored by the Association for Chinese Academic
and Cultural Exchange Across the Strait.</P>
      <P>Professor Pan Hsi-tang of Tamkang University said at the seminar
 that there will now be more room for relations to develop between
Taiwan and Macau than there was between Taiwan and Hong Kong after
its handover.</P>
      <P>Pan envisioned Macau as acting as an intermediary bridge
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, adding that though there
is not much trade opportunity in the former Portuguese colony, it
will be a good place for Taiwan businessmen to establish overseas
operations centers for making inroads into the mainland.</P>
      <P>Professor Kuo Chan-li of Chinese Culture University said that
Macau, if it continues to develop into a prosperous society, could
serve as the midpoint of cross-strait communication.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that a high degree of autonomy will be the key to
whether Macau will be able to rule itself as promised by mainland
China. He also said that if the current cross-strait stalemate is not
resolved after the handover, cross-strait relations will enter into a
period of confrontation and adversity.</P>
      <P>Especially after both sides of the Taiwan Strait enter the World
Trade Organization next year, the economies of both sides will have
more exchanges but will also suffer under the impact, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>He said that if both sides of the Taiwan Strait handle the
situation well, then it will either be a chance for positive
development between the two sides or relations will enter into a
dangerous period.</P>
      <P>Professor Wu Heng-yu of the College of Political Warfare said
that after the handover, Macau will follow the example of Hong Kong
and become a special administration region in carrying out the
mainland's "one country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the formula, first broached by Deng Xiaoping in
1980s with the intention of reunification with Taiwan, is being put
to the test in Hong Kong and Macau. The mainland definitely wants the
test to be successful so it will be attractive to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that after Hong Kong and Macau are back in the fold of
mainland China, the desire to unify with Taiwan will pose new
pressure on mainland leader Jiang Zemin, so Wu envisions that Beijing
will refine its "one country, two system" rhetoric, perhaps by
offering a more flexible time span than the "50 years of an
unchangeable system" offered to Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Beijing could also permit more Taiwan people and businessmen who
live in the mainland to participate at various levels of the
government. Beijing could also unveil more substantial details of the
government's legislative act to protect Taiwan businesses that was
announced earlier this month, he said.</P>
      <P>Beijing could also establish a National Unification Council, and
work out national unification guidelines just like Taipei has done,
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECORD NUMBER OF MRT PASSENGERS TRANSPORTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the opening to traffic of a small part
of the new Panchiao-Nankang (PN) line of Taipei's mass rapid transit
(MRT) system, the volume of passengers transported by Taiwan's only
subway system continued to hit record highs over the past two days.</P>
      <P>Officials from Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) attributed the
remarkable increase in MRT passengers to the opening of a
7.7-kilometer route, connecting Lungshan Temple in western downtown
Taipei to Taipei City Hall in the east, on Dec. 24, or Christmas Eve,
when the number of people traveling on board MRT totaled a record
high of 734,000.</P>
      <P>Of that number of passengers traveling on all lines of the MRT
Friday, the number of those traveling on the PN line totaled 83,000,
according to TRTC officials.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, when the total MRT transport volume amounted to
672,000, the number of those traveling on the PN line shot up to
120,000, indicating that the PN line is the "goose that lays golden
eggs" of TRTC.</P>
      <P>The PN line is popular because it allows people from western
Taipei, including those from other satellite cities of suburban
Taipei, to reach the Wenshan District in southern Taipei, the Taipei
City Hall district in the east, and northern Taipei, in a fast 14
minutes -- speed that was just a dream back when such travel took at
least an hour by bus or car during peak hours.</P>
      <P>The PN line, when it is completed in two years, will allow
passengers to travel from Panchiao in Taipei County, located to the
southwest of Taipei, to Nankang in the northeast of suburban Taipei,
in about 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>The PN line is the third major line of the Taipei MRT system,
joining the line connecting Mucha and Chungshan, a mid-capacity
route, and the line connecting Taipei Railway Station in downtown
Taipei and Tamshui in Taipei County, a mass-capacity route.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE FM SEES CHINA LIBERALIZING POLITICS, NOT UPPING ANTE IN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  25  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer predicted mainland China will have to liberalize its political
system, and he believed current Taiwan-Strait tensions would not
worsen, despite growing worry in the international community.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a newspaper in Adelaide this week following
his return from attending the handover ceremonies of Macau to China
on Dec. 20, Downer said: "As China's economy liberalizes, as it
becomes more engaged in the global economy, it will have no choice
over the medium to long term but to progressively liberalize its
political system.</P>
      <P>"I don't think there is any reason to believe that tensions will
automatically increase" in the Taiwan Strait. "There's an election in
Taiwan up in the early part of next year and we'll have to see what
happens in that election process. I don't just mean in terms of the
actual outcome of the election, but how the campaign finally unfolds.</P>
      <P>"And those sorts of issues are obviously sensitive issues both in
Taipei itself and in Beijing. So there's unknown. And the second
thing is that after election, you'll have a new administration in
place, the existing president isn't going to be re-elected, isn't
standing for re-election. You'll have a new administration in place
and all of us will just have to wait and see what sort of approach
that administration takes."</P>
      <P>"So what could you say? That there's a certain amount of
uncertainty, certainly, but an electoral process to go through in
Taiwan," he said in an excerpt of the transcript faxed to CNA late
Friday night.</P>
      <P>Downer said the international community is gravely concerned
about the current tensions between Taiwan and China and wanted to see
both sides able to resolve their problems peacefully.

    <HEADLINE>SUMMARY OF RAND REPORT ON PRC ARMS SALES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  24  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China's arms sales pose a
moderate threat to US interests, and further sales will make the
future security environment more dangerous. Although Beijing's
behavior is improving, continued pressure is necessary to minimize
Communist China's most dangerous sales, particularly those to rogue
regimes, according to a new report by the Rand Corporation in the
United States.</P>
      <P>The Rand report, titled "China's Arms Sales: Motivations and
Implications," pointed out that Communist China has been, and can be,
influenced by US pressure, although some level of sales is likely to
continue. Thus, Washington must hedge against the likelihood of
sales, developing offsets in concert with allies to minimize danger.</P>
      <P>Communist China emerged as a major source of arms transfers in
the 1980s, and by 1987 was the world's fourth largest seller of
conventional arms, said the report. However, Chinese weapons sales
diminished sharply after the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, and
demand for Communist Chinese weapons fell further after "Operation
Desert Storm" dramatically demonstrated the superiority of Western
high-tech weaponry over low-tech Chinese and Russian systems. The
growing availability of cheap -- and more advanced -- Russian weapons
also reduced demand for Chinese weapons.</P>
      <P>Rand noted that as Communist China's conventional weapons sales
began to taper off, it began transferring systems and technology that
were much more worrisome: those associated with missiles and nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons. The decisions to engage in such
transfers had been made well before the slump in the demand for
Chinese conventional arms, but these transactions did not begin to
receive public attention until the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>In 1988, US intelligence revealed that Communist China had sold
nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi
Arabia. This was followed by reports that Beijing was assisting
ballistic missile programs in Iran and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Even more alarming was Communist China's assistance to several
countries' nuclear, biological and chemical programs. The most
extensive assistance was to Pakistan, where Beijing apparently
provided Islamabad with both nuclear weapon designs and fissile
material. Communist China also aided the nuclear programs of Iran and
Algeria as well as Iran's chemical and biological weapons programs.</P>
      <P>The level of Communist China's arms sales has fallen in recent
years, and Beijing has shown restraint in its transfers to rogue
states such as Iran and Iraq. In addition, Beijing has increased its
adherence to international agreements regulating the sale and spread
of dangerous arms, "although it is still not committed to the spirit
of many of these agreements," said the Rand Corporation.</P>
      <P>Six countries -- Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Myanmar and
Thailand -- have been Communist China's primary arms transfer
recipients since the 1980s, added the report. In general, strategic
factors outweigh commercial ones with regard to Communist Chinese
arms sales.</P>
      <P>These sales represented a significant portion (roughly 7 percent)
of mainland China's export earnings in the 1980s, but today they are
only a small fraction of Communist China's total sales abroad. Many
of Beijing's recent transfers were subsidized, and it has refrained
from sales to possible foes, indicating that strategic concerns
guided most arms sales.</P>
      <P>The Rand Corporation stressed that regardless of US efforts to
limit Communist China's arms sales, some transfers will inevitably
occur. Most of Beijing's conventional weapons are unsophisticated and
do not present a significant threat to the United States if
transferred.</P>
      <P>Of most concern are Communist China's transfers of technology
related to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and missiles.
"Given the limitations on the US ability to stop these transfers, the
US military in general, and the US Air Force in particular, must
prepare for the possibility of future conflict with regional
adversaries, such as Iran, who are armed with longer-range ballistic
missiles and perhaps even nuclear or chemical weapons," concluded the
report.

    <HEADLINE>`SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE' RELATIONS SPELL OUT SOLID TRUTH: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of
Taiwan's relationship with mainland China as a "special
state-to-state" one explicitly states the true situation in the
Taiwan Strait and is also a clear reflection of the opinion of most
Taiwanese citizens, said government spokesman Chen Chien-jen on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The "special state-to-state" theory, the most explicit definition
of cross Taiwan Strait relations to date, also helps Taiwan by
providing a clearer status when dealing with other countries in the
international diplomatic arena, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Chen,
director-general of the Government Information Office, said Taiwan is
prepared to return to the negotiating table with South Korea today if
authorities in Seoul respect the two principles Taiwan insists on
concerning resuming bilateral talks: mutual respect and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea severed formal diplomatic relations nearly
eight years ago.</P>
      <P>To resume the bilateral aviation talks, Chen said, the two sides
must first settle the content of an agreement before deciding which
authorities should represent each side in signing the new accord.</P>
      <P>In regard to Beijing's much-talked-about relations with the
Vatican, Chen said he is positive that Beijing has not gained an inch
over the past four months in its attempt to establish formal ties
with the Holy See and to sabotage the Taipei-Vatican relationship.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, promised legislators that he will keep a close
watch on any new developments in relations between the Vatican and
Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC FACING NEW PRESSURE TO HIKE OIL PRICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the state-owned Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) said on Monday that the price of petroleum
products will be adjusted according to market forces and will not
be affected by political factors.</P>
      <P>CPC President Pan Wen-yen made the remarks while responding to
questions on whether to raise the prices of petroleum products in the
wake of new pressure from rising world crude prices.</P>
      <P>The CPC hiked its petroleum prices again earlier this month,
basing its price on crude at US$19.5 per barrel and an exchange rate
of NT$31.64 to one US dollar at the time.</P>
      <P>Pan noted that world crude now stands at US$25 per barrel and
that the CPC's petroleum price has not fully reflected the
trend of rising world crude prices.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has authorized the CPC to adopt
a floating price system, but the adjustment will not exceed 6 percent
within three months. As the CPC has raised its prices in November and
December by nearly 6 percent, petroleum sources said the price of oil
is not expected to go up in January.</P>
      <P>But as Chinese New Year falls on February 5 and the
upcoming presidential election is scheduled for March 18, Pan was
asked if the CPC would suspend adjustments for a while due to
political factors.</P>
      <P>Pan said the floating price system will respect market forces
and cut the influence of political factors. He noted that whether
or not the CPC hikes oil prices in February will depend on a review
of the cost of purchased petroleum and the company's revenue at the
time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPUTER HACKERS EXPECTED TO USE Y2K BUG AS A COVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Computer hackers are expected to create
and release viruses under the cover of the Y2K bug during the New
Year period, according to warnings from Australian authorities.</P>
      <P>Federal Attorney General Daryl Williams and Senator Ian Campbell
urged Australian consumers to beware of hacker attacks and viruses
over the New Year period.</P>
      <P>Campbell said he issued the warning after receiving advice from
the US and "our own sources that hackers and virus makers will create
and release viruses under the cover of the Y2K bug."</P>
      <P>"It's an expectation based on previous experience," he said,
adding that some viruses have been specifically written for Jan. 1,
2000.</P>
      <P>Campbell pointed out that the W32/Mypics virus had been designed
to reform a hard disk on January 1 while others, such as the
W95.Babylonia virus, have already taken advantage of the paranoia
that has come with talk of the millennium bug.</P>
      <P>Many have been distributed disguised as program fixes for the
date problem and some 24 viruses have already been detected with that
theme, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RAW FOOD DIET REDUCES CHOLESTEROL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A growing new fad diet consisting only of
raw foods has dethroned veganism as the most rigid diet in North
America, while a new study has found that eating in this way actually
reduces cholesterol to the same extent as cholesterol-reducing drugs,
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Living foods" enthusiasts' idea of trying to stay healthy by not
eating any cooked foods has been around for decades, the CBC pointed
out, but the message is just now catching on, with Web sites and
books on how "not" to cook.</P>
      <P>Bill Nasby frequents Super Sprouts, Canada's first store to
promote raw foodism. Nasby, 72, used to tire easily and was
overweight. He went on the raw food diet four months ago and soon
lost 30 pounds and gained new energy, reported the CBC.</P>
      <P>"With this type of diet, you're totally alive. It's
unbelievable," said Nasby.</P>
      <P>Catererer George Zuwala said raw foodists feel an energy boost
because cooking kills enzymes in food that the body needs for
digestion. "We take more energy to digest that food, and instead of
doing whatever it is that we want to do, we're sitting there after a
three or four-course meal, we're just kind of just dead."</P>
      <P>Nutritionist Carol Greenwood of University of Toronto said the
raw food concept is flawed, because only the body's enzymes break
down food. She does agree that the diet is healthy, but doubts it
will catch on.</P>
      <P>"Just from that long-term perspective of palatability, it's
unlikely that somebody would be on it for a long period of time,"
Greenwood added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOBLESSNESS THE WORST PROBLEM IN EARTHQUAKE-STRICKEN AREAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Joblessness is expected to become the most
serious problem in areas struck by the devastating magnitude 7.3
earthquake on Sept. 21, academician and social activist Chu Hai-yuan
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chu, a researcher with Taiwan's top research institute Academia
Sinica and executive director of the National Alliance of Private
Post-Disaster Rehabilitation Work, said the worst phenomenon in the
earthquake-stricken areas to date is not that people are still living
in tents in open fields during winter, but is the looming shroud of
joblessness in the wake of the destruction.</P>
      <P>Chu urged quick passage of the proposed "9-21 Earthquake
Rehabilitation Draft" in the Legislative Yuan so as to provide a
legitimate basis for the use and allocation of the huge amount of
funds donated by people at home and abroad since the deadly jolt hit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But even if the draft is quickly passed into law, Chu noted that
unemployment will still pose a problem in affected areas, adding that
the people there do not feel they have been sufficiently taken care
of by the government.</P>
      <P>Many people have lost their jobs or their means of making living
because of the earthquake and this has not only affected their
financial situation but has also strained their family relations, Chu
added.</P>
      <P>Chu disclosed that the affected people are planning to
demonstrate their grief and anger by busing to Taipei Wednesday to
rally in front of the Central Committee of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake
that struck Taiwan on Sept. 21 was selected as Taiwan's top news
story in 1999 by the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI) on Monday.</P>
      <P>CNFI's Industry Magazine compiled the list of the top 10 news

business journalists from Taiwan's leading mass media from Dec. 5 to
20.</P>
      <P>The Sept. 21 earthquake was voted the top news story of the year,

reduction in the country's gross national product (GNP) for 1999,
according to a magazine spokesman.</P>
      <P>The islandwide blackout on July 29 caused huge property damage to
Taiwan's industrial sector, and President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition

influential industrial news stories in Taiwan this year, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The other news stories or events that were selected by the

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Monday
expressed his appreciation of Chinese-Japanese baseball star Sadaharu
Oh for his active participation in quake-relief efforts after the
devastating earthquake hit Taiwan Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Oh, currently head coach of Japan's Daiei Hawks baseball team,
presented Lien with a check for 2 million Japanese yen (around
US$19,600) to be added to quake-relief efforts. Oh previously donated
autographed baseball uniforms and equipment for auction, and the
proceeds have been used for the relief effort.</P>
      <P>The vice president thanked Oh for his sympathy and generosity
after the deadly temblor. He also congratulated the coach for leading
his team to win the all-Japan championship in October.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that more than 20 countries sent 37 rescue teams
to take part in the rescue work after the earthquake, adding that
their actions are the embodiment of love and good-Samaritan deeds and
he has the deepest admiration for them.</P>
      <P>Lien said that love transcends national borders, adding that
Taiwan has sent rescue teams to Central and South America, Asia
and Pacific and African countries.</P>
      <P>"We are good neighbors in a global village," Lien said, adding
that he led a team to Central America to help with sanitation, medical
and health care work after the region was ravaged by hurricane Mitch
last year.</P>
      <P>Oh echoed Lien's words by saying that international cooperation
is important, and that such actions will help resolve many problems.
He said he felt sad about the heavy causalities following the Sept.
21 earthquake, which killed more than 2,400 people, adding that Japan
is very concerned about the quake.</P>
      <P>The owner of the Daiei Hawks had earlier donated 1 million
Japanese yen for quake relief.</P>
      <P>Oh, who arrived here last Wednesday for a weeklong stay, was
accompanied by Chao Li-yun, chairperson of the National Council

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MAY SHIFT ITS DIPLOMATIC POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is considering putting a halt to
spending huge sums of money on winning over Taipei's diplomatic
allies, the Hong Kong Standard reported today.</P>
      <P>Through such a truce, the mainland hopes to warm relations across
the straits, paving the way for the resumption of dialogue with
Taiwan, said the sources, adding that this largely depends on
Taipei's response.</P>
      <P>"In other words, if the ruling Kuomintang refuses to stop paying
huge amounts of money under the auspices of aid to lure mainland
diplomatic allies, Beijing will have to fight back", the report
quoted the same sources as saying.</P>
      <P>"On the other hand, Beijing has discovered that more work is
needed in strengthening relations with leading countries which exert
substantial influence in international affairs, such as the US,
Japan, and members of the European Union."</P>
      <P>According to the report, Beijing believes that its decades-long
policy of focusing on improving ties with these key nations rather
than the smaller, poorer nations works well.</P>
      <P>"Certainly, Beijing could not refuse to talk to nations who
wanted to switch recognition from Taipei to Beijing based on
non-economic motivations, such as the widely anticipated
formalization of diplomatic ties between Beijing and the Vatican,"
noted the report.</P>
      <P>"For Beijing, forging diplomatic relations with the Holy See is,
above all, an issue of religion and social stability that has little
to do with any intent to isolate Taiwan," it said.</P>
      <P>Besides, the report revealed that when the timing is good next
year, Beijing hopes to resume the suspended talks between Wang Daohan
of the semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits and his Taiwan counterpart Koo Chen-fu, head of the Taipei's
Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S NEW MISSILE BASE IN ZHANGZHOU POSES NO THREAT TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
on Tuesday that mainland China's new missile base in Zhangzhou in its
southeastern province of Fujian is not expected to pose a substantive
threat to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Quoting military intelligence reports, MND spokesman Gen. Kung
Fan-ding said mainland China will mainly deploy its indigenous Hungqi
(Redflag) No. 2 surface-to-air missiles and Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles at the new base.</P>
      <P>According to Kung, the S-300 missile has a range of 90 km, while
the mainland-made Hungqi No. 2 has a range of about 30 km.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times reported on Dec. 22 that a US spy satellite
had detected in late November that mainland China was constructing an
air-defense missile base in Zhangzhou, which is located opposite
Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>US intelligence officers further said the base is scheduled to be
inaugurated in the coming spring. However, they added that they still
could not ascertain which types of missiles will be deployed there.</P>
      <P>Noting that Zhangzhou is one of mainland China's most important
air bases, Kung said the mainland air force has long deployed J-8 jet
fighters for reconnaissance missions at the Zhangzhou base. In recent
years, Kung said, the mainland military has also deployed 24
fighter-bombers and six J-7 jet fighters at Zhangzhou.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Kung said the MND has concluded that the
main purpose of the new missile base is to better protect the
existing Zhangzhou facilities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW QUOTAS ON US IMPORTED LIVESTOCK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will continue to allow the import of
livestock from the United States next year before it enters the World
Trade Organization (WTO), a Council of Agriculture (COA) official
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to secure WTO entry, Taiwan agreed to
allow a "down payment system," under which the import of 10,000 tons
of chicken, 5,000 tons of pork belly, and 7,500 tons each of pork and
beef offal would be permitted from June 1, 1998.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Ling Shiang-nung said the quotas for the United
States, as well as similar global quotas for WTO members other than
the United States, will stand next year.</P>
      <P>The COA announced on May 13 this year that it would give WTO
members other than the United States accumulated quotas of 9,163 tons
of chicken and 1,160 tons of pork belly to further facilitate its
efforts to join the world trade regulatory organization.</P>
      <P>The COA promised that the implementation of the global quota will
last until the end of the year, when it will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Ling noted that the total quotas are equal to the amount Taiwan
promises to open its market to other countries in its first year of
WTO membership.</P>
      <P>Ling said that the quota system actually allows domestic industry
to face the pressure of international competition earlier so that
they have the opportunity to make the adjustments needed to cope with
WTO membership.</P>
      <P>He also said that if the system is scrapped suddenly, and imports
shrink, it will also throw the local livestock industry into
disarray.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said
on Tuesday that the government hopes to step up exchanges and
dialogues with mainland China based on equality and mutual respect.</P>
      <P>He also said that both sides could discuss any issues, including
political issues, so that two sides across the Taiwan Strait can
develop a constructive relationship.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks during a report to the members of the
Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, who were making
their annual rounds of the government agencies.</P>
      <P>Siew reported on the major tasks of his Cabinet over the past
year, including the restructuring of the government, or the
downsizing of the provincial government.</P>
      <P>He also described the Cabinet's efforts to overcome the Asian
financial storm, noting that the nation has shed the influence of the
regional financial storm since the second quarter of this year, with
a dramatic increase in exports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in the first eight months totaled US$78.1
billion, up 7 percent from the same period of last year, the best
performance among the four Asian dragons.</P>
      <P>Export orders in August totaled US$10.95 billion, up 9.73 percent
from the same period of last year, or the sixth consecutive month
orders have topped US$10 billion, making it the prime mover behind
the country's economic growth, Siew said.</P>
      <P>The government is also doing its best to improve social order,
and has engaged in campaigns to crack down on gangsters, guns, drugs
and robberies, and bringing down the number of reported criminal
cases in the first 10 months from the corresponding period of last
year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government is also dedicated to caring for
children, teenagers, women, aboriginal people, the elderly, laborers,
farmers and fishermen, low-income households, the disabled, and
residents of Taiwan's offshore islands, Siew said.</P>
      <P>The premier said the government plans to earmark NT$157 billion
over the next five years to promote educational reform.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the government will pursue peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait, but will step up national defense to
ensure the survival of the nation and actively promote diplomatic
relations.</P>
      <P>He said that the government has made its top priority respecting
historical facts and ensuring the continued existence of the nation
and the welfare of the people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan renamed its representative office in
Macau to serve the interests of both Taiwan, Macau and mainland
China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On the first day of Macau's Taipei Trade and Tourism Office
operations under its new name of Taipei Economic and Cultural Center,
Macau, Su told a group of legislators that the renaming has upgraded
the office to the level of a visa-issuing center in the former
Portuguese enclave.</P>
      <P>From now on, Su said, foreigners, mainland Chinese and residents
of Macau will be able to apply to the renamed office for travel
documents to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As for Taipei's representative to Macau William Li, who has been
reprimanded for covering the office's nameplate before Macau was
handed over to Beijing on Sept. 19, he will remain in his job because
of his familiarity with the situation in Macau and his good
connections with the people there.</P>
      <P>Li was recalled by Taipei to explain his decision to cover the
plate, a move which was criticized at home as self-demeaning for the
sake of wooing the Macau authorities.</P>
      <P>Macau had asked Taipei to change the name of the office and play
down its official overtones before Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>Su also called on Beijing to shift away from its advocacy of the
"one country, two systems" formula as a way of reunifying with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing a candidate who came out in favor of the formula during
Taiwan's 1998 legislative elections and got only about 1,000 votes,
Su said "one country two systems" is totally unacceptable to the
Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Beijing's adherence to the formula will only further alienate the
Taiwan people, said Su.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC FIND CORRUPTION, GANG-LINKED POLITICS MOST DISGUSTING: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One in four people in Taiwan has complained
that rampant official corruption and gang-linked politics have made
them feel ashamed or unable to take pride in living in Taiwan,
according to the results of an opinion poll released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,112 adults conducted by the CommonWealth
magazine between Dec. 9 and Dec. 14, found that nearly 25 percent of
those interviewed cited "money- and gang-linked politics" as Taiwan's
most serious drawback that makes them feel ashamed to live on the
island.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that the majority of the respondents
feel the government's most urgent tasks are to crack down on
organized crime and improve public order.</P>
      <P>This is the first time since 1996 that the monthly business
magazine's annual state-of-the-nation survey has found that
improvement of public order has replaced educational reforms or
economic development as the thing that members of the general public
most want the government to tackle immediately.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the results, the magazine said many local people feel
that Taiwan's public order has worsened over the past four years.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, the magazine said, many people are worrying about the
phenomenon whereby criminal ring members manage to win seats in
law-making bodies at national or local levels and then abuse their
status to gain windfalls or illegal profits.</P>
      <P>Quoting the poll results, the magazine said many local people
fret that the situation might have distorted the direction of
Taiwan's political development.</P>
      <P>One of the most adverse impacts on local society of "money- and
gang-linked politics" is the widening of the gap between the rich and
the poor, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>About 60 percent of the respondents cited "money- and gang-linked
politics" as the No. 1 reason behind the widening wealth gap in local
society. Other reasons mentioned by those interviewed included stock
speculation, unfair taxation policy and land speculation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 68.5 percent said the president and Cabinet members
should be held responsible for the widening wealth gap, and 60
percent said legislators and county and city councilors should also
be blamed.</P>
      <P>Asked to name their top expectation of the new millennium, many
respondents said "a safe, secure living environment" is their most
fervent hope.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that public order, personal/family
livelihood, and political stability are the respondents' top three
concerns.</P>
      <P>The survey results further show that local people are more
concerned about domestic reforms than diplomatic affairs and
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The government's eight most urgent tasks as cited by the
respondents are: cracking down on organized crime; improving
educational quality; beefing up economic strength; upgrading
administrative efficiency; wiping out corruption; strengthening
defense capabilities; improving cross-strait relations; and enhancing
international status, in that order.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, more than 60 percent said they do not think that the
country's existing judicial system is fair and just enough to
safeguard social justice.</P>

win the contract from the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) to
build Taiwan's first high-speed railway, industrial sources said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>THSRC officials announced that the corporation has decided to
give up plans to cooperate with the Eurotrain Consortium to build the
high-speed railway system, choosing instead Shinkansen as the "first
priority for negotiation."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC) will be given priority
consideration for the building of core systems of the multi-billion
dollar bullet train, including carriages, locomotives, power supply
and overhead container systems, transmission systems, signals and
telecommunications systems, according to THSRC General Manager Liu
Kuo-chih.</P>
      <P>TSC is a business consortium of leading Japanese firms including
Mitsui &amp; Co., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries
and Toshiba Corp. The consortium has become more aggressive since
last year as a rival to compete with Eurotrain for the project.</P>
      <P>Liu said the decision to give up Eurotrain was made solely out of
consideration of business clauses and technical assessments, and he
denied that the change was the result of any political influence.</P>
      <P>Upon hearing of the THSRC decision to seek partners other than
Eurotrain, Ambroise Cariou, vice president of Eurotrain's Taiwan
high-speed rail project, said the news took him by surprise and that
he is deeply disappointed with the development.</P>
      <P>Cariou noted that Eurotrain has been working with THSRC for three
years on the project, and said that THSRC has done a u-turn by opting
for Shinkansen.</P>
      <P>However, he took the blow like a gentleman, saying that Eurotrain
respects any decision that is made by THSRC.</P>
      <P>Announcing that the TSC is now considered the first priority for
negotiation, Liu said the TSC has demonstrated greater flexibility in
coping with schedules of land development and construction of the
railway and depots. TSC also promised after-sales service commitment,
and the telecommunications systems to be installed on the high-speed
rail system will better cope with THSRC demands, he added.</P>
      <P>Liu added that choosing the first priority for negotiation does
not necessarily mean that the decision is final. A formal contract
will not be signed until certain important business clauses and
technical details are settled and mutually recognized, he said.</P>
      <P>New rounds of negotiations between THSRC and TSC are expected to
begin in mid-January, Lin said, adding that if the negotiations do
not mature into formal agreement in a few months, THSRC will turn to
the "second priority" for talks.</P>
      <P>Trains traveling on the envisaged high-speed railway will operate
at a maximum speed of 300 kilometers per hour and will shuttle
passengers from Taipei to Kaohsiung in 90 minutes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA URGED TO CONTROL NUMBER OF FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of aboriginal legislators on
Tuesday urged the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to
pay attention to the squeezing out of aboriginal workers from the
local job market by foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Yang Jen-fu, a ruling Kuomintang legislator elected from
aboriginal communities on plains, said the number of legally
imported foreign laborers has increased steadily since incumbent CLA
Chairman Chan Hou-sheng assumed the top labor administrative post on
Feb. 5, 1998.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Yang said, the jobless rate of aborigines has
continued rising to record highs.</P>
      <P>By the end of this year, Yang said, the number of legally
imported foreign workers will approach 300,000, while the aboriginal
unemployment rate will reach 7.55 percent, up 3 percent from the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>This year's aboriginal jobless rate will also more than double
the nation's average unemployment rate of 3.22 percent, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks during a meeting with CLA Vice Chairman
Wang San-chung, Aboriginal Affairs Commission Vice Chairman Chung
Fu-shanand several other aboriginal legislators.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, another aboriginal legislator,
Lin Cheng-er said the aboriginal workers' average working day has
declined from 20 days a month to only 12 days.</P>
      <P>"The unemployment issue among aborigines has become very
serious," Lin warned, adding that if the number of illegal foreign
workers is taken into consideration, the total number of foreign
nationals in the domestic job market should reach about 600,000.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lin said it has become increasingly
difficult for aboriginal youths to land jobs.</P>
      <P>Lin blamed the CLA for failing to control the number of
blue-collar foreign laborers and the kinds of enterprises to be
allowed to recruit foreign workers.</P>

      <P>Four practitioners of Falun Gong in
Dalian city in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning have
recently been sent to labor camps for reeducation after they posted
on the internet pictures and stories about police mistreatment of

      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights

college girl student, was detained by police for 15 days in September
for practicing Falun Gong in public. She was forced to walk with

Falun Gong even in the detention center.</P>
      <P>After her release, she posted on the internet pictures of her
ankles which were injured during her detention, as well as stories
of her sad experience in the detention center. The pictures were

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Tuesday called
on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to promote exchanges on the
basis of mutual benefit, peace, equity, and rationality, saying both
sides care about the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lien said there is no reason that Taiwan and mainland China
should threaten each other with military force. He reiterated that
Taiwan will not seek independence, but "will never accept Beijing's
description of Taipei as a local government of mainland China."</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks in a meeting with
representatives of the Kinmen Women's Association.</P>
      <P>Speaking of efforts to develop the front-line island stronghold,
Lien recalled that in his former tenure as premier which began in
1993, he launched a 10-project construction program with a total
value of NT$5 billion (US$158.73 million) on the island, which was in
1992 released from military administration.</P>
      <P>In July, the central government expanded Kinmen's development
plan and injected another NT$19.56 billion, Lien noted, adding that
the offshore island has sacrificed its urban development for Taiwan's
safety for nearly fifty years.</P>
      <P>Now, as the hostility fades in the face of the promotion of
mutual cross-strait understanding, the government should start
repaying Kinmen, Lien said.</P>
      <P>Building Kinmen into the most beautiful ocean-surrounded park in
the Taiwan Strait region should be "our joint prospect and a goal to

      <P>Pressure to drive down the new Taiwan

      <P>The NT dollar closed at 31.052 against the US unit at the Taipei

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Suao-based Taiwanese fishing boat "Hsin
Hung Hsiang No. 1" has been missing for 10 days since it disappeared
Dec. 18 after sailing to Xiamen to pick up mainland Chinese fishermen
to work on board, sources from the Council of Agriculture (COA) said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The last time "Hsin Hung Hsiang No. 1" was heard from was on the
evening of Dec. 18, a couple of hours after it picked up the 36
mainland workers and was on its way back home via the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The location of the fishing boat, with its four Taiwanese crew
members and 36 mainland workers, was roughly 60 nautical miles west
of the offshore island of Penghu when last heard from, according to
officials from the COA's Fisheries Department.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Taiwanese owners of the fishing
boat said they do not know the whereabouts of the boat and that they
hope relevant government agencies will assist in tracing the location
of the boat.</P>
      <P>However, the families of the four Taiwanese crewmen, including
skipper Chen Ke-ming and head mechanic Chen Yao-kun, on Wednesday
expressed their anger toward the boat owners.</P>
      <P>They condemned the boat owners for lying, saying that they were
informed on Tuesday by families of the mainland fishermen that the
"Hsin Hung Hsiang No. 1" capsized in the Taiwan Strait on Dec. 18 and
all the people on board were killed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, COA officials said they wrote a formal letter to the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on Wednesday, asking the
Taipei-based intermediary body to contact its Beijing counterpart,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), for
concerted efforts in finding the missing fishing boat.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS, both quasi-official organizations, were authorized
by their respective governments to handle civilian exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait in the absence of formal contacts.</P>
      <P>Fishing sources in Penghu said the disappearance of the "Hsin
Hung Hsiang No. 1" is surrounded in mystery, noting that if the
fishing boat did sink, remains of the wreckage or related debris
should have been found floating on nearby surface waters. But Penghu
fishing boats so far haven't found anything up to Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The fishing sources said the boat may have been confiscated by
the mainland's public security authorities or may have been hijacked
by unknown vessels.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL FACE 5 CRISES IN 21ST CENTURY: PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will face five crises in the 21st
century, independent presidential candidate Hsu Hsin-liang warned on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu, a former chairman of the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who quit the party in May to run in the 2000
presidential election, told a news conference that the first crisis
Taiwan will face is a military conflict across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
very likely to engage in a full-blown military confrontation in the
new millennium because of their failure to conduct rational, peaceful
dialogue, plus irresponsible political provocation," Hsu explained.</P>
      <P>The second crisis, he went on, will be the loss of many
traditional industries because of economic globalization.</P>
      <P>Hsu predicted that many of Taiwan's traditional industries, which
have little global competitiveness, will be edged out following the
island's entry into the World Trade Organization, a Geneva-based
world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>"The demise of such traditional industries will not only bring
economic problems but may also trigger a series of social problems
due to decreased job opportunities and a rising unemployment rate,"
Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Third, Hsu said, Taiwan will face a crisis of ethnic conflict.
According to Hsu, Taiwan originally had no ethnic hatred problems.
However, he said Taiwan's three major political parties -- the
ruling Kuomintang, the pro-independence DPP and the
pro-unification New Party -- have been formed along an ethnic bias.</P>
      <P>"Ethnic sentiment has repeatedly been stirred up in every 
political
election of the past decade," Hsu said, adding that he believes the
same will happen in the presidential election scheduled for March 18,
2000.</P>
      <P>"Unless we manage to form a new political party based on a wide
social spectrum, the potential ethnic conflict crisis cannot be
resolved," Hsu claimed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fourth crisis, he continued, lies in the fact that news
stories will come to overshadow local people's everyday lives.</P>
      <P>"News should have a shelf life of only one day. However, in
Taiwan, all people live their lives guided by news stories," Hsu
lamented, adding that most of Taiwan's active political figures lack
a genuine, lasting concern for the island's sustainable well-being
and development.</P>
      <P>The fifth crisis Taiwan will face lies in the loss of national
identity and values. "Except for ethnic identification, there are
many other values-related issues worth considering. However,
politicization of ethnic issues has left little room for local people
to think about other values-related subjects," he noted.</P>
      <P>In fact, Hsu said, the root cause of the first three crises lies
in ethnic hatred, which he said mainly results from major local
political parties' irresponsible abuse of ethnic sentiment as an
electoral campaign tactic.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China Minister of
Education Lin Ching-jiang died on Wednesday of respiratory failure at
the age of 60.</P>
      <P>Lin assumed the post of education minister in February 1998, but
resigned in June the following year due to deteriorating health after
doctors discovered that he was suffering from a brain tumor.</P>
      <P>Last October, Lin checked in to a local hospital to undergo
surgery after the tumor began to affect the movement of his right
leg.</P>
      <P>Lin, born in 1940 in central Taiwan's Yunlin County, graduated
from National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) and had a doctoral
degree from Britain's University of Liverpool.</P>
      <P>Before his resignation, Lin had been a NTNU professor, president

Provincial Department of Education, president of National Chung Cheng

to abolish the yearly high school entrance examination by the 2001

    <HEADLINE>1999 ANOTHER BANNER YEAR FOR HSINCHU SCIENCE-BASED PARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park, home to many of Taiwan's most successful high-tech
companies, witnessed another banner year in 1999, park administration
sources said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The park's total production is expected to top NT$600 billion
(US$18.99 billion) in 1999, up a whopping 50 percent over last year's
NT$400 billion, said park administrator Huang Wen-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu park, a collection of 290 high-tech factories that
have been an engine of Taiwan's economic growth for 15 years, stunned
the world this year by remaining relatively unscathed by an
islandwide power blackout on July 29 and the devastating
7.3-magnitude earthquake that struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21,
Huang noted.</P>
      <P>He quoted park tallies as showing that business turnover at the
park totaled NT$507.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year
with a workforce of 79,000 persons.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the annual turnover will break the NT$600
billion mark for the whole of 1999, with the workforce increasing to
80,000 people.</P>
      <P>With investment in the Hsinchu companies continuing to expand,
the park's overall production is expected to grow by between 25
percent and 30 percent to reach NT$780 billion in the year 2000, with
the workforce growing to 85,000 persons.</P>
      <P>Huang said he is confident that the park's business will continue
to pick up steam next year. Meanwhile, he added, efforts will be made
to develop the park into a "town of culture" as well, beginning with
efforts to conserve the environment and improve neighborhood
relations.</P>

      <P>Despite the huge amount of money spent
and the enormous advanced efforts made on fixing any potential
millennium bug problems, Australia remains nervous about clearing the
Y2K hurdle as it will be one of the first countries to enter the new
year, according to the National Coordination Center (NCC).</P>

playing down any suggestions of an emergency.</P>
      <P>"I think we'll get there, but I'd be lying if I didn't say
there's a bit of anxiety around," he told reporters on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Businesses, state governments and federal agencies will report
any Y2K problems to the NCC, which will then pass the information on
to Campbell who will inform the public and react accordingly.</P>
      <P>Campbell is expected to spend much of the time from December 31

      <P>Japan and Tokyo remain the favorite foreign
country and city visited by Taiwan tourists, according to the results
of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>In addition to Japan, New Zealand was named on the list of the
top ten most popular countries for the first time, while
Singapore, Kyoto, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Paris, Vancouver, Venice
and New York were among the leading ten most popular cities, the
poll conducted by tourist magazine To Go found.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Japan and Tokyo were polled as the best
foreign country and city ever visited by Taiwan people, Western
countries and cities made up more than half of the top ten spots on
the two lists.</P>
      <P>While Canada was selected as the country which most tourists from
Taiwan want to visit, Paris was the city named as most popular
destination, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The United States was cited as the most popular country among
Taiwan people for short-term study visits, while the Maldives was the
most often-mentioned island for a dream vacation, followed by Bali,
Guam, Tahiti, Palau and Phuket.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hawaii, Venice, Paris, Bali, and Hamilton,
Australia were the leading five most popular honeymoon destinations
for Taiwan people, the poll indicated.</P>
      <P>In terms of travel budget, only 9.7 percent of the respondents
said they would earmark NT$100,000 (about US$3,180) or more for
travel each year, while less than 50 percent travel as part of

      <P>The United States has assured the Republic
of China that the US-made F-16 jet fighters it has bought will not be
affected by the Y2K bug, an air force official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The United States has issued a Y2K-compliance certificate for
our F-16 fighters," said Chien Chien-chun, political warfare division
chief at the Chiayi air base in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force has taken delivery of more than 100 of an order
of 150 F-16s from the United States as part of its arsenal
modernization plan. As four of the planes have crashed in less than
two years, concern has been mounting as to whether the advanced
fighters are prepared for millennium bug-related problems.</P>
      <P>In an apparent effort to allay these public misgivings, Chien
said the air force has made full preparations to counter any possible
millennium bug glitch during the rollover into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>"All of our F-16s have undergone intensive Y2K testing," Chien
said, adding that the Y2K testing also covers all air force logistic
support services.</P>
      <P>Chien further said the air force is confident that its F-16s will
be able to cope well with any Y2K problems. "We firmly believe that
our air defense safety dragnet will not be affected by any millennium
bug glitches."</P>
      <P>Even if computer systems break down, Chien said the air force
personnel have practiced manual operation of all related systems.</P>
      <P>Still, he went on, air force authorities have decided to reduce
training flights during the Y2K high-risk period from Dec. 31 through

    <TEXT>
      <P>Business insolvencies in Australia are
expected to drop in calendar 1999, but will surge by the year 2000
thanks to the introduction of a 10 percent goods and services tax
(GST), to be implemented on July 1 of next year, according to the

first nine months of 1999, compared to 6410 over the same period a
year earlier.</P>
      <P>But Australian accountants believe the GST will likely be a
catalyst for increased business insolvencies because companies must
pay the tax before they can claim credits for the 10 percent tax on
their inputs.</P>
      <P>They expect an increase in company failures in the new year, with
a peak in the second half of 2000.</P>
      <P>"There will be general uncertainty arising from the unknown

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Australian athlete appointed to the
International Olympic Committee this month has called for anti-doping
rules to be updated before the Olympic Games in Sydney begin next
September.</P>
      <P>Olympic gold medalist speed-skater Johann Olav Koss, said the
list of banned drugs in the new anti-doping code should be revised
"absolutely in time for Sydney," the Australian reported on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He questioned the inclusion of some medical drugs on the list and
suggested that an alternative list of banned substances be drawn up
for use in out-of-competition doping tests.</P>
      <P>He proposed that the review be given priority by the World
Anti-doping Agency (WADA) at a meeting in Switzerland on January 13.</P>
      <P>"I believe there are certain drugs which have been shown to be
helpful in medical treatment but are not performance-enhancing," said
Koss, questioning whether these should be included on the
banned-substance list.</P>
      <P>The new Olympic anti-doping code, to come into force on the first
of January, provides for million-dollar fines for athletes found to
be using performance-enhancing drugs. The code fines first-time
offenders up to US$100,000 and suspends them from competition for at
least two years, although the sports federation can shorten the
suspension in exceptional circumstances, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Repeat cheats can be fined up to US$1 million with a life-time
suspension under the new code.</P>
      <P>But Koss said the Olympic code still gives sports federations
discretionary powers to test or punish athletes for using banned
drugs in the lead-up to the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>"Now, the list of (banned) substance depends on the federation.
For one federation marijuana is not on the list, but for another it
is," he pointed out.</P>

      <P>THSRC, which was contracted to build and operate the railway,
will begin negotiations in January with Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium
on the NT$95 billion (US$3 billion) contract to provide the island
with electric locomotives and rail cars, as well as the electric
system to run the trains.</P>
      <P>If the negotiations with Shinkansen, which are expected to
conclude by the end of January, were to fall through, its European
rival would automatically fill Shinkansen's place as the alternative
bidder, said the THSRC official.</P>
      <P>Eurotrain, which is led by Germany's Siemens and France's Alstom,
was initially selected as the "preferred bidder" for the project two
years ago, but Shinkansen bent over backwards to win the project and
sweetened its offer by providing soft loans with money from the
Japanese government.</P>
      <P>Once the contract for the rail system's machinery and electrical
equipment is concluded, Shinkansen will begin to build the system,
and construction of the railway will start in the first quarter of
next year, said the official.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's high speed railway is scheduled to become operational in
October 2005, but the system should be ready for a test run two years
before it begins operations.</P>

      <P>A college student arrested for designing

      <P>Chen Ying-hau, a student at the Ta-Tung Institute of Technology,
was arrested after police found he had allegedly designed the
computer virus and purposely transmitted the virus to many computers
around the world.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei prosecutors' office investigation found that
Chen did not spread the virus deliberately, and determined not to

      <P>Chen, who is currently working in Wahoo's headquarters in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A passenger on a luxury liner tour was
reported missing after taking part in a four-day tour to Okinawa,
Japan, police said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Police said Chou Tzu-ming, 34, and his wife, Liang Yu-feng,
boarded the Star Cruises Co.'s Aquarius liner in Keelung, northern
Taiwan, on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liang reported to police that around 11 p.m. Tuesday, her husband
told her that he wanted to go to the casino on the ship. But as of 8
a.m. Wednesday, she had not seen her husband again.</P>
      <P>After the cruise ship docked at Keelung Harbor at 3 p.m.
Wednesday, and all passengers had disembarked, Chou was nowhere to be
seen. "I am very worried about my husband's safety," Liang said.</P>
      <P>Police at Keelung Harbor boarded the ship to search for clues as
to whether Chou had fallen overboard or disappeared for some other
reason.</P>
      <P>An official from a local Star Cruises agent said the company will
work closely with police to try to discover Chou's whereabouts.</P>
      <P>This is the second case this year involving the disappearance of
a passenger of Star Cruises, which is owned by a Malaysian business
group but headquartered in Singapore.</P>
      <P>In mid-September, Taipei resident Lin Tze-huang, 30, was reported
missing from aboard another Star Cruises liner on his way home from a
five-day voyage through waters around Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Lin's family had solicited assistance from the government.
However, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said that
of all Star Cruises-owned liners, it only has regulation to govern

    <HEADLINE>US PROMISES NOT TO EXCLUDE ROC FROM TMD PROJECT: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative to the United States
Stephen Chen said on Wednesday that the Clinton administration has
promised not to exclude the Republic of China from the US-proposed
theater missile defense (TMD) system.</P>
      <P>Chen, who returned to Taipei earlier this week for home
consultations, made the statement in a report to the Legislative
Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>The ROC's de facto ambassador to the United States said senior
officials from both sides have exchanged views on TMD-related
issues.</P>
      <P>"In addition to expressing our interest in participating in the
TMD project, we have also told American officials that our Ministry
of National Defense is carefully evaluating whether to take part in
the project," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As the project is still in the planning stage, Chen said the ROC
has asked the Clinton administration not to hastily deny Taiwan's
access to the TMD.</P>
      <P>Noting that the US executive branch has adopted an open-minded
attitude toward the project at the moment, Chen said it has promised
not to rule out the possibility of Taiwan's participation at this
stage.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said the United States absolutely does not
want to see the outbreak of a military confrontation in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"The United States hopes to maintain prosperity and development
in the Taiwan Strait and entire Asia-Pacific regions, and this is why
it has repeatedly stressed its stance on peaceful solution to
cross-strait issues," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>The career diplomat pointed out that the US State Department,
Pentagon and even President Bill Clinton have on many
occasions expressed grave concern about mainland China's mounting
missile threat to Taiwan and its construction of new missile bases
along its southeastern coast in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the US administration's strong reaction to
Beijing's intensified military buildup fully reflects the
great importance it has attached to peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Clinton administration announced its decision
in late July to sell US$550 million worth of spare parts for F-16
jet fighters and E2T early warning aircraft to Taiwan, Chen
said the US government has not changed its security commitment to
the ROC after President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait relations
as a "special state-to-state relationship" on July 9.</P>
      <P>However, Chen admitted that it is difficult to upgrade
substantive ties between Taipei and Washington before the
inauguration of a new US president in January 2001.</P>
      <P>With a view to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait, Chen said the United States now adopts a strategy of
"de-politicizing security issues."</P>
      <P>Under this strategy, Chen said the United States is not expected
to adopt steps detrimental to cross-strait stability when it comes
to arms sales issues.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen went on: "From the US viewpoint, the ROC
government's failure to consult with the United States before
unveiling its 'special state-to-state relationship' theory has
affected mutual trust."</P>
      <P>Chen further predicted that the US executive branch may impose
some hurdles to its working relationship with the ROC's
representative office in Washington, D.C. because of the "special
state-to-state" theory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANILA COURT ISSUES HABEAS CORPUS WRIT FOR TAIWANESE-AMERICAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Dec.  29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Manila Regional Trial Court (MRTC) on
Tuesday granted a request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus
for a Taiwanese-American businesswoman who is protesting her
continued detention at the Bureau of Immigration.</P>
      <P>The issuance of the writ was ordered by Presiding Judge Vicente
A. Hidalgo of MRTC Branch 37 after hearing the petition of Mary Yen,
who was arrested Sept. 23 for allegedly trying to escort two aliens
out of the country.</P>
      <P>She was arrested by immigration agents at the Ninoy Aquino
International Airport while waiting for her flight to Vancouver,
Canada.</P>
      <P>The Dec. 28 writ required that Yen be brought before the court
for the purpose of determining the legality of her detention.</P>
      <P>The case against her was ordered dismissed by Judge Francisco
Mendiola of the Pasay City Regional Trial Court on Nov. 25. However,
she remained detained for alleged failure to pay an administrative
fine of 500,000 pesos.</P>
      <P>Yen appealed to President Estrada and the Bureau of Immigration
for a reduction of the fine to 50,000 pesos.</P>
      <P>After considering the status of her case, however, Yen announced
through her counsel, Ricardo Juan Jr., that she will not pay the fine
because the case has been ordered dismissed by the court.</P>
      <P>Juan added that because of the court's order to dismiss her case,
there is no legal basis for the imposition of the fine or her
continued detention.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei caught Washington off guard last
summer by claiming to have "special state-to-state" ties with Beijing
without consulting the United States in advance, said Taipei's envoy
to Washington on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in the United States, told the Legislative Yuan
that the trust between Taipei and Washington was damaged despite
Taipei's efforts afterward to limit the impact of its claims.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui stated in July that relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should be characterized as a "special
state-to-state" relationship.</P>
      <P>In addition to the anticipated fierce criticism from Beijing, the
remark, designed to foil Beijing's claims of sovereignty over Taiwan,
got the cold shoulder from Washington, which expressed its veiled
disapproval by reiterating its adherence to the "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>As a result, the envoy cautioned, Washington might curtail arms
sales to Taiwan somewhat in the future, but, he believes, not to the
extent that it would tilt the military balance across the Taiwan
Strait, which the United States has taken pains to maintain.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is in Taipei on a routine visit, met with President Lee
Teng-hui on Monday and is slated to return to his Washington office

      <P>The official noted that FEMA has set up 28 urban search and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said on
Wednesday that it will consider filing a lawsuit against independent
presidential candidate James Soong charging him with embezzling party
funds.</P>
      <P>The KMT Central Standing Committee heard and discussed an
investigative report on Soong's suspicious accounts at Chung Hsing
Bills Finance Corp. during Wednesday's regular meeting.</P>
      <P>The report noted that Soong had removed millions of dollars of
KMT money through the accounts of his son and his relatives and was
suspected of forgery, breach of trust and misappropriation of funds.</P>
      <P>The KMT said it will consult with attorneys and bring the case to
the courts.</P>
      <P>Soong reiterated Tuesday night that he has not embezzled a single
penny of KMT funds although he had been authorized by KMT Chairman
Lee Teng-hui to manage a large sum of money when he was KMT
secretary-general.</P>
      <P>He stated that the secret fund was to be used to take care of the
family members of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo and to finance
other special party assignments at the direction of Lee.</P>
      <P>The former Taiwan governor had assigned New Party Legislator
Hsieh Chi-ta to check all transactions relating to the money since
1991.</P>
      <P>Hsieh defended Soong on Tuesday night, saying that her
investigation of his accounts had indicated no wrongdoing in handling
the money.</P>
      <P>But Lee branded Soong "a thief," "a big liar" and "shameless" on
Wednesday when he commented on Soong's explanations regarding the
questionable accounts.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lee, other prominent KMT figures directed their
criticism against Soong. They included KMT Secretary-General Huang
Kun-huei, former KMT Secretary-General Hsu Shui-teh, former Vice
Premier Hsu Li-teh, and Lee's close aide Su Chih-cheng.</P>
      <P>Public opinion surveys showed that among the major presidential
candidates, Soong continues to take lead in support ratings, but his
rating had fallen several notches since the issue of party funds was
raised weeks ago. But the approval rating of KMT presidential nominee
Lien Chan has not benefited much from the incident.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday issued
four administrative directives, in the hope that his Cabinet will
lead Taiwan to achieve the targeted 6.1 percent economic growth rate
in 2000.</P>
      <P>Siew gave the instructions after hearing a report on the island's
economic situation at the Executive Yuan's last plenary session for
1999. The report was delivered by P.K. Chiang, chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Chiang indicated that Taiwan's foreign trade continued its
double-digit growth in November, with exports amounting to US$11.55
billion, up 11 percent from that period one year ago. The figure
marked a record single-month high in the island's history.</P>
      <P>November imports were posted at US$10.11 billion, up 14.5 percent
from the same month last year, Chiang reported, noting that imports
of mechanical products saw 31.8 percent growth in November,
reflecting that the private sector is gearing up for increased
investment activity.</P>
      <P>Chiang added that in the first half month of this month, Taiwan's
imports registered 17.4 percent growth.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Siew said all 1999 economic indices are
reflecting economic development greater than that of last year,
thanks to the strong and solid economic fundamentals that the island
now enjoys.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan was hit hard on Sept. 21 by the magnitude 7.4
earthquake, which killed some 4,000 people and left thousands injured
and homeless, it nevertheless registered economic growth of 5.5
percent for the year, one of the highest figures among Asian
countries, the premier said.</P>
      <P>However, the figure does not mean that everything is OK regarding
Taiwan's economic development, Siew warned, saying that declining tax
revenues and surging crude oil prices in the international market are
affecting the island.</P>
      <P>Unemployment and continuing recession in some sectors, such as
the residential building sector, are also potential challenges for
Taiwan's economic development, Siew added.</P>
      <P>To maintain a prosperous economy, the premier said that official
efforts in the coming year should focus on four areas:</P>
      <P>-- completing post-quake rehabilitation work: the government
should make a comprehensive effort to implement an NT$80 billion
(US$2.54 billion) reconstruction budget, and ensure that the work
will improve economic development;</P>
      <P>-- preparing for the possible impact of Taiwan entering the World
Trade Organization;</P>
      <P>-- encouraging the on-time completion of important private
investment projects, such as the high-speed rail system;</P>
      <P>-- and strengthening the overall economy, as well as overhauling
the domestic financial market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BANK SEES ROSY ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN NEW MILLENNIUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's economies are generally headed
for a revival in the new millennium as an acceleration in overseas
activity offsets a cooling in the red-hot American economy, reported
a Canadian bank on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Bank of Nova Scotia, in its latest Global Economic Outlook,
said Asia will bounce back, the situation in Europe is already
looking up and even Latin America's prospects seem good.</P>
      <P>Asia is reviving, led by an impressive economic rebound in Korea,
continuing momentum in mainland China and recovery in Japan, the
outlook report said.</P>
      <P>In the US, the bank said interest rate hikes by the Federal
Reserve will slow the economy. However, its analysts believe
consumers and businesses will stay in a spending mood, contributing
to solid gross domestic product growth of 3.3 percent in 2000 and 3.0
percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>"Since more than half of Canada's private sector activity is
geared to exports, buoyant conditions in the United States and abroad
will be good news for Canada through 2001," said Warren Jestin,
Scotiabank's chief economist.</P>
      <P>He forecast the Canadian GDP will grow 3.7 percent in 2000 and
3.2 percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>The global revival will kindle inflationary pressures, Jestin
noted. That will result in rate hikes in the US of 50-75 basis points
by late summer 2000, he added.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A director at Taiwan's de facto embassy
in Australia has defended the sovereignty of the Republic of China
and clearly stated Taiwan is not a colony like Hong Kong and Macau
and is therefore not interested in the "one country, two systems"
formula being offered by Beijing.</P>
      <P>In a letter sent to the Australian Financial Review, Pong,
director of the Information Division of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Sydney, mentioned that both Vice President Lien
Chan and presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian have said that Taiwan
is a sovereign state and not a colony.</P>
      <P>He cited the arrest of 13 street theater actors in Macau as an
example on how Beijing authorities are treating the people of the
former Portuguese colony.</P>
      <P>"Can you imagine that 13 players of street theater staged outside
St. Paul's Church (in Macau) were arrested just because one of the
players wore a Jiang mask?" Chang asked.</P>
      <P>He mentioned that the people of Taiwan not only can select their
leader through popular election, but also have an independent
judicial system.</P>
      <P>"Who can expect Taiwan to return to a totalitarian regime and to
let its people live as colonial citizens?" he asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN SUPPORT FOR OLYMPIC GAMES HITS RECORD LOW DUE TO SCANDALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian support for the year 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney has hit a record low thanks to a series of
scandals, including the preferential sale of premium tickets to the
rich at inflated prices, according to a new survey by the Australian.</P>
      <P>The daily's survey showed that only 37 percent of the people
interviewed expressed their support for the Olympic Games, compared
to 51 percent in a survey earlier this year and 58 percent in a
similar survey last year.</P>
      <P>The same survey shows 62 percent of Australians are no longer
interested in supporting the Olympics, compared to 49 percent in
early 1999 and 42 percent in 1998.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Lee Naylor, chair of the Athlete's Commission
for Track and Field, as saying that it was frustrating that the job
of promoting the Games was not being done properly.</P>
      <P>"It's the ticketing, it's just everything. It's definitely an
indicator that the SOCOG isn't doing the job it should be doing. The
survey is just amazing. I guess it's a case of enough is enough.
People are being so disheartened by everything and I don't blame
them," she said.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Organizing Commission for Olympic Games (SOCOG) was
hit first by scandal last year when one of its senior officials was
involved in accepting expensive gifts and trips to the US and other
countries. Then this year, organizers came under attack by the public
for selling tickets to the rich at high prices for major events,
including the opening and closing ceremonies.</P>
      <P>"There's no doubt the Olympics today, compared to five or 10
years ago, doesn't enjoy the same pristine standing in the community.
It's become related to big business and big politics," said Mara Bun,
public affairs manager of the Australian Consumer Association.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SENDS 25 CHINESE ILLEGALS HOME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has deported 25 Chinese illegal
immigrants to southern China, but 3000 other illegals from other
Asian countries and the Middle East remain in detention centers, 
causing headaches for Canberra.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock told reporters on Wednesday
that 23 of the 25 Chinese citizens landed on Christmas Island in
November and the other two breached visa conditions.</P>
      <P>The surge in illegal arrivals to Australia from China and several
Middle Eastern countries is the result of an increase in human
smuggling operations in China, Indonesia and elsewhere, Australian
immigration officials said.</P>
      <P>Ruddock is set to go to Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey to
directly ask those governments to help Australia stop smuggling
operations, making him the first senior Australian official to resort
to such a strategy.</P>
      <P>The Australian government is worried that more illegals are
expected to attempt entry into the country in the coming weeks or

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS SOONG'S RATING DECLINING OVER 'MYSTERY FUNDS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   30   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a series of
Gallup polls show that independent presidential candidate James
Soong's support rating has declined steadily since the outbreak of
controversy over his finances.</P>
      <P>According to Wednesday's Gallup poll, Soong's support
rating dropped to a new low of 21.7 percent from a high of 35.5
percent recorded in a similar Nov. 11 survey.</P>
      <P>Gallup Taiwan Co., commissioned by Sanlih Entertainment
Television, began to conduct a series of 2000 presidential
election-related public opinion surveys on Sept. 29.</P>
      <P>Poll results find that Soong's popularity has shown a downward
trend after reaching a peak in the Nov. 11 survey. His support
rating was 33.1 percent in the Nov. 16 Gallup poll, 28 percent in
the Dec. 10 survey, 23.6 percent in the Dec. 15 poll and 22.1
percent in the Dec. 23 survey.</P>
      <P>In contrast, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
candidate Chen Shui-bian's support rating has risen mildly since
Soong's finances drew skepticism in early December.</P>
      <P>Chen's rating in the first Gallup poll was 16.9 percent and rose
to 24.3 percent in Wednesday's survey, making him the most popular
of the three key presidential contestants.</P>
      <P>In the same series of surveys, ruling Kuomintang presidential
candidate Lien Chan's support rating has hovered in a narrow range,
with the number edging down to 10.41 percent in the latest Gallup
poll from 10.5 percent in the Sept. 29 poll.
 Another noteworthy trend is that the percentage of swing voters
has climbed steadily since the exposure of huge "mystery funds" in
the Soong son's account at the Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corporation
(CHBFC). In the Dec. 10 survey, 28 percent of those interviewed said
they have not yet made a decision on their choice, and the ratio
surged to 32.4 percent in the Wednesday poll.</P>
      <P>Survey results also show that Lien continues to take the lead in
terms of the odds to win the 2000 presidential election, with the
percentage of those who believed in Lien's final electoral success
picking up from 30.3 percent in the Nov. 16 poll to 33.3 percent in
the latest survey.</P>
      <P>During the same period, the number of people who bet on Soong's
victory has fallen from 34 percent to 14.3 percent, while the
number of those who bet on Chen's win has edged up modestly from 9.1
percent to 14.8 percent.</P>
      <P>A total of 998 adult residents responded to Wednesday's Gallup
poll.</P>
      <P>Survey results released on Thursday show that 31.9 percent of
those interviewed do not buy Soong's lengthy explanations of
financial transactions in his relatives' accounts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42.4 percent said they think that the acrimonious,
pungent mutual criticisms between the ruling Kuomintang and the Soong
camp would have negative effects on Taiwan's democratic development.
Soong, a former KMT powerhouse and Taiwan governor, was expelled from
the party for his insistence on running in the 2000 presidential
election as an independent.</P>
      <P>The same poll also found that 68 percent of the respondents
support the enactment of a law requiring candidates in political
elections to report their assets.</P>
      <P>Asked about their opinions concerning President and KMT Chairman
Lee Teng-hui's criticism of Soong as a "shameless liar and thief"
for alleged financial dishonesty over the CHBFC case, 50.9 percent
said they disagree with Lee's criticism. Only 17.3 percent said
they back Lee's criticism and 31.8 percent said they have no opinion
about Lee's remarks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BANK ACCOUNT BALANCE SURGES TENFOLD ALLEGEDLY DUE TO Y2K BUG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec.  30  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Allegations of a Y2K bug attack on a
Taiwan bank emerged one day before the rollover to the year 2000, as
one Taichung resident found her bank account had swelled tenfold when
she checked her account balance on Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Fearing effects of the Y2K bug, Chang Ching-yi used an automatic
teller machine (ATM) at Chung Hwa Commercial Bank's Taichung branch
to check the balance of her account at the Bank of Taiwan (BOT).
Surprised to find a balance of over NT$860,000 -- more than 10 times
the anticipated NT$80,000 -- she checked again an hour later, only to
find the same result.</P>
      <P>Chang inquired at both banks about the mistaken balance, in order
to find out which bank was affected by the Y2K bug, she said.</P>
      <P>In response to Chang's case, Vice General Manager of Chung Hwa
Commercial Bank Chang Sung-o clarified that the situation has nothing
to do with the Y2K bug, as the overall balance of Chang's current and
time-deposit accounts totals NT$860,000.</P>
      <P>The bank manager reiterated that there is absolutely no problem
with Chung Hwa's ATM, and stated that the customer's confusion has
nothing to do with the Y2K bug, speculating that she must have
forgotten that she has two accounts or that she was overly nervous
about potential Y2K problems.</P>
      <P>According to the Chung Hwa official, if an account holder uses
certain ATM functions to check an account balance, all of the
customer's account balances will be summed up and printed out as one
total figure.</P>
      <P>He further stated that no technical problems or malfunctions have
occurred with Chung Hwa ATM machines, as no other account holders
have reported having the same problem.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Bank of Taiwan claimed that the inflated balance
simply resulted from a printing error by the ATM machine and would
have no effect on Chang's actual account balance.

West Pacific island state, told a hastily called press conference
that a communique declaring diplomatic ties had been signed at
Palau's capital, Koror, earlier the day.</P>
      <P>The minister said official ties with Palau have been developing
for many years, as the ROC signed a technological cooperation pact
with Palau in 1984, and sent an agriculture mission to Palau in 1985.</P>
      <P>In the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic
relations, the two sides agreed to exchange embassies in Koror and
Taipei at "an appropriate time."</P>
      <P>Palau, with a total land area of 487 square kilometers and a
population of 18,000, becomes the ROC's 29th diplomatic ally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO MEMBERSHIP TO AFFECT TAIWAN'S RICE OUTPUT: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 80,000 hectares of farmland in Taiwan
may be left to lie fallow over the next six years, Council of
Agriculture (COA) Chairman Ling Shiang-nung said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Due to the government's farm land liberalization policy and
Taiwan's impending membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Ling said Taiwan's cropland will gradually be fully released for
other uses in the future.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has promised to open up its farm produce market after
joining the WTO, Ling said the local agricultural sector, and in
particular the rice industry, will be hard-hit.</P>
      <P>He added that COA has compiled a report focusing on the reduction
of land given over to rice, which is Taiwan's No. 1 crop, with a
total of 360,000-hectares given over to paddy.</P>
      <P>According to Ling, more than 140,000 metric tons of imported rice
will be allowed to enter Taiwan under the island's terms for joining
the WTO, a move which may initially affect NT$3.4 billion (US$109.7
million)-worth of rice production on 32,000 hectares, along with the
livelihoods of about 800,000 farmers.</P>
      <P>Since rice production will eventually come to a halt on as much
as 80,000 hectares, the COA head stressed that it is very important
for the government to help affected farmers to find other crops to
grow.</P>
      <P>In line with the COA's program to reduce local rice output, Ling
claimed that his council will assist rice farmers in developing
"refined agriculture with domestic characteristics."</P>

      <P>Independent presidential candidate James
Soong on Thursday entrusted an attorney to return more than NT$240
million (NT$7.5 million) to the ruling Kuomintang and to terminate
his commission relationship with KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>In the past few weeks, the KMT has charged Soong with embezzling

party secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Soong has reiterated that the party funds he deposited in
accounts belonging to his son and his sister-in-law at Chung Hsing
Bills Finance were authorized by Lee to pay for care for the family
of late President Chiang Ching-kuo and for helping to finance
"special political assignments" on Lee's instruction.</P>

matters, and openly criticized Soong as "shameless" and "a liar."</P>
      <P>Soong on Thursday asked his attorney, Huang Tung-hsiung, to end
his commission relationship with Lee and to return the balance of the
party funds, a sum amounting to NT$247.9 million.</P>
      <P>The attorney said that he will try to establish written contact
with Lee, but added that he would consider other methods if that one
fails to bring a response.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong said during a campaign tour of Miaoli in central
Taiwan that he and his running mate Chang Chao-hsiung will not
withdraw from the presidential race, scotching rumors that he was to
abort his bid to win the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>He stated that he has never embezzled "a single penny" during his

    <HEADLINE>NTU HOSPITAL COMPLETES LIVER TRANSPLANT FOR 9-MONTH BABY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Taiwan University (NTU)
Hospital announced on Thursday it has successfully completed a liver
transplant for a nine-month baby girl using a liver segment donated
by the baby's mother.</P>
      <P>The 5.5-kilogram baby, nicknamed Hsuan-hsuan, is the lightest and
youngest liver transplant recipient that the hospital has ever
treated, said NTU Hospital President Lee Yuan-teh.</P>
      <P>"The surgery was conducted on Dec. 6 and the baby has since been
in stable condition," said Dr. Lee Po-huang, head of the medical team
which performed the transplant.</P>
      <P>The announcement was made while the hospital held a party to
celebrate the success of the surgery and the baby's "re-birth."</P>
      <P>Lee said Hsuan-hsuan had suffered from a disease known as biliary
atria (BA). "She underwent surgery when she was two months old, but
it failed to improve her health," he said.</P>
      <P>In the past, Lee said, a child BA patient usually had to wait
until he or she was 10 kg in weight to receive a liver transplant.
"However, as Hsuan-hsuan's condition was very serious, we decided to
take a risk and give her a ray of hope," the doctor said.</P>
      <P>"The biggest challenge in performing the surgery lay in the
thinness of Hsuan-hsuan's blood vessels," Lee said, adding that
another hurdle is the intensive care required after the surgery to
protect the baby from complications. He also noted that Japan's Kyoto
University once unsuccessfully performed a liver transplant for a 3.5
kg baby.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the incidence rate of BA is high among Asian
people, but the cause of the disease remains unknown.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, child BA patients are usually given liver segments
donated by their mothers, as was the case with Hsuan-hsuan's mother.
"Hsuan-hsuan's mother has been recovering well," Lee said, pointing
out that humans can theoretically survive the loss of as much as 80
percent of their liver, as the organ can regenerate itself.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY BARRACKS RECONSTRUCTION PLAN LAUNCHED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's military barracks
reconstruction plan got underway on Thursday as part of its efforts
to improve the quality of life of its armed forces.</P>
      <P>Gen. Tang Yao-ming, chief of the General Staff, presided over
a ground-breaking ceremony for the Kaoshanting military barracks
reconstruction project in Yangmei, Taoyuan County, some 40
kilometers south of Taipei, in the morning.</P>
      <P>It was the first barracks reconstruction and refurbishment
project under a newly formed military barracks reconstruction fund.</P>
      <P>Tang said the barracks reconstruction project is part of the
country's trans-century military buildup plan. "In addition to
arsenal modernization and organizational restructuring, we'll also
improve the living environment and quality of all servicemen," he
noted.</P>
      <P>As weaponry modernization and organizational restructuring need
huge funds, Tang said the Cabinet has arrpoved a Ministry of
National Defense (MND) proposal to establish a special fund to
finance the military barracks renewal project.</P>
      <P>"The reconstruction fund will mainly rely on money raised from
sales of idled or unsuitable military barracks," Tang said, adding
that due to urban development, some military barracks in downtown
areas will be relocated to suburban or rural areas under the
reconstruction plan.</P>
      <P>Many of the existing barracks were constructed by
military servicemen in the 1950s. Most of them were poorly
equipped and had limited living spaces. Moreover, many of them
are now in a dreadful state of dilapidation. Some county governments
have often pushed the military to relocate barracks to make way
for major economic development projects.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the MND has drawn up an overall
blueprint for military barracks reconstruction.</P>
      <P>According to an MND estimate, the reconstruction plan will call
for a total outlay of NT$130 billion and is scheduled to be
completed by 2017.</P>
      <P>In fact, the MND said a total of 80 army barracks have been
reconstructed or refurbished since 1981, and 22 other barracks are
now under reconstruction. There are still 70 barracks to be
relocated or renovated in the next two decades.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION WON'T DRASTICALLY CHANGE ROC'S FOREIGN POLICY SAYS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei will not change its current basic
foreign policy no matter who is elected as the Republic of China's
next president in March 2000, Foreign Affairs Minister Chen Chien-jen
said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end news conference, Chen said the
government's present foreign policy, arrived at after many
adjustments since 1949, is the best one for ROC nationals. Although
each presidential candidate has a different viewpoint on foreign
affairs, he stressed that the foreign ministry will not rashly change
its current policy so as to avoid risks.</P>
      <P>Turning to speculation that President Lee Teng-hui may visit
Japan in October next year after stepping down from his current post,
Chen said the president will be a private citizen by then and will be
able to choose on his own where he wants to go. However, he added
that his ministry will advise Lee based on the principle of national
interest due to the sensitive nature of his position as the nation's
former head of state.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Taiwan's prospects for joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Chen expressed the belief that Taiwan will be
granted membership in the world trade regulatory body soon after
mainland China gains entry, noting that the mainland already reached
a bilateral agreement on its WTO membership with the United States on
November 15.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister also stressed that his ministry will further
step up its efforts to take part in non-governmental activities in
the international community. Currently, Taiwan is a member of 962
non-governmental organizations, he noted.</P>
      <P>Looking back over the past year, Chen pointed to the forging of
diplomatic ties with Macedonia in January and the establishment of
such links with Palau just 24 hours ago to demonstrate that the ROC
government is still willing to set up formal relations with friendly
countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Regarding the resumption of aviation talks with South Korea and
the Philippines, the foreign minister emphasized that Taipei will
reopen such talks with Seoul and Manila, respectively, as long as the
negotiations are mutually-beneficial and reciprocal.</P>

      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
said on Friday that his ministry will advocate an investment-oriented
policy to further sharpen the competitiveness of Taiwan's industrial
sector.</P>
      <P>Although the government will not take the lead in pushing for
mergers among enterprises, Wang said it has worked out laws to
provide tax incentives to encourage business mergers as part of an
effort to create an unfettered investment climate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Industrial Development Bureau,
the economics minister disclosed that 182 investment projects, each
worth at least NT$200 million, will be accomplished in 2000, with the
overall investment amount totaling NT$482.7 billion (US$15.33
billion).</P>
      <P>As the Taiwan economy has gradually recovered from the Asian
financial crisis which broke out more than two years ago, Wang

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE STOCK MARKET TO KEEP BOOMING IN EARLY 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian stock market closed to a
record high on the eve of the new millennium and economists on Friday
predicted that it will rise further in January thanks to bullish
sentiments amid strong economic growth in Australia and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index rose 11.4 points to close at 3152.5 on
Thursday, topping the previous record high of 3145.4 set in April of
this year. The close at the end of last year was 2813.4.</P>
      <P>Brokers attributed the rise to a wave of Australian retailers
cashing in on strong gains on Walls Street and other major markets.
The gains however were limited by cautious investment by major
Australian institutions.</P>
      <P>"Many Australian investors remained cautious in their investment,
compared to the aggressive and bullish campaign by American
investors," one broker said.</P>
      <P>The index only added 12.1 percent for the year, which was below
the percentage gains set on the Wall Street and many other markets
around the world, particularly the record-breaking gains in the Dow
Jones, economists said.</P>
      <P>The year 1999 witnessed a flood of 141 new listings, including
the government-owned telecommunications giant Telstra Inc. Many new
Internet firms were the biggest winners with their stock prices
increasing two to four times as a result of a flood of investment by
Australian institutions as well as individuals, they said.</P>
      <P>"It has been the year of the new economy with technology stocks
the strongest performers over the past 12 months," said Greg
Matthews, chief investment officer at Macquarie Investment Management
in Sydney.</P>
      <P>The year also witnessed Australian share market capitalization
soaring to A$652 (nearly US$435) billion by the end of 1999 from
A$536 (over US$357) billion. Trading records were also smashed during
the year, including the highest single day trading volume when shares
worth A$6.98 (over US$4.59) billion changed hands on June 22.</P>
      <P>1999 was the best year ever for many Australian stockbrokers, who
scored the most ever transactions and handsome profits, according to
Australian stock broking industry sources.</P>
      <P>The number of transactions skyrocketed 51.3 percent to 10.2
million from 6.7 million last year, while the average daily volume
surged 20 percent to A$1.21 billion (US$807 million) from A$1.02
billion (US$680 million).</P>
      <P>The public floating of the second tranche of Telstra shares
pushed Australia to the world's highest ranking in terms of the
number of stock investors, taking the lead from the United States.</P>
      <P>The Telstra shares brought the total number of stock investors to
over 45 percent of Australia's 19 million population. Economists
believe more people are expected to jump on the bandwagon in the
coming weeks and months of the new millennium because of the higher
earnings to be had than from bank interest rates or property markets.</P>
      <P>Salomon Smith Barney predicts that the Australian stock market
index could peak at 3250 in the first quarter of 2000 and then come
under pressure by inching inflationary increases and bank interest
rate hikes.</P>
      <P>Australia's gross domestic product is expected to grow by more
than 4 percent during the current fiscal year, which ends June 30,
2000, with an unemployment rate of below 7 percent and a low
inflation rate of about 2-2.5 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange's (TSE) new year
resolution is to invite more qualified firms to apply for their
company's stocks to be listed in a bid to expand the scale of
Taiwan's stock market, TSE officials said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The TSE's goal is to bring the number of listed companies from
the current level of 463 to over 500, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The TSE listing department, which regularly makes predictions on
the coming year's business, has in recent years attempted to enlarge
the scale of the local bourse and reach international standards by
keenly interviewing companies issuing shares and encouraging them to
apply to have their shares listed.</P>
      <P>Fifty firms applied to be listed on the stock market last year,
while 43 handed in their application this year, according to TSE
figures. Based on the number of applications submitted during these
two years, the TSE listing department set a goal of 40 new listed
companies for next year.</P>
      <P>The TSE figures showed that 33 of last year's 50 applications
were approved, with 14 of those firms coming from electronics-related
industries.</P>
      <P>A total number of 463 companies are presently listed on the
Taiwan stock market, surpassing the 395 companies listed on
Thailand's stock market, the 317 on Singapore's, and lagging behind
the 709 listed on South Korea's, the 694 on Hong Kong's and the 1907
companies listed on Japan's stock market.</P>
