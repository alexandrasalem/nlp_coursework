    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTORS REMAIN CONFIDENT IN MALAYSIA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the financial crisis that
recently swept through Southeast Asia, Taiwan businessmen in Malaysia
remain confident of the economic prospects in that country, Chen
Kun-huang, president of Taiwan Business Association in Malaysia, said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that as of 1996, Taiwan businessmen had invested US$8
billion in the country, second only to the Japanese among foreign
investors in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>He said that most of the more than 2,000 Taiwan firms in Malaysia
are manufacturers of electronics and electric products for export,
and that they have largely been unscathed by the financial crisis.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan businessmen remain confident in Malaysia's
economic prospects. They are not considering a withdrawal of their
investments, and some are actually planning to expand operations,
especially since their export products have become more competitive
after the devaluation of the Malaysian currency.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taiwan investment in Malaysia has slowed in the
past two years. A total of US$310 million in new investments was
pumped in last year, while the figure for the first eight months of
1997 was only US$200 million.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that most of the new investments have centered
in the high-technology field, rather than in labor-intensive
industries as in the past.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE'S APPROVAL RATING DROPS TO NEW LOW: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, who concurrently
serves as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), has seen his
approval rating plummet to a record low of 39 percent following the
KMT's latest election rout, according to a poll conducted by the
United Daily News (UDN).</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 889 adults taken on Nov. 30 also found that
the percentage of respondents dissatisfied with Lee's performance
jumped to an all-time high of 46 percent, outpacing his support rate
by 7 percent.</P>
      <P>Lee's popularity rate peaked at 75 percent in December 1996 and
fell to the previous low of 47 percent in May this year when popular
former Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou resigned from his post as a
minister-without-portfolio. Lee's average approval rating in the 22
UDN polls conducted during the past one and half years was 58
percent.</P>
      <P>The latest UDN survey showed that Premier Vincent Siew's approval
rating also declined to 52 percent from 60 percent recorded in a
similar poll conducted a month ago.</P>
      <P>Although the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won
big in the weekend nationwide mayoral and magistrate elections, its
political star Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who had campaigned
vigorously for DPP candidates, did not see a dramatic surge in his
popularity in the latest UDN opinion poll.</P>
      <P>Chen's approval rating remained at 61 percent, the same as that
registered in pre-election surveys. On the other hand, the number of
those dissatisfied with Chen's performance rose slightly to 19
percent from an average of 17 percent recorded in previous polls.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, up to 75 percent of the respondents to the Nov. 30
UDN survey acknowledged that Chen had contributed much to help DPP
candidates win in the elections; only 7 percent said Chen didn't make
any contribution to the DPP's landslide win; and 18 percent declined
to answer the question.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the respondents were divided over the
necessity to reshuffle the Cabinet following the local elections. The
proposal drew an equal number of opponents and proponents, both
accounting for 32 percent of the total; while 35 percent said they do
not have any opinion about the issue.</P>
      <P>If the Cabinet were to be reshuffled, 50 percent said DPP members
should be invited into the new Cabinet, but 20 percent objected to
that proposal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a China Times opinion survey, also conducted on Nov.
30, showed that 60 percent of the respondents were satisfied with
the outcome of the weekend elections.</P>
      <P>Most of those interviewed said they could accept the fact that
the pro-(Taiwan) independence DPP won the top executive posts in 12
cities and counties around the island, according to the China Times
telephone poll of 768 adult residents.</P>
      <P>About 60 percent attributed the KMT's unprecedented electoral
setback either to voter dissatisfaction with the poor performance of
incumbent KMT local government chiefs or to its intraparty squabbling
and disunity. Several incumbent KMT mayors or magistrates were
accused of having links with underworld gangs or of involvement in
corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Fifteen percent of the respondents said the KMT's failure to
nominate suitable or qualified candidates was to blame for its
embarrassing defeat; and about 7 percent said the KMT should improve
its campaign strategies.</P>
      <P>Although more than half of local governments will soon be
controlled by the opposition party, 25 percent of those interviewed
said they believe relations between the central and local governments
will improve in the future; 26 percent said there will be little
change; but 18 percent said they expect rifts between central and
local governments to worsen.</P>
      <P>As to the impact of the election results on future relations
across the Taiwan Strait, 34 percent said they don't think the DPP
victory will affect cross-strait ties; 15 percent forecast relations
between the two sides will deteriorate; while 13 percent said ties
between Taipei and Beijing will improve.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 33 percent of those interviewed said they are elated
by the DPP's big win in the local elections; 26 percent said they do
not have any special feelings about either the DPP win or the KMT
defeat; while 23 percent said they worry about Taiwan's political
development in the wake of the weekend polls.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENARY MEETING URGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of the major setback for the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in Saturday's mayor and county chief
elections, several members of the party's Central Committee have
called for an interim plenary meeting to examine the causes of the
defeat.</P>
      <P>Wei Yung, chairman of the Vanguard Found, and Lee Ching-an, a
Taipei City councilor, said in a seminar on Sunday that they will ask
party leaders to convene an interim plenary meeting of the Central
Committee as soon as possible and that they are planning to set up a
group to promote reforms within the party.</P>
      <P>Wei said a meeting should be held to forward the opinions of all
Central Committee members to ranking authorities, as the KMT's huge
loss in Saturday's elections represents a clear warning signal to the
party.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party scored victories
in 12 of the 23 cities and counties in the elections, nearly doubling
its current total of city mayor and county magistrate seats, while
the number held by the KMT dropped from 15 to eight.</P>
      <P>Wei went on to say that he had exchanged opinions with Lee and
they both agreed to submit a petition asking the party to look into
the roots of the crisis if their call goes unheeded by the party
leadership.</P>
      <P>Wei said it is important to hold a plenary Central Committee
meeting now at a time when the KMT is facing a challenge to reform
itself. He added that he will invite other committee members to set
up a panel devoted to revitalizing the party.</P>
      <P>The group, he pointed out, will focus on charting a new KMT
policy direction, adjusting intraparty mechanisms, studying the
party's election strategies and improving its effectiveness in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The political analyst said the KMT should seriously consider
implementing a system of primary elections to select party candidates
for electoral contests.</P>
      <P>For her part, Lee asked KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui to put forward
a timetable and an outline for the reforms and to call a Central
Committee meeting immediately in view of next year's legislative
elections and upcoming balloting for the mayors of Taipei and
Kaohsiung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE KILL DOGS AS RABIES SPREAD IN KALIMANTAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Nov.  30  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-Chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fear of rabies has prompted the Dayak
people in remote areas of West Kotawaringin regency of Pangkalan Bun,
Central Kalimantan, to kill their dogs despite their reliance on the
animals for years.</P>
      <P>Known locally as "kudu" dogs in the Dayak region -- which covers
Nanga Kalin, Namuah and Melata villages of Bulik subdistrict -- the
animals have been killed by the local people since October when
rabies began to spread in the area.</P>
      <P>The Dayak people, compared to other ethnic groups in Indonesia,
ironically treat their dogs highly and consider them to be part of
their families, going as far as sharing their beds with them.</P>
      <P>The Dayaks, however, have declared kudus as enemies lately out of
fear of the fatal rabies.</P>
      <P>Guntur, aged 50, who is a community leader of Melata village,
said his people were left with no choice but to kill the dogs they
see roaming the village.</P>
      <P>"We fear further disaster, so we decided to kill our dogs despite
our love for them," he was quoted by Antara news agency as saying,
adding that the decision was unanimously made by the community as
a last ditch attempt to protect themselves from rabies.</P>
      <P>"Our dogs have become wild and vicious. Their tails fold down
stiffly with their saliva foaming. They also hide in dark places
now," said Guntur.</P>
      <P>Apek, aged 33, however, expressed hope that local animal
institutions as well as the health office will extend help to the
people to calm their fears.</P>
      <P>He objected to the idea of killing the dogs.</P>
      <P>"Dogs have been useful to families. They help hunt wild boars for
food," he said.</P>
      <P>"My two dogs, which were killed recently, had brought me hundreds
of wild boars and other animals and help me feed my family," said
Apek.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE MEDIA SEES INCREASED CROSS-STRAIT TENSION AFTER DPP POLL WIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The overwhelming victory in Taiwan's local
elections by the Democratic Progressive Party is expected to bring
increased tension between Taipei and Beijing because of the DPP's
pro-independence views, according to leading Australian media
sources.</P>
      <P>In a five-column headline "KMT loss in polls may sting Beijing,"
mass-circulation newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported that
the shock triumph of the opposition party in Saturday's local
government polls is a blow to the ruling Kuomintang and a sign that
increased friction with Beijing may lie ahead</P>
      <P>The daily quoted political analysts as saying that the strong
support for the DPP would be closely monitored in Beijing. The
opposition party supports eventual independence for Taiwan although
its policy on ties with mainland China is generally vague.</P>
      <P>Many senior DPP officials openly advocate independence and
strongly dispute China's historical claim to sovereignty over the
island.</P>
      <P>Beijing has refused to rule out the use of force to rein in the
island if Taiwan declares independence.</P>
      <P>Another leading newspaper, The Australian, also devoted a
five-column article, headlined "Poll shock fuels Taiwan push for
statehood," in which the daily quoted DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang as
saying that: "As of today, the DPP has become a vital factor in
deciding Taiwan's political future that no country, including China,
can ignore."</P>
      <P>It also quoted DPP Secretary-General Chiu I-jen as vowing that
the opposition would push ahead with its plan to turn Taiwan into an
independent state.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Professor Andy Chang Wu-yueh, director of the
Institute for China Studies at Tamkang University, as saying that:
"Beijing will be worried that Taiwan's political map has been redrawn
in favor of the pro-independence DPP, but may also welcome the blow
to Lee's (Teng-hui) prestige and expect the KMT to offer a more
positive attitude toward China."</P>
      <P>In the mayoral elections on Nov. 29, the DPP won 12 of the 23
city and county executive posts, up from its previous six, while the
ruling Kuomintang won only eight posts, down from its previous 15.
Another three mayoral posts went to independent candidates.</P>
      <P>That means more than 70 percent of Taiwan's 22 million citizens
will be under DPP local administrations, according to Australian
media reports.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review, the leading business newspaper
in Australia, also reported that the DPP's "demolition of the
formerly invincible Kuomintang in local elections should ensure that
Taipei's charismatic Mayor Chen Shui-bian [will] ... become Taiwan's
first opposition president."</P>
      <P>"Such an electoral rout is a personal humiliation for the
president, Mr. Lee Teng-hui, who, along with other top government
heavyweights, such as Vice President Lien Chan and Provincial
Governor James Soong, campaigned strongly on behalf of Kuomintang
candidates," the daily reported from Taipei.</P>

      <P>The use of pesticides is increasing due to

      <P>In 1996, Saudi Arabia imported US$40.26 million worth of
pesticides compared to US$36.8 million in 1995. The increase in the

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Nov.  30  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The dispute settlement body of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) has decided to set a
panel to resolve a dispute between the United States and Japan over
trade in apples, trade officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The dispute settlement panel of the global trade referee will
begin a nine-month examination after the WTO picks its members, they
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The United States maintains that Japan's agricultural quarantine
system poses non-native barriers to US-grown apple imports, and
requested last month that the WTO form the panel of experts on the
matter.</P>
      <P>Japan imports two types of apples from the United States and
Washington has requested that the number be increased by five
varieties starting next January.</P>
      <P>Washington has argued that Japanese requirements for a check for
each variety of apples constitutes a nontariff barrier.</P>
      <P>Japan insists the quarantine system cannot be simplified, saying
the efficacy of the fumigation treatment of apples by US farmers
should be checked for each variety of apple.</P>
      <P>Japan says such checks are necessary to prevent pests that may be
in US-grown apples from proliferating in Japanese apple-growing
districts, trade officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS FRET OVER DPP VICTORY, WHILE BUSINESSMEN DON'T</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Professor Ma Chi-hua of National Chengchi
University sees the dismal failure of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and
the victory of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
the just-concluded local elections for heads of 23 cities and
counties as "disappointing."</P>
      <P>Ma said although he personally is not thrilled with the KMT's
recent performances, the outcome of the local contests is disastrous,
because at least the ruling party's platform does not advocate Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Conversely, the DPP has vowed to pursue the island's independence
from mainland China, a development Beijing has vowed to oppose by
force.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed fear that a domino effect may be triggered by the
Nov. 29 KMT collapse, heralding a DPP rise to power through next
year's legislative elections and the mayoral contests in Taipei and
Kaohsiung, as well as presidential polls still two years away.</P>
      <P>The KMT lost seven of its 15 seats in the local elections to the
DPP which grabbed 12 seats, up five from its showing in the last such
elections in 1993.</P>
      <P>Prof. Kuo Wu-ping, also from National Chengchi University (NCU),
who sees the onset of the "Yeltsin effect" in Taiwan, suggested that
KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui pay equal attention to revitalizing the KMT
and to carrying out national political reforms. Kuo said this would
prevent Lee from following the footsteps of Russia's President Boris
Yeltsin, who accomplished political reform in that country, but at
the cost of his party's and his own political future.</P>
      <P>Kao An-pang, an NCU professor in economics, said conflicts
between the central and local administrations over control of
government assets and distribution of financial resources will become
increasingly tense, which in turn will give rise to pressure for
legislation on resource allocations islandwide.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, most of the island's business leaders are playing a
different tune.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, said the DPP's victory in the local elections will have
little impact on the overall domestic investment climate.</P>
      <P>The contests for top offices in 23 cities and counties around the
country are not significant as the legislative and presidential
elections, he noted.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ming-chang, chairman of the Taipei CEO Association,
attributed the DPP's victory to its pluralistic nomination system, as
well as to the fact that it has downplayed the sensitive issue of
cross-strait relations, even though the party platform advocates
Taiwan's independence.</P>
      <P>If the victorious DPP candidates fail to keep their campaign
promises or prove unable to help improve their constituents' welfare,
they will be promptly booted from office, he said, adding: "The
voters are as sharp as a tack."</P>

      <P>The Cabinet will work out new measures to
provide for closer interaction between the central and local
governments in the wake of the weekend mayoral and magistrate
elections, a senior official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Interaction between levels of government has become a new focus

      <P>The Cabinet official said the DPP is still not the ruling party

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to dramatic political changes brought by
the outcome of local elections last week, the government is expected
to move forward the timing of a partial Cabinet reshuffle,
high-ranking Executive Yuan officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>They said the move is inevitable in view of the new political map
drawn after Saturday's islandwide polls for city and county chiefs.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang managed to hold on to only eight of the 23
posts up for grabs, while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
won 12 seats, and the remaining three went to independents.</P>
      <P>It is understood that Premier Vincent Siew, who kept most of the
previous Cabinet intact when he assumed the premiership on Sept. 1,
has already reviewed a plan for the new Cabinet composition. The
lineup will undergo "not a few" changes, and the new ministers are
expected to bring a fresh atmosphere to the central government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as KMT Secretary-General Wu Poh-hsiung has insisted
upon resigning to take the responsibility for the party's stunning
defeat in the elections, the KMT leadership will also undergo
changes.</P>
      <P>Siew has already exchanged views with President Lee Teng-hui,
Vice President Lien Chan and Wu on the extent of the Cabinet
reshuffle, and a preliminary consensus has been reached, the
high-ranking officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that after the KMT leadership positions have been
filled, the Executive Yuan will begin the partial Cabinet reshuffle,
the timing of which could come in "one or two weeks."</P>
      <P>As for the new faces in the Cabinet, the officials said that as
Siew attaches great importance on teamwork, the ideal ministers will
be individuals who are enthusiastic, noncontroversial. and able to
work well and coordinate with others, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They also said that to deal with the post-election political
situation as well as to prepare for legislative polls and the
balloting for Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors next year, the government
will not rule out recruiting more nonpartisan personnel. But inviting
DPP members to serve on the new Cabinet will be out of the question
for the time being for reasons of political pragmatism.</P>
      <P>Chan Chih-hsien, director-general of the Department of the Health
(DOH), is the only minister without party affiliation in the present

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TAIWAN UNCHANGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Wang Hsin-chung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's attitude toward Taiwan
regarding bilateral relations remains the same following the
resounding victory of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) in local mayor and county chief elections on Saturday, observed
officials of various mainland organizations relating to Taiwan
affairs.</P>
      <P>There are two central tenets in Beijing's attitude toward Taipei,
both of which remain unchanged, said deputy director of the Taiwan
Studies Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Yu Keli,
on Sunday: anticipating Taipei's response to the "eight principles"
of Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party; and
the concept that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should enter the
process of negotiation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The DPP's first major victory over the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
has created speculation as to whether Beijing will adjust its stance
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Now that the local elections have come to an end, Yu said, the
issue of how to make a breakthrough in relations, which is deemed a
most important issue by the Beijing authorities, might attract even
more attention in various circles.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed that while Beijing does not want political talks
alone, it feels that because protocol always gets obstructed by
political factors, political dialogue is "necessary" and "beneficial"
to the progress of protocol affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S COPYCAT STRATEGY BACKFIRES IN TAIWAN POLLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The blurring of party lines -- in which
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is widely seen as adopting the
platform of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -- has
been blamed for the KMT's massive defeat in local polls on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Singapore-based Straits Times on Monday quoted analysts as
reporting in a dispatch from Taipei that while the KMT officially
favors unification with mainland China, it has moved in recent years
towards a more centrist position of maintaining the status quo, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Taipei has rejected Beijing's offer for unification under its 
"one China" formula, maintaining that Taiwan and the mainland are now
under separate rule and that unification can only take place under
democratic conditions.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the DPP had been playing down its
pro-independence stance in recent elections in a bid to woo more
mainstream voters, saying that there is no need for Taiwan to declare
independence because the island already enjoys de facto independence,
the report said.</P>
      <P>The KMT is also seen to be cooperating with the DPP on some major
policies originally proposed by the DPP -- such as recent
constitutional reforms which allow for the dismantling of the Taiwan
Provincial Government, said Professor Hu Fu of the National Taiwan
University (NTU) political science department in an interview on
Saturday night after the poll results were announced.</P>
      <P>"Voters simply cannot differentiate their policies anymore," he
was quoted as commenting.</P>
      <P>The blurring of party lines had worked to the disadvantage of the
KMT at a time of widespread public dissatisfaction over its inability
to maintain law and order, prompting voters to elect the DPP's "fresh
faces" for a change, as Hu put it.</P>
      <P>Professor Lu Ya-li, also of NTU, noted during a seminar on Sunday
that Taiwan's urban population did not support the ruling party in
this election because of the law-and-order issue, the report said.</P>
      <P>"Chen Chin-hsing was the DPP's biggest campaign aide," he was
quoted as saying, referring to the major suspect in a high-profile
murder case who turned himself in last month after taking hostage a
South African diplomat's family.</P>
      <P>"In the end, he was caught not by the police, but rather, it was
he himself who wanted to be caught."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's influential local factions had also turned their backs
on the ruling party because they had been offended by the KMT's
crackdown on underworld figures linked to them, Hu said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some party members had felt alienated by the
central leadership's move to streamline the provincial
government, seeing it as a betrayal of party tradition, he said.</P>
      <P>The provincial dismantling became an issue that rekindled the
reunification-versus-independence debate in Taiwan as the move was
interpreted by some as tantamount to declaring that Taiwan was no
longer a province of China, the report said.</P>
      <P>NTU's Professor Chang Lin-cheng pointed out that the expected
provincial freeze had made the county and city head positions more
sought after than ever.</P>
      <P>A large number of maverick candidates standing without party
support had in effect reduced the KMT vote, the report also noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR DENIES HE'LL ORGANIZE `GREEN ALLIANCE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who has been
credited for helping his opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) win big in the weekend local elections, on Monday denied media
reports that he is to organize a "green alliance" of DPP mayors and
magistrates to confront the Kuomintang (KMT)-controlled central
government.</P>
      <P>The term "green" has been coined widely in Taiwan to indicate DPP
sympathies and refers to the green-and-white of the DPP's party
colors.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the outcome of the weekend mayoral and
county chief elections reflects the latest public opinion. "Although
our party won the top executive post in 12 cities and counties around
the island, we (local administrations) don't intend to besiege the
central government," he stressed.</P>
      <P>"Now is not the time to think about confrontation," Chen said,
adding that different levels of government should work hand-in-hand
for the well-being of all the people on the island.</P>
      <P>"City and county governments should support and coordinate with
the central government to carry out various community development and
welfare projects," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>As the central government will deal directly with city and county
governments following the "marginalization" of the Taiwan Provincial
Government late next year, Chen said the cabinet should start to
delegate more power to local governments.</P>
      <P>"Relations between levels of government should be adjusted and
the central government should allow local governments to have a
bigger say or authority in personnel, financial, educational and
police administration," the outspoken mayor said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, partisan considerations should be set aside
when handling central-local government relations. "Even where
different party affiliations exist, local and central government
officials should cooperate closely to boost overall national and
public interest."</P>
      <P>Chen further said local DPP government chiefs should not isolate
themselves from the central government, while the KMT-dominated
central government should not ignore or overlook the existence or
interests of DPP-administered constituencies.</P>
      <P>The DPP headquarters will meet with all newly elected DPP mayors
and county chiefs over the next few days to discuss joint
administrative strategies and working guidelines. Chen said he will
be more than willing to attend the meetings to share his three years
of experience in administering the Taipei municipal government.</P>
      <P>Until Saturday's resounding success, the DPP, with only six
cities and counties under its control, has concentrated more on
parliamentary politics at the central level than on local political
issues at the grassroots level.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has made no secret of his intention to seek reelection
in next year's mayoral election, said the DPP's latest electoral
victory is no guarantee of victory in the 1998 legislative elections,
the mayoral elections for Taipei and Kaohsiung municipalities, or for
the 2000 presidential elections. "The DPP should redouble its efforts
to reach out to the people and continue to exercise caution and
prudence in working out its strategies for those elections."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the dramatic plunge on the Taiwan stock market
following Saturday's election results, Chen said he believes the drop
was only the result of psychological factors. "The downward trend
will be short-lived. I don't think the DPP's win signals the advent
of a bear market here," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
said on Monday that his ministry will increase communication with
local government chiefs to boost economic development at local and
national levels.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed the belief that his ministry and local
governments, although cut from different political cloth, will be
able to work together toward this goal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
managed to win 12 out of 23 constituencies in Saturday's mayoral and
county chief elections, dramatically changing the nation's political
picture at the local level.</P>
      <P>Wang said it is normal in any democratic society for political
parties to experience election gains or losses, noting that
Saturday's elections are viewed by the international community as an
indication that democracy has truly come of age in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As one of the Economic Ministry's major tasks is to create a
healthy and stable investment climate for investors, Wang said his
ministry will further strengthen communication with the newly elected
local chiefs in the 12 DPP-controlled cities and counties to promote
national economic development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Finance Minister Paul Chiu, when questioned on the
impact of the DPP's stunning victory on the ministry's current
allocation of government expenditure and revenues, told local
newspapers that his ministry will continue to carry out its
operations in accordance with set ROC policy.</P>
      <P>He said that future allocation of revenues between the central
and local governments will be decided after the revision of the
current Law Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and
Expenditures is approved by the Legislative Yuan, adding that his
ministry will soon begin work on the revision.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the mass-circulation China Times reported on Monday
that the Ministry of the Interior will accelerate its pace in
drafting the Self-governance Law for Counties and Cities, as the
power of city mayors and county magistrates will be significantly
enhanced after the Taiwan Provincial Government is abolished.</P>
      <P>The proposed law will give city and county chiefs greater power
in personnel management, while local councils will have greater
legislative power, according to the newspaper.</P>

Rajani on Monday expressed his country's appreciation to the Republic
of China government for the dedication of a Taiwan agricultural
technical training center in rural Chiangmai as a gift marking the
50th anniversary of the coronation of Thailand's King Bhumibol

      <P>On behalf of his father the king, Bhisatej accepted the
dedication of the agro-tech center built by the ROC government which
he lauded as a token of friendship between the people of Taiwan and
Thailand.</P>
      <P>According to Dr. Sung-ching Hsieh, deputy secretary general of
the International Cooperation and Development Fund of the ROC, the
center, built at a cost of NT$10 million (US$312,500), is an
extension of a 27-year Taiwan commitment to Thailand to help turn
land formerly given over to opium cultivation into forestry and
orchards.</P>
      <P>The center, located at the heart of a 100-hectare farm tract in
Chiangmai's Fang District, is a white, European-style two-story
building with a meeting hall, a library, and dormitory facilities.
Members of the ROC agro-tech mission in northern Thailand and three
agricultural experts also reside in the center.</P>
      <P>The first training course offered by the center began on Monday
to 50 Thai attendants, including several university professors.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan agro-tech mission first came to Thailand in 1970 at
the invitation of King Bhumibol as part of a force designed to back

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO BOOST DEFENSE SPENDING DUE TO ASIAN UNCERTAINTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is expected to dramatically
boost its defense spending to upgrade its air and naval strike
capabilities to cope with the uncertainty in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Military sources disclosed that nearly A$6 billion would be spent
on new medium-range missiles and sensors for combat aircraft,
air-to-air refueling to increase the range of the F-111 aircraft and
FA-18 and airborne early warning and control aircraft to improve
surveillance and guidance in order to upgrade the combat readiness
for the Royal Australian Air Force.</P>
      <P>In addition, the spending would also cover extensive overhauls
and strike and self-defense upgrades of the naval fleet, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>They said the decision to strengthen maritime power comes amid
concerns by strategic planners that future conflicts may be more
demanding because of a growth in regional military power spurred by
stronger Asian economies.</P>
      <P>Australia's foreign policy white paper noted that on a table of
East Asian economies, Australia has gone from second to fourth place
in a decade and will slip to sixth in terms of military power by
2010.</P>
      <P>Currently, there is no apparent threat to Australia. But defense
planners are alarmed by the greater strategic unpredictability and
regional capabilities following military build-ups in the region.</P>
      <P>Military analysts said there is uncertainty in East Asia, with
the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea
remaining as possible flashpoints, although there has been a recent
easing of tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since
the 1996 missile shooting exercises by mainland China off Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>DPP-RULED CONSTITUENCIES WILL NOT CONFRONT CENTRAL GOVERNMENT: HSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will not use its clout at the local administration level to
confront the Kuomintang (KMT)-controlled central government, DPP
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"The DPP is unlikely to organize its mayors and magistrates to
confront the KMT-dominated central government because such action
would cause social anxiety or instability," Hsu stressed.</P>
      <P>The pro-(Taiwan) independence DPP won the top executive post in
12 of the 23 cities and counties up for grabs around the island in
Saturday's local mayoral and county chief elections, while the KMT
won only eight. The remaining three went to independent candidates.</P>
      <P>When the newly elected mayors and magistrates assume office on
Dec. 20, more than 70 percent of the Republic of China's 21.3 million
population will find themselves under the DPP's jurisdiction at the
local level. Against this new political backdrop, the future of
central-local government relations has come under intense scrutiny.</P>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to allay public misgiving, Hsu said the
DPP's efforts to win the control of local governments is absolutely
not to topple the KMT-controlled central government. "The voters cast
their ballots for our candidates, not in order to create social
instability but to create an efficient, caring new system of local
government," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Hsu further said major political parties should strengthen
consultations and cooperation to accelerate Taiwan's development in
various fields. "We'll compete with the KMT with better public policy
and welfare services. We don't want political confrontation."</P>
      <P>Hsu said the DPP hopes to negotiate with the KMT for delegating
more powers to local governments, particularly a greater say in
financial, personnel and police administration.</P>
      <P>Hsu said all DPP-ruled constituencies will give top priority to
educational reforms, improving social order and upgrading welfare
services.</P>
      <P>The DPP headquarters will also set up an anti-corruption
commission to investigate charges of corruption and any other
irregularity involving DPP local government chiefs, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that the DPP didn't have an anti-commerce
complex. "We'll come up with a white paper on our industrial
development policy in the near future to explain our plans for
promoting development of various industries in DPP-ruled
constituencies."</P>
      <P>Hsu went on to say that the DPP has consistently called for
development of peaceful, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relations
across the Taiwan Strait. "It's an erraneous perception that the
DPP's rise to power would strain cross-strait relations," Hsu said,
adding that if necessary, he is willing to visit mainland China.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party

victory the DPP scored in the just-concluded local elections.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen, director of the DPP's publicity department, said that
the dismal showing of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in the mayoral and

political and social instability.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's voting, the DPP took 12 of the 23 mayoral and
county seats up for grabs, putting 72 percent of Taiwan's population
under its jurisdiction. The KMT suffered a setback by obtaining only
eight seats. The remaining three seats went to independents.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the DPP understands stable political development is
crucial to the island's economy. He attributed the dramatic fall of
the local bourse Monday to short-term psychological factors caused by
his party's surprise victory as well as downward trends in
international stock markets.</P>
      <P>Hsu also denied that the DPP has an "anti-business" complex. The
DPP will soon host an economic meeting to which business leaders will
be invited to discuss the further development of Taiwan's economy in
various fields, he added.</P>
      <P>Relations between the central and local governments need to be
adjusted, especially with the marginalization of the Taiwan
Provincial Government, Hsu said, noting that how to allocate revenue
between the central and local governments is a question urgently
requiring a solution.</P>
      <P>Asked if the victory by the pro-independence DPP might heighten
tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Hsu responded by
saying that the DPP has always asserted that Taiwan should deal with
mainland China "reasonably and peacefully."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese businessmen in Manila and its
suburbs will close their businesses and schools all of Tuesday to
protest the recent killing of a Chinese-Filipino trader by suspected
kidnappers, police said Monday.</P>
      <P>Col. Avelino Razon, Manila's police chief, said the Chinese
community in Manila and nearby suburbs will hold a "day of mourning"
Tuesday to mark the funeral of Gordon Tan, a trader who was shot dead
Nov. 25 when he fought back against suspected kidnappers in the
northern province of Bulacan.</P>
      <P>The shop and school closures will be in protest against a spate
of kidnappings.</P>
      <P>"But Tan was not kidnapped in Manila," Razon complained,
stressing that kidnappings occur "not only in Manila."</P>
      <P>Razon, however, said he will deploy more policemen in the
Chinatowns in Binondo and Quiapo to deter kidnappers from abducting
rich Chinese businessmen and their scions.</P>
      <P>Police records show that between January and October 1997 there

      <P>To maintain oil price stability, it is

      <P>In a speech to participants at the 103rd Meeting of the

      <P>Suharto pointed out that even though OPEC is an organization of
oil-producing countries, it is unavoidable that due attention should
be paid to issues related to the environment. The oil technology
being used must be completely environment-oriented, he said.</P>
      <P>"I fully support the idea of developing an OPEC cooperation in
oil technology through the Petroleum Technological Cooperation

    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World oil prices will not plunge even
though the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
raised export quotas to 27.5 million barrels a day from 25.03 million
barrels, an expert said.</P>
      <P>"I do not think the price of oil will drop," Soebroto, a former
secretary general of OPEC, was quoted by the Antara news agency as
saying here Monday after a meeting between Indonesian President
Suharto and OPEC participants.</P>
      <P>The new quota, which will be effective from Jan. 1, 1998, is
still below the 28 million barrels a day of production during October
1997.</P>
      <P>In October, the price of oil ranged around US$20 a barrel.</P>
      <P>"If oil prices drop, OPEC will hold a special meeting and discuss
its oil production," he said.</P>
      <P>Large oil producers, he said, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates, will adhere to the new quota.</P>
      <P>The increase of OPEC's quota is an improvement for the
organization, Soebroto said, explaining, "OPEC will not cede the
increase in oil demand to non-OPEC producers."</P>
      <P>One consideration for setting up the new oil quota is to meet the
1.86 million barrels a day of increased demand in the world market.</P>
      <P>OPEC wants to be the leader in the oil market, he said.</P>
      <P>On the topic of Indonesia's quota of 1.46 million barrels a day,
Soebroto said that the country has the ability to fulfill it.</P>
      <P>"We can meet the quota and it is expected to help Indonesia in
overcoming the monetary crisis because it can (now) increase its oil
export," he said.</P>
      <P>Soebroto said that oil producing countries are still trying to
develop the technology for new oil products that would be friendlier
to the environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAILURE OF FINANCIAL TALKS COULD HURT MARKETS: WTO HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Renato Ruggiero, director-general of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO), said a failure of talks
to liberalize the global financial services industry by this month's
deadline could hurt international markets.</P>
      <P>"It will be something very damaging," Ruggiero said. "If we miss
this opportunity the markets will not appreciate it, and the reaction
of the market could be negative. And that is something we really
don't need."</P>
      <P>The WTO has set a Dec. 12 deadline for completion of the new
agreement. Yet, reeling from Asia's unfolding financial crisis,
several Asian countries are dragging their feet on new offers for
removing obstacles to trade in financial services.</P>
      <P>"I'm worried, really, because time is going on," Ruggiero said.
"We know that governments are working on offers, but the offers have
not yet arrived in Geneva. We are moving on, but we are not yet
there."</P>
      <P>The United States refused to join a stopgap accord reached two
years ago at the WTO, saying others were giving too little in return
for access to its financial services market, the largest in the

    <HEADLINE>ALTHOUGH DOWN AGAINST GREENBACK, NT DOLLAR SURGES IN REAL VALUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although down against the US dollar, the New
Taiwan dollar is surging in real terms even with the Asian financial
crisis continuing in the region, said renowned Japanese economist
Richard Koo.</P>
      <P>Koo, chief economist at the Japan-based Nomura Securities Co.,
said in an exclusive interview with CNA on Nov. 26 that the NT
dollar's devaluation against the greenback has to do with the US
dollar increasing in strength rather than the Taiwan currency
weakening.</P>
      <P>Given that the NT dollar fell relatively little against the
greenback compared to the declines of other major currencies around
the world, its value is actually growing, he said.</P>
      <P>Koo made the comments to CNA during a visit to Kaohsiung, where
he had been invited to deliver a speech on the economy to the local
Japanese community.</P>
      <P>He said he believes the depreciation will help Taiwan keep its
competitive edge against its Southeast Asian rivals, although he
noted the island exports a different level of products than countries
in that region.</P>
      <P>When the Thai baht crashed in July, this triggered financial
problems throughout Southeast Asia, largely because of the linkage
between the region's currencies and the yen, which has been in a
downward trend since 1985 because of the slack Japanese economy, he
said.</P>
      <P>Koo, however, said he sees no need for Hong Kong to cut the value
of its currency, which was rumored would give up its peg to the US
dollar amid the backdrop of a strengthening greenback.</P>
      <P>Although several Asian countries -- such as the Philippines,
Thailand and South Korea -- have called on the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to bail them out of their financial troubles, Koo
predicted the crisis will not go away anytime soon.</P>
      <P>He didn't back the initiatives by Taiwan and Japan to establish
an Asian fund to help states in the region ward off future economic
crises, saying Tokyo should use what, if any, extra funds it has to
address its own financial issues first, and that Taiwan, which is not
a member of the IMF and therefore would not be able to turn to it for
help, should set aside money for its own possible crisis.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the ruling Kuomintang met
Monday to discuss the causes of the party's surprising defeat in
Saturday's elections, in which it lost 7 of the 15 seats it had held
at the head of city and county governments.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu Poh-hsiung, who tendered his resignation
Saturday to assume responsibility for the party's poorest performance
ever in local elections, declared at the meeting that he will let his
successor decide on the avalanche of letters of resignation by
ranking party officials that hit his desk after Saturday's
vote-counts came in.</P>
      <P>Wu's resignation is expected to be approved Wednesday in a
regular meeting of the KMT Central Standing Committee, the party's
policy making body.</P>
      <P>Wu encouraged his fellow party workers not to lose confidence in
the KMT but rather to stand up and meet whatever challenges the
future might have in store for the 100-year-old party.</P>
      <P>Admitting that he himself was stunned by the disastrous defeat,
Wu urged those at the meeting -- mainly the KMT party chiefs of
cities and counties around the island -- to point out shortcomings of
the party's campaign strategy, including its method of naming
candidates and how the party's messages were conveyed to voters.</P>
      <P>He also asked them to pay attention to the criticism of the KMT
from the mass media and academies.</P>
      <P>A thorough review of the party's pre-election opinion polls, some
of which were blamed as misleading, will be carried out to
assess their effectiveness, said Wu.</P>
      <P>However, unpopular policies of the central government, which is
still controlled by the KMT and often a target of opposition
politicians, are off-limits in the party's review, said Wu, not
attempting to shift the blame and steering clear of offending those
who run the government.</P>
      <P>Even though the KMT lost almost half of the local administration
seats it had held, Wu reminded his coworkers not to forget to thank
the 3.2 million voters who did support the party. He also lauded the
party officials who vigorously campaigned in Taoyuan and Kaohsiung
counties, where KMT candidates posed serious threats to the
incumbents of the Democratic Progressive Party and only lost by small
margins.</P>
      <P>The outgoing secretary-general encouraged his coworkers to learn
from the defeat and prepare for next year's national and local
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Lee Teng-hui, who also serves as KMT
chairman, met with Premier Vincent Siew and KMT Vice Chairman and ROC
Vice President Lien Chan on Monday afternoon at the Presidential
Office for two hours, presumably on the new political situation that
the KMT defeat established.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Lien met in his office with another KMT elder,
Hsu Shui-teh, the president of Examination Yuan and a former KMT
secretary-general, probably to consult on the reshuffle of the party
hierarchy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two mainland Chinese fishermen who were
rescued off the Republic of China's frontline island of Kinmen late
last month were sent back to their hometown on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kang Youbo and Li Jiabo were rescued by ROC troops stationed on
Kinmen on Nov. 27 after their fishing boat, Minlungyu No. 2708,
struck a rock formation near the island and capsized.</P>
      <P>Kang, 40, sustained several injuries as a result of the accident.
He has fully recovered after receiving medical treatment under the
arrangement of the Kinmen garrison command.</P>
      <P>Kang said prior to his departure for home that he was grateful
for the care and hospitality extended to him and his colleague during
their stay in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The duo went home via a ferry boat leased by the Kinmen liaison
office of the ROC Red Cross Society. The boat left a Kinmen wharf at
around 8:30 a.m. and arrived in Xiamen, Fujian Province, at 9:00 a.m.</P>
      <P>Hsu Nai-jung, director of the preparatory office for the Kinmen
Red Cross Society, accompanied the two mainland fishermen on their
homecoming voyage. Hsu made a brief stopover at the Xiamen port to
complete some handover formalities with Li Minzhu, deputy
secretary-general of the Xiamen Red Cross Society.</P>
      <P>As the ROC still bans direct transport links with mainland China,
the Red Cross Society originally planned to send the duo to the
center line of the Taiwan Strait, where a mainland boat was to take
them home. Due to rough seas and bad weather, the Red Cross Society
decided to send them directly to Xiamen for safety considerations.</P>
      <P>An earlier case of what has been termed "humanitarian direct
sailing" between the two sides of the strait was witnessed on Nov.
26, when seven mainland fishermen who had completed jail terms
following convictions for smuggling were repatriated in a similar
manner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MIDDLE-AGED UNSKILLED WORKERS HAVE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Middle-aged unskilled workers have become
the top concern in solving the nation's unemployment problem, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials made the remarks after they reviewed a plan put
into practice a year ago to address the supply and demand imbalance
in the local job market.</P>
      <P>The officials said the high rate of unemployment among persons
with advanced academic backgrounds has improved. But at the same
time, the unemployment woes of middle-aged unskilled workers have
become noticeably more acute.</P>
      <P>The CEPD devised a strategy to tackle rising joblessness after
seeing a steady rise of unemployment in the latter half of 1995.</P>
      <P>In reviewing the results and future prospects of the plan, CEPD
officials found that the original problems have largely been
alleviated. However a new set of difficulties has appeared over the
past several months.</P>
      <P>They found that persons aged 50-54 registered an unemployment
rate of 1.74 percent in the first nine months of this year, or up
0.67 percentage points from 1.07 percent in the same period last
year. The increase rate was the highest among all age groups.</P>
      <P>The statistics released by the CEPD showed that the closure or
overseas relocation of businesses in labor-intensive industries as
well as the importation of foreign laborers has posed increased
threats to the job security of middle-aged unskilled workers.</P>
      <P>They said middle-aged laborers tend to enjoy stable employment,
but if they happen to lose their jobs, they are likely than workers
in other age groups to experience difficulties in securing new
employment.</P>
      <P>The Labor Standards Law stipulates that persons who reach the age
of 55 and have stayed in the same working place for over 15 years, or
persons who have stayed in the same working place for over 25 years
regardless of age, are entitled to retire and to receive a pension.
The CEPD officials said many employers are reluctant to hire
middle-aged workers because they want to avoid paying the pensions.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has proposed that the Council of Labor Affairs revise
the law so that laborers will receive pension payments in proportion
to the number of years they have served at the time they resign or
retire. In this way, officials said, middle-aged laborers will have
the same employment opportunities as their younger counterparts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO UNVEIL POLICIES ON INDUSTRY, CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to allay public
misgiving over its attitudes toward industrial development and
relations across the Taiwan Strait following its resounding win in
local elections, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
said on Tuesday it will unveil its polices on those issues early next
year.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen said the party will sponsor a
"business magnates meeting" in February, which will bring together
DPP local government chiefs and senior business executives to
exchange views on the development of various manufacturing and
service industries in DPP-ruled cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting, Chiu said, the DPP will issue a white
paper detailing its policy on industrial development.</P>
      <P>In the past, the DPP was widely seen to harbor an anti-commerce
sentiment as several DPP-ruled constituencies often shut doors on
some energy-consuming or highly polluting industries.</P>
      <P>"It is an erroneous perception," Chiu said, adding that the DPP
does not oppose industrial development or normal business activities.
"We don't welcome polluting industries mainly out of considerations
of environmental protection. We absolutely do not have an
anti-commerce complex," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiu said, the DPP will call a meeting after the
Chinese New Year holiday to forge an intraparty consensus on
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the DPP, which has advocated Taiwan independence, will
deal with cross-strait issues in a peaceful, rational manner.</P>
      <P>Chiu admitted that DPP members remain divided over many major
cross-strait issues, including whether Taiwan should start to
negotiate with mainland China for direct trade, transport and mail
links.</P>
      <P>While DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang supports an early start on
cross-strait discussions for the "three links," Chiu said he
personally sees no hurry to start negotiations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Recalling the history of negotiations between the ruling
Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party before the fall of
the Chinese mainland to communist hands in 1949, Chiu said
negotiations with Beijing are highly risky and tricky. "The three
direct links are Taiwan's last bargaining chips. We should handle the
issue very prudently."</P>
      <P>With the DPP gaining the mandate to rule more than half of the
cities and counties around Taiwan, Chiu said the party's social and
political responsibility has increased significantly. "Even though
our members remain divided over the issue, our party still has to
make efforts to forge an internal consensus and formulate a
comprehensive and coherent policy on cross-strait relations," he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PETROLEUM PRICE HIKE IN THE OFFING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) will raise petroleum prices to reflect increased costs of
purchasing imported crude in the wake of the sharp devaluation of the
New Taiwan dollar, CPC President Pang Wen-yen announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>But Pang said the size of the petroleum price hike and whether
the increase will be made in stages or in a single move, will be
decided after careful evaluation.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said the cost for crude purchases was US$19.48 per
barrel in November, up from US$18.16 per barrel in October, causing
the CPC to fall short of its targeted profits by NT$2.4 billion
(US$73.84 million) last month.</P>
      <P>They said the CPC incurs additional costs in purchasing crude of
about NT$1.5 billion (US$461.53 million) per month for every one New
Taiwan dollar decrease in value vis-a-vis the US dollar. The CPC also
fell short of its estimated surplus by nearly NT$600 million in
October because of the devalued local currency, which began its slide
after mid-October.</P>
      <P>They said that if the CPC seeks to raise petroleum prices by more
than 3 percent, it must first consult an advisory committee on energy
and electricity rates under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
However, if the price hike is set at below 3 percent, the CPC can

    <HEADLINE>EIGHT-POINT PROPOSAL STILL HOLDS GOOD: JIANG ZEMIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Chang Sheng-chao &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
that the eight-point proposal he introduced in 1995 to set forth the
basic principles of the Chinese Communist Party for resolving the
Taiwan issue still holds good.</P>
      <P>Jiang made the remark on Nov. 29 in an interview with Canada's
Globe and Mail. An excerpt of the 50-minite interview appeared in the
daily on Monday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail asked Jiang whether too much time has been
wasted in realizing the reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait at a time when more and more people in Taiwan think of
themselves as Taiwanese rather than as Chinese.</P>
      <P>In response, Jiang noted that the Taiwan issue has always been a
very sensitive problem. However, he said, it is something over which
there is a firm and positive resolve to bring to conclusion, adding
that it is also a Chinese internal matter.</P>
      <P>"Our policy toward Taiwan is peaceful reunification -- one
country, two systems. I believe that without military interference of
foreign countries, Taiwan will be reunified with the motherland
eventually. The eight-point proposal I introduced in January 1995 to
promote the reunification of both sides is still effective today,"
Jiang stressed.</P>
      <P>The statement is a reassertion of points made in his address
delivered at the opening ceremony of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum held in late November in Vancouver, Canada.
Jiang was quoted as saying at the APEC gathering that he believes the
Taiwan issue will be eventually resolved.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOME 5,890 LPG-FUELED TAXIES IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Nov.  2  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of taxies in Taipei fueled by
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) has reached some 5,890, accounting for
14.72 percent of the city's 40,000 registered cabs.</P>
      <P>The municipal Transportation Bureau and Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in March 1995 jointly
pushed for a program that promotes the conversion of gasoline-powered
taxies into LPG-propelled vehicles as part of efforts to check
deteriorating air quality in the city.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chai-liang, a departmental director in the Transportation
Bureau, on Tuesday cited the advantages of using LPG, saying that in
addition to its relative low-polluting qualities, LPG is priced at
NT$11 (US$0.34) per liter, much cheaper than non-leaded gasoline
which currently sells at about NT$17 (US$0.53) per liter. The taxi
drivers using LPG-fueled motor vehicles can save between NT$4,000 and
NT$6,000 in fuel costs per month.</P>
      <P>To encourage the conversion of taxies, each cab driver can apply
for a subsidy of between NT$40,000 and NT$45,000 provided by the
bureau and the EPA, Cheng said, adding that the subsidy can cover the
entire conversion cost.</P>
      <P>Cheng, however, admitted that in addition to promoting the
conversion of motor vehicles, the bureau should also make more effort
to build LPG service stations. As there is only one LPG station in
Taipei, which can serve only some 1,000 vehicles a day, drivers
invariably have to wait in long lines for refueling, he noted.</P>
      <P>The LPG station, operated by the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC),
has recently completed expansion of the facility, Cheng said, adding
that the city government has approved a private-invested LPG filling
station, which is scheduled to be completed in four to six months.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the bureau plans to build another three LPG
stations, in the northern, central and southern parts of Taipei. But
a number of problems have to be solved before construction can begin,
he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MULTIMEDIA INDUSTRY TAIWAN'S RISING STAR OF 21ST CENTURY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Information Infrastructure
(NII) task force under the Executive Yuan has decided to promote the
multimedia sector as Taiwan's rising star for next century,
estimating that the industry's output will reach about US$10 billion
in 1999 and rise to account for 5 percent of the world's total by
2002.</P>
      <P>The decision was made on Monday at an NII meeting in which the ad
hoc group approved the launch of a three-year promotional program to
develop Taiwan's information highway.</P>
      <P>The program, expected to be approved by the Executive Yuan soon,
calls for a total investment of NT$42.7 billion, with the government
channeling in NT$18.6 billion, while Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. will
contribute the remaining NT$24.1 billion.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which will be in charge of the
trans-century project, will invest NT$8.2 billion under the plan in
an effort to build Taiwan into a research, development and
distribution center for the multimedia industry in the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>As the multimedia industry covers a wide range of fields, NII
officials said, the Economics Ministry will join forces with the
private sector to develop the project.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Council for Economic Planning and Development, as
well as the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the
Ministry of Finance, will work out incentives in June and December
1988, respectively, to help boost development of the multimedia
sector.</P>
      <P>NII convener Yang Shih-chien, currently a minister without
portfolio, said Taiwan, with its already solid base in the
information industry, should grab the opportunity to develop itself
into a multimedia power, as the sector has been seen as the
locomotive behind the world's economic development in the future.</P>
      <P>Major world bodies, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, World Trade Organization and Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, have all targeted the multimedia
industry as the focus of future development, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>In addition to managing to transforming Taiwan into a regional
multimedia network hub and a world Chinese-language data bank, Yang
said the NII task force hopes to boost the number of Internet users
in Taiwan to 3 million over the next three years and have all
elementary and high schools on line in five years to reach the goal
of providing one out of every 20 students with access to a multimedia
computer.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Institute of the Information Industry
show that the number of Taiwan's Internet users stood at around 1.5
million as of the end of October.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA TO CUT GAS EMISSIONS BY 3 PERCENT FROM 1990 LEVEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian government announced Monday
that it will reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions by three
percent from 1990 levels by the year 2010.</P>
      <P>Ottawa also said it will set a domestic target for the
stabilization of the release of greenhouse gases by 2007. It will
announce the target at the Kyoto conference on climate change.</P>
      <P>"Now is the time for the government to show leadership," stated
Christine Stewart, Canada's minister of the environment.</P>
      <P>But what she called "leadership" was termed "incompetence" by the
opposition. And the province of Alberta, which produces and sells
energy, called it "betrayal" -- all because the federal target went
beyond the agreement between the federal and provincial governments,
and because Ottawa did not spell out how that target could be
achieved or how much it would cost Canadians.</P>
      <P>Federal officials said the measures will be worked out after an
international treaty is signed in Kyoto, Japan.</P>
      <P>Opposition leader Preston Manning called this "completely
irresponsible."</P>
      <P>"It failed to identify the impacts side of the economics,
sectoral or regional, and it's got no implementation plan and no idea
how it's going to pay for what it's committed itself to," the Reform
Party leader pointed out.</P>
      <P>Manning accused the Liberal government of pulling its position
out of a hat and urged it not to sign a deal binding Canada to reduce
emissions.</P>
      <P>Alberta's Energy Minister Steve West said, "They've betrayed the
process (of federal and provincial discussion on reducing gas
emission)." He promised to fight the "unilateral decision" by Ottawa.</P>
      <P>Stewart said climate change is one of the most significant
environmental challenges facing Canadians, as it could lead to higher
temperatures, more frequent and longer lasting droughts in some
areas, floods in others, melting permafrost and more frequent severe
weather events.</P>
      <P>Representatives from more than 150 countries opened a conference
Monday in Kyoto with the goal of negotiating a worldwide treaty to
limit emissions of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>Such gases are transparent to incoming radiation from the sun,
but they prevent that radiation from being reflected back into space,
the way a greenhouse traps the sun's heat for plants.</P>
      <P>An estimated six billion tonnes of greenhouse gases are being
pumped into the atmosphere annually, mainly through the burning of
fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gasoline.</P>
      <P>Most scientists predict that the result will be a gradual rise in
the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, but there's a lot
of uncertainty about how specific regions of the world will be
affected.</P>

      <P>Driven up by a rising current account
deficit and the recent depreciation of its currency, Australia's net
foreign debt hit a record high of A$217 billion (US$147 billion) in
the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the current
account deficit between July and September this year expanded over
second quarter levels by 55 percent to hit A$4.6 billion.</P>
      <P>The country's net foreign debt jumped about 4 percent to a record
A$217 billion during the third quarter, caused largely by the recent
9 percent depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US
currency.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar on Monday dropped to as low as 67.67 US
cents before closing at 67.88 US cents.</P>
      <P>Economists believed the currency would breach a barrier of 65 US
cents soon and possibly head towards 60 US cents in the next few
months.</P>
      <P>The signs of deterioration in Australia's trade and debt
positions crystallized growing financial market concerns about the
combined impact of a slump in Australian exports due to the Asian
economic crisis and a surge in imports as the country's economy
gathers pace, they said.</P>
      <P>Australia's economic indicators show that its economy is picking
up because the impact of the Asian crisis needs some time to be felt

      <P>Defense expenditures in Asia are expected
to rise despite the recent economic crisis because of potential
flashpoints in the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait and South China
Sea, Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said.</P>
      <P>In a speech at the National Press Club on Monday, Downer noted an
increase in defense spending across the region prompted by economic
growth and an array of "pressure points" that could lead to open
conflict.</P>
      <P>"None is greater in my view than the Korean Peninsula, and I look
forward to these four-party talks [among the United States, mainland
China, and North and South Korea] on Dec. 9 being a good start to
easing the tension on the Korean Peninsula," he said.</P>
      <P>"But the fact is the level of tension there is still very great
and should not be underestimated. There has, of course, been tension
between China and Taiwan. There are still competing claims in the
South China Sea. So this is not a part of the world without its
tensions," he added.</P>
      <P>He said regional defense expenditures would continue to grow for
the "foreseeable future" despite the recent economic turmoil in
Southeast Asia, which has forced many countries to cut back on large
capital projects.</P>
      <P>Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan has asked the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's Li Ruihuan, chairman of
the National People's Political Consultative Conference and a member
of the Politburo Standing Committee, is scheduled to visit Australia
from Dec. 14-20.</P>
      <P>He will become the most senior mainland Chinese official to visit
Australia since bilateral ties between Canberra and Beijing improved
earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Australia strained its ties with the People's Republic of China
in 1996 due to a series of incidents, including its support for the
US dispatch of two aircraft carrier groups to the Taiwan Strait
following military provocations directed at Taiwan by Beijing, the
sending of a senior Australian minister to Taipei, and the visit of
the Dalai Lama to Australia.</P>
      <P>But Australia improved its ties with mainland China through
visits by Prime Minister John Howard, Deputy Prime Minister Tim
Fischer and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer to Beijing, as well as
through a trip by Chinese mainland Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to
Australia, earlier this year.</P>
      <P>In announcing Li's visit, Fischer said the trip would cap a year
of "significant advances" in a relationship marked by a series of
acrimonious differences a year ago.</P>
      <P>"Australia's ties with China have continued to grow and diversify
into new areas to the great benefit of both countries and Mr. Li's
visit will further strengthen our already very good relationship,"
Fischer said.</P>
      <P>Li, who ranks fourth in the Chinese leadership hierarchy, is
expected to meet Howard and a number of senior federal and state
ministers during his visit, which will take him to Victoria, New
South Wales and Queensland.</P>
      <P>Australia switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in late 1972 and this year marks the 25th anniversary of ties
between the two governments.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Zhu Rongji, who ranks fifth in the Chinese
Communist hierarchy, visited Australia in May this year.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Australia and the mainland totaled about
A$8 billion last year and the figure is expected increase in coming

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia on Monday announced a ban
designed to outlaw Australian multinational companies and their
employees from bribing foreign officials in an attempt to win
contracts.</P>
      <P>In announcing the tough policy, Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone,
in a statement faxed to the CNA, said: "The government intends to
prohibit bribery of foreign officials by Australian companies or
individuals.</P>
      <P>"The move to prohibit bribery of foreign officials supplements
moves by the government in May to deny tax deductibility for bribes
paid to foreign officials. The prohibition forms part of the
government's response to the OECD Ministerial Council agreement in
May on measures to combat bribery in international business
transactions," she said.</P>
      <P>"Bribery raises business costs, creates uncertainty and distorts
international trade and investment. Legislation to implement the
government's intentions to prohibit bribery of foreign officials is
now being prepared," she said.</P>
      <P>"For an offense to occur, however, part of the conduct must occur
in Australia. The OECD has set April 1, 1998, as the target date for
the introduction of this legislation," she said. "The Australian
government intends to meet this target date. However, passage of the
legislation will be dependent on other OECD countries seeking to
introduce similar legislation. Business groups and nongovernment
organizations will be consulted further on the details of the
proposed legislation," she added.</P>
      <P>Analysts said Australian companies and employees are forced to
follow the practice of bribing foreign officials, including those in
developing countries such as mainland China, Vietnam, Indonesia and
Thailand, in order to win business contracts. Otherwise, other
foreign companies from the United States and Europe would beat
Australian firms if they fail to follow suit, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRATULATES TAIWAN ON SUCCESSFUL ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US government Monday extended
congratulations to the people of Taiwan for holding successful
mayoral and county magistrate elections last weekend.</P>
      <P>In a readout to the press, the US Department of State termed the
elections "another step in the impressive democratic transformation
of Taiwan over the past decade."</P>
      <P>"We also congratulate all candidates who won and have earned the
trust of the voters to serve in these important local offices," the
State Department said.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on possible implications of the election
results, the department said, "These were local elections contested
on local personalities and issues."</P>
      <P>In the Nov. 29 elections, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) suffered a
major setback. Although its candidates received 42.1 percent of the
popular vote -- slightly less than the 43.3 percent for the
candidates from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party -- the
KMT retained only eight of the 23 cities and counties contested, much
less than the 12 cities and counties captured by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The remaining three went to
independent candidates.</P>
      <P>An official at the State Department contacted by CNA declined to
speculate on how the election results might affect the triangular
relationship among the United States, Taiwan and mainland China. He
also would not comment on whether the elections might have a
significant influence on Taiwan's internal party politics.</P>
      <P>On whether the United States would step up its contacts with the
DPP, the official said the United States, through the American
Institute in Taiwan, has maintained contacts with a variety of people
from all of walks of life in Taiwan and will continue to do so.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CONCERNED ABOUT BURGLARIES AT AIT STAFFERS' HOMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The residences of four staff members of the
de facto American embassy in Taipei were broken into last weekend, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Mrs. Lauren Moriarty, acting director-general of the Taipei
office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), informed the
Foreign Ministry of the incidents on Monday," ministry spokesman Roy
Wu told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ministry is concerned about the series of incidents
and will convey AIT staff members' requests to local police
authorities.</P>
      <P>"Minister of Foreign Affairs Jason Hu has expressed grave concern
about the incidents and has ordered John Feng, director of the
ministry's Protocol Department, to contact police authorities and
urge them to actively investigate the case," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Shen Lu-hsun, director of the ministry's North American Affairs
Department, had met with Moriarty to express his concern about the
break-ins and exchange views on how to improve security at residences
of foreign officials stationed here, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He stated that one of the AIT staff members had incurred property
losses at the hands of the intruder or intruders, while the three
others reported only that the windows and doors to their residences
had been damaged. The houses are all located on the
scenic Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu declined to disclose details about the losses and damages
sustained by the AIT officials, saying, "I must respect their
privacy."</P>
      <P>Wu said the Foreign Ministry will make further contacts with the
AIT to learn more about the incidents and will demand that police
authorities intensify protective measures to ensure the safety of its
staff members.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, the burglarized house belongs
to Daryl Johnson, director-general of the AIT Taipei office. As
Johnson is currently not in Taipei, the reports said, the amount of
financial losses remains unclear.</P>
      <P>AIT was founded by American authorities in 1979 to handle
exchanges with the Republic of China in the absence of diplomatic
ties.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry has shown much concern about the series of
burglary cases because the incidents could further hurt the ROC's
image. On Nov. 18, a wanted fugitive broke into the home of South
African military attache Col. McGill Alexander and took his entire
family hostage. Though the incident was peacefully resolved after a
24-hour standoff between police and the fugitive, the safety of
expatriates here has since become a major concern. Police
authorities have pledged to improve protective measures for
diplomats and other expatriates.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier John Chang on Monday refused to
confirm that he is to take over as secretary general of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) following the party's rout in the local elections.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he hadn't received any notice about the reported
assignment to replace Wu Poh-hsiung, who resigned on Saturday after
the KMT for the first time lost its majority in local government
seats.</P>
      <P>If local press reports turn out to be true, Chang said, he would

      <P>The KMT's top decision-making body, the central standing
committee, will have a regularly scheduled meeting on Wednesday in
which it is expected to approve Wu's resignation as well as the

      <P>Commenting on local reports about Chang's appointment, Wu said
that Chang, who is known as capable and enjoys a good reputation,
would be the proper person to fill the vacancy left by his
resignation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Li Guoqiang, member of the National
Committee of the communist Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said here Tuesday that the result of Saturday's local
elections in Taiwan "will certainly affect cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>In the elections of 23 city mayors and county magistrates, the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won 12 seats,
while the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) obtained only eight.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Li said that the election result
indicated the decline of the KMT after 50 years of ruling in Taiwan,
and that the situational change has made the relations between
Taiwan and mainland China more complicated.</P>
      <P>He predicted that facing the new situation, Beijing will become
more emphatic about its "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Li said the major opposition party's victory may enhance the
advocacy of Taiwan independence on the one hand, but will give
Beijing a chance to play the KMT and DPP off against each other on
the other hand.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS WORLD'S SEVENTH FREEST ECONOMY: RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan has the
seventh freest economy in the world, on a par with Britain's and
Luxembourg's, according to the latest world economic assessment
compiled by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal.</P>
      <P>According to the 1998 Index of Economic Freedom, Taiwan also has
the fourth freest economic system in the Pacific Rim, behind only
Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>The index, co-authored by the Heritage Foundation's Kim Holmes
and Bryan Johnson and the Wall Street Journal's Melanie Kirkpatrick,
assessed 156 economies around the globe in 10 economic and financial
areas to judge their freedom.</P>
      <P>The 10 areas included the banking system, foreign investment,
currency, tariffs, foreign trade, government system, salary structure
and inflation, economic and financial laws, rights of property and
black-market activities.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's economy, the compilers said the convention of the
National Development Conference in late 1996 has helped raise the
island's competitiveness in world markets and strengthened its
ability to attract foreign capital.</P>
      <P>The welfare programs called for by opposition parties, however,
may undermine Taiwan's sustainable growth, the authors said.</P>
      <P>Despite Hong Kong's handover from Britain to mainland China, the
former colony kept its rating as the world's freest economy for the
fourth consecutive year, mainly due to the district authorities'
adherence to the pre-established hands-off policy, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong scored 1.25 points in the 1998 Index of Economic
Freedom, on a scale in which 1.0 is the "freest."</P>
      <P>Taiwan received 1.95 points. Among the 10 areas assessed,
Taiwan's foreign investment and banking system received 3 points,
underscoring the two sectors' need for further liberalization.</P>
      <P>The index showed that the economies of Hong Kong, Singapore,
Bahrain, New Zealand and Switzerland in that order are the five
freest in the world.</P>
      <P>The US economy was declared the globe's sixth freest, while
Australia and Japan tied at 12th, and South Korea came in 24th.</P>
      <P>Mainland China fell in 120th place, down among countries that
allow relatively little freedom in economic activities, such as
Albania, the Congo, Bangladesh and Croatia, the index showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STRAITS TIMES COMMENTS ON TAIWAN ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is far better for Taiwan to continue
to flourish by preserving the status quo, The Straits Times commented
in its editorial Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The editorial, titled "Sign of the times in Taiwan," points out
that in Saturday's local elections in Taiwan neither the
pro-reunification New Party nor the year-old Taiwan Independence
Party, formed by defectors from the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) dissatisfied by what they see as DPP caution over the issue of
independence, won any seats.</P>
      <P>The rout suffered by these two parties, situated at opposite ends
of the spectrum on the question of Taiwan's unification with mainland
China, suggests that "Taiwanese are opposed to extreme positions on
the subject," says the editorial.</P>
      <P>"Most of them prefer the status quo to either independence or
reunion with the mainland, at least in the near term," it asserts.</P>
      <P>The editorial said that the voters' rejection of the ruling
Kuomintang had many reasons, from the island's deteriorating
law-and-order situation and the constitutional reforms, to the
maneuverings of candidates and others at the local level.</P>
      <P>But there is no doubt that many Taiwanese have chosen the DPP and
what it stands for over the KMT, it says.</P>
      <P>For this result, it adds, the KMT has only itself to blame. The
Straits Times says that the KMT tried to adopt the DPP's platform,
alienating in the process those who saw this as betraying its own
traditions.</P>
      <P>However, in hedging its position on independence, the KMT failed
to dislodge the DPP from the political space the opposition party
created by making the island's political future a core issue,
comments the editorial.</P>
      <P>"Neither one nor the other, the KMT has paid the price of
inhabiting a halfway house," it says. "Just under half, as the local
election results show."</P>
      <P>These are, of course, local elections. However, the political
mood they reveal will have a bearing on the outcome of the
parliamentary polls due to be held next year and the presidential
election in 2000, asserts the editorial.</P>
      <P>The key question is what the DPP is going to do with the local
mandate it received last week, it says.</P>
      <P>The party has been playing down its pro-independence stance of
late, arguing that it is unnecessary for Taiwan to declare
independence because it enjoys de facto independence already.</P>
      <P>However, the editorial notes, in the aftermath of last week's
victory, "the DPP has vowed to push ahead with its pro-independence
stand."</P>
      <P>"We will continue pursuing the goal of turning Taiwan into an
independent state," DPP Secretary-General Chiu I-jen was quoted as
saying bluntly.</P>
      <P>That would be inadvisable, to say the least, opines the daily.</P>
      <P>"The prospects of the island splitting strike at the heart of
China's integrity," it says.</P>
      <P>"Beijing, to which a single China is non-negotiable, has left no
one in any doubt that it will intervene militarily to prevent the
prospects from becoming reality," the editorial cautions.</P>
      <P>Armed conflict would have a cataclysmic effect in Northeast Asia
and affect the stability of a far wider region as well, it adds.</P>
      <P>Asian countries that have a stake in peace in the Taiwan Strait
would hope that no party in the island would force issues to that
point, asserts the editorial, hoping instead that as the DPP becomes
more powerful, it will moderate and not radicalize its position on
independence.</P>
      <P>"It is far better for Taiwan to continue to flourish by
preserving the status quo," the editorial says.</P>
      <P>"Independence might or might not be a daydream, but it can
certainly turn into a nightmare," it warns.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT REQUIRES `DEEP SCRUTINY': PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday that
his ruling Kuomintang (KMT) needs to do some deep soul-searching and
self-examination following the party's recent election rout.</P>
      <P>Lee, who concurrently serves as KMT chairman, made the remarks
during a meeting with a delegation of overseas Chinese community
leaders from the United States.</P>
      <P>It was also the first time since last Saturday that the president
had publicly talked about the just-concluded mayoral and magistrate
elections, in which the KMT suffered a significant setback, winning
only eight of the 23 top local government executive posts up for
grabs.</P>
      <P>Lee said the outcome indicates that democracy has taken firm root
in Taiwan. "Although the KMT has lost control of several cities and
counties, we should respect the choice of the electorate," he said,
adding that the KMT should carefully scrutinize the reasons behind
its defeat at the hands of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party and independent candidates.</P>
      <P>Turning to the country's current challenges, Lee said the
Republic of China must give top priority to three tasks in order to
ensure its survival and sustained development: consolidating its
democratic system, upgrading national competitiveness and forging
rapprochement with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC has now existed for 86 years. "We should never
forsake our sovereignty," he said, adding that the ROC should
endeavor to dispel the unrealistic perception in the international
community that "one China" is tantamount to the "People's Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Chinese culture has been revitalized in Taiwan,
Lee said Taiwan's experience can provide inspiration for mainland
China in its future development.</P>
      <P>He urged overseas Chinese community leaders to remain confident
in the ROC's political and economic strength. "I believe China will
eventually be reunified under the principles of freedom, democracy
and prosperity," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After more than two years of standstill,
relations across the Taiwan Strait have finally shown signs of
thawing, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo said
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Among others, Koo said, the deputy secretaries of SEF and the
Beijing-based Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) have resumed
exchanges of visits.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that even higher-level exchanges between the two
organizations are expected to take place in the not too distant
future," said the Republic of China's top negotiator with mainalnd
China.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies founded by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Koo said stable cross-strait relations are critical to the
well-being of the people on both sides of the strait. Before China
is reunified, Koo said, the two sides should respect each other. "I
earnestly hope that cross-strait dialogue can be resumed soon."</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks while receiving a group of officials of the

policy toward the mainland and oversees SEF operations.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh paid a visit to the SEF head office
Tuesday morning in the company several MAC departmental chiefs.</P>
      <P>This was Chang's second visit to the SEF office since he assumed
office in February 1996. Chang said communications and interchanges
between the MAC and SEF have been very smooth. "So i do not need to
make frequent visits to SEF," he noted.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General Chiao Jen-ho briefed Chang and other MAC

      <P>Senior MAC and SEF officials, including Koo, Chang and Chiao,
then held a closed-door meeting.</P>
      <P>Local media reports said senior officials of the two

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday called for
cool heads among Kuomintang (KMT) members and for a period of
soul-searching in the wake of the ruling party's wholesale rout in
Taiwan's Nov. 29 local elections.</P>
      <P>During a reception for delegates of overseas Chinese communities
in the United States, Lee also said that the Republic of China
government will never budge on its sovereignty stance, adding that
Taipei will continue to seek to expose the lies that Beijing has
spread in the international community that "one China" refers only to
the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the just-concluded local elections, Lee said that
although the rival parties engaged in a heated contest, the elections
were carried out smoothly and rationally, underscoring a perfect
example of democratic politics.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as KMT chairman and member, he hopes that all
party-members will exercise calmness and rationality while carrying
out the post-election self-examination.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that all failures and mistakes occur for a
reason, adding that the party's dismal failure over the weekend, in
which the KMT lost seven of its 15 seats at the executive level of
local government, demands deep, across-the-board scrutiny.</P>
      <P>He urged all KMT members to try their best to dig to the root of
the problems behind the failure in order to ready themselves for the
next round of challenges, referring to the mayoral elections for
Taipei and Kaohsiung cities and the legislative elections scheduled
for 1998, as well as the presidential election which will take place

Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) predicted on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Since oil consumption makes up only about 2.2 percent of average
household expenditure in Taiwan, even if petroleum prices were to be
raised by 10 percent, and the ensuing impact on the manufacture
sector taken into account, it is estimated that the consumer's price
index (CPI) would edge up only 0.43 percentage points, while the
wholesale price index (WPI) would increase by 0.53 percentage points,
DGBAS officials noted.</P>
      <P>If electricity prices remain unchanged and the New Taiwan dollar
retains its strength, a 10-percent oil price hike will exert even
less impact on CPI and WPI growth, estimated to be only about 0.36
percentage points and 0.46 percentage points, respectively, they
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. announced on Tuesday that
it will raise petroleum prices, probably by 7 percent, in the middle
of this month as a reflection of the increased cost of imported crude
in the wake of the recent sharp depreciation of the local currency.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS officials refused to speculate on next year's inflation
rate increase, since it remains unknown how Taiwan's currency, which
has been affected by Southeast Asia's currency turbulence, will
change. The agency predicted in November that Taiwan's annual
inflation growth will be controlled at about 3.12 percent in 1998.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippines has been more victim than
culprit in the Asian financial drama. Its economy was structurally
sound, and its banking system was in good shape, according to reports
of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an upbeat assessment of the current outlook, although
forecasts for economic growth in 1997-98 have been scaled down by a
percentage point or more since the onset of the crisis, they are
still within a range of 5.5 - 6.5 percent, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Inflation might be slightly higher than recent rates of around 5
percent, but prices for basic foodstuffs remain stable. Exports are
up by about a quarter on last year's levels, and inward investment
continues at a strong pace.</P>
      <P>President Fidel Ramos expects the privatization program to
continue, in spite of the sharp fall in share prices. The sale of the
National Power Corporation, the country's largest company, is under
active discussion, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>"Before the end of the first quarter of 1998 we should have some
real action going so far as this privatization is concerned," Ramos
was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"Much of the anxiety about East Asia today has to do with issues
of transparency, openness, prudence and responsible management -- all
of which are the natural outcomes of managing and governing in a
democratic way," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO CONSIDER DIALOGUE WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Riding the wave of its resounding victory in
Taiwan's local elections last weekend, the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said on Tuesday that it will consider opening
dialogue with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which won 12 out of the 23 seats up for grabs in the
elections for county magistrates and city mayors on Nov. 29, was
responding to calls made recently by officials of Beijing's Taiwan
Affairs Office for the DPP to help develop cross-strait relations.
Beijing in the past has refused contact with the DPP because of the
party's advocacy of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, director of the DPP's Department of China Affairs,
said that his party will definitely not accept any preconditions set
by Beijing for entering into dialogue, referring to Beijing's demand
that the DPP first renounce its pro-independence stance to pave the
way for talks.</P>
      <P>Describing the DPP's policy on cross-strait ties "more practical
than Beijing's," Yen said that acquiescing to the Beijing demand
would be tantamount to the DPP asking Beijing to abandon its "one
China" principle.</P>
      <P>He said that since Beijing now regards the DPP as important, it
needs to review its strategy in dealing with the DPP. "It would be
unwise for Beijing to set any prerequisite because this would only
serve to block the proposed dialogue between the two sides," he
added.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the DPP might seek to open dialogue not only with
Beijing's policy-making agencies for Taiwan affairs and think-tanks,
but also with relevant mainland government and party institutes at
both the central and local levels.</P>
      <P>Throwing his support behind a call by the ROC's Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) for all political parties to establish a consensus on
mainland policy, Yen asked the MAC to increase communication with his
party in this regard.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out Beijing's proposal that the suspended
cross-strait talks be resumed step by step -- beginning with the
reopening of dialogue between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) -- is acceptable to the DPP.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended SEF-ARATS talks following ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States in the
summer of 1995 as a gesture against what it said was a trip aimed at
promoting Taiwan independence, an allegation which has been
frequently and emphatically denied by the ROC government.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are intermediary organizations set up by Taipei
and Beijing respectively to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>

      <P>In a great step forward for the ROC in
realizing the island's goal of becoming a regional media center, the
Asian Wall Street Journal is launching its first printing in Taipei,
the seventh site in Asia for the international financial newspaper.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at a luncheon attended by some 200
government official and dignitaries marking the start of Taiwan's
first printing operation of an international daily, ROC President Lee
Teng-hui said he admired the foresight of Dow Jones &amp; Company, the
paper's owner, in selecting the ROC as a base for further expansion.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as a regular reader of the journal, the
president lauded the newspaper's insistence on cautious objectivity,
accuracy, impartiality, and "its conscientious attitude in presenting
its analyse," thereby allowing its readers to analyze issues
comprehensively.</P>
      <P>These factors help the paper command an influential readership
which includes many government and business leaders and
policy-makers, and have been instrumental in building it's vast
influence in Asia, said Lee.</P>
      <P>Noting that the media industry in ROC is becoming a new force for
social progress, the president said the island is completing a
comprehensive review of relevant laws and regulations, with the aim
of attracting more international media to expand their operations
into the ROC.</P>
      <P>At the luncheon, Karen Elliott House, president of the
international affairs division of the Dow Jones group, hailed Lee as
the man "who personifies the dramatic change and progress" of the
ROC, and the man "who transformed his country into a democracy."</P>
      <P>Citing the journal's editorial philosophy of "free men and free
markets," House said she admired Taiwan's "commitment to free markets
and free men," and expressed gratitude to Lee and his government for
welcoming the journal to Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to an AWSJ executive, the newspaper's daily circulation
in Taiwan is currently about 2,500, a figure which is expected to
rise to between 5,000 and 6,000 now that the daily is printed here
instead of being delivered from Hong Kong.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan purchased US$2.58 billion worth
of agricultural commodities from the United States between Oct. 1,
1996 and Sept. 30, 1997, making it the fifth largest buyer of
American farm products in fiscal year 1997, up one notch from the
previous year, the US Department of Agriculture (DOA) reported
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported about 1.5 times more of these products than
mainland China, which took in about US$1.78 billion worth of American
agricultural commodities during the same year.</P>
      <P>Mainland China was the seventh largest buyer of American
agricultural commodities in FY 1997, down two notches from FY 1996,
according to DOA tallies.</P>
      <P>The tallies also showed that the top 10 world buyers of American
agricultural commodities in FY 1997 were Japan, Canada, Mexico, South
Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, mainland China, Hong Kong, Germany,
and Britain, in that order.</P>
      <P>In FY 1997, the United States exported US$57.26 billion worth of
agricultural commodities, down 4.2 percent from the previous year.
North America, Japan and the European Union, in that order, were the
three major export areas.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was also the fifth largest buyer of American agricultural,
fishery and forest products as a whole in FY 1997, the same tallies
indicated. A total of US$2.77 billion worth of such products were
shipped to Taiwan during the past fiscal year, about US$90 million
more than those delivered to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan exported a relatively much smaller US$164.5
million worth of agricultural products to the United States in FY
1997, making it America's 32nd largest supplier of such products.</P>
      <P>As a result, the United States enjoyed an enviable surplus of

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The public notification of the import of
38,000 foreign laborers by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA), originally scheduled for November, was suspended as a result
of a boycott by a dozen legislators, CLA Chairman Hsu Chieh-kuei said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, Taiwan's top official in charge of labor
affairs, the lawmakers opposed the further introduction of laborers
from abroad into Taiwan on the grounds that the number of crimes
committed by this special group of expatriates has continued to rise.
They asked for a wholesale halt to such import, he added.</P>
      <P>The quota of 38,000 is not an addition to the originally approved
number of foreign laborers, Hsu noted, saying that instead these
slots are available now because domestic applicants did not fill the
original quota or sometimes had their individual quotas revoked
because of improper usage.</P>
      <P>Hsu would not speculate on how soon the CLA will give the green
light to entry of the 38,000 alien workers, only saying that he will
continue to communicate with the legislators on this concern.</P>
      <P>Since 1989, when the government first began the introduction of
foreign laborers to Taiwan to help ease the ever-increasing labor
shortage, 327,443 foreigners have been approved to come to the island
as of the end of October.</P>
      <P>During the period, 251,127 laborers, mainly from Southeast Asian
countries, actually arrived in Taiwan to work in various sectors,
including home service, manufacturing and construction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, their period of single stay has been extended from two
to three years since May of this year.</P>
      <P>So far the number of runaways or those who overstay their visas
totals about 20,000, creating a headache for the government.</P>

      <P>There is no timetable for the resumption of

Tuesday that if Taipei's attitude and response are both active and

      <P>Chang made the remarks at a seminar held in Hong Kong on
information about Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In regard to whether there is a chance for both sides of the

      <P>Beijing's stance is to formally end hostilities under the
principle of one China through political negotiations, Chang

    <HEADLINE>US SCHOLARS COMMENT ON TAIWAN ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By David Wang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A long-time Taiwan observer and China
expert said on Tuesday that Taiwan's recent mayoral and county
magistrate election was a "genuine democratic election," which truly
reflects public opinion.</P>
      <P>However, Andrew Nathan, professor of the East Asian Study
Institute at Colombia University, told the local press that the
chances are slim that the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will declare Taiwan independent, even if the pro-independence
party assumes power in the central government.</P>
      <P>The DPP scored a landslide victory in Taiwan's mayoral and county
chief election on November 29, winning control in 12 out of a total
of 23 constituencies in the race and changing dramatically Taiwan's
political picture at the local level.</P>
      <P>According to Nathan, the people of Taiwan prefer to maintain the
status-quo across the Taiwan Strait and the DPP must take this into
account should it ever become the ruling party. Since most of
Taiwan's population are unwilling to unify with mainland China or
declare independence, the DPP must forge its policy based on public
opinion, he added.</P>
      <P>He said the US position on the issue of cross-strait negotiations
has undergone a subtle change since the October meeting between US
President Bill Clinton and mainland China's President Jiang Zemin in
Washington.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman of the Washington-based American Institute
in Taiwan, reiterated to ranking ROC authorities during a visit to
Taiwan in the wake of the Clinton-Jiang summit, that the US
government will stand firm on the "three communiques" signed between
Washington and Beijing and stressed that Washington will not
recognize Taiwan sovereignty or establish diplomatic relations with
Taiwan should the country declare independence.</P>
      <P>Nathan also opined that Beijing should increase contacts with the
DPP in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the DPP's
stance on the issue of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>James Seymour, a senior researcher at the East Asian Study
Institute, said the election is a reflection of Taiwan's sound
political structure and its energetic bi-partisan system. He noted,
however, that the election results should not have much effect on
Taiwan's overall political situation, as they only affected
government at the local level.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP achieved a major victory, Seymour said it is
unlikely that the opposition party will be able to assume power of
the central government in the short term, making it unnecessary to
worry about at present the question of whether the DPP will declare
Taiwan independent should it become the ruling party.</P>
      <P>He expressed the belief that the DPP will not impulsively declare
Taiwan independent, even it does win power in the central government,
in order to avoid unnecessary trouble for the people on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>

(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy opened an international conference on land mines in Ottawa
Tuesday, calling it a triumph of "people power" on the international
stage.</P>
      <P>Besides signing a historic treaty banning the deadly devices,
participants from more than 100 countries will work on the details of
getting rid of them.</P>
      <P>The drive to ban land mines was originally launched by volunteers
and non-governmental agencies. Canada took up the cause last year,
telling its diplomats to help push other governments to sign the
deal.</P>
      <P>Some important powers don't support the treaty. Among the
hold-outs are the United States, mainland China, India, Pakistan,
Israel and Russia. They are major producers and users of land mines.</P>
      <P>Many still see the accord as a major first step toward
eliminating mines. The accord will ban the stockpile, export,
production and use of anti-personnel mines. It will also set a
timetable for the removal of mines already in the ground.</P>
      <P>It's estimated that over 100 million land mines are strewn in 70
countries throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The Ottawa initiative gained steam in October, when the Nobel
Peace Prize was awarded to the International Campaign to Ban Land
mines and its leader Jody Williams.</P>
      <P>Only last week, Japan and Poland came aboard. On Tuesday,
Venezuela, the Vatican and Bulgaria were added to the list.</P>
      <P>Canada is spending C$3.7 million (US$2.6 million) to roll out the
red carpet for the delegates from 148 countries, including airfare
and accommodation for many.</P>
      <P>"It is on the subject of land mines that Canada's leadership has
made its most resounding contribution to humankind this decade," said

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE WHEAT EXPORTS SEEN BEING HIT BY UNTIMELY RAINS, HEAT WAVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia expects lower wheat exports in
fiscal 1997-98 because of untimely rains and hot spells that will
hurt the quality of the produce, according to the Australian Bureau
of Agriculture and Research Economics (ABARE).</P>
      <P>The ABARE has slightly upgraded its overall wheat harvest
forecast to 17.9 million tonnes for the 1997-98 wheat crop but it has
warned of widespread quality problems in that crop.</P>
      <P>The bureau said only 11.7 million tonnes of wheat -- or less than
two thirds of the expected crop -- will be fit for export in 1997-98,
the poorest result for three years.</P>
      <P>The Australian Wheat Board, however, is more optimistic than the
bureau, predicting that almost 13 million tonnes of wheat could be
exported, including to mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The board's merchandising manager Phillip Pyle said much of the
lower quality grain could still be sold overseas at a discount price.</P>
      <P>Rains in early November generally came too late to benefit crops
and instead had a detrimental impact on grain formation and

      <P>The Globe and Mail carried a
Taipei-datelined report on Tuesday saying that the defeat of the
ruling Kuomintang in the latest election in the Republic of China
"has profound implications for peace in the region."</P>
      <P>The report, by the International Herald Tribune, said the KMT
could well lose next year's parliamentary election and it is now
possible that Taipei's popular mayor Chen Shui-bian will replace Lee
Teng-hui as president in 2000.</P>
      <P>Beijing will now wait to see if a Democratic Progressive Party
candidate becomes president in 2000 and wholly abandons the mantra of
reunification and moves Taiwan toward the "ultimate flash point,
independence," according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE TO REINFORCE PROTECTIVE MEASURES FOR EXPATRIATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police are to step up protective measures
for expatriates in the metropolitan Taipei area from Thursday, amid
mounting criminal activities which target foreign diplomats and
business people, the country's top police administrator said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Grassroots police officers will intensify patrols around foreign
embassies, representative offices, corporations and expatriate
residential communities," said Ting Yuan-chin, director general of
the National Police Administration (NPA).</P>
      <P>Intensified protective measures will first be implemented in
Taipei City and Taipei County, where many foreign offices are located
and where the largest number of expatriates are resident, Ting said,
adding that similar measures will gradually be expanded to cover
other cities and counties around the island.</P>
      <P>Ting made the remarks during a visit to the central city of
Taichung, where he presented awards to police officers responsible
for solving the recent murder of a schoolteacher and for cracking a
recent firearms smuggling operation.</P>
      <P>Ting also exchanged views with criminal investigators responsible
for probing the murder of an American housewife which took place in
Taichung on April 15.</P>
      <P>Tina Holden died from repeated blows to the back of her head
during a suspected burglary at her home in an upscale community in
Taichung.</P>
      <P>Tina's husband, Lenny Holden, appealed to Ting on Tuesday for a
speedy solution to the brutal murder case.</P>
      <P>Holden, the Asia general manager for the Converse sporting goods
company, said he is disappointed by the ineffectiveness of local
police in solving the crime.</P>
      <P>"Seven months later, they are still saying that they are checking
fingerprints," Holden told a news conference after meeting with Ting,
adding: "It seems to me they have not energetically and aggressively
pursued leads, such as missing artwork, jewelry and foreign
currencies."</P>
      <P>Holden, who had lived with his wife and two small children in
Taiwan for two-and-a-half years, said police have even failed to keep
him informed of their progress, as they had promised to do at the
outset.</P>
      <P>In response to Holden's appeal, Ting again instructed the
Taichung police office to do its utmost to bring the perpetrators to
justice as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>However, Taichung police said they have in fact devoted a great
deal of energy to investigating the case over the past seven months.
Forensic experts have examined more than 60 fingerprints and a number
of ex-convicts suspected of involvement in the case have been
questioned. However, no major breakthrough has so far been achieved
due to a lack of eyewitnesses as well as limited information about
the pre-murder situation. Investigators said they still do not have a
complete list of missing articles.</P>
      <P>The safety of expatriates was thrust even more forcefully into
the spotlight after the island's most-wanted criminal -- Chen
Chin-hsing -- broke into the home of South African military attache
Col. McGill Alexander and took his entire family hostage on Nov. 18.
The incident was peacefully resolved after a 24-hour standoff between
police and the fugitive, although Alexander and his eldest daughter
were shot and wounded by Chen.</P>
      <P>In the latest reported incident, the residence of the de facto
American ambassador to the Republic of China, Daryl Johnson, was
burglarized last weekend, and the homes of three of his colleagues at
the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) were also
broken into, apparently on the same day. AIT was founded by American
authorities in 1979 to handle exchanges with the ROC in the absence
of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The burglary of Johnson's home has sounded alarm bells to police
because it is the first such case in recent memory, and occurred
despite round-the-clock police protection which is mandatory for
foreign embassies, representative offices and the residences of the
top personnel of those offices.</P>
      <P>According to NPA tallies, a total of 46 criminal cases, involving
52 foreign victims, were reported in the first six months of this
year, most of which involved Americans and Japanese. Burglary, which
accounted for 30 cases, was the most common crime reported, while
murder, with only three reported cases, was much rarer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUEENS IS EPICENTER OF NEW YORK CITY IMMIGRANT GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Half of the households in Queens Borough
of New York City are now headed by someone born in a foreign country,
according to a New York University study that shows Queens remains
the epicenter of a massive influx of immigrants into New York City.</P>
      <P>The study also found that Hispanics now outnumber blacks as the
second largest racial/ethnic group in Queens and citywide. The city's
white population, though still the largest, continued to decline,
especially in Queens, while Asians are growing at the fastest pace.</P>
      <P>The report, released Monday by the Taub Urban Research Center,
analyzed data collected by the US Census Bureau for the New York City
Department of Housing Preservation and Development in 1996.</P>
      <P>The report cited Queens as having the highest number of city
households headed by foreign-born people in 1996. Nearly 350,000
Queens households, or almost half of the total in the borough, were
headed by a foreign-born person. Brooklyn had the second highest
number, with more than 40 percent of households headed by a
foreign-born individual.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Queens' population was 39.1 percent
white, 23.9 percent Hispanic, 20.5 percent black and 18.6 percent
Asian in 1966.</P>
      <P>For Queens, the percentages are a significant change for whites,
who in 1990 represented 48.2 percent of the borough's population. At
that time, blacks accounted for 20.3 percent, Asians 12.4 percent and
Hispanics 19.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Citywide, the 1996 figures were 38.5 percent white, 26.6 percent
Hispanic, 26.2 percent black and 8.7 percent Asian. That compared
with 1990 figures of 43.3 percent white, 24.5 percent Hispanic, 25.4
percent black and 6.7 percent Asian.</P>
      <P>Asians increased at the fast rate, growing in Queens from 240,672
in 1990 to 402,373 in 1996. Citywide, their population grew from
489,851 in 1990 to 744,837 in 1996.</P>
      <P>Mitchell Moss, the center's director and one of the report's
three authors, believes there is no connection between the increase
in immigrants and the drop in white residents.</P>
      <P>"White professionals benefit because immigrants provide the
support services they require," Moss said. "You see it in the dry
cleaners, green grocers, the health care workers and the phenomenal
growth of manicure salons."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA'S WOES MAY HELP US ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Ranan Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic analysts said Asia's monetary
crisis will mean a stronger US dollar, fewer US exports to the region
and more imports from it, followed by slower US growth and less
inflation than otherwise would have occurred, hence benefiting the US
Federal Reserve Board's work helping secure the US economy, according
to the Journal of Commerce on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The analysts said there's no question that such a scenario -- in
which Asia's woes help the US economy -- is highly probable, even
inevitable, for the next six months or more. The dampening effect on
the US economy will also be sufficient to forestall Federal Reserve
action to boost interest rates in a preemptive strike against
inflation.</P>
      <P>They also said that, for dealing with the crisis, the United
States and the European Union may take a step or two this week at an
EU-US summit toward harmonizing their related policies, starting a
kind of government-to-government cooperation US and EU business
leaders are strongly urging.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD CHAIRMAN ADDRESSES US-ROC BUSINESS CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Diego,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is
taking decisive action to push forward the APROC plan and government
re-engineering. These major initiatives will bring laws and
regulations up to date, improve efficiency, and strongly enhance the
investment environment, according to P.K. Chiang, chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>"The performance of the ROC economy amid the widespread financial
turmoil stands as testament that Taiwan is a place where investors
may still come with confidence to seek high profits at low risk,"
Chiang said in San Diego on Tuesday at the plenary session of the
21st Joint Business Conference of the ROC-USA Economic Council and
US-ROC Business Council.</P>
      <P>In his speech entitled "ROC Economic Prospects Amid Global
Financial Turmoil," Chiang said: "We will press ahead with financial
liberalization while continuing to strengthen financial supervision
to ensure the soundness of financial environment.</P>
      <P>"As economic and trade ties between our countries grow constantly
broader and deeper, we would like to call upon your support for early
completion of the bilateral talks on ROC accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO). We are sure that our entry to the WTO will
substantially benefit us both, giving rise to rich new opportunities
for US-ROC business."</P>
      <P>Chiang said: "The agricultural sector should be given special
consideration in the process of trade liberalization. A healthy
agricultural sector in Taiwan will help the stabilization of our
society, which will better serve US interests; The delay of our
accession to the WTO prevents the US business community to enjoy the
benefits of our market."</P>
      <P>He went on: "Trade liberalization is an ongoing process. We can
work together to solve remaining issues in bilateral or multilateral
form even after our WTO accession; accession is one of the most
important policies to my country." He also asked the US delegates to
convey to their government the Republic of China's determination to
build up a better and more open economy and to conclude bilateral
negotiations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Addressing the recent financial turmoil in Southeast and East
Asia, he said: "The effects of the currency crisis have been felt not
only in the financial markets of the ROC, Singapore, Hong Kong and
South Korea, but also in stock markets around the world. The Impact
of the financial turmoil on the ROC's economy remains moderate, due
to our sound economic fundamentals and our steady pursuit of economic
liberalization."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CURRENCY CRISIS PROMPTS BEIJING TO SPEED UP ECONOMIC REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will use the opportunity
provided by the currency crisis to improve its economic efficiency
and to "accelerate the pace of economic reforms," mainland Chinese
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Beijing will not devalue the renminbi, Li said, calling this step
unnecessary as long as the mainland government's policies are
pro-investment and pro-business.</P>
      <P>He said that the currency crisis had proven Beijing right in
pursuing a gradual, step-by-step economic reform program, but added
that mainland China would continue to press ahead with reforms and
the opening up of its economy to foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Li made the points when Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
called on him Tuesday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, The
Straits Times reported Wednesday in a dispatch filed from Suzhou.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a Singapore spokesman as saying that their
45-minute talk focused on the impact of the regional currency crisis.</P>
      <P>Lee lamented the harm the crisis had done to a number of Asian
economies and said it was fortunate mainland China had been spared
the fate of countries like South Korea because its currency, the
renminbi, is not fully convertible.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese currency enjoys current account
convertibility; capital account convertibility has been deferred for
several years.</P>
      <P>Turning to the crisis' impact on investments, he stressed the
importance of maintaining investors' confidence in the region.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Lee also commended mainland Chinese economic
progress as "praiseworthy," with visible advancements each time he
visits, the report said.</P>
      <P>Lee's last visit to mainland China was in September last year.</P>
      <P>On the economic task facing mainland China, the mainland Chinese
vice-premier noted that it is "unprecedented," as it involves a
massive transformation of the economy. The two key issues, he noted,
are getting management talent and technology into mainland China.</P>
      <P>Turning to the 15th Communist Party Congress held in September
this year, he told Lee that its most significant outcome was the
affirmation of Deng Xiaoping's reformist ideology as the current
guiding philosophy, the report said.</P>
      <P>He said the congress' final report is a document of consensus,
prepared only after getting the views of all participants.</P>
      <P>The task ahead is to consolidate achievements and speed up
reforms, he added, reiterating that mainland China will remain
pro-investment.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is in mainland China to renew ties with leaders there
and to update himself on Singapore's mainland Chinese investments,
arrived in Suzhou late Tuesday to tour the Singapore-Suzhou
Industrial Park and other facilities in Suzhou Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The highlight of Lee's 12-day visit to mainland China will be
calls on President Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji next
Monday, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA OPPOSED TO DIMINUTION OF US INFLUENCE IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will spend A$5 billion (US$3.4
billion) to increase its military firepower to deal with any emerging
enemy beyond its shores and Canberra is unwilling to see mainland
China's growing power if it means the diminution of the US strategic
influence in Asia, according to an Australian strategic review.</P>
      <P>Releasing the first defense strategic review Tuesday, Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan said Australia would rely on a ring of
electronic early-warning intelligence, including "spy planes" to
identify any threat long before a potential invader could reach the
Australian coast.</P>
      <P>He said the Royal Australian Air Force's strike planes and the
Royal Australian Navy's vessels, equipped with substantially
increased weaponry, would be sent to deal with any such threat.</P>
      <P>The A$5 billion will be used to buy up to seven airborne early
warning and control aircraft, new helicopter-launched strike
missiles, new weapons for the navy's frontline warships and the
upgrade of F1-11 bombers to ensure they remain the main strike weapon
until the year 2020.</P>
      <P>Medium-range missiles for the F1-11 bombers and air-to-air
refueling to extend the combat range of the Air Force's 71 FA-18
fighters to maintain air defense superiority are also on the drawing
board.</P>
      <P>McLachlan said in the past two decades Australia's security
interest was far more tightly focused on the immediate region --
Southeast Asia, the southwest Pacific and the eastern reaches of the
Indian Ocean.</P>
      <P>"We cannot allow our thinking to be influenced by artificial
boundaries. This strategic review re-emphasizes the importance of
northeast Asia to our own security," he said.</P>
      <P>The review warns of a "significant danger" of war breaking out on
the Korean peninsula despite the "clear possibility" of the two
Koreas reunifying within the medium term.</P>
      <P>McLachlan said the reunification itself could have the potential
to create "strategic tensions" in northeast Asia that would need to
be carefully managed.</P>
      <P>He played down any "inevitability" about Australian forces being
drawn into a conflict in the region.</P>
      <P>But he said mainland China was not perceived as a military
threat, notwithstanding its central role in a number of potential hot
spots such as the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's regional ambitions, the strategic review adopts a
cautious approach. It describes the growth of mainland Chinese power
as an important new factor in the strategic equation and adds the
caveat that "it is not yet clear how that power will be accommodated
within the regional community."</P>
      <P>"It would not be in Australia's interests for China's growing
power to result in a diminution of the US strategic influence or to
stimulate damaging strategic competition between China and other
regional powers," the review says.</P>
      <P>"Such competition is not inevitable because the regional
strategic balance need not be a zero-sum game. But there are some --
in China and elsewhere -- who are inclined to see it that way," it
adds.</P>
      <P>McLachlan said another significant factor in Australia's security
is the impossibility of quarantining the rest of the Asian region
from tension in northeast Asia.</P>
      <P>"Today, tensions in northeast Asia -- for example on the Korean
peninsula -- have flow-on effects in Southeast Asia much more
directly than was the case in the 1970s and 1980s," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FUTURE SHOULD BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY: US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US government Tuesday reiterated its
long-standing position that the issue of Taiwan's future should be
resolved peacefully between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>At a regular press briefing, James Rubin, spokesman for the US
Department of State, was asked whether the US government would view
the use of force by mainland China against Taiwan as justified if
Taiwan should declare independence. Earlier Tuesday a spokesman for
mainland China's Foreign Ministry reportedly threatened that Beijing
would resort to force if Taiwan should seek separation from the
Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>In reply, Rubin pointed out that the US position has not changed.
He reiterated that the United States does not support Taiwan
independence or "one Taiwan, one China."</P>
      <P>"What we do support is the resolution of this issue peacefully,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Pressed further to explain if the use of force by Beijing to
prevent Taiwan independence would be justified, Rubin said, "What we
do support ... is the resolution of this issue peacefully; therefore,
we don't support the use of force."</P>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan insists that, contrary to what
Beijing says, it is an independent sovereign country. The nation was
founded in 1912. Its government moved to Taiwan in 1949 after the
Chinese mainland fell into the hands of the Chinese Communists in a
civil war. The ROC has since been in effective control of Taiwan,
Penghu (the Pescadores) and the two offshore islands of Kinmen and
Matsu -- territories that have never been ruled by the Communists.</P>
      <P>In talks between Taiwan and mainland China during past years,
both sides have agreed that there is only one China and that either
side is free to make its own interpretation of what that means.
Beijing claims that Taiwan is "a province of the People's Republic of
China" and favors a "one country, two systems" approach -- a formula
being practiced in Hong Kong -- as the way to resolve Taiwan's
future.</P>
      <P>However, the government in Taipei insists that Taipei and Beijing
are two equal political entities and has favored "one country, two
governments" -- a proposal rejected by Beijing. The ROC government
has dismissed the idea of "one country, two systems" as unworkable
and has stated repeatedly that Taiwan and mainland China can be
reunited only when both sides of the Taiwan Strait are free,
democratic and prosperous.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SIGNS TOURIST PACTS WITH SIX CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Wednesday signed
tourist cooperation agreements with six Central American countries --
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.</P>
      <P>The accords were inked in Taipei by Minister of Transportation
and Communications Tsay Jaw-yang and the heads of the tourism
promotion organizations of the six countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Tsay said the pacts are part of the ROC
government's efforts to deliver promises made by President Lee
Teng-hui during his four-country Latin American visit in September to
boost cooperation with the region in various fields.</P>
      <P>Tsay said Central America is one of the best travel destinations
in the world because of the region's beautiful natural scenery and
rich cultural heritage. "With intensified promotional efforts from
relevant countries, tourist exchanges between the ROC and the region
will increase significantly in the years ahead," he noted.</P>
      <P>Under the newly signed agreements, the signatories agreed to
offer flexible visa services on a reciprocal basis, exchange
tourism-related information, cooperate in marketing and offer
incentives to encourage investment in the development of tourist
resources and facilities.</P>
      <P>The signatories also agreed to upgrade the quality of flight
services and sponsor seminars to work out attractive tour packages.</P>
      <P>The agreements will remain valid for five years, and, if
necessary, can be extended for another five years.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the ROC's Tourism Bureau, local travel
agencies organized a fact-finding visit to Central America earlier
this year, following which they worked out three suitable tour
packages.</P>
      <P>However, local travel agents remain doubtful as to how many
Taiwan tourists those travel packages will actually be able to
attract, since several barriers to expanding tourist exchanges with
the region remain, including geographic distance, language barriers
and expensive travel bills, as well as the fact that most Central
American countries have no budget allocations for promotional
programs.</P>
      <P>According to travel sources, ROC nationals make an average of
2,000 visits to Central American countries a year, with business
people, elected representatives and members of special social groups
forming the largest group of visitors.</P>
      <P>At present, only Costa Rica offers landing visas for ROC
passport-holders. Travel sources said Costa Rica, Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua are considering issuing "joint
travel cards" to prospective visitors, whereby holders of such cards
will be able to visit all five countries without having to apply
separately for permission to enter each one.</P>
      <P>The ROC has already signed aviation agreements with Panama and
Costa Rica, but to date, only Taiwan's EVA Airways operates two
weekly scheduled flights between Taiwan and Panama because of the low
economic value of the route.</P>
      <P>Under the ROC's open-sky agreement with the United States, Tsay
said, Taiwan carriers can also cooperate with American airlines to
open the Central American travel market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>For the first eight months of this year,
the Republic of China's trade with the United States was quite
satisfactory. There should be many more opportunities for American
businesses to participate in ROC government projects on a fair,
competitive basis, Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the ROC-USA Economic
Council, said in San Diego, California, Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the plenary session of 21st Annual Joint Conference
of the ROC-USA Economic Council and the USA-ROC Business Council, Koo
said: "For the first eight months of this year, our trade with the
United States was quite satisfactory, the total two-way trade being
US$34.05 billion, an increase of 9.3 percent over the same period in
1996. Our total export to the United States was US$18.83 billion, an
increase of 7.1 percent. Our total import from the United States was
US$15.23 billion, an increase of 12.2 percent. The trade balance in
our favor was US$3.6 billion, a decrease of 10.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"We believe this health trend in our bilateral business relations
will be kept up in the coming years. The policy of our new Cabinet
will emphasize on transparency in the government, privatization of
state enterprises and a BOT approach in many infrastructure projects.
There should be many more opportunities for American businesses to
participate in our government projects on a fair, competitive basis."</P>
      <P>Koo acknowledged that in recent years there has been a rush of
many countries for investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"From 1979 to 1996, cumulative foreign investment in mainland
China totaled US$175.5 billion. In 1996 alone, total foreign
investment in mainland China was US$41.7 billion, of which US$21.3
billion, or 50.95 percent came from Hong Kong and Macau; US$3.7
billion, or 8.82 percent from Japan; US$3.5 billion, or 8.33 percent,
from Taiwan, US$3.4 billion, or 8.25 percent from Singapore; US$1.4
billion or 3.25 percent, from South Korea; and US$1.3 billion, or
3.12 percent, from Britain," he said.</P>
      <P>Koo, however, added: "Because of inefficiency and corruption in
the government, it is not very easy to run a profitable business
operation on mainland China. Indeed, a significant number of foreign
investments in (mainland) China have ended badly.</P>
      <P>"Now that our cross-strait relations with mainland China seem to
be on the mend, there should be increased business relationships
between two sides. There should be many good opportunities for
American industries, especially high-tech industries, to use Taiwan
as a regional operations center for expansion of business to mainland
China, as well as to other Asian markets. They can not only avoid
unnecessary risks (through) indirect investment in mainland China,
but also take advantage of the trained manpower and much more
favorable investment climate in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He continued: "Taiwan's economy in the current year is fairly
encouraging. The forecasts for our GDP growth in 1997 range from 6.2
percent to 6.7 percent, as compared with 5.71 percent in 1996. The
driving force for the growth is an over 10 percent growth in private
sector investment.</P>
      <P>"Construction of infrastructure projects, which fell way behind
schedule, has gradually caught up with targets. Domestic consumption
has considerably increased as a result of the bullish stock market
and a mild upturn of the prices of real properties in the first three
quarters of the year. The CPI increased by less that 2 percent, and
the unemployment rate remains at about 3 percent.</P>
      <P>"All real economic indicators, including industrial production
export growth and private sector investment, show signs of steady
improvement. The upswing of the economy is expected to continue into
the next year (at) a moderate pace. The forecast for 1988 is a GDP
growth rate of no less than 6.5 percent.</P>
      <P>"The financial sector fared quite well for the first seven months
of the year. The stock market registered robust growths, and the
money supply also went up to the Central Bank's target level."</P>
      <P>Although he noted that the financial crises in ASEAN countries
and South Korea have had an impact on Taiwan's financial market, he
said: "Taiwan's economy is on a more solid foundation than the ASEAN
countries.</P>
      <P>"While the ASEAN countries are suffering from negative growths in
exports because of competition from mainland China, we still enjoy a
trade surplus. Since we have a large foreign exchange reserve, we
don't have foreign debt burdens, nor do we have to rely on short-term
international hot money. As our exchange rate is not pegged to the US
dollar, our currency is not over-valued like the currencies in some
of the ASEAN countries.</P>
      <P>"All these factors help us withstand the impact of the Asian
currency crises with considerable success."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ECONOMICS MINISTER ADDRESSES ROC-US BUSINESS CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Diego,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Although we are faced with many
challenges brought on by changes in both the domestic and
international economies, these challenges can also be viewed as
opportunities to break out of the current bottleneck in our economic
development," ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang said in
San Diego on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the plenary session of the 21st Joint Conference of
ROC-USA Economic Council and the US-ROC Business Council, Wang went
on: "The next few years will be critical to our efforts to bring our
economic development to its full potential. This period will provide
an unmatched opportunity for developing and implementing constructive
solutions to the problems that face us. At the same time, we must
bear in mind that in an increasingly interdependent world, no country
can remain prosperous and stable unless people everywhere enjoy
similar benefits.</P>
      <P>"Looking to the 21st century, we will actively seek cooperation
with international enterprises to develop the ROC into an
Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Center. We hope that by building on
our existing strong and vibrant foundation, we will be able to join
the ranks of fully developed countries by the year 2000. We also hope
that by that time, we will have met the following objectives:</P>
      <P>-- A gross national product of US$440 billion.</P>
      <P>-- A total production value of US$300 billion for the
manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>-- A total export and import volume that exceeds US$300 billion.</P>
      <P>-- A per capita GNP that exceeds US$20,000."</P>
      <P>He said: "We recognize these are ambitious goals, but we believe
they are within our reach. I am proud to say, in the case of Taiwan,
that our reach is consistently oriented to the future and toward
goals that will create more prosperity for our people. We look
forward to working with our many American partners in pursuing these
aims and in identifying new directions for our economy. The ROC and
the US have successfully explored many areas for cooperation in the
past. I am confident that this will be no less true in the future."</P>
      <P>In his speech, Wang also noted: "Generally speaking, our economic
performance in 1997 has been promising in spite of the recent
financial turmoil brought on by currency crises in Southeast Asia.
Further expansion of the global economy should ensure that our export
growth remains buoyant. With work on major infrastructure projects
proceeding at an accelerated pace, as well as the effect of the
various measures that have been taken to spur investment, our economy
is expected to grow at a rate of about 6.17 percent."</P>
      <P>He also listed the promotion of liberalization, improvement of
the basic infrastructure, enhancement of administrative efficiency,
upgrading of local industries and heightening of the ROC's
competitiveness as current challenges to the ROC's economic
development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1997 SET TO BE SINGAPORE'S HOTTEST YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>1997 is set to be Singapore's hottest
year ever, or at least since weather records started being kept here
in 1929.</P>
      <P>The Singapore Meteorological Service said Tuesday that this
year's annual mean temperature is likely to be 28.2 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>For the last 36 years, the mean was 26.8 C.</P>
      <P>1997 will also be the first year that Singapore's mean
temperature exceeds 28 C, a rise of three degrees from about three
decades ago, when the average temperature hit 25.2 C one year.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Meteorological Service said that actually
four of the five warmest years on record have all been in this
decade, including the year the mean temperature hit the previous high
of 27.6 C.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that a lack of rain, and clouds induced by El Nino
are driving temperatures here up.</P>
      <P>And it is not just Singapore that is feeling the heat, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Britain's Meteorological Office said last Thursday that the
earth's temperature is set to hit its highest level this year since
global records began in 1860, with the average temperature 0.43
degrees Celsius higher than the 1960 to 1991 average.</P>
      <P>The El Nino phenomenon is caused by a warming in southern Pacific
waters. It occurs with varying strength every two to seven years,
lasts up to 18 months and affects weather patterns all over the
world.</P>
      <P>It last hit Singapore in 1994. This year, it contributed to the
haze which affected the entire region.</P>
      <P>The Meteorological Service spokesman said that the dry weather
conditions are expected to last into the first half of next year as
El Nino will peak around April before tapering off.</P>
      <P>A return to near normal weather conditions is expected only in
the second half of next year, he added.</P>
      <P>While light northeast monsoon winds have begun to be felt, the
total rainfall during the monsoon months (late November to the
following March) is still expected to be below normal.</P>
      <P>This has been the case for the last 11 months, which saw monthly
rainfall at more than 80 percent below normal levels in four months:
January, March, July and September.</P>

      <P>US President Bill Clinton has sent a
letter to participants in the 21st annual joint business conference
here of the ROC-USA Economic Council and US-ROC Business Council,
commending them for their efforts to promote closer and expanding
trade and business ties between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Clinton wrote: "The theme of your conference, 'Charting a New
Course for US-Taiwan Business: New Game, New Rules, New
opportunities,' reflects your awareness of the growing business
opportunities for US companies as Taiwan liberalizes its trading
regime, privatizes state enterprises and develops as a center for
business in the Asia-Pacific region. We strongly support a greater
role for American firms in Taiwan's development to help reduce our
trade deficit and to stimulate ever closer economic and business
ties.</P>
      <P>"During my four visits to Taiwan, I saw for myself the economic
miracle and democratic evolution that have occurred there --
important developments that have contributed to Taiwan's growing role
in the international community. As you know, I have just returned
from the very successful APEC Leaders Meeting in Vancouver, where we
made further progress toward our shared vision of free trade in the
Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan played a vital part in that meeting and
is deeply involved in negotiations designed to overcome the final
obstacles to entry into the World Trade Organization as a developed
economy.</P>
      <P>"As you meet to discuss past accomplishments and plan for the
challenges of the coming year, I commend you for your efforts to
promote closer and expanding trade and business ties between our two
peoples. You are helping to build a brighter future for us all."</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOHN CHANG VOWS TO REBUILD CONFIDENCE IN KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, ROC vice premier and secretary
general-designate of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), on Wednesday vowed
to rebuild public confidence in the party after its major setback in
last week's local election of city mayors and county magistrates.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a press conference after the KMT
Central Standing Committee approved him to replace Wu Poh-hsiung, the
outgoing secretary general who tendered his resignation on Saturday
to take responsibility for the party's stunning election losses.</P>
      <P>The KMT managed to win only eight out of 23 seats up for grabs,
while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took 12 seats
and the remaining three went to independent candidates.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the party needs to rebuild confidence, stressing
that the "fundamentals of the party are still good."</P>
      <P>Chang also said that a period of party soul-searching is needed
in the wake of the defeat, but emphasized that now is not the time
for criticism or finger-pointing. Demands from some quarters that KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui step down will not change the difficult plight
the party is in, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Chang said that the KMT is determined to walk out
of the shadow of Saturday's humiliating defeat, and will actively
prepare for next year's legislative elections, while at the same time
injecting new blood into the grand old party.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT must present itself as a young, vibrant and
hopeful party.</P>
      <P>Vowing to mingle with the public to hear the true voice of the
people, Chang said the party will be seeking to provide more services
to women, youth, and minority groups, as well as continuing to push
for party-to-party diplomacy.</P>
      <P>He placed special emphasis on KMT efforts to attract Taiwan's
youth, who he said have gradually turned their backs on the KMT in
recent years in favor of other parties.</P>
      <P>Chang, 55, who is to formally take over his new position on
Friday, has previously served as the director general of the KMT's
Department of Overseas Affairs and as ROC Minister of Foreign
Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KUEISHAN ISLET TO BE PARTIALLY OPENED FOR SIGHTSEEING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense has
tentatively agreed to partially open the offshore Kueishan Islet for
sightseeing trips, Ilan County Government sources said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Defense Ministry demanded that the new opening measure should
not affect the Republic of China's national security and that only a
limited number of tourists be allowed to land on the scenic islet at
designated locations during specified periods of time, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>The islet, also known as Turtle Mountain Islet for its
turtle-shaped appearance, is located in the Pacific Ocean just nine
nautical miles north of Toucheng Township, Ilan County, on Taiwan's
northeast coast.</P>
      <P>The highly protected islet is replete with natural scenery and
resources, according to previous field surveys. Ecologists said the
islet has more than 300 kinds of plants and a wide variety of birds.
Its surrounding waters are also a fertile fishing ground. Even more
special is that the islet has two rare inland lakes.</P>
      <P>The islet was designated a military-controlled area in 1977, and
troops have been stationed there ever since. Civilians have not been
permitted to visit without permission from military authorities.</P>
      <P>For years, the Ilan County Government has pushed the armed forces
to open the islet for sightseeing purpose. In line with the
government's liberalization policy, the Defense Ministry has recently
agreed to allow visitors under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>The Ilan County Government has formed a special task force to
work out a comprehensive tourism resources development plan. Members
of the team are scheduled to make an inspection visit to the Kueishan
Islet in the near future.</P>
      <P>According to a study by Professor Chung Wen-ching of Tunghai
University, the islet can be opened to ecologists and students for
research purposes. In addition, Chung said, a limited number of
sightseers can also be allowed to make short-term visits to the
islet.</P>
      <P>The Ilan County Government said it plans to permit only two
yachts, carrying a combined total of about 200 people, to tour the
islet daily in the initial stage to avoid damaging its natural
environment or affecting national security.</P>
      <P>Legend has it that the Kueishan Islet was first inhabited during
the reign of Emperor Hsienfeng in the Ching Dynasty (1644-1911). In
1888, Christian priest Mackay toured the islet and confirmed that
there was a Han Chinese village there. The islet was put under the
jurisdiction of the Ilan County Government following the end of
Japanese colonial rule in 1945. Civilian residents were all relocated
to Toucheng Township in 1977 when the military took control of the
islet.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung,   central   Taiwan,   Dec.   3  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Osteoporosis, a
progressive deterioration of bone mass that often accompanies old
age, has been found by researchers at China Medical College (CMC) to
be closely related to kidney vacuity syndrome, or kidney deficiency.</P>
      <P>Detecting the close relationship of the two conditions through a
series of clinical tests, doctors at CMC Hospital began to administer
a newly developed kidney supplement to osteoporosis patients. They
were amazed to find that the rate of bone-mass deterioration among
patients was significantly slowed within a half-year after treatment
began.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Ya-ying, an internal medicine specialist at CMC
Hospital, the kidney supplement, a compound of traditional kidney
remedies and extracts designed to strengthen bone mass and bone
structure, has been clinically proven effective in slowing
osteoporosis, particularly among post-menopausal women aged over 50.</P>
      <P>After taking the supplement for about six months, patients
suffering from such afflictions as back pain, stiffness in the waist,
weak knees and fatigue, showed considerable improvement. And it was
also found that the loss of bone mass had slowed significantly, Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>Sophisticated meauring devices indicated that bone-mass density
among patients who had taken the supplement for only six months had
dropped 0.8 percent, as compared with an average annual drop of 2
percent to 6 percent among post-menopausal women in general, she
said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the supplement, currently administered in tablet form,
is especially recommended for serious osteoporosis patients, breast
cancer patients, women who suffer multiple kidney vacuity syndromes,
and post-menopausal women who are unable to take estrogen, a widely
used hormone that helps to maintain bone mass.</P>
      <P>The supplement is also recommended to the general public, both
men and women, since bone mass density of ordinary people begins to
deteriorate by an average of 0.75 percent annually after they reach
the age of 35 or 40, she added.</P>

      <P>Police on Thursday were investigating the
cause of a fire which killed four female workers, including three
Filipinos, at a plant in the Nantzu Export Processing Zone (NEPZ) in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>The four workers were identified as Chen Fu-mei, a native of
Taiwan, and Mary Ann Bartocome, Filipina Mampata and Jahei Abello,
all from the Philippines. The women were employees of Lite-On
Automotive Corp.</P>
      <P>Police said that more than 20 night-shift workers were on duty
Wednesday evening at a facility owned by Lite-On, which specializes
in manufacturing vehicle security systems and cruise control
mechanisms. At around 8:10 p.m. the smell of smoke was detected and
workers spotted flames on the third floor of the three-story
building.</P>
      <P>Lite-On officials said the 15-year company had 230 employees,
among which 48 were Filipinos. Chen, who was working on the first
floor of the facility, was apparently overcome by smoke inhalation
while attempting to notify fellow employees on the second and third
floors about the fire.</P>
      <P>Firefighters put out the fire at 9:57 p.m. Lite-On officials
estimated property losses at about NT$30 million (US$923,076). The
plant will be unable to resume operations for a short period of time,
they added.</P>
      <P>The blaze was the most serious fire in several years at the NEPZ,
which had celebrated its 31st anniversary on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei said
Thursday that it is still waiting for the final police report on the
investigation into the cause of the fire before issuing a statement
or filing a request for compensation on behalf of families of the
deceased Filipino workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN TO REMAIN UNCHANGED: AIT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Diego,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Philip Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US policy toward Taiwan will remain
unchanged in the wake of a recent summit meeting between President
Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the top US
liaison officer with Taiwan said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Taipei-Washington-Beijing trade and
economic relations, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman
Richard Bush said the United States looks forward to establishing a
constructive strategic partnership with mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, Bush stressed, it is a long-term goal, not an existing
reality.</P>
      <P>He further explained that a strategic partnership is not
tantamount to an alliance, not to mention a military alliance.</P>
      <P>The partnership will only provide for foreign policy cooperation,
Bush said. For example, the US must cooperate with mainland China in
the four-way Korean Peninsula negotiations.</P>
      <P>Anyway, Bush said, the proposed strategic partnership will be
constructive and won't target any country.</P>
      <P>Bush said President Clinton had taken advantage of his meeting
with the top mainland leader to reaffirm his administration's "one
China" policy under which the US will not support Taiwan
independence. Clinton also called for an early resumption of dialogue
across the Taiwan Strait to resolve their disputes peacefully and
maintain stability in the region.</P>
      <P>Bush said the Clinton administration has fully considered
Taiwan's interests in its engagement with mainland China.</P>
      <P>He further said the US government has made many efforts to let
its Taiwan friends understand that there has been no change in the US
policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization
(WTO), Bush said the Clinton administration welcomes ROC Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang's planned visit to Washington, D.C., early
next month for a new round WTO talks with relevant American
officials. The US is one of the three WTO members which have yet to
finalize bilateral talks with the Republic of China on its WTO
accession terms.</P>
      <P>Bush is currently in San Diego to attend the annual joint
conference of the ROC-USA Economic Council and the US-ROC (Taiwan)
Business Council being held here.</P>
      <P>AIT was founded by American authorities in 1979 to handle
relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA WILL BE MORE HEEDFUL OF DPP: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities, who have cast
a watchful eye upon the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) since its
inception, will be more heedful of the pro-(Taiwan) independence
party's conduct in the future, a mainland scholar said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Xin Qi, a fellow with the Beijing-based Peace and Development
Research Center, said the Communist leadership will pay more
attention to the DPP, now that its political strength has been
greatly enhanced following a landslide victory in the Nov. 29 local
elections across Taiwan. "But that does not mean mainland China's
opposition to Taiwan independence will be changed," he noted.</P>
      <P>In a commentary carried in Thursday's edition of the Hong
Kong-based Wen Wei Po, Xin said the DPP's rising political power in
Taiwan will by no means weaken Beijing's sovereignty claim over
Taiwan or shake its determination to seek peaceful reunification
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Xin, a cross-strait affairs expert who has visited Taiwan many
times for academic research, said the Beijing authorities have kept
themselves well informed of Taiwan's political environment, and they
are well prepared to meet any circumstances arising across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>In the article, headlined "It takes time for the DPP to become a
ruling party," Xin said Beijing has noted the DPP's willingness to
communicate with mainland Chinese authorities, its intention to work
out a pragmatic mainland affairs policy, and its ambition to carve
out a new explanation of its Taiwan independence platform.</P>
      <P>Beijing cannot afford to ignore the DPP, in the hope that
cross-strait relations will develop in a stable and peaceful manner,
and that the goal of reunification can eventually be reached, Xin
noted.</P>
      <P>"The last thing we want to see is that the residents of Taiwan
are subjected to a catastrophe resulting from causes that we all know
very well," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIEX DELEGATION VISITING US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By J.J. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With an ever-increasing influx of
investors into the local stock market, a three-member delegation from
the Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) is currently in the United States
to study measures in force to protect stockholders there.</P>
      <P>Chen Li-ching, deputy director of the Taiex Trading Department,
said here that Taiex has instituted a NT$1.03 billion (US$31.69
million) fund to protect investors in the local bourse. However, there
are currently no laws in effect to ensure legal protection to
stockholders.</P>
      <P>She noted that Premier Vincent Siew formed a task force on
financial reforms shortly after taking his post on Sept. 1, and that
assuring the rights of investors through the implementation of
relevant laws has been one of the top priorities for his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The Taiex delegation has visited the offices of Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. and the New York Stock Exchange in recent days. It will fly next
to Washington, DC, to visit the Securities Investor Protection Corp.
(SIPC) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>SIPC, founded in 1970, regularly monitors the financial situation
of listed and over-the-counter companies. When symptoms of insolvency
regarding a particular company are detected, the SIPC will request
relevant information through the Securities Exchange Commission
(SEC). If all indications point to a financial crisis, it will ask
local courts to liquidate the company in question.</P>
      <P>In such cases, small investors will be given first priority in
the allocation of the failed company's assets.</P>
      <P>The Taiex delegation will return to Taipei on Friday to report on
its findings.</P>
      <P>In the future, Taiex may send groups on similar missions to other
financial hubs such as London and Tokyo, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT PERSONNEL CHANGES TO BE COMPLETED IN 2 WEEKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Pi-huang, director-general of the
Kuomintang's Department of Cultural Affairs, said Thursday that
personnel changes within the party should be completed in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that he has offered his resignation to KMT
Secretary-General-designate John Chang, who will officially take over
the post Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that "this would be the best time to go," though his
departure will be up to his superiors.</P>
      <P>The ruling KMT suffered a stunning defeat in Saturday's mayoral
and county chief elections. The KMT only managed to take eight seats,
while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party won 12 of the 23
posts up for grabs. The remaining three went to independent
candidates.</P>
      <P>Amid soul-searching by the KMT in the wake of Saturday's setback,
the party's campaign strategy has come under particular fire from KMT
members</P>
      <P>Tsai admitted that the party's campaign lacked an effective
strategy, saying that he tried to focus 90 percent of the campaign on
the performance of the KMT, and the remaining 10 percent on attacking
candidates from other parties. He said that because the media played
up the 10 percent, the public was not fully attuned to the
performance of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that he has expressed his intention to take a long
leave or assume a different position, and stressed that he will fight
for the KMT in whatever post.</P>
      <P>Faced with such a major defeat at the polls, Tsai said that the
KMT's most urgent task is to regain the voters' confidence in the
party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS DIVIDED OVER CABINET RESHUFFLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's two major opposition parties are
divided over whether the Cabinet should be reshuffled after the
ruling Kuomintang suffered a major setback in last weekend's
nationwide mayoral and magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>While the pro-(Taiwan) independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) sees no need for a Cabinet reshuffle, the pro-(China)
unification New Party wants an immediate shakeup.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-fang, New Party whip in the Legislative Yuan, said he was
disappointed by Premier Vincent Siew's announcement on Wednesday that
he will not consider any personnel changes until a comprehensive
year-end evaluation of each Cabinet member's performance is
completed.</P>
      <P>Lin said the KMT's embarrassing defeat in last Saturday's local
elections for government chiefs was an unmistakable sign that the
electorate is dissatisfied with the overall performance of Siew's
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"Since local voters have used their ballots to signify their
assessment of the Cabinet performance, I see no reason for Siew to
hesitate in making a personnel reshuffle," the outspoken lawmaker
stressed.</P>
      <P>The KMT won only eight of the 23 top local government posts up
for grabs in last Saturday's elections, while the DPP garnered 12
mayoral and county magistrate posts and the three remaining seats
went to independents.</P>
      <P>In addition to the election returns, Lin said, Siew can also
refer to a series of recent public opinion polls to determine whether
the performances of various government departments have met public
expectations.</P>
      <P>"For the well-being of all people, the New Party legislative
caucus demands the premier make a major Cabinet reshuffle
immediately," Lin insisted.</P>
      <P>He also listed several criteria for Siew's reference in choosing
new Cabinet members: accountability, professionalism and
youthfulness.</P>
      <P>Commenting on press reports that former Interior Minister Lin
Feng-cheng may succeed John Chang as vice premier, Lin urged Siew to
forsake such an idea. He pointed out that Lin Feng-cheng had stepped
down from his post only a few months ago, in large part because law
enforcement agencies under his ministry had failed to solve several
high-profile criminal cases.</P>
      <P>He said Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao would be a much more
suitable person to fill the position to be vacated by Chang, who has
been tapped to replace Wu Poh-hsiung as KMT secretary-general. "Liao
has spared no efforts to fight crime since assuming his post in
1996," Lin said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Chen Ting-nan, DPP whip in the legislature,
said the KMT's latest election rout had nothing to do with the
government's administrative system. "My observation is that KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui's obstinacy, intraparty infighting and lax
party discipline were to blame for the party's defeat," Chen
asserted.</P>
      <P>"It is the KMT itself, not the Cabinet, that should undergo an
internal reshuffle or restructuring," Chen said, adding that KMT
party workers should not try to evade responsibility by blaming
Cabinet ministers for the party's election flop.</P>
      <P>Chen further pointed out that the DPP owned much of its electoral
victory to the KMT's intraparty rifts. "DPP candidates would not have
won in five cities or counties if rivaling factions within the KMT
had not presented their own candidates in those constituencies," he
observed, adding that the number of total ballots the DPP garnered
in the elections increased only slightly more than 1 percent as
compared with the similiar elections held four years ago.</P>
      <P>Chen said the DPP headquarters should do its utmost to assist
all newly elected DPP mayors and magistrates to overcome
various difficulties and work out innovative strategies to
resolve such chronic thorny problems as garbage disposal, traffic
congestion and mounting violent crime. "Otherwise, the DPP would
suffer setbacks in a series of elections to be held in the coming
years."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FIVE-DAY WORKWEEK SYSTEM TO BE POSTPONED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed five-day workweek system, which
the Republic of China government had proposed to fully implement by
the year 2000, is likely to be postponed.</P>
      <P>The legislative Committee for Organic Laws has passed an
amendment to the governmental employees' services law, establishing a
legal basis for the planned system. However, no exact date for full
implementation of that practice was set in the amended law as a
result of opposition to an earlier target date of Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>One of the opposing voices was sounded by Schive Chi, vice
chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD),
which has been charged with developing the five-day workweek system.</P>
      <P>He explained that his council originally planned to put the
system into full effect by the end of the year 2000, when Taiwan's
per capita gross national product (GNP) is expected to reach
US$20,000 from the current US$13,000. Attainment of that income level
is regarded by the CEPD as a proper juncture for the island to allow
employees two days off each workweek.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official said, it is now impossible to keep
that timeframe as the eruption of the Southeast Asian financial
crises in July has undermined the nation's economic progress.</P>
      <P>The financial storm was not merely attributable to the New Taiwan
dollar's depreciation, but also slowed down Taiwan's economic growth,
which, according to the latest CEPD assessment, can now only be
expected to reach 5.5 percent yearly. Thus, Taiwan's per capita GNP
is unlikely to rise to US$20,000 by 2000, Schive said.</P>
      <P>The CEPD estimates that Taiwan will probably only register a per
capita GNP of approximately US$16,000 by Jan. 1, 2001, Schive noted.</P>
      <P>The economics expert said he believes the government should work
to implement the planned five-day workweek system on a gradual basis,
with workers being given a day of rest on alternating Saturdays. He
cited the case of Japan, a highly developed economy wherein it took
11 years to completely put the practice into effect.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the island's economic growth continues on a stable
track, Schive said he prefers to maintain the partial five-day
workweek until Taiwan reaches the level of US$20,000 per capita GNP,
irrespective of the original target date for full implementation of
the system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DOESN'T HOLD BACK FOREIGN BUSINESSES FROM M'LAND INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Diego, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative in
the United States reassured businessmen Wednesday that the ROC's
policies do not prevent foreign businesses in Taiwan from taking full
advantage of opportunities arising in the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>"Our 'no haste, be patient' policy is directed only toward Taiwan
businesses that might be considering investing very substantial
amounts of capital in strategically important industries on the
Chinese mainland. The policy is not a sanction against all Taiwan
investment on the mainland. Rather, it is an effort to reduce the
risks incurred by that investment," Stephen Chen, ROC Representative
to the US, said while speaking at a seminar on US-ROC-mainland China
economic and business relations.</P>
      <P>"It is hard to be good trading partners when one side reserves
the option of using violence against the other whenever it sees fit.</P>
      <P>"When it comes to mainland China, we are compelled to put
national security ahead of trade and investment on our list of
priorities. Such vigilance would not be necessary if the PRC
renounced the use of force against us and acknowledged our sovereign
status in the international community. Until it does, we must
judiciously manage our trade and investment with the mainland, so
that the PRC cannot gain critical leverage over our economy, our
well-being or our destiny."</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government had "no choice but to take action"
when it noticed that 40 percent of outward investment by Taiwan
businesses in recent years had been directed toward mainland China
and that the size of each investment project was growing larger and
larger.</P>
      <P>"This new policy is aimed not at preventing investment in the
mainland but at monitoring and regulating it so that it better
reflects the economic and political risks involved," he explained,
noting that while the government discourages Taiwan businesses from
investing heavily in infrastructure and heavy industry on the
mainland, it places no restrictions on small and medium-sized
investments.</P>
      <P>"So far the policy seems to be working. While the total value of
Taiwan investment in mainland China fell slightly between January and
June of this year, the number of investments actually increased by 22
percent. In effect, Taiwan businesses are investing in mainland China
at nearly the same rate as before, but their investments are more
diffuse and thus less risky. In other words, we are avoiding putting
all of our eggs into one basket."</P>
      <P>Chen continued: "My government still believes that the major
hurdle to greater interaction and eventual reunification between
Taiwan and the mainland is the difference between the political
systems and the ways of life of the two sides. Only by narrowing such
differences can the two sides naturally reach reunification based on
democracy, liberty and prosperity.</P>
      <P>"The ROC government has been consistent in its mainland policy,
with a strong desire to construct peaceful and stable cross-strait
relations through exchanges and negotiations. This is why we are
hoping for an early resumption of dialogue through private sector
counterparts."</P>
      <P>The US-ROC-mainland China Economic and Business Relations Seminar
is one of 12 seminars of the 21st joint conference of the ROC-USA
Economic Council and USA-ROC Business Council being held at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel in San Diego. Speakers at the seminar also include
Richard Bush, chairman and managing director of the American
Institute in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ACTIVELY TAKING PART IN WORLD DE-MINING MOVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang &amp; Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is welcome to take part in the Ottawa
Process II, the non-governmental activities following this week's
signing of a world convention against land mines by 125 governments,
relevant Canadian officials said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan may not have an opportunity to become a signatory
of "The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,
Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their
Destruction," the officials said, pointing to unspecified political
reasons, the island can contribute to related efforts, including by
helping Cambodia and Afghanistan restore their economies and be swept
clean of mines, and by aiding victims of the devices.</P>
      <P>Delegates of two private organizations from Taiwan -- the Eden
Social Welfare Foundation and the Anti-Land Mine Network of Taiwan --
are currently in Ottawa, waiting to take part in the non-governmental
land mine action forum slated to kick off on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-chuan, head of the Eden Social Welfare Foundation, said
his group began its efforts related to the world's land mines last
year. The foundation launched a fund-raising drive in March,
successfully collecting enough money to purchase 1,000 wheelchairs,
which have already been distributed to mine victims in Afghanistan
and Cambodia, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lin, himself a wheelchair user, said his organization plans to
raise enough funds next year to purchase 10,000 more wheelchairs, and
that he will announce the plan in person to the Ottawa gathering.</P>
      <P>Lin said he hopes that other Asian nations and areas will
organize their own anti-mine societies to contribute their efforts in
the region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he told CNA that his initiative to hold an
international conference in Taiwan has received a favorable response
from the delegates of many countries, including Belgium, Canada and
Mozambique.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-JAPAN ECONOMIC CONFAB OPENS IN TOKYO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 22nd trade and economic cooperation
conference between the Republic of China and Japan opened in Tokyo
on Thursday, with the widening trade gap between the two countries
as a major topic.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening session, Leijiro Hattori, chairman of the
Japanese Interchange Association (JIA), said he admires the ROC
government's proper measures in coping with the recent Asian
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Hattori said two-way trade between the ROC and Japan totaled
US$33.8 billion in the first 10 months of this year, down 1.3
percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Due to a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic that hit Taiwan's
hog ranches in mid-March and a slowdown in the Japanese computer
market, Taiwan's exports to Japan plunged 13.4 percent in the
10-month period, while Japan's shipments to Taiwan still managed to
post a 4.8 percent gain.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current trend, Hattori said, the total amount of
this year's ROC-Japanese trade will be almost same as last
year's.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hattori said Japanese enterprises invested a
total of US$708.8 million in the January-October period, marking a
nearly 80 percent year-on-year rise. The amount was also the highest
since 1990.</P>
      <P>Hattori said Japan will continue to promote trade and economic
cooperation with the ROC in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lin Chin-ching, chairman of the ROC's East Asian
Relations Association (EARA), said he is delighted to see bilateral
commercial exchanges continue to grow even after the two
countries suspended formal diplomatic ties in 1972.</P>
      <P>However, Lin expressed his regret over the fact that Japan still
would not send ministerial-level officials to attend the annual
bilateral economic conference.</P>
      <P>Lin also expressed concern about Taiwan's swelling trade deficit
with Japan, reaching US$14.05 billion in the January-October
period.</P>
      <P>Japan has banned imports of pork from FMD-stricken Taiwan
since March, resulting in a substantial drop in the island's
agricultural exports to Japan this year. Moreover, Japan's overall
economic slowdown and a hike in its consumption tax have further
hindered ROC exports to that country. Taiwan's trade deficit with
Japan registered a 23 percent jump in the 10-month period, and the
total imbalance could reach a record US$17 billion by year's end,
Lin noted.</P>
      <P>He said the issue has become a major concern in Taiwan. "We hope
Japan will pay more heed to the issue and help the ROC expand its
exports to the Japanese market by offering preferential tariff rates
and lifting its import ban on Taiwan pork."</P>
      <P>Lin also urged Japanese companies to invest more in Taiwan's
capital- and technology-intensive industries for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Lin headed a 19-member delegation of EARA and ROC
government officials to attend the two-day meeting. In addition to
JIA officials, several section chiefs and their deputies from
Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of International Trade
and Industry and Ministry of Agriculture were also present at
Thursday's meeting. The agenda includes about 30 topics.</P>
      <P>EARA and JIA are founded by their respective governments to
handle bilateral exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S TOYOTA AGENT TO RECALL US-MADE 1997 CAMRYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hotai Motor Co., the Taiwan importer of cars
made by Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., announced Thursday that it has
decided to recall all 7,096 US-made 1997 Toyota Camrys on the island
due to a problem with the ignition lock.</P>
      <P>The lock, technically the key interlock solenoid, sometimes
allows the ignition key to be removed even when the car is not in
park, according to a recent wire service report.</P>
      <P>If left in neutral, the car can coast. If it is in drive or
reverse, it can lurch upon starting, the report indicated, saying
that all 280,000 1997 Toyota Camrys manufactured in the United States
will be recalled.</P>
      <P>A Hotai spokesman said that letters on the recall will be sent to
local consumers on Dec. 18, while work on replacing the faulty
devices with good ones will not start until Dec. 22.</P>
      <P>The spokesman noted that although not all 1997 Camrys -- which
were built between June 29, 1996 and July 31, 1997 -- have a
defective ignition lock, his company still decided on a complete
recall in order to assure safety.</P>
      <P>Toyota said 27 customers had reported faulty locks and that these
devices had resulted in six minor accidents but no injuries,
according to the report.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(FCO) on Wednesday expressed regret over the murder in the northern
English city of Manchester last month of a student from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>David Coates, director of the FCO's Far Eastern and Pacific
Department, also asked the ROC's representative office in London to
convey condolences to the parents of Chang Chun-yu, 29, a doctoral
candidate at Manchester University's Sciences and Engineering
Institute, who was robbed and killed on the night of Nov. 22.</P>
      <P>Coates said the FCO has demanded that the Manchester local
authorities handle all the affairs relating to the murder in the
proper manner.</P>
      <P>In addition, Coates said, Manchester University has decided to
confer a posthumous doctoral degree upon Chang and to set up a
foundation in his memory.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office in Britain said it will keep a
close watch on follow-up developments and will offer all the
necessary assistance to Chang's family.</P>
      <P>Manchester police authorities said all four suspects involved in
the case have been arrested and charged with robbery and murder.
Chang's body will be returned to his family in six weeks' time, in
accordance with British law.</P>
      <P>Although British law permits the victims of violent crime or
their family members to demand compensation from the attackers, the
four defendants are all described as penniless, which means it may be
difficult for Chang's parents to obtain compensation from them.</P>
      <P>A British fund for the victims of violent crime has already
agreed to pay compensation of ten thousand pounds sterling to Chang's
family, while the ROC representative office said it has decided to
hire a lawyer to seek a higher amount.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIETARY GUIDELINES SAID CONFUSED AND CONTRADICTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dietary guidelines published around the
world are confused, contradictory and may even be bad for many
people, according to a new survey by the Associates for Research Into
the Science of Enjoyment (ARISE) in Sydney.</P>
      <P>The guidelines by the food faddists -- people dedicated to the
elimination of fat and all other nasties from their diets -- are
seemingly taking over the world and making people miserable,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey, published by mass-circulation newspaper The
Australian on Thursday, showed the guidelines highlight some absurd
differences between the recommendations on food and wine consumption
in 21 countries.</P>
      <P>The survey asks how Americans can be allowed seven to 14 eggs a
week, yet Italians are told to have only two or three. And why is it
safe for French and Italian women to consume more alcohol than
Australian men?</P>
      <P>The research shows Australian dietary standards recommend men
consume a maximum of 20 standard drinks a week. This is more than the
United States, Finland and Sweden, but far less than Denmark (25
drinks), Italy (28 drinks) and France (42 drinks).</P>
      <P>Consumption levels for women are lower in all countries but
authorities in France believe women can safely consume 25 standard
drinks a week, five more than Australian men.</P>
      <P>When it comes to eggs, the World Health Organization allows 10
eggs a week, the Australian Heart Foundation and official U.S.
dietary guidelines recommend seven, but authorities in Germany
suggest three or less.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that salt is another ingredient that stimulates
disagreement, with Germans recommending a maximum of 10 grams a day,
the United States and the UK six grams, and Australia just 2.3 grams.</P>
      <P>Dr. Dale Atrens of the University of Sydney said the scientific
and medical communities were guilty of overstating the importance of
diet to health and making people feel guilty over a glass of wine or
a chocolate. "We are moving to this post-modern age of living in fear
of some of the things which are really fun and good for us," he said.
"We have become frightened of our own appetites," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SEES STRONG GDP GROWTH OFFSET BY ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's economy has picked up
vigorously, with growth at an annualized rate of 6 percent in the six
months to September, but Federal Treasurer Peter Costello admitted
the strong recovery will be clipped by the recent economic crisis in
Asia, particularly South Korea.</P>
      <P>But worries over a slowdown in Australian exports to Asia,
particularly to its second largest trading partner -- Korea -- sent
the Australian currency down to 4-year lows because many believed
Asian countries would reduce their imports from the country.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar on Wednesday closed at 67.51 US cents, down
0.20 US cents from Tuesday's closing level.</P>
      <P>The gross domestic product grew by a faster than expected 1.5
percent in the third quarter of 1997, lifting the annual growth to
3.6 percent from 3.1 percent in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Economists said Australia's GDP growth during the past six months
was 5.9 percent -- the fastest since 1993 -- and they believed the
Reserve Bank of Australia would have to put on hold any official
interest rate cuts in light of such high growth.</P>
      <P>Costello said the strong showing would help the government to
achieve its GDP growth target of 3.75 percent in fiscal 1997-98,
which ends in June next year.</P>
      <P>But he warned that the Australian economy could be affected by
the recent Asian economic crisis in the next fiscal year starting
July 1998.</P>
      <P>"There will be an effect, particularly as a consequence of
Korea," he said. "Korea is a very serious situation. A downturn in
South Korea will have a more significant effect on Australian
exports," he added.</P>
      <P>Korea is the second largest trading partner for Australia, buying
about A$7.1 billion worth of coal, iron ore, natural liquefied gas,
and other products from Down Under between July 1996 and June 1997.</P>
      <P>Costello attributed the strong growth to successive interest rate
cuts between July 1996 and July 1997 during which the Reserve Bank of
Australia reduced its official rate to 5 percent from 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>He said the growth lift reflected the delayed impact of cuts to
interest rates by the central bank.</P>
      <P>"The (interest rate) cuts in 1996 were, I think, just starting to
come on stream at the end of 1997 and will be felt more so in 1998,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Economists said whether the Australian GDP can grow beyond 4
percent in fiscal 1998-99 depends on how the recent Asian crisis will
eventually affect Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US COMMERCE OFFICIAL SUPPORTS CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Diego,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Peter Hale, the United States acting
deputy assistant secretary of commerce, said Wednesday that Taiwan
has been at the forefront of Asia's phenomenal economic growth, which
has created vast opportunities for US firms.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 21st Annual US-ROC Business Council and ROC-USA
Economic Council, Hale said "in recognition of Taiwan's trade and
commercial strength, the United States has actively supported
Taiwan's participation in multilateral economic forums."</P>
      <P>"In the early 1980s," he continued, "the United States helped
Taiwan to continue its membership in the Asian Development Bank. In
1991, we helped Taiwan enter APEC, together with China and Hong Kong.
Since 1992, we have been working for Taiwan's accession into the
World Trade Organization."</P>
      <P>On opportunities for trade and investment, Hale pointed out that
Taiwan's successful transition to a more mature, competitive economy
from the manufacture of simpler, labor-intensive goods to the
production of more sophisticated capital- and technology-intensive
goods has created a booming consumer and industrial market for a full
range of goods and services.</P>
      <P>"In its quest to reposition itself as a potential regional center
for multinational business operations, Taiwan authorities have taken
a number of steps to improve the investment climate, especially for
service industries. Most ownership restrictions in the securities
trading, insurance and banking industries for example have been
removed. In its negotiations to enter the WTO as a developed economy,
Taiwan has committed to bringing its trade and investment regimes
into full compliance with international standards."</P>
      <P>He said, "one of the key elements of our bilateral commercial
relationship with Taiwan is the interest of US companies in
participating in its extensive infrastructure development effort.
With over US$100 billion in project expenditures anticipated over the
next decade, US firms are eager to enter this market."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's efforts to privatize a number of sectors, most notably
power generation and telecommunications, have also created potential
opportunities for American companies. US firms have been selected to
participate in seven independent power projects, although obtaining
financing has been something of a problem. In the telecom area,
consortia including US companies won four of the eight mobile phone
licenses announced in January of this year.</P>
      <P>"A number of our market access concerns with Taiwan, including in
the agricultural area, are being handled through the process of WTO
accession. The full range of trade issues has been under discussion:
tariffs, nontariff measures, services, agriculture, intellectual
property issues, investment measures, technical barriers to trade,
government procurement and civil aircraft."</P>
      <P>He also said, "Our two peoples continue to enjoy a long and
prosperous association, I commend the U.S.-ROC and ROC-USA Business
Councils for providing this invaluable forum for dialogue and
commerce. Our mutual commitment to trade and international
entrepreneurship has enabled both of us to benefit.</P>
      <P>"I can assure you that the United States wants to continue our
commercial engagement with Taiwan as it moves forward economically.
Our firms stand ready with their world-class experience to assist
Taiwan in achieving its economic goals."</P>

      <P>The Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) and North Korea resumed talks in New York on
Wednesday in search of a protocol concerning quality assurance and
warranties in connection with the light-water reactor (LWR) project
through which KEDO will supply two nuclear reactors to Pyongyang.</P>
      <P>The talks, being held at the headquarters of KEDO in New York,
are a continuation of an earlier round of discussions on this
protocol which took place in North Korea last Nov. 4-11.</P>
      <P>During the first round of discussions, both sides made progress
and conducted their meetings in a businesslike and professional
manner, an official of the KEDO said.</P>
      <P>The LWR project has been in construction since last August when
it officially broke ground for site preparation in Kumho, South
Hamgyong Province, on the east coast of North Korea.</P>
      <P>The KEDO delegation to the protocol talks consists of members of
the organization's secretariat and representatives from KEDO's
executive board member countries, including the United States, Japan,
South Korea and the European Union.</P>
      <P>KEDO was founded in 1995 for implementing most of the "Agreed
Framework" signed by the United States and North Korea in 1994.</P>
      <P>The Agreed Framework addresses international concerns about
nuclear activities in North Korea. If implemented, it will assure
both North Korea's full compliance on its safeguards agreement with
the International Atomic Energy Agency and the complete dismantlement
of those aspects of North Korea's nuclear program, including
reprocessing-related facilities, that have undermined the viability
of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime and the

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin has tried his best to burnish his image in the Western world, a
Canadian journalist who "had the luck" to interview him last week
says: "Don't be fooled."</P>
      <P>Marcus Gee, international affairs columnist for The Globe and
Mail, and two other colleagues were the first Canadian journalists
ever to interview Jiang.</P>
      <P>Gee, writing in the Wednesday edition of the Mail, said although
Jiang has learned to flash a little leg while overseas, he remains "a
doctrinaire Communist politician whose spoken views have not been
changed a whit by his encounters with placard-waving Canadian
protesters or noisy Canadian journalists."</P>
      <P>Despite ardent courting by Western leaders, Canada's Prime
Minister Jean Chretien in the lead, Beijing's tough line on political
dissent has barely wavered since Jiang assumed the presidency in
1993, Gee emphasized. Thousands of mainland Chinese still languish
behind bars for their political beliefs, he noted.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that although life for most Chinese on the
mainland is better, and freer, than it has been since 1949, "their
government still denies them the most basic rights." "It struck me as
we interviewed Mr. Jiang that no Chinese journalist (who was around)
would be allowed to ask him even the polite questions we put to him,"
Gee added.</P>
      <P>He saw a bit of communist sophistry worthy of Leonid Brezhnev
when Jiang told an Ottawa press conference that mainland China's
constitution already guarantees freedom of assembly, speech and
demonstration. Like Brezhnev before him, Gee said, Jiang quickly
added that those rights don't give people license to "create chaos."</P>
      <P>In the views of Beijing's leaders, stability without democracy is
better than democracy without stability. What they fail to see is
that "the two are linked," Gee commented. His reason: A government
that rests on the consensus of the governed is far more stable, in
the end, than one that rests on the power of the gun.</P>
      <P>The 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square only bottled up the
dangerous discontents of mainland Chinese society, he pointed out. If
Beijing keeps them bottled up, without any democratic release valve,
it is far more likely that the mainland will return to chaos that all
Chinese rightly fear, Gee said.</P>
      <P>"Despite his cuddlier image," he concluded, "the new Jiang seems
no closer to understand that than the old."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND MEDIA UNDERGOING CHANGES DESPITE GOV'T CONTROL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Dec.  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The news media of mainland China have
been undergoing substantial changes in content and format since
Beijing launched reform programs in 1979, although the government
still controls the media with a heavy hand.</P>
      <P>More than 90 journalists from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan have participated in a four-day seminar on
journalism here, which ended Thursday.</P>
      <P>In mainland China, it is still the responsibility of all mass
media to report "positive news." Reporting "negative news," such as
social violence or irregularities, may bring them trouble,
not to mention criticism of the government and government officials,
according to a mainland Chinese participant in the seminar.</P>
      <P>He told CNA that, in mainland China, freedom of the press is
totally overwhelmed by "media's social responsibility" and "national
interests."</P>
      <P>Despite tight government controls, the mass media of mainland
China have grown substantially since 1978, he said.</P>
      <P>The number of newspapers in mainland China increased from 186 in
1980 to 2,163 in 1997; radio stations increased from 93 in 1978 to
1,244 in 1996, and TV stations from 32 in 1978 to 872 in 1996. Their
advertising revenue also jumped 580 percent from 1992 to 1996,
according to the materials distributed at the seminar. But no exact
amount of the ad revenue was given.</P>
      <P>Financially, the news media had to completely rely on government
subsidies before, and now advertising revenue has become one of
the major financial resources of them, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that ideological materials and government
propaganda have long made the contents of news media very boring,
and the audience abhor them.</P>
      <P>In order to woo the audience with a purpose to increase
circulation and advertising income, the news media have gradually
changed the content and format.</P>
      <P>Take the newspaper for example, to the "positive news" they
added economic news and many other news of human interest. In
addition to regular issues, many of them publish various kinds of
supplements. New formats have also been introduced in order to make
their newspaper less prosaic, he said.</P>
      <P>TV news always enjoy high rating, because it is the major source
of information to the mainlanders, he added.</P>
      <P>The mainland participant also said that Taiwan's news media are
abusing their freedom of the press, causing damages to national
image and to the whole society.

    <HEADLINE>HORMONE TREATMENT SHOWS RECOVERY OF LOST BONE MASS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hormone treatments given to transsexuals
are revealing valuable medical information about the long-term
effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on women after
menopause.</P>
      <P>Studies on Singapore's transsexuals have helped to show that HRT
results in replacing some of the loss in bone mass that usually
occurs after menopause, something no other study has shown so far.</P>
      <P>This was disclosed Wednesday in a lecture at the opening of the
Ninth Congress of the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies in
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Professor Victor Goh of the National University of Singapore
talked about his study on 80 female transsexuals who had none or less
than the recommended amount of hormones for about one to eight years
after their sex change operations, in which their ovaries or testes
were removed.</P>
      <P>As a result, some had lost as much as 35 percent of their bone
mass.</P>
      <P>But when male hormone replacement therapy was restarted, he found
that all were able to regain some of their bone mass by an average of
7 percent, and in one case, by as much as 15 percent, after about one
and a half years.</P>
      <P>The study was published this year in the international journal
Maturitas.</P>
      <P>Goh said that the studies using transsexuals had implications for
both menopausal women and men with little or no testosterone.</P>
      <P>After their sex-change operations, male and female transsexuals
do not secrete any more sex hormones. They can be considered as being
in a surgically-induced menopausal state, he said.</P>
      <P>He also discussed the usefulness of the transsexual model in
studying the direct effects of male and female hormones on
cholesterol levels.</P>
      <P>In another study published in the same journal last year, Goh
confirmed what other studies have implied: that male hormones can
raise the level of bad cholesterol, or LDL, and lower the level of
good cholesterol, or HDL.</P>
      <P>He found in a study of about 40 female transsexuals that after a
year of male hormone therapy, their LDL levels were raised and HDL
levels lowered. In a related study, he also found that the HDL levels
went up and the LDL levels dropped in about 30 male transsexuals on
long-term female hormone therapy.</P>

sentence and one jail term of 57 years for his role in a series of
violent crimes that sent shock waves through Taiwan society earlier
this year.</P>
      <P>A prosecutor at Panchiao Prosecutors' Office said on Thursday
that following an exhaustive investigation into Chen's alleged
criminal activities, he has been indicted for abduction, murder,
rape, robbery, infringement of personal freedom and interference with
police duties.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Shih Liang-po said that the prosecutors' office is
demanding four death penalties for Chen's alleged involvement in four
abductions and murders, including the kidnap-murder of high school
student Pai Hsiao-yen in April; the murder of plastic surgeon Fen
Pao-fan, his wife and a nurse at Fen's clinic in October; the
abduction of Taipei County councilor Tsai Ming-tung for a ransom of
NT$5 million in June; and the kidnapping of businessman Chen

      <P>For Chen's holding hostage the family of South African military
attache Col. McGill Alexander in November, the first case of its kind
in Taiwan, the prosecutors' office is seeking a life sentence, said
Shih.</P>
      <P>Chen is also being held responsible for at least 18 rape cases
reported in Taipei over the course of the six months he was on the
run after Pai's kidnap and murder, Shih said, adding that the rape
cases, along with possession of firearms and attacks on police, have
prompted the prosecutors' office to demand an additional jail term of

      <P>The DPP, which won a landslide victory in last Saturday's local

      <P>The European Commerce Association in Taipei issued a statement

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CONFIRMS TARIFF EXEMPTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has confirmed that it will
extend tariff exemptions on capital goods imports for some
foreign-funded businesses, a measure intended to encourage flagging
foreign investment, according to reports from the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The State Council, mainland China's cabinet, has decided to allow
duty-free imports on capital goods and equipment for foreign-funded
projects approved before March 31 last year, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The exemptions will cover imports of equipment and materials
considered part of an enterprise's investment.</P>
      <P>The government in Beijing canceled the system of tariff
exemptions from April last year, prompting strong opposition from
foreign businesses in mainland China which faced as much as 40
percent increases in the cost of importing machinery and equipment.</P>
      <P>The grace period for foreign-funded projects valued at less than
US$30 million was to lapse at the end of this year and projects worth
more than US$30 million were to receive the special treatment until
the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>Contracted foreign investment fell 38.8 percent in the first nine
months of 1997 to US$34.2 billion, while actual foreign investment
has grown, but at a slower pace than last year.</P>
      <P>In the same January-September period, a total of 15,067 foreign
investment projects were approved, down 19.9 percent compared with
the year-earlier period.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese government will reintroduce the tax breaks
for foreign companies importing capital goods into the country,
placing particular emphasis on high technology businesses, the WTO
report added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Children's Fund announced on
Thursday that it has handled a total of 5,151 cases involving abused
children aged from newly born to 14 years over the past seven years,
according to a report in Thursday's edition of the United Evening
News.</P>
      <P>The newspaper quoted a fund spokesman as saying that the number
of abused children in Taiwan has been rapidly increasing in recent
years, with the figure rising from 425 cases in 1990 to 967 cases in
1996.</P>
      <P>According to the fund, 43.3 percent of the 5,151 abused children
were seriously neglected by their parents, adversely affecting their
mental and physical development and leading many to turn to a life of
crime or vagrancy.</P>
      <P>Some 40 percent suffered serious physical abuse and torture,
including being burned by cigarettes, forced to eat excrement, or
being beaten into unconsciousness or even to death, it added.</P>
      <P>The most alarming finding, according to the fund, is the rapid
increase in the number of cases of sexual abuse against children,
adding that while it received reports of 40 cases of sexual abuse
against children in 1990, the figure more than doubled, to reach
around 100 last year.</P>
      <P>Most of the cases were of children being violated by their

    <HEADLINE>'SURVIVAL' TOPS ALL PRIORITIES IN CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: HUANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ensuring the Republic of China's sustainable
existence and continued development is the top priority in
cross-strait relations, said Huang Kun-huei, secretary-general to the
president, on Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang, in a discussion held on the eve of the National
Unification Council (NUC) conference, outlined the government's
stance on cross-strait relations, saying that the ROC shall first
seek to consolidate and secure its current position before further
liberalizing its mainland policies.</P>
      <P>Huang said Beijing has long schemed to "pressure the Taiwan
government through the private sector," and "constrict Taiwan's
political maneuverability through trade and commerce."</P>
      <P>Beijing has also adopted a two-pronged approach toward Taiwan --
presenting a guise of goodwill to Taiwan residents, particularly the
business community, on one hand, and stifling every pragmatic
initiative within the international community on the other, Huang
pointed out.</P>
      <P>He stressed that in formulating mainland policy, the government
cannot cater solely to the needs of particular groups, it must also
uphold the interests of national security and the overall public
welfare.</P>
      <P>Until Beijing alters its fundamental attitude toward Taiwan,
Huang noted, it is vitally important for the island to maintain its
"no haste, be patient" policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Byron Weng, a member of the NUC Research Committee and a
professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, proposed that
authorities from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait jointly establish
an official "Chinese Cross-Strait Joint Council" to promote mutual
exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Weng's proposal, however, was not favorably received by several
of the committee members, who said the creation of such a body is
premature and that the overall environment is not favorable at the
present time.</P>
      <P>Those members, who sided with Huang on the desirability of
continuing the "no haste, be patient" approach, suggested the
government define that policy more clearly so as to forge a greater
consensus among the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP DELEGATION TO LEAVE FOR US VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-profile delegation of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will leave for the United States
on Saturday for a publicity tour.</P>
      <P>The delegation will be headed by the party's outspoken chairman,
Hsu Hsin-liang, and comprises several heavyweight party officials.</P>
      <P>The visit has long been planned, but has drawn increased
attention following the party's resounding win in last weekend's
nationwide mayoral and county magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>The delegation will visit New York, Washington, D.C. and Los
Angeles to publicize the party's basic stances on major
Taiwan-related issues.</P>
      <P>During its stay in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 8-9, the group will
meet with senior officials of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
which was founded by American authorities in 1979 to handle relations
with the Republic of China in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>AIT Chairman Richard Bush is expected to arrange for Hsu to meet
with officials of the US State Department, the White House and the
Defense Department. The levels of those officials remain unclear.</P>
      <P>Local media quoted DPP sources as saying that the DPP delegates
will exchange views with US officials on Taiwan's latest
general political situation. They will also explain the party's
stance on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The sources said Hsu may meet with Stanley Roth, assistant
secretary for East Asian &amp; Pacific affairs, and other senior
US officials in charge of East Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Parris Chang, also a member of the
delegation, will deliver a speech at Georgetown University on the
pro-(Taiwan) independence party's blueprint for the future of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While in Washington, the delegation will also meet with senior
executives of several noted American think tanks, and give a news
conference at the Foreign Press Club. In addition, the group will
take part in a call-in forum at the DPP's US East Coast Headquarters.</P>
      <P>The delegation will also visit South Korea and Japan before its
return to Taipei in the latter half of this month.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the delegation's departure, several DPP lawmakers
urged Hsu to exercise caution and self-restraint in his words and
deeds during his US visit.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers, including Shen Fu-hsiung, Lee Ying-yuan, Yen
Chin-fu, Tsai Ming-hsien and Lin Tze-fu, made the appeal at a joint
news conference held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Hsu is known to support a "bold westward expedition" policy
toward mainland China, which advocates further liberalization of
investment on the mainland and opening of direct trade, mail and
transport links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The five DPP lawmakers urged the party chairman to abide by five
principles, or "two wants and three no's," whenever touching upon
cross-strait issues during his upcoming US visit.</P>
      <P>They reminded Hsu that in the eyes of the Chinese Communists,
Taiwan is a "renegade province," and that the People's Republic of
China is a one-party, totalitarian country.</P>
      <P>They also demanded that Hsu's remarks concerning cross-strait
relations should avoid giving the international community the
erroneous impression that cross-strait issues are exclusively Chinese
internal matters.</P>
      <P>The legislators further stressed that "China-related" statements
made by any DPP members during the visit should only reflect their
personal views and should not be interpreted as representing the
party's formal stance.</P>
      <P>Shen, a medical doctor turned lawmaker, said cross-strait
relations are crucial to Taiwan's survival. "All local political
parties should deal with the issue prudently," Shen said, adding that
the DPP should first forge an internal consensus on the issue before
taking any concrete steps to contact the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>Shen further said the DPP should not rashly begin to conduct any
party-to-party talks with the Chinese Communist Party before a
specialized and informal dialogue mechanism is established.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan sailor was killed by a drunken man
on the streets of Cape Town, South Africa, the Republic of China
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday, adding that the
suspect has turned himself in to South African police, who are
handling the case.</P>
      <P>The sailor, identified as Cheng Jung-chun, was the first mate on
the "Hao Yi No. 212" fishing boat, which is currently anchored in the
Cape Town harbor. Cheng reportedly left the vessel with a group of
friends on Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>In the early hours of Thursday morning, Cheng got into a heated
argument on the street with a drunken local man, who stabbed and
seriously wounded the Taiwan sailor. Cheng later died of his injuries
after being rushed to a local hospital.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Y.Y. Wu told the press in Taipei that his ministry
has received a report on the incident from the ROC's
Consulate-General in Cape Town, adding that the consulate has been in
contact with relevant South African law enforcement authorities on
the status of the investigation.</P>
      <P>Wu said the consulate-general will provide any assistance within
its means to help Cheng's family members handle matters arising from
his death.</P>
      <P>He noted that Cheng's sister had been touring South Africa at the
time of the unfortunate incident and that she hopes to be able to
return to Taiwan with the sailor's cremated remains after all
necessary procedures have been completed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR CALLS FOR VIGILANCE AGAINST COMMUNIST INFILTRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese communist regime has never ended
the work of its secret agents in and against Taiwan even though
private exchanges across the Taiwan Strait have been substantially
liberalized, a legislator representing the Taiwan Independence Party
(TAIP) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a routine meeting of the national affairs forum held
at the Legislative Yuan, Legislator Chen Wen-hui (TAIP-Miaoli) called
for concerted efforts by the government and the private sector to
ward off further Chinese communist infiltration.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted two local dailies as reporting that more than 70
officers of mainland China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), some
ranked as high as major-general, have snuck into Taiwan over the last
two years to collect intelligence and conduct subversive activities.</P>
      <P>PLA agents have infiltrated Taiwan through a myriad of means,
including by disguising themselves as stowaways on fishing boats,
mainlanders visiting relatives in Taiwan, or specialists and pundits
coming to the island for cultural exchange programs, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Mainland intelligence authorities have also set up a workshop for
underworld figures who flee Taiwan for mainland China and
irresponsible Taiwan businessmen and immigrants to turn them into
mainland agents, Chen reported, noting that such turncoats can speak
the Taiwanese dialect and not act like outsiders in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taking the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park as an example,
Chen noted that the flagship of Taiwan's high technology sector has
been visited frequently by visitors from abroad, among them many from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>He urged companies in the park to beef up their security measures
so as to prevent high-tech know-how and commercial secrets from being
stolen, which he said could in turn jeopardize Taiwan's overall
high-tech development in the future.</P>

      <P>Hsu Chieh-kuei, chairman of the Council of

      <P>Some of the representatives of business enterprises proposed at
the meeting that foreign labor not be restricted to originate in
Southeast Asian countries but be expanded to include mainlanders.</P>
      <P>Hsu was quoted as saying that he has not been opposed to the idea
of introducing mainland labor into Taiwan, noting that since both
sides of the Taiwan Strait use the same language, communication
between both sides would be relatively easy. However, since the issue
involves Taipei's policy toward Beijing, any such move should first
acquire the consent of the MAC, stressed Hsu, adding that as soon as
the MAC agrees, the CLA will undertake the plan accordingly.</P>
      <P>Hsu indicated further that the CLA will suggest that the MAC open
Taiwan's labor market to mainland workers when the time is right.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew of the Republic
of China said in an article published by Los Angeles Times Thursday
that the people on Taiwan have worked hard for 50 years to avoid
being put under communist rule, and that their rejection of
communism should not be interpreted as an advocacy for "Taiwan
independence."</P>
      <P>Siew said in the article that "under the leadership of President
Lee Teng-hui, we have successfully carried out a process of internal
democratic reform. Today, we have developed into a fully liberated,
vital open society."</P>
      <P>Siew said "Today, Taiwan is the second largest source of external
investment on the Chinese mainland. Every year residents of Taiwan
make more than a million trips to the mainland for business and other
purposes. Taipei and Beijing have already held 17 rounds of
semi-official talks and signed several agreements."</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, what we have done in goodwill has only met with
military intimidation, diplomatic suppression, and threatening
invective from Beijing."</P>
      <P>"The government and the 21 million people on Taiwan have labored
hard for the past 50 years so as not to be absorbed into a communist
system under the Hong Kong model," Siew said, adding that "Our
rejection of the communist system is in no way tantamount to the
advocacy of so-called 'Taiwan independence' or the establishment of
'two Chinas.'" "We simply prefer democracy and peaceful means of

      <P>"China's reunification can be peacefully achieved only if both
sides face the reality of a 'divided China' and embark on discussions

      <P>"In the long run, only a China unified under a democratic and

      <P>Chicken embryo hearts are likely to prove
instrumental in enabling heart attack victims to avoid the need for
transplants if pioneering Australian research is successful,
according to mass-circulation newspaper The Australian on Friday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that, following a heart attack, human cells
are destroyed and do not regenerate. But researchers at the Griffith
University in Brisbane say they are hoping their work can eventually
trigger a process whereby heart cells are reproduced.</P>
      <P>They are looking at cell formations in the hearts of chicken
embryos and seeking to isolate a gene which could help produce more
cells.</P>
      <P>They said the technique has far-reaching ramifications for heart
attack victims who either require heart transplants, or in less
serious cases, have to carry on with the permanent damage.</P>
      <P>Dr. Wayne Murrell, the head of the research team, was quoted as
saying that the genes in question will be located in the hearts of
chicken embryos and mouse embryos before tests are performed on
humans.</P>
      <P>He said once the genes involved in the development of a chicken's
heart have been isolated, they will be tested for their ability to
direct other chicken cells to become heart cells.</P>
      <P>"We have developed a molecular biology technique for identifying
genes that are turned on when cells in the chicken embryo become
heart cells," Murrell said.</P>
      <P>"By developing an understanding of this molecular process, we

other cells in a patient to form new heart cells," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Dec.   5   (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gambling is increasingly driving
Australians broke, with a rise of over 50 percent in gambling-related
bankruptcies in 1996-97, according to a new survey.</P>
      <P>The survey by accounting house Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu shows
bankruptcies due mainly to gambling have moved into the top 10
contributing factors in some instances.</P>
      <P>The survey shows bankruptcies due to "gambling or speculation"
rose 56 percent in 1996-97 financial year, compared with a 26 percent
rise for all other bankruptcies.</P>
      <P>A Deloitte spokesman said while the figures were coming off a low
base -- up from 255 to 398 in a total of 21,830 cases -- a definite
upward trend was appearing.</P>
      <P>He said New South Wales residents were more likely to experience
financial problems from gambling than were Queenslanders and
Victorians.</P>
      <P>"Gambling is a thing to watch," he said.</P>
      <P>"While these figures are still low, there is an increasing upward
trend. These figures could well underestimate the real problem
because many people are embarrassed to admit gambling as a problem,"
he added.</P>
      <P>"A high percentage of the 32 percent increase in nonbusiness
bankruptcies relate to those who are unemployed or not earning an

      <P>In 1997 alone, two large casino complexes were opened in
Melbourne and Sydney and they are described as the biggest gambling
dens in the Southern Hemisphere.</P>
      <P>Altogether there is at least one casino in each major city in
Australia, making a total of about 14 nationwide.</P>
      <P>"Gambling was already a problem similar to those associated with
alcohol and addiction," said Lucy Limbers of the St. Vincent de Paul
Society.</P>
      <P>"It is contributing factor to homelessness and family breakdown
which we witness in the problems we deal with in our family refuges
and homeless men's refuges. There is definitely a causal link and an
increase in our workload," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SLOW GROWTH EXPECTED FOR REGION'S AIR TRAFFIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ongoing currency and economic turmoil
in Asia will slow the growth of air traffic and affect the purchase
of new aircraft in the region, warned Dr. Cheong Choong Kong, deputy
chairman and chief executive officer of Singapore Airlines.</P>
      <P>But the devaluation of Asian currencies, which accompanied the
crisis, has made these countries more competitive and attractive to
tourists. It has boosted the region's exports and increased air cargo
volumes, he told aerospace experts at Pulau Langkawi, Malaysia on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cheong was quoted as saying at the Langkawi International
Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition: "Businesses and consumers are now
poorer. Some are poorer and wiser, some simply poorer. Either way,
it's reasonable to assume that there will be some slowdown in traffic
growth in the immediate future, especially in intraregional travel."</P>
      <P>But he was optimistic that the slowdown will be short in
duration, and that growth would remain solid by international
standards. This is because Asia, with its rising living standards and
expanding international trade, will still be one of the
fastest-growing aviation markets in the world, he said.</P>
      <P>Cheong, however, acknowledged that the economic crisis would have
an impact on purchases of new aircraft, particularly those by
airlines which were cash-strapped, or were government-supported and
had to compete with other national priorities for funding.</P>
      <P>He said that airlines might turn to more cost-effective ways of
acquiring new aircraft, such as leasing.</P>
      <P>Another area which could suffer because of government cutbacks
was investment in airport infrastructure. It was estimated last year
that Asian countries would spend about US$150 billion on new or
upgraded airports over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>Cheong said he hopes these projects will not fall prey to
spending cuts because of the regional economic difficulties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROCKETTES TO STAY AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a deal that secures the Rockettes and
the Radio City Christmas Spectacular as fixtures on Manhattan's
holiday calendar, Tishman Speyer Properties said Wednesday that it
had leased Radio City Music Hall to the Cablevision Systems
Corporation, which plans to renovate the famed Art Deco theater and
use it for televised performances.</P>
      <P>The agreement puts an end to speculation that the Rockettes and
the Christmas pageant would be moved or put out of business.</P>
      <P>Cablevision, which is also a co-owner of Madison Square Garden,
said it planned to spend $25 million renovating the 65-year-old
concert hall.</P>
      <P>By agreeing to purchase rights to the Rockettes, a troupe that
first performed as the Missouri Rockets in St. Louis before opening
the Radio City Music Hall in 1932, Cablevision is giving new life to
one of New York City's more enduring entertainment institutions.
While the troupe is sometimes viewed by New Yorkers as an
anachronism, the Rockettes continue to draw large crowds of tourists
every holiday season.</P>
      <P>Although precise terms were not disclosed, executives involved in
the transaction said Cablevision had signed a 25-year lease on the
hall for about $13 million a year.</P>
      <P>James Dolan, the chief executive officer of Cablevision, said
Wednesday that the transaction would provide opportunities to expand
the company's broadcasting operations. In a partnership with NBC, the
company already owns several cable networks, including American Movie
Classics and Bravo, and holds a controlling interest in Madison
Square Garden, the Knicks basketball team and the Rangers hockey
franchise.</P>
      <P>He said the television studio that the company planned to install
in Radio City would be capable of broadcasting advanced
high-definition television programs and would make the hall's stage a
venue for more television programming.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENGHU BANS SHELL FISHING TO SAVE CORAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The local government on Penghu (the
Pescadores) on Friday announced a wholesale ban on the gathering of
lithophaga, a saltwater shellfish, in an effort to save rift coral.</P>
      <P>Lithophaga, a great delicacy in seafood restaurants both on the
offshore islands of Penghu as well as on Taiwan, use rift coral as
their habitat, sheltering themselves in the natural protection of
coral trees, according to Chen Chao-lun, a researcher at Academia
Sinica's Institute of Zoology.</P>
      <P>The dark tea-colored shellfish exude a certain chemical similar
to an acid to enable them to penetrate the skeleton of the rift coral
and affix themselves there, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In order to harvest lithophaga, Penghu shellfish gatherers smash
the upper parts of the coral skeletons to reach the delicacy.</P>
      <P>With demand increasing as a result of booming tourism on Penghu
and seafood restaurants in Taiwan, harvesting of lithophaga has
increased, resulting in catastrophic damage to coral, which is
quickly diminishing in waters off Taiwan, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC Coral Reef Association, the Taiwan area's
coral population -- including rift coral, which grows mainly in
shallow waters, and jewelry coral, which mostly lives in ocean waters
between 600 and 3,000 meters deep -- is facing unprecedented damage
as a result of myriad reasons, including over-fishing and
environmental pollution.</P>
      <P>If the trend isn't reversed, the association warned, the coral in
waters near Taiwan will face extinction in 20 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO EASE TRADE EXCHANGES WITH OUTER MONGOLIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission
(MTAC) on Friday agreed "in principle" to ease restriction on trade
between Taiwan and Mongolia.</P>
      <P>MTAC Chairman Kao Koong-lian said that in the future Taiwan
businessmen need only apply for ordinary import permits for bringing
in goods from Mongolia, and will no longer be bound by regulations
governing imports from mainland China.</P>
      <P>MTAC officials said the move was made out of pragmatic
considerations, adding that the government will continue to regard
Mongolia as a part of the national territory of the Republic of China
politically, but will henceforth differentiate that area from the
rest of the Chinese mainland in economic affairs.</P>
      <P>The barriers governing imports from Mongolia will be
significantly lowered, while investment proposals in Mongolia will be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the officials said. They pointed
out that the scale and range of such investments do not presently
pose many impediments to local businessmen anyway, because of the
low-level of Taiwan investment in Mongolia.</P>
      <P>The MTAC convened a meeting with Taiwan entrepreneurs in early
November, during which the businessmen urged the government to ease
restrictions on trade exchange with Mongolia.</P>
      <P>To gain more trade opportunities for Taiwan businessmen and to
promote bilateral exchanges, the MTAC favored a less-restrictive
trade policy toward Mongolia, commission officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials added that they will not rule out signing a trade
investment guarantee agreement with authorities in Ulan Bator to
further protect the interests of Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Kao noted that outer Mongolia has implemented a series of reforms
since 1990, and that it has made tremendous progress in implementing
political democracy and a free market economy, putting it in stark
contrast with mainland China.</P>
      <P>For several decades, the ROC government has considered Mongolia
to be part of its national territory as a region of mainland China.
Accordingly, economic activities with Mongolia by Taiwan businessmen
have been regulated under the Statue Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, which was
implemented on Sept. 18, 1992.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yiin
Chii-ming said Friday that Bayer Taiwan Co. has applied to invest in
Taiwan according to the law and that the government will give it full
support.</P>
      <P>Yiin was responding to remarks by Taichung County
Magistrate-elect Liao Yung-lai, who made a campaign pledge to conduct
a referendum to decide the fate of a proposed investment in a
petrochemical plant in Taichung Harbor by the German conglomerate.</P>
      <P>Liao's words have caused great concern at the European Council of
Commerce and Trade, which has asked the government to explicitly
express its stance.</P>
      <P>Yiin said Bayer has applied to invest in the nation, and that the
government supports any firm that invests in Taiwan according to the
law here.</P>
      <P>He said that there is no legal basis for the referendum. If the
result of a referendum were to decide the fate of an investment
project, this would set a bad example and damage the image of local
government, he said.</P>
      <P>Since businesses naturally assess risks and possible profits
before making an investment, the government should provide a stable
and predicable investment environment, Yiin said, adding that if a
local government were to change that policy abruptly, it would hurt
future foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Bayer's NT$50 billion (US$1.53 billion) investment project in a
plant in Taichung Harbor is scheduled to have a production capacity
of 100,000 tons of TDI. The first stage of construction work has
passed an environmental assessment, and Bayer and Taichung Harbor
authorities are now discussing land rental.</P>
      <P>An executive of Bayer said earlier in Hong Kong that the project
is expected to start construction next year.</P>
      <P>Local reports quoted Bayer President Horst Mueck as saying
that the investment project has been approved by the ROC government
and that he had not been told beforehand that the fate of a private
investment should hinge on the result of a referendum. If Taichung
County insists on such a move, Bayer will not rule out withdrawing
its investment, Mueck said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHANGES GUARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) changed its
general manager of day-to-day affairs on Friday, with John Chang, the
only surviving son of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo, replacing
Wu Poh-hsiung as party secretary general.</P>
      <P>The changeover ceremony was presided over by President Lee
Teng-hui, who concurrently serves as KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Lee expressed his hope that Chang will
lead the party from under the shadow cast by the KMT's latest
election rout and into an even brighter future for the party.</P>
      <P>Lee praised Wu for his devoted service during his 16-month tenure
as KMT secretary general. "Wu assumed his post at a time when the KMT
faced rigorous challenges. With his sincerity, candidness, diligence
and entrepreneurial spirit, Wu has managed to lead the party members
in carrying out various KMT restructuring projects and faithfully
implementing major party policies," Lee said.</P>
      <P>"Although the KMT suffered a setback in the recent local
elections, Wu's achievements in reforming the party apparatus are
evident and significant," the president said, adding that he hopes Wu
will continue to serve the country and the party as one of his senior
advisers and as a member of the KMT's decision-making Central
Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to describe Chang's rich experience in party and
government affairs, as well as his practical experience in electoral
affairs.</P>
      <P>"With his profound knowledge, exuberance and can-do spirit, I'm
convinced that Chang will be able to lead the party in taking on all
the challenges which lie ahead," he said.</P>
      <P>In a stepping-down address, Wu said he remains a KMT stalwart,
despite his departure from the secretary general post. He also
apologized for his failure to help the party win more seats in last
weekend's nationwide mayoral and county magistrate elections. "I
earnestly hope that all party members will stand united and work
vigorously for the party's resurgence," Wu said, adding that the KMT
can no longer endure any intraparty schisms or factional infighting.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chang, who until Thursday served
as vice premier, said KMT comrades should not be daunted by the
recent election setbacks. "We should just pick ourselves up from
where we fell," a spirited Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang, who quit his former post as minister of foreign affairs as
recently as October to assume the vice premiership, said he feels
honored to have the opportunity to serve as the party's secretary
general. "Frankly speaking, I also feel a bit anxious because the new
job also carries a heavy mantle of responsibility. I'll do my utmost
to meet the party's expectations," he added.</P>
      <P>Following the changeover ceremony, Chang immediately met with
members of the media to explain his work plans. He said the KMT is a
party which belongs to the people. "Although I was born in mainland
China, I have lived in Taiwan for nearly 50 years," he said, adding
that it's unfair to consider him unsuitable for the top KMT post
simply because of his mainland origin.</P>
      <P>Chang, who can speak Taiwanese and the Hakka dialect, said he
will reach out to ordinary people to win their support for the KMT.
Starting on Saturday, Chang said he will make extensive visits to
constituencies around the island and on offshore islands such as
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT will reinforce its services to youth, women and
under-privileged groups, as well as increasing contact with members
of the middle class in order to understand their thinking, opinions
and demands.</P>
      <P>Chang also stressed the importance of interaction with opposition
parties, underlined by a courtesy visit which he paid on Friday
afternoon to Chiu Yi-jen, secretary general of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, which won 12 of the 23 mayoral and
magistrate posts up for grabs in last Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>Turning to press speculation of a party reshuffle, Chang said he
will complete a shakeup of department chiefs at the KMT headquarters
in one or two weeks. Local KMT branch chiefs in some cities or
counties may also be reshuffled in the near future, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang's challenges are set to begin immediately, as elections for
city and county councils, as well as for township chiefs, will be
held in January 1998. "I'll meet with grassroots party workers and
community leaders in order to nominate the most suitable candidates
and work out effective campaign strategies to win the upcoming
elections," he added.</P>

      <P>Australia's chapter of the Taiwan-based
Buddhidt Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Association will help those whose

towns in New South Wales.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-yi, president of the local chapter of Tzu Chi, and other
members of the Buddhist charity organization went Thursday to
disaster investigation centers in Menai, a southern suburb of Sydney,
to look at how they could help those left homeless by the fires that
have raged since last week.</P>
      <P>Altogether there have been almost 160 bushfires across New South
Wales, 80 of them remaining uncontrolled with 20 growing more
serious, influenced by strong winds and hot weather.</P>
      <P>So far about 6,000 volunteer and professional firefighters are
battling the bushfires, which have already burned down more than
400,000 hectares of forest in New South Wales.</P>
      <P>In 1994, some 600,000 hectares of forest were destroyed and over
200 houses gutted in the same state.</P>
      <P>So far in this year's fires, more than a dozen houses in New
South Wales have been completely destroyed and scores of others
partially damaged.</P>
      <P>Two firefighters were killed this week and others suffered
injuries.</P>
      <P>Firefighters from Canberra went to New South Wales Friday to join
in the rescue work, and police said between 8,000 and 10,000
volunteer and professional firefighters from other states are on
standby in case the fires spread over the next three days.</P>
      <P>Lin said he and other Tzu Chi members in Sydney would look at the
seriousness of the needs of the bushfire victims so that the
association could raise money to help them recover from their losses.</P>
      <P>Lin and other Tzu Chi members dashed to the Snowy Mountains early
this year when two resort hotels collapsed in a landslide, killing 19
Australians.</P>
      <P>They provided beverages to hundreds of rescue workers and won
lots of praise from Australian residents and police.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi established its Australian chapter in March this year, so
far attracting more than 1,600 members, most of whom are immigrants
from Taiwan now living in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and other
cities.</P>

      <P>A petroleum price hike of between 6 and 8
percent in mid-December will push up the consumer price index (CPI)
by 0.3-0.4 percentage points at most, the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS department director Hsu Yiao-chang said that since oil
consumption accounts for only about 2.2 percent of average household
expenditure in Taiwan, even if petroleum prices are raised by 10
percent, the CPI will edge up by only 0.43 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the actual impact on the CPI caused by a petroleum
price hike will probably be around 0.3-0.4 percentage points, because
some business sectors will absorb the price increase themselves.</P>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. announced on Tuesday that
it will raise petroleum prices in mid-December to reflect increases
in the cost of imported crude oil due to the sharp plunge of the New

    <TEXT>
      <P>After nearly 10 years of concerted efforts
by local women's groups and socialites, Taiwan's 42 surviving
"comfort women" have finally received some financial assistance from
the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday paid NT$500,000
(US$15,873) to each of the women, who were forced into sexual slavery
by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II, in order to help
improve their living conditions. The move became necessary because
the Japanese government is still reluctant to compensate the women.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Cheng Wen-hua said the ROC
government will continue to push Japanese government authorities to
compensate the surviving comfort women, adding that the Foreign
Ministry will also urge the Japanese government to formally apologize
for the sins of its predecessors.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF) said the ROC
government has paid the money, totaling NT$21 million, with the
object of improving the lives of the women and in order to discourage
them from accepting "consolation money" offered by various private
Japanese groups, which would be meaningless without an official
government apology.</P>
      <P>The foundation said that if the Japanese government makes a
formal apology and compensates the comfort women in the future, each
comfort woman will be expected to return NT$500,000 to the ROC
national coffers.</P>
      <P>Two former comfort women present at Friday's ceremony, both in
their 70s, were moved to tears when they received their checks. "We
are delighted and grateful for our government's care and generosity,"
they said emotionally.</P>
      <P>One of them, identified only be her family name of Huang, said
she was a lonely old woman who despised herself when TWRF workers
contacted her for the first time some 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>"I felt ashamed for being a wartime comfort woman. I never dared
to tell my parents of my ordeal in Japanese military barracks in
Southeast Asia during World War II," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Ashamed of her past, she never married, and made her living by
doing odd jobs.</P>
      <P>Huang said she appreciates all the assistance TWRF workers have
given to her over the past decade. "More important, they have helped
me understand that it is not me, but the Japanese, who should feel
ashamed for my ordeal."</P>
      <P>Several female lawmakers, as well as executives of the Women's
Rescue Foundation, were also present at Friday's ceremony.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government set up a private Asian Women's Fund in
1995 that has offered to compensate each former comfort woman with 2
million Japanese yen for her suffering. Many of the women, including
those in South Korea and the Philippines, have refused compensation
unless it comes directly from the Japanese government.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Friday repeated his
opposition to DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang's proposal that the DPP
could form a coalition government with the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that doing so would only enhance and prolong the
KMT's status as the ruling party in Taiwan and stated his opposition
to such a proposal.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to questions from reporters
covering a seminar of elementary school principals from Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The mayor said he could not believe that Hsu would make such a
pessimistic suggestion so soon after the DPP's major victory in the
recent mayoral and county magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>Expressing the firm belief that the DPP will eventually become
Taiwan's ruling party in the coming years, he stressed that forming a
coalition government with the KMT will only hinder the DPP's efforts
in this regard.</P>
      <P>Chen called on Hsu to stop voicing such comments, in order
to preserve the DPP's solidarity and morale and said that he would
prefer to wait a little longer for the party to come to full power
rather than forming a coalition with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang said on Thursday that some outgoing DPP mayors and
county chiefs would make good candidates for a coalition cabinet with
the KMT.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hit by the New Taiwan dollar's depreciation,
the general index for Taiwan's wholesale prices surged 4.06 percent
to 111.01 in November from the October level, according to the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The new index also represents 5.28 percent growth, the highest
amount since 1995, in comparison with the year-earlier-level, showed
the DGBAS statistics on price fluctuations, which were released
Friday. The agency attributed the high level to the surge in the
prices of imported goods following the fall of the local currency.</P>
      <P>However, the agency indicated that November's consumer price
index registered 120.51, down a slight 0.26 percent from October, or
0.51 percent from the level of a year ago.</P>
      <P>The results indicate the depreciation has yet to affect local
consumer prices, the DGBAS analyzed, adding that Taiwan's consumer
good prices remain stable.</P>
      <P>As a result, the agency said the growth of consumer prices could

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two readers told The Globe and Mail on
Friday that Canada has been too soft on mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin during his recent visit.</P>
      <P>Ronald R. Clark of Calgary said it is disturbing that Canada
should honor the man, knowing "the government he heads is guilty of
persistent, widespread and brutal abuses of people under its
control."</P>
      <P>Clark said the claim that increased trade influences Beijing to
improve its human rights behavior "has no credit." He stressed that
talk of "constructive engagement" and the like is a mere smoke
screen, a rationalization for greed.</P>
      <P>"That we in Canada should place our own material gain ahead of so
much needless human suffering is, indeed, shameful," he concluded.</P>
      <P>Another reader, Trevor Bartram of Toronto, criticized the Mail
staff, saying they gave Jiang an easy time when he granted a rare
interview with the Canadian media last Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Too bad the only probing question in reaction to Mr. Jiang's
vacuous responses was as to his dance styles. But not one of your
staff chose to cross-examine Mr. Jiang on his hypocrisy as he
remarked that 'the world is a colorful and diverse one' in his appeal
for tolerance of the Chinese dictatorship," Bartram said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that a question on Beijing's suppression of Tibetan
culture and diversity would have been appropriate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS A PLACE IN A NEW WORLD ORDER: PM SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of an article
entitled "Taiwan Has a Place in a New World Order" by Republic of
China Premier Vincent Siew, which appeared in Thursday's edition of
the Los Angeles Times:</P>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan is evolving and ardently aspires
to actively contribute to peace and stability in East Asia and the
new world order of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>As early as a decade ago, the government and people of Taiwan
began making major adjustments in their actions and thinking.</P>
      <P>Under the leadership of Lee Teng-hui, we have successfully
carried out a process of internal democratic reform. Today, we have
developed into a fully liberated, vital open society.</P>
      <P>We also have decided to face the reality of "a divided China,"
and no longer claim to represent all of China. We believe that China
should be unified in the future. However, at present and in the
foreseeable future, neither Taipei nor Beijing can effectively
govern all of China. Hence, there is no "one China, rather only "one
divided China," of which the Republic of China is one part and the
People's Republic of China the other. Neither part can thus represent
the other, and neither side can represent all of China.</P>
      <P>Finally, we believe that in this Post Cold War era, no country
should be excluded from playing a part in the shaping of the new
world order.</P>
      <P>Prompted by these concepts, as early as 1991, president Lee
unilaterally renounced the use of military force as a means to unify
China. At the same time, he took the initiative to adopt a series of
measures to expand people-to-people contacts between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait and launch semiofficial talks.</P>
      <P>Today Taiwan is the second-largest source of external investment
on the Chinese mainland. Every year residents of Taiwan make more
than a million trips to the mainland for business and other
purposes. Taipei and Beijing have already held 17 rounds of
semiofficial talks and signed several agreements.</P>
      <P>On many different occasions. President Lee has publicly expressed
his willingness to make a "journey of peace" to the Chinese mainland.
The government has also proposed many projects for bilateral
cooperation, such as agricultural cooperation and an offshore
transshipment center. Since the summer of 1995, we have continuously
expressed our willingness to resume cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, what we have done in goodwill has only met with
military intimidation, diplomatic suppression and threatening
invective from Beijing. As a member of the world community, we would
certainly be pleased to participate in discussions on many major
global issues such as trade, investment, human rights, crime,
pollution, agriculture and telecommunications, We stand ready to
offer our expertise and experience toward their solutions.</P>
      <P>We also would be happy to see regional East Asian as well as
bilateral issues resolved, but not at the expense of the legitimate
rights of the 21 million people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government and the 21 million people on Taiwan have labored
hard for the past 50 years so as not to be absorbed into a communist
system under the Hong Kong model. Our rejection of the communist
system is in no way tantamount to the advocacy of so called Taiwan
independence or the establishment of "two Chinas," We simply prefer
democracy and peaceful means of reunification.</P>
      <P>China's reunification can be peacefully achieved only if both
sides face the reality of a "divided China" and embark on
discussions on equal footing.</P>
      <P>In the long run, only a China unified under a democratic and
open political system and integrated with the world is likely to
bring happiness to its people and peace to its East Asia
neighborhood.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progress Party (DPP)
chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said on Friday that his party doesn't wish
for the collapse of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), because only
partisan politics will best serve the interests of the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu, whose party scored a resounding victory in the
just-concluded mayoral and county chief elections, said that it will
not benefit Taiwan's democratic progress if the DPP overwhelms the
other parties to become the only powerful party in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP needs a healthy KMT as a competitor in the
political arena, adding that a sound system of partisan politics
should be established in Taiwan, with the DPP and KMT competing
against each other on an equal footing in future political races.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsu said that the leaders of political parties
should not just concentrate on pitting their forces against the other
parties while neglecting the promotion of national unity.</P>
      <P>Hsu was referring to local press reports regarding the
possibility of cooperation between the DPP and the KMT, as he had
earlier the week proposed a coalition cabinet formed by KMT and DPP
members. A meeting between Hsu and Liu Tai-yin, who is in charge of
KMT investment in various fields, following the plunge of the local
bourse on Monday, also sparked speculation on such issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER  BLAMES  KMT'S  ELECTION DEFEAT ON  MULTIPLE NOMINATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew, a member of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Central Standing Committee, on Thursday laid the
blame for the party's election defeat on Nov. 29 on its policy of
multiple nominations, which sees two KMT candidates in each of six
constituencies slugging it out in public.</P>
      <P>In a question-and-answer session after a speech to the Taipei
Foreign Correspondents Club, the KMT premier blamed multiple
nominations for tearing apart KMT grassroots support and playing into
the hands of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Multiple nominations are often the result of fierce intra-party
competition for the chance to represent the KMT, in this case in the
mayoral and county chief elections in which the KMT won only eight
seats to the DPP's 12 out of a total of 23, the remaining three going
to independent candidates.</P>
      <P>It was the first time the premier had pointed a finger of blame
at the reasons for the KMT's election debacle, and a very different
view to that of another KMT heavyweight, Taiwan Provincial Governor
James Soong, who blamed the defeat on the government's faulty
policy-making process and its failure to act promptly on people's
concerns.</P>
      <P>Siew rejected the idea of organizing another national conference
to build consensus among different political factions, saying that
the time is not yet ripe for such a meeting.</P>
      <P>He also described as "immature" the cross-strait "three direct
links" -- trade, postal, and transportion -- which he said could be
considered only after the island is allowed to join the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>He refused to comment on a recent proposal initiated by a group
of scholars for the establishment of an official "Chinese
Cross-Strait Joint Council" aimed at bringing some momentum to the
moribund cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Instead, he called on Beijing to resume cross-strait dialogue
without any preconditions.</P>
      <P>Siew also reiterated the government's policy on mainland China,
and its efforts to speed up its own streamlining.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 7,000 WOMEN RAPED IN LAST TEN YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 7,000 Taiwan women have reported
being raped in a recent 10-year period, with adolescent girls
representing the largest group of victims, according to a report from
Taipei's Mackay Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-sung, director of the social services center at the
hospital, cited an analysis based on official figures, which
indicated that a total of 7,530 women were raped between 1984 and
1993, an average of more than 700 cases per year.</P>
      <P>Teenage girls accounted for 40 percent of the total number of
reported rapes, while women aged between 20 and 29 made up about 20
percent of the total, Chen said.</P>
      <P>About 20 percent of the rapes were classed as "date rape," a
figure which is rising, he noted, adding that sexual offenders are
usually known to their victims.</P>
      <P>A staffer at a Mackay emergency center dedicated to abused women
lamented that many women are reluctant to undergo a physical
examination immediately after being raped, which she said makes it
difficult for them to provide evidence of rape if they decide to take
court action. She added, however, that of those who do receive a
hospital examination, about 70-80 percent will return for continued
treatment to prevent pregnancy or infection by sexually transmitted
diseases.</P>
      <P>Although the hospital usually encourages rape victims to make a
police report, the staffer pointed out that only 50-60 percent tend
to do so, for fear of exposure. Statistics show that police
authorities often fail to keep such cases confidential, causing the
victims to suffer for a second time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND  CHINA  URGED  TO  SPEED TARIFF CUTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US and the European Union are urging
mainland China to build on its latest diplomatic efforts to speed its
admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) by committing itself
firmly to faster and deeper tariff cuts, according to reports from
the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body on Friday.</P>
      <P>Mainland China outlined proposals for a new approach to its WTO
application to the US last week. These have been welcomed by
President Bill Clinton who told mainland China's President Jiang
Zemin that they provide the basis for intensified negotiations.</P>
      <P>Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, called Beijing's
initiative a "major step forward" which showed real commitment to the
long-stalled membership talks. He claimed the offer was modeled on
negotiating principles which he proposed to Beijing in October.</P>
      <P>Western officials said mainland China appears to be taking a more
constructive stance in response to recent moves by the US and EU to
close ranks in the negotiations, after a long period in which they
were often openly at odds, according to the WTO report.</P>
      <P>Although the full contents of Beijing's offer have not been
disclosed, it is understood to center on a formula which provides for
a more comprehensive and systematic approach to negotiating tariff
cuts on imports of industrial products.</P>
      <P>The formula appears intended to respond to western complaints
that mainland China's previous tariff offers in the WTO talks have
involved piecemeal reductions, which left many of its highest import
duties intact.</P>
      <P>EU negotiators said mainland China's proposals could have a
decisive impact on its WTO application if Beijing quickly turns them
into a firm and detailed timetable for sharp reductions in tariffs on
a wide range of specified imports.</P>
      <P>The US and EU are pressing mainland China to cut tariffs on many
industrial products to no more than 5 percent by early next century
and to phase out tariff-quotas on imports by fixed dates.</P>
      <P>Negotiators in Geneva say successful completion of the talks also
depends on mainland China agreeing to accelerate the removal of other
important trade barriers, in particular in areas such as agriculture,
services, distribution and subsidies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of the opposition
Democratic Progress Party (DPP), on Friday met with executives of
Bayer Taiwan Co., to clarify the party's stance on a referendum which
may decide the fate of Bayer's latest investment project in central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Chai-chung, vice president of Bayer's Taiwan office,
described the meeting with Hsu and Sisy Chen, director of the DPP's
publicity department, as "positive and well-intentioned," and that he
feels Hsu has shown sincerity in trying to communicate with him on
the issue.</P>
      <P>Hsu told him that the DPP has no bias against Bayer's investment
project and understands that the withdrawal of Bayer's investment
will have an impact on further foreign investment in Taiwan, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Liao Yung-lai, DPP magistrate-elect of Taichung County, has said
in public on several occasions that Bayer's investment plan for a
chemical manufacturing plant near Taichung Harbor will be subject to
a referendum held in the county. Liao's remarks have aroused concern
and uncertainty among foreign investors.</P>
      <P>A statement issued by the European Council of Commerce and Trade
in Taipei expressed the foreign investors' uneasiness over the DPP's
unprecedented move, demanding that the government clarify its policy
on foreign investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the DPP's publicity department is to gain a
better understanding of the referendum issue proposed by Liao, and
the DPP will hold a public hearing on Bayer's investment project with
scholars, experts, Bayer officials and representatives from an
"anti-Bayer league" taking part.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he is still optimistic about the investment
project, which has been approved by the government and has passed
evaluations on its impact on the environment. However, construction
work cannot start until they obtain the land lease, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The first stage of construction work, originally slated for last
year, will take two-and-a-half years to complete, with the investment
value reaching NT$10 billion (US$3.15 billion), Chen said, adding
that the total investment value in the three-stage project is
estimated at NT$50 billion.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The demand of Taiwan's major opposition
party leaders to subject a German investment plan to "national
referendum" has troubled American investors.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, president of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), and Liao Yung-lai, DPP magistrate-elect of Taichung County,
said in a recent TV interview that the investment plan of Bayer
Taiwan Co. to produce chemicals near Taichung Harbour in central
Taiwan is subject to "national referendum." Bayer is a well-known
German producer of chemical and other products.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which won a landslide victory in last Saturday's local
elections and is expected to win national elections in the next
three years by some analysts, has advocated for adding a "national
referendum" article to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei said
Friday that many American investors have called his office to
express their concern about the remarks of the DPP leaders, and that
his office will continue to pay attention to this matter.</P>
      <P>The European Council of Commerce and Trade in Taipei issued a
statement Thursday, saying that the unprecedented demand by DPP has
troubled many European investors, and that the government should
clarify its policy on foreign investment in Taiwan, because the
remarks of the DPP leaders have made foreign investors doubtful about
the transparency of the policy.

    <HEADLINE>TIBETAN DIRECTOR VOWS TO BOOST TIES BETWEEN  TIBET AND TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kesang Takla, director of a proposed Tibet
religious foundation here, said on Saturday that her main task will
be to promote Tibetan Buddhism and culture, as well as to increase
mutual understanding between the people of Taiwan and Tibet.</P>
      <P>Takla, 53, who served for more than eight years as representative
to the office of the Dalai Lama in London before assuming her new job
in Taiwan, arrived here in late November with her husband Phuntsok
Takla and secretary Kunga Tashi.</P>
      <P>Takla said that before she came to Taiwan, she traveled to
Dharamsala, India, seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, to meet
with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, to receive advice and
guidance regarding her new post.</P>
      <P>She said the Dalai Lama instructed her to promote the traditional
culture of Tibet, as well as boost bilateral ties and deepen
understanding between the people of Taiwan and the people of Tibet.</P>
      <P>Asked about specific ways she intends to promote Tibetan religion
and culture here, she said that in view of the keen interest in
Taiwan of the preaching of the Dalai Lama when he visited Taiwan in
March, she would first arrange for religious teachers to come here,
adding that other activities will follow as the foundation gathers
pace.</P>
      <P>Although she has only been here for a week, Takla said she
already feels keenly the friendliness and hospitality of the people
here. She is currently looking for a suitable office location, to be
named "The Tibet Religious Foundation of his Holiness the Dalai
Lama."</P>
      <P>The Tibetan government-in-exile has now set up offices in the
United States, Britain, France, Switzerland, Hungary, Mexico,
Australia, Japan, Nepal, India and South Africa, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO OFFER 14-DAY VISA-FREE ENTRY FOR ITALIANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Rome,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is to offer 14-day
visa-free entry for Italian passport-holders from Jan. 1, 1998, the
ROC representative office in Italy announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>The new measure is to reciprocate Italy's friendly move in
offering "Schengen Agreement" privileges to ROC nationals, a
spokesman for the representative office said.</P>
      <P>Italy began to implement the Schengen Agreement in late October,
under which visitors with a valid visa issued by any signatory can
visit any of the other member-countries. In addition to Italy, seven
other European countries -- France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg -- have also implemented the
travel liberalization accord.</P>
      <P>Although Italy maintains formal diplomatic ties with mainland
China, it hasn't offered the privileges to people from the Chinese
mainland or Hong Kong, which reverted to mainland rule on July 1,
1997.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Italian people who intend to stay in Taiwan
for more than 14 days for commercial, study or any other purposes
still have to apply for landing visas upon their arrival at Taiwan's
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport or file visa applications with
the ROC representative office in Italy.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the ROC offers landing visas to Italians,
the ROC representative office in Rome still received more than 1,400
applications over the past three months.</P>
      <P>Many Italian business people hailed the ROC's new visa-free
measure, saying it will facilitate their business visits to Taiwan
and thus help boost bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office said the new measure is expected to
help attract more Italian tourists and business people to Taiwan,
although it will cause the office's revenues from visa services to
decline.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK ADVISOR CONFIRMS HE VISITED TAIWAN LAST MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Paul Yip Kwok-wah, the Hong Kong chief
executive's advisor responsible for contact with Taiwan confirmed on
Friday that he visited Taipei in November.</P>
      <P>Yip stressed to CNA, however, that it was a private visit for a
"reunion with friends" and had no official purpose.</P>
      <P>"If I went there for business, how could (Taiwan's representative
to Hong Kong) Cheng An-kuo stay here rather than coming along with
me?" Yip asked CNA.</P>
      <P>Local press reports had said that Yip, on the instruction of Hong
Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, met with Taiwan officials,
including Chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chang
King-yuh, and Secretary General of the Straits Exchange Foundation
Chiao Jen-ho, to discuss issues concerning both Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>During the alleged meeting, the reports said, Yip had politely
refused Taipei's demands for 72-hour landing-visas for Taiwan
travelers, saying "it is difficult" and "the time is not yet ripe,"
while the MAC dodged his counter demand for cutting the red tape
surrounding Hong Kong people's applications for Taiwan visas, saying
"it needs thorough study."</P>
      <P>Yip denied the allegations.</P>
      <P>Responding to Taiwan's complaints about Hong Kong's troublesome
visa application procedure for Taiwan passengers, Yip said the
existing regime suits the current situation existing between mainland
China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taipei should understand that the issue hinges on the whole
cross-strait situation rather than on a decision by one or two people
in Hong Kong. The special administration government is not supposed
to take measures which are out-of-step with the general political
trend prevailing across the Taiwan Strait," Yip said.</P>
      <P>Regarding Taiwan's demands for Hong Kong to institutionalize its
contact channels with Taiwan rather than conducting contacts through
a relatively low-level advisor who holds no official position in the
government, Yip said he doubted an official capacity would help his
work. On the contrary, he said, his unofficial status allows him free
contact with Cheng and facilitates the exchange of views between
Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHYSICALLY-CHALLENGED JUDGE WORKS HIS WAY UP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  eastern  Taiwan, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A young law student, lame
in his left leg, who was barred 14 years ago from being a judge
because of his physical handicap, even though he passed Taiwan's bar
examination, has today worked his way up to the position of chief
justice after years of hard work and perseverance.</P>
      <P>Chuang Ming-chang, 43, was sworn in as the chief justice of the
Hualien District Court on Friday, making him the first chief justice
in Taiwan who is physically challenged.</P>
      <P>Chuang said he was happy to return to the eastern coastal city of
Hualien, where he took his first public service job after passing the
bar examination so many years ago.</P>
      <P>Before being promoted to a chief justice, Chuang had served as a
judge in district courts of Taoyuan and Panchiao.</P>
      <P>Fourteen years ago, Chuang and three other handicapped men passed
the annual bar examination. However, the fact that they were
handicapped meant that they were discriminated against by the
authorities, who refused to dispatch the four to judge-training
centers.</P>
      <P>Insisting that they were entitled to equal work opportunities
under the ROC Constitution, the quartet refused to succumb to this
discrimination, and fought for their rights.</P>
      <P>After two years of appeals and fighting by the strong-willed men,
the judiciary authorities finally agreed to let them join the public
prosecutor apprenticeship program.</P>
      <P>During their apprenticeships, the quartet proved that their
handicaps did not affect their work, and they were later dispatched
to district prosecutors offices in Hualien, Chiayi, Taoyuan and Ilan,
respectively, to work as alternate public prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Chuang, born into a farming family in rural Nantou county,
central Taiwan, became a victim of infantile paralysis during his
childhood. The disease affected both of his legs and he was on the
verge of becoming totally crippled.</P>
      <P>To save her son from losing the use of his legs, Chuang's mother
pawned all the family's valuables in order to buy medicine.</P>
      <P>Luckily, Chuang's right leg was spared from the disease and he
was able to walk with the aid of a crutch. As medical equipment has
improved over the years, Chuang's handicap is now barely noticeable.</P>
      <P>Chuang attributed his achievements today to his mother's bravery
and strong will, saying that "mother's love is the force behind my
perseverance."</P>
      <P>Chuang is a hard worker. He passed the national land
administration examination in his freshman year at Fu Jen Catholic
University and managed to pass the court clerk exam in his junior
year, finally passing the judges exam in 1983 at the age of 28.</P>

number of visas to be processed each day and the amount of the fee

    <HEADLINE>RESULT OF LOCAL ELECTION NO STRAIN ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES: GIO HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By K. C. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the ruling Kuomintang suffered a
major setback in the Nov. 29 local elections, the results should not
strain relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
government spokesman David Lee said in a televised interview with the
Cable News Network (CNN) on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee, the director-general of the Government Information Office,
said the victory of the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive Party should not be interpreted as a public referendum on
the fate of the nation.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the polls were local elections for city and
county chiefs, and that the campaign issues centered on local topics.
Thus, Lee said, the victory of the DPP should in no way cause raised
tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The KMT managed to win only eight of 23 seats up for grabs, while
the DPP won 12, and the remaining three went to the independents.</P>
      <P>Despite the opposition victory, Lee asserted that most people on
Taiwan favor maintaining the status quo.</P>
      <P>The four-minute interview was conducted in New York and aired
Friday night to audience in Asia. After the CNN interview, Lee
called on the offices of Newsweek and Time magazines, and the New
York Times and Wall Street Journal newspapers.</P>
      <P>He later spoke on current Taiwan issues at the Asia Society.</P>
      <P>Lee left Taipei for New York on Thursday. He said the main
purpose of his trip was to brief major US media on recent
developments in Taiwan, including the elections last week, Taiwan's
social order situation and its approach and strategy to coping with
the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the local elections will have no impact on
relations with Beijing because the topics at issue centered on social
order, environmental protection, corruption, and the personalities
and performances of the incumbent local chiefs. Lee said those
matters are far removed from the questions of mainland policy and
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The government spokesman said that Taiwan has been largely
unaffected by the fallout stemming from the recent financial crisis
which swept through Southeast Asia because of its good economic
fundamentals, sound currency policy and lively stock market.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the US media appeared to be most concerned about
the implications for cross-trait relations wrought by the local
election results, and were also interested in the current status of
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Lee reiterated the government's desire to resume dialogue with
Beijing at an early date in order to solve technical problems
involving the two sides across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He is slated to return to Taipei Dec. 11 after a hectic week-long
tour of the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 60 percent of local university
students believe that incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian will be
reelected next year, according to the results of a recent opinion
poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey of more than 1,300 university students around the
island also found that Chen, a heavyweight in Taiwan's
pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is
the most-favored candidate for the Taipei mayorship.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 61.6 percent of those interviewed said
they believe Chen will be reelected Taipei mayor in 1998, while 20.6
percent said former Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou could be elected as
the city's next mayor.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Governor James Soong (6.3 percent), newly installed
Kuomintang Secretary General John Chang (1.2 percent) and New Party
Secretary General Wang Chien-hsien (1.1 percent) trailed Ma as
possibles in Taipei's next mayoral race.</P>
      <P>The poll results show that Chen has successfully cultivated a
"strongman" image among local university students since assuming
office some three years ago.</P>
      <P>Chen topped the questionnaire's list of 15 noted politicians from
the three major local political parties in many of the personal
characteristics reviewed.</P>
      <P>In the eyes of the respondents, Chen is a man with "grit, vision,
charisma and administrative know-how," according to the survey
results.</P>
      <P>The poll also shows that a majority of the respondents consider
Chen as "most willing to undertake sweeping reforms, assume political
responsibility, fight against evil forces and deliver campaign
promises."</P>
      <P>However, Chen lagged behind Ma, now a law professor at National
Chengchi University, in four respects: clean image, amiability,
steadiness and sex appeal, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Ma resigned from his cabinet post as a minister-without-portfolio
earlier this year after declining a KMT offer to nominate him to run
in next year's Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted jointly by the Chinese Culture
Association, the ROC Industry and Commerce Management Association and
the business management department of National Chunghsing University.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, Fan Kuang-ling, president of the
Chinese Culture Association, said Ma could still be Chen's strongest
potential rival in the next Taipei mayoral election should he decide
to stage a political comeback, even though the Harvard-trained
professor is currently out of political arena.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that Wu Poh-hsiung, who just stepped down
from the KMT secretary general post to assume responsibility for the
party's defeat in last weekend's nationwide mayoral and county
magistrate elections, was rated by local students as "most capable of
communicating with his superior."</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh on Saturday urged Beijing to step up exchanges with
Taipei based on the principles of mutual respect and equality.</P>
      <P>Chang made the appeal during a review of cross-strait relations
over the past year at a meeting of the National Unification Council
on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the disruption of regular cross-strait dialogue has
damaged mutual trust, deepened the rivalry across the Taiwan Strait
and delivered a major setback to beneficial exchanges between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended talks with Taipei in protest at a
visit by Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui to the United
States in June 1995.</P>
      <P>Chang also said mainland China has increased its diplomatic
pressure on Taiwan by using its political and economic clout to
blackmail members of the international community, some of whom have
even gone so far as to accuse the ROC of "provocation" in its
attempts to break out of the isolation imposed by Beijing, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said most people in Taiwan hope that Beijing and Taipei
will resume talks soon, in order to avoid a further deterioration of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chang suggested putting political differences aside and focusing
on technical problems arising from exchanges between the two shores
of the Taiwan Strait. This will help create a harmonious atmosphere
favorable to building a broader cross-strait consensus.</P>

(By Wang Chung-hsin &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following a brief remark on Monday about
Taiwan's local elections, the Beijing-based Taiwan Affairs Office
under the State Council commented on Friday about the US trip by
Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang.</P>
      <P>Beijing's brain-trust on Taiwan affairs confessed that the
response to Hsu's US trip is part of an "immunization" process
whereby Beijing intends neither to emphasize its differences with the
pro-(Taiwan) independence DPP, nor to meet with or be cordial to its
leadership.</P>
      <P>Since winning a majority of seats up for grabs in local elections
across Taiwan late last month, the DPP has expressly stated that
there is "no problem" in its relations with the Chinese mainland.
However, the situation has attracted international attention, noted
political observers in Beijing who are familiar with Taiwan affairs.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the observers said, Beijing must be prudent in its
remarks regarding the election outcome and its attitude toward the
DPP.</P>
      <P>In comments made on Monday, the Taiwan Affairs Office information
department mentioned only "developments in cross-strait relations,
and opposition to Taiwan independence." In Friday's statement,
however, Beijing raised its voice in suggesting it would prevent
Taiwan from declaring independence if necessary.</P>
      <P>According to those familiar with the mentality of the Beijing
leadership, such remarks are an indication Beijing is readjusting its
stance in accordance with the new political environment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Analysts noted that Beijing apparently does not want to convey
the impression to the international community that it will tolerate
the DPP's pro-independence platform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP AGRICULTURAL OFFICIALS REMOVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group former and currently serving
senior-level agricultural officials have been removed from office on
charges of negligence stemming from the disastrous outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease that struck Taiwan hog farms in March this
year.</P>
      <P>The Judicial Yuan's Committee on the Discipline of Public
Functionaries handed down the penalties on Friday, marking the
harshest punishment meted out to public officeholders in recent
decades.</P>
      <P>Chiu Mau-ying, former chairman of the Council of Agriculture
(COA), Taiwan's top agency in charge of agriculture, fisheries,
forestry, husbandry and related affairs, was dismissed from his
current post as board chairman of the Central Trust of China. He also
had his right to hold public office suspended for one year.</P>
      <P>Chiu is currently in Los Angeles attending the joint conference
of the ROC-USA and USA-ROC Economic Councils. He expressed dismay
upon hearing the news by telephone and said he will cut short his US
trip and return to Taipei in order to learn more details surrounding
the surprise development.</P>
      <P>Liu Pei-bo, director of the Taiwan Research Institute for Animal
Health, was also dismissed from his current position and had his
public functionary accreditation suspended for one year.</P>
      <P>Upon being informed of the penalty, Chen Wu-hsiung, agriculture
and forestry commissioner of the Taiwan Provincial Government, who
himself was on reprimand list, said the punishment dealt to Liu was
"shocking and unacceptable."</P>
      <P>Chen said that when confronted with the devastating outbreak of
the foot-and-mouth epidemic, all relevant agencies, none of which had
experience in handling such a crisis, had tried to prevent the spread
of the disease as quickly as possible. If the officials don't deserve
commendations, Chen argued, they should by no means be punished for
their efforts.</P>
      <P>Sun Ming-hsien, former COA chairman and Chiu Mau-ying's
predecessor, was also reprimanded.</P>
      <P>Shieh Kuai-lo, former director of the COA Animal Industry
Department, was demoted and had his civil servant accreditation
suspended for six months.</P>
      <P>Shieh, who resigned in the wake of the epidemic and returned to
his academic career, asserted that he had done his best during the
outbreak which caught the entire island unprepared. He said the
penalty is unfair.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S HUMAN RIGHTS STILL NEED IMPROVEMENT: CAHR REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's human rights index shows signs of
decline this year, with children's rights even flunking the
acceptable standard, the Chinese Association for Human Rights (CAHR)
reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The association has consistently issued an annual survey of
Taiwan's human rights conditions since 1992. Previously, the
association evaluated six major indicators -- political, economic,
social, educational/cultural, judicial and women's rights. This year
children's rights were included in its review for the first time.</P>
      <P>The 1997 report was based on the findings of a survey of
more than 200 scholars and experts as well as 1,000 prison inmates.
The association received a total of 1,335 valid replies.</P>
      <P>According to the report, women's rights have not made any
significant progress this year, and children's physical safety
received the worst rating.</P>
      <P>The report said Taiwan's children have not been well protected,
facing threats of white-slaving, kidnapping or abduction. Child
abuse or maltreatment is also rampant in local families.</P>
      <P>Protection for children's educational rights and distribution of
educational resources have also received poor ratings on the
CAHR-devised scaling system.</P>
      <P>Turning to women's rights, the report said social participation
received the lowest rating among the six indicators gauged in this
category, indicating that local women have still not been granted
equal opportunities as their male counterparts to take part in
social and political activities.</P>
      <P>The rating for women's physical safety was only slightly higher
than that for social participation, as several high-profile criminal
cases involving female victims were reported over the past year.</P>
      <P>Compared with the 1996 survey, women's freedom, working and
educational rights have made some progress, but the marriage and
family index and social participation rights registered slight
drops.</P>
      <P>The report said the Women's Rights Promotion Council under the
Cabinet should work even harder to protect women's basic human
rights and that the newly passed sex crime prevention law should be
faithfully implemented.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report said although the overall political rights
index rose modestly from last year's level, civil rights and
liberty received a lower rating than 1996.</P>
      <P>The report further said Taiwan has made progress in protection
for rights of survival and land ownership as well as in restriction
on death sentences.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report said there is still ample room for
Taiwan to improve protection for environmental rights, labor rights,
welfare services, privacy, communications rights, disaster relief and
crime prevention.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE PRESIDES OVER MEETING OF NATIONAL UNIFICATION COUNCIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui reiterated the
government's steady and cautious mainland policy at a meeting of the
National Unification Council (NUC), while politicians from opposition
camp criticized his mainland China policies.</P>
      <P>Lee said at the a-half-day meeting that "avoiding haste,
exercising restraint, treading gingerly to attain long-lasting
stability" should remain the government's guiding principles in
managing cross-strait exchanges at the present stage.</P>
      <P>"We maintain that both sides (of the Taiwan Strait) should engage
in dialogue and consultations to nurture mutual confidence, enhance
consensus and create a new stage for peace based on mutually
beneficial cooperation."</P>
      <P>He called for changing the informal rule that the NUC meets once
annually by calling it into session twice or more in a year if
necessary, an motion unanimously supported by the attendants.</P>
      <P>President Lee reiterated calls he made in his inaugural address
last year, that the two sides of the strait should "face up to
reality and engage in dialogue with profound sincerity and patience
in order to resolve their differences."</P>
      <P>He said both sides of the Taiwan Strait should resume dialogue at
the earliest possible time, and should start with consultations
between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation and the
mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, which
were unilaterally suspended by Peking in June 1995.</P>
      <P>"We believe that cross-strait exchanges and consultations should
not have any preconditions but should be based on respect for
historical reality and the premise of securing the rights and
interests of our people."</P>
      <P>"In fact," Lee said, "the inhabitants of both sides of the strait
are Chinese and therefore should enjoy similar standards of living
and equal opportunities for development."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has built a full-fledged democracy, President
Lee said: "We wish that Peking will join us soon in the ranks of
modern civilized society by accelerating its political reform,
cultivating democracy and rule of law, following international norms
and enhancing international cooperation."</P>
      <P>He expressed hope Beijing "will be pragmatic and forward-looking
in developing cross-strait relations, commit themselves to peace,
renounce the use of force and through parallel participation of both
sides in international organizations and activities, promote
coexistence as well as mutual prosperity in the international
community."</P>
      <P>By so doing, Lee said, "the gap between both sides of the strait
will be narrowed and conditions for national reunification will
mature in the foreseeable future."</P>
      <P>Although many participants chimed in to support Lee's opinion at
the meeting, an opposition New Party leader, Hsu Li-nung, who is also
a vice chairman of the NUC, challenged Lee's no-haste China policy,
characterizing it as "against the public opinion" and urging Lee to
review it.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who just returned from a trip to the mainland China, also
urged the government to deal with Beijing flexibly without regard to
the three-phased limits imposed by the National Unification
Guidelines.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, two NUC members from the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party abstained from Saturday's meeting in
protest at the government's policy of pursuing national unification.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsin-chieh, an NUC vice chairman, was absent from the
meeting, while Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who was appointed to
the NUC because of his mayorship, criticized the NUC's pursuit as not
based on consensus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORTUNETELLING IS WORSHIPPING THE ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"The nation's leader is elected under the
mandate of heaven." Over half of the population in Taiwan is deeply
convinced of that, as the occult sciences are increasing in
popularity around the island.</P>
      <P>As the Chinese society here is becoming more modernized and
industrialized, local sociologists have found that oracle reading and
other methods of fortunetelling, which cannot be proven by scientific
theory, are nevertheless more and more popular as well, especially
among well-educated members of the public.</P>
      <P>One of those scholars is Prof. Chiu Hei-yuan, director of
Academia Sinica's preparatory office for the institute of social
sciences, who has studied the changes in Taiwan's fortunetelling and
religious practices. He presented his findings at a two-day seminar
on religion, occult, science and society, which opened in Taipei on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Conducting a survey over a ten-year period from 1985 to 1995,
Chiu found that 64 percent of today's well-educated Taiwan women aged
20-35 are fond of fortunetelling. The figure marks a growth of 40
percent in comparison with the level recorded five years ago.</P>
      <P>Chiu told the seminar that religious beliefs and fortunetelling
have been deeply and widely rooted in Chinese societies after
centuries of being handed down from one generation to another. Such
practices provide a sense of certainty and security to people who
live in an age in which they feel incapable of resolving problems on
the basis of their own abilities and powers of reason.</P>
      <P>Eager for reassurance, stability or survivability, people often
turn to supernatural powers for answers. This is the main reason
behind the increased popularity of fortunetelling in Taiwan, the
prestigious scholar said, pointing out that the island is undergoing
a dramatic change from an isolated society to an open and modern one.</P>
      <P>Chiu's survey showed that currently popular forms of the occult
and divination in Taiwan are largely based on such concepts as god
and ghosts, the spirit world, ancestor worship, "qi," Chinese
geomancy known as "feng shui," auspiciousness, fortunetelling, and
fate.</P>
      <P>Social behavior influenced by such concepts and beliefs was found
to be on the rise during the 1985-95 period.</P>
      <P>More than 50 percent of the surveyed believe that gods and
ghosts, Heaven and Hell, do exist, and that there is a superior being
in the universe, the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>It was also revealed that 70 percent of the Taiwan public believe
humans have a spirit after death; some 70 percent believe in fate;
and 55 percent are convinced by that having an incompatible spouse is
due to debts incurred in a former life.</P>
      <P>In addition, the survey found that about 80 percent of the public
islandwide will select an auspicious day to hold wedding parties,
burial services and business openings.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
denied local press reports that he would not seek reelection next
year.</P>
      <P>"The reports were erraneous," the outspoken mayor said,
reaffirming his reelection bid.</P>
      <P>Local media quoted ruling Kuomintang sources as speculating that
Chen might not seek reelection and would instead join the race for
the chairmanship of his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) next
year.</P>
      <P>KMT sources said Chen is eyeing the DPP chairmanship with a view
to imporve his prospects of becoming the party's candidate for
Taiwan's next presidential election in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>KMT sources reportedly have made such speculations mainly
because the DPP bans its public office holders from seeking another
elected post before having served at least half of his original
tenure. If Chen is reelected Taipei mayor late next year, he would
be unable to join the 2000 presidential race in accordance with
current DPP regulations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, the charismatic mayor scoffed at
the KMT's intelligence gathering skills. "It's only KMT's wishful
thinking that I would not seek reelection," he stressed, adding
he'll seek reelection and would do his utmost in the coming year
to win his bid.</P>
      <P>"I've never said that I would seek the DPP chairmanship, nor
have I dreamed to be our country's president," Chen asserted. "For
the moment, the top priority for me is to fulfil my duty as the
Taipei mayor."</P>
      <P>Chen has consistently enjoyed a high approval rating in various
public opinion polls over the past three years. A survey of
local university students released on Saturday also showed he stands
a good chance of winning reelection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIC REPORT CARDS FORGERY GROUP BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police on Saturday raided an overseas study
consulting company in Taipei on suspicion of selling bogus
transcripts of academic records of an unaccredited college here to
students who intended to do advanced studies abroad.</P>
      <P>Police arrested two key suspects, identified as Huang Tai-sheng
and his wife Kuo Yen-ling, and confiscated five forged transcripts
of academic records of the Christianity Universal Federation
College (CUFC), as well as many related documents.</P>
      <P>The couple were accused of selling false CUFC academic
report cards to local students for NT$100,000 to NT$200,000 each.
The students, most of whom had poor academic records, would then use
the forged CUFC report cards to apply for admission to colleges or
universities abroad.</P>
      <P>The couple told police that the false transcripts were provided
by a mysterious man, identified as Ho Yen-ming whose whereabouts are
still unknown.</P>
      <P>According to the couple, Ho is about 60 years old and speaks
Mandarin Chinese with a Cantonese accent. Ho was said to travel
frequently between Taiwan and Hong Kong. The couple said they
usually contacted Ho over telephone and did not know his ture
identity. They claimed that Ho sold them each copy of false CUFC
transcripts for NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations also show that the couple had operated
such illegal business for 16 years and made a profit of over NT$10
million. Among documents seized by ploce at the couple's company on
Taipei's Jen-Ai Road were a list of 230 student applicants
intending to buy bogus transcripts of academic records.</P>
      <P>The couple said they don't know where the CUFC is located.
Although the school is not accredited by the ROC's Ministry of
Education, it is recognized by many schools abroad. Hundreds or
thousands of local students might have used such false transcripts
to obtain admissions to many overseas colleges or universities over
the past 16 years.</P>
      <P>Police said they will further investigate the case and bring to
justice other accomplices.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>At the sixth meeting of the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization (WTO) working party on the accession of
mainland China on Friday, Beijing's revised services offer was
examined closely.</P>
      <P>"Members judged it to be an important document, one on the basis
of which they could build the future bilateral services negotiation,"
said Pierre-Louis Girard, chairman of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Overall, Girard pointed out, there was a feeling that while this
offer represented a substantial improvement over Beijing's previous
services offers, there was still a need for a clarification exercise
so that governments and the services providers they represent could
satisfactorily assess the significance and value of the offer.</P>
      <P>On the bilateral track, Girard said the delegation from Beijing
has been holding bilaterals all this week and will be continuing this
process through the end of next week.</P>
      <P>Yet, much work still remains to be done, especially in the area
of services, Girard said.</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been taken on a date for resuming the
multilateral process in Geneva, however, Girard said, adding that he

      <P>A one-day Taiwan trade fair will be held in
Istanbul on Dec. 15, according to Peter Huang, executive director of
the Istanbul office of the Taiwan Trade Center.</P>
      <P>At a news briefing on Friday, Huang said some 39 companies in all
areas of business from the Republic of China will be participating at
the trade fair which is organized by the Taiwan Trade Center, the
ROC's foremost nonprofit trade promotion organization.</P>
      <P>After peaking at US$622 million in 1993, total trade value
between Taiwan and Turkey dropped to US$455.8 million for 1996,
according to Huang. However, the last two years have seen a lopsided
trade balance in favor of Taiwan, with the surplus nearly doubling
from US$173.6 million in 1994 to US$334.1 million in 1995, and
climbing to US$394.7 million last year.</P>
      <P>Huang said that as Taiwan businessmen have been actively
participating in trade shows and organizing market development
activities in Turkey, two-way trade between the two countries has
seen a rapid increase in the recent years.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said Saturday at a
meeting of the National Unification Council (NUC) that it is necessary
to forcefully refute Beijing's "one China" rhetoric.</P>
      <P>The NUC was established in 1990 to provide the President with
ideas and findings of researches on matters relating to national
unification and cross-strait relations. Currently the NUC is
headed by President Lee Teng-hui himself. Premier Siew serves as vice
chairman of the council.</P>
      <P>Siew said at the meeting that Beijing has repeatedly trumpeted
its "one China" rhetoric, by saying in various occasions that "There
is only one China," "The People's Republic of China is the only
government representing China," and "Taiwan is part of China."</P>
      <P>"This rhetoric is a political trick to downgrade us," Siew said,
adding that "We must forcefully refute it."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Republic of China has been a sovereign
country since it was established in 1912. Taiwan and the Chinese
mainland are now under separate rule.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that the development of good relations between
Taiwan and mainland China will depend on whether Beijing is able to
face this situation realistically and change its unreasonable policy
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government will steadfastly carry out its mainland policy
and steadily establish "stable and forward-looking relationship" with
mainland China with a purpose to unite the nation under the
principles of democracy, freedom, and equal distribution of wealth,
he added.</P>
      <P>The NUC meeting was held Saturday morning for more than three

      <P>The Eden Social Welfare Foundation of Taiwan
announced on Friday that it will raise some US$1 million next year to
help victims injured by landmines around the world.</P>
      <P>Robert Lin, foundation secretary general, told a press conference
that his group is also pleased to provide psychological counseling
and job training programs to help disabled mine victims in other
countries.</P>
      <P>The Christian non-profit organization launched a Love Without
Frontiers campaign in March this year, collecting 1,000 wheelchairs
for survivors of landmine incidents in Afghanistan and Cambodia. Half
of the wheelchairs have already been sent to Afghanistan, while the
other 500 will soon be delivered to Cambodian victims.</P>
      <P>Sayed Aqa, the director of Afghanistan's Mine Clearance Planning

so they won't become a burden on society.</P>
      <P>Traditional cooperation in assisting war victims in less
developed countries has been North-South, but the Eden project sets a

international norms of mine clearance operations to concerned parties
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government deploys mines in its frontline
islands near mainland China. One week before the signing of the
Ottawa treaty, Taiwan's defense authorities issued the first
commercial contract in 40 years and began to clear an open mine dump
on Kinmen Island, according to ANT coordinator Don-Lin Mon.</P>
      <P>Mon said ANT, a coalition of weapons specialists and businessmen
concerned with mine problems, is also coordinating campaign
activities both at home and abroad calling for increased awareness of
mine issues and assistance to victims.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two Taiwan NGOs, other Taiwan groups are also
doing their parts in response to Canada's anti-landmine cause. For
example, the Taipei Overseas Peace Service is running three
humanitarian programs in Cambodia, Thailand and Kenya to help
rehabilitate mine victims.</P>
      <P>The Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu-Chi Foundation and the
World Vision of Taiwan also have many projects in mine-contaminated
countries, providing aid to victims of wars and natural disasters.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After a quarter of a century, Australia
remains tangled in the politics of civil war between the Republic of
China on Taiwan and the People's Republic of China on the mainland.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, mass-circulation newspaper The
Australian's correspondent Richard McGregor reported that both
Beijing and Canberra are celebrating the 25th anniversary of
Australia's formal recognition of the mainland government.</P>
      <P>In an eight-column article headlined "Slow Boat to China," on
Saturday, the daily said Australia has been and will continue to be
squeezed in the middle of the two combatant Chinas.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Australia has ignored Taipei politically
since recognizing Beijing as the sole ruler of "one China" in 1972. A
quarter of a century later, mainland China and Taiwan are both
economic giants and massive trade and investment partners.</P>
      <P>"Technically, however, they are still at war, which makes
maintaining relations with both awkward for countries such as
Australia," the daily reported.</P>
      <P>"Australia ignored Taiwan politically after recognizing Beijing
as the sole ruler of 'one China' in 1972. In the 1980s, our diplomats
would only visit the island unofficially from Hong Kong and meet
Taiwan government contacts in neutral places such as coffee shops.
Things have thawed since," the daily reported.</P>
      <P>"Now, Australia's unofficial consulate in Taipei is headed by a
senior China specialist from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Sam
Gerovich. To observe diplomatic niceties, he is there in a private
capacity. An Australian minister usually visits once a year. But even
with this improvement, most analysts expect the cross-straits
tensions to remain for generations," the daily said.</P>
      <P>"The worst-case scenario is war between Taiwan and China. The
best is some sort of federation. In the meantime, countries such as
Australia will continue to be squeezed in the middle," it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A hormonal gel is currently being
developed in Australia as a potential new method of contraception.</P>
      <P>Mass circulation newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported on
Saturday that women in Sydney are being sought to take part in the
first Australian study of the progestogen gel, which researchers hope
will offer an alternative to oral contraceptives.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that volunteers will be asked to rub 0.3 ml of
gel into the skin daily, which will operate on the same principle as
the "mini-pill," by releasing hormones into the blood stream which
will affect the cervical mucus and the womb lining.</P>
      <P>The study is part of an international trial, as the gel has been
developed by the Population Council in New York, a non-profit body
with a mandate to develop new forms of contraception, the daily said.</P>
      <P>Dr. Edith Weisberg, director of the Sydney Center for
Reproductive Health Research, said there is a need to develop
alternatives as "many women don't like taking pills.</P>
      <P>"The major advantage of these methods is that they are
alternatives to the pill but they are still under women's' control,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Weisberg said the gel study is preliminary work aimed at
establishing optimum dosage and its effect on ovarian function. The
next step will be to measure its efficacy as a contraceptive.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Prime Minister John Howard is
facing a double-dissolution election after the Senate on Friday
rejected his native title bill. The government now has three months
to decide whether to agree with the Senate-proposed amendment on the
legislation or call an election.</P>
      <P>Howard accused the Senate of "wreaking havoc" on his native title
plan and told his cabinet and back bench late Friday night that he
believes the only way he could have his legislation passed is to
submit it to a joint sitting of both houses of parliament after a
double-dissolution election.</P>
      <P>The key man who wreaked the havoc was Senator Brian Harradine
from Tasmania because he holds the balance of the vote. He favored
amendment of Howard's 10-point bill as proposed by the opposition
Labor Party.</P>
      <P>Howard has ordered a rare Saturday sitting of the House of
Representatives so that he can announce his rejection of the Senate
action.</P>
      <P>The main point which was denied to the government was to deny
Aborigines the right to negotiate over the terms of development on
pastoral leases and on mineral and petroleum exploration,
infrastructure projects and towns and cities.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government wanted to introduce a six-year time
limit for native land title claims and a tougher registration test
before Aborigines can negotiate on native title claims. But the
government also failed to have this passed in the Senate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PIG LIVER CELLS CAN CLEAN BLOOD FOR LIVER PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dialysis may prove to be a viable
alternative to liver transplants for liver patients in the future, a
Japanese professor said in Singapore on Friday.</P>
      <P>Professor Yoshito Ikada from Kyoto University's Research Center
for Biomedical Engineering said that his studies have shown that pig
liver cells can completely clean the blood of toxins and could
possibly be used to help liver patients.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Ninth International Conference on Biomedical
Engineering, he said that charcoal is currently used to get rid of
toxins but is not so effective because it can only remove very small
amounts of toxins.</P>
      <P>It cannot get rid of substances like ammonia, he said, adding
that this does not help patients with acute liver failure.</P>
      <P>The blood of liver patients could be drawn out and cleaned in a
machine using the pig liver cells, he said, adding that the process
would be similar to the haemodialysis system that kidney patients use
to clean their blood while they are awaiting a kidney transplant.</P>
      <P>Ikada said that although the procedure has only been tested on
dogs so far, the University of Kyoto is applying for approval to use
the machine on terminally-ill liver patients next year.</P>
      <P>If successful, liver dialysis could be a real help to liver
patients, as there is a shortage of liver donors worldwide.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that cleaning the blood of toxins is only
one of the liver's functions. There is still no way of duplicating
the liver's other functions, such as bile secretion, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, JAPAN CONCLUDE ANNUAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and Japan wrapped up
their annual trade and economic cooperation conference on Friday,
with the two sides agreeing to meet next month in Taipei to negotiate
an agreement on the temporary admission of goods.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-ching, chairman of the ROC's East Asian Relations
Association (EARA) and leader of the 29-member ROC delegation, said
at a news conference following the close of the conference that
officials of the two countries had discussed 34 issues of mutual
concern during the two-day gathering, helping the two sides further
strengthen cooperative trade relations.</P>
      <P>The 49-member Japanese delegation was led by Leijiro Hattori,
chairman of the Japanese Interchange Association (JIA), and included
five officials from Japan's Foreign Ministry. It was the largest
contingent to the conference in years, which Lin said was an
indication that the Japanese government attached great importance to
the event.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Japanese side had also promised to seek to
upgrade the status of its officials participating at future meetings.</P>
      <P>In addition to agreeing to consider holding a third round of
bilateral fishery talks and to allow the resumption of imports into
Japan of cooked pork products from Taiwan, Lin said the two sides
decided to conduct a second round of talks on the temporary admission
of goods and on cross-border transfer of hazardous waste.</P>
      <P>Agreement was also reached on inviting the ROC to attend a
seminar on management of high-tech exports slated for February in
Japan, supporting bids by both countries to sponsor working party
meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, as well as
jointly holding seminars to boost bilateral technological exchanges
and helping remove barriers to ROC exports into Japan, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>The ROC's mounting trade deficit with Japan has again become a
major point of concern for Taiwan people since Tokyo barred ROC pork
shipments following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at Taiwan
hog farms in March, which resulted in a slowdown in Taiwan's exports
to this country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan suffered a negative trade balance of US$14.5 billion with
Japan in the first ten months of the year and the figure is expected
to rebound to the previous level of US$17 billion in 1995 from last
year's US$13.8 billion.</P>
      <P>The EARA and JIA are intermediary bodies representing the ROC and
the Japanese government, respectively, in bilateral exchanges in the

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIST SEES 'BIG JUMP' IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local economist on Sunday predicted an
imminent "big jump" in relations between Taiwan and the mainland as a
result of Taipei's "no hurry, be patient" mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>Ma Kai, a research fellow with the Chung-Hua Institute for
Economic Research, was among the few experts who hold an optimistic
view on the consequences of the conservative mainland investment
policy initiated by President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>He noted that the currencies of the Southeast Asian countries
have depreciated greatly in the wake of the financial turmoil that
swept through the region recently.</P>
      <P>As a result, mainland China has lost many of its export markets
to its Southeast Asian neighbors, and much foreign capital has begun
to flow out of the mainland.</P>
      <P>That unfavorable situation, coupled with its seriously ailing
state-run enterprises and bad debt problems suffered by its banks,
will surely serve to tighten the mainland's money supply, prompting a
devaluation of the renminbi in order to save the nation's export
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Those measures in turn will force Southeast Asian finance
officials to further depreciate their currencies to win back foreign
markets, thus setting off a "currency devaluation race" with Beijing,
which will see the serious bleeding of the mainland economy, Ma
predicted.</P>
      <P>As the mainland is in need of Taiwan capital to fill the vacancy
left by the withdrawal of foreign capital, the "no hurry, be patient"
policy, designed to slow down Taiwan's investment on the other side
of the strait, will only make the mainland "more thirsty" for capital
from Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Ma expects Beijing to extend an olive branch to
Taipei in the hope of reopening the dialogue it unilaterally
suspended following President Lee's visit to the United States in the
summer of 1995 in what it said was a trip aimed at promoting Taiwan's
independence. Taipei has repeatedly and emphatically denied Beijing's
allegations.</P>
      <P>Ma said that resumption of the cross-strait talks could likely
begin with a meeting between either Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shubei, the
secretaries general of the two sides' intermediary bodies -- Taipei's
Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the mainland's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- or between SEF Chairman
C.F. Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER AIT CHAIRMEN OPPOSE SUSPENSION OF ANNUAL TRADE CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By  Herman Pan and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>David Dean and Natale Bellocchi, both
former chairmen of the Washington-based American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT), on Saturday voiced their opposition to the proposed suspension
of the annual joint conference of the US-ROC (Taiwan) and ROC-USA
Business Councils.</P>
      <P>Dean, who served as the first chairman of the AIT when the
institute was created to handle bilateral affairs after the Republic
of China and the United States cut diplomatic relations in 1979, told
CNA that he felt "shocked" and "surprised" to learn of the US side's
intention to discontinue the annual conference.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the confab had played a very important role in the
1980s by providing an unofficial channel for ROC and US officials to
meet in the absence of formal contact between the two governments,
Dean said David Laux and Jeffrey Koo, currently the respective heads
of the US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council and ROC-US Business Council,
should consider means by which to promote the functions of the two
organizations.</P>
      <P>He suggested that instead of holding a ceremonial event each
year, the two councils should sponsor theme seminars on various
high-tech industries four or five times annually in order to boost
the willingness to participate and the substantive gains of US
attendees.</P>
      <P>Bellocchi admitted that the importance and functions of the
annual joint conference of the US-ROC (Taiwan) and ROC-USA Business
Councils have significantly declined over the past few years due to
more frequent exchanges of ranking officials between Taipei and
Washington during the tenure of former US President George Bush.
However, he insisted that the annual meeting should not be
impulsively suspended.</P>
      <P>As ranking ROC officials have been able to travel to the United
States in recent years and the two countries now hold annual
vice-ministerial trade meetings, Bellocchi said the joint conference
of the business councils is no longer the only occasion on which
officials from Taipei and Washington can meet.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that from the business community's point
of view, it is necessary to continue the yearly meeting as Taiwan
needs more private-sector channels to reflect its importance as
America's second largest market in Asia.</P>
      <P>Bellocchi attributed the declining willingness to participate in
the conference by US enterprises to lackluster support from the US
government. Taiwan dispatched three ministerial-level officials to
this year's annual conference held earlier this week in San Diego,
California, while the Clinton administration only sent one cabinet
official to the meeting, he pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING RULES OUT CURRENCY DEVALUATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing will not devalue its currency to
boost exports, despite the recent depreciations in rival Asian
manufacturing economies which threaten to undermine the
competitiveness of mainland Chinese exporters, according to reports
of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the face of the devaluation of currencies in Southeast Asian
countries, mainland China will take measures to increase the
competitiveness of its exports and its absorption of overseas funds,
the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Mainland exporters have been putting discreet pressure on Beijing
authorities for a devaluation to restore the competitive advantage
they fear may have been lost to Southeast Asian competitors, whose
devalued currencies will cut the prices of their products on
international markets.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, domestic currency markets have seen pressure for an
appreciation of the local currency, reflecting the strong demand for
the renminbi in mainland China and the view of many economists that
the currency has been undervalued since the beginning of 1994.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's forecast 9.5 percent growth this year has been
driven by the strong performance of the external sector and supported
by the continuing growth of foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>However, the recent devaluations by export-oriented economies in
Asia and the unraveling of the financial systems in Japan and Korea,
two of the mainland's most important markets and inward investors,
have raised concerns of a marked slowdown in export growth and a
possible decline in foreign investment next year.</P>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui's approval rate has
recently dropped to a new low, according to the result of a public
poll.</P>
      <P>The survey, commissioned by Kuomintang Legislative Yuan whip Chen
Hung-kee and conducted by the Gallup Organization Inc., Taiwan, shows
that less than 37 percent of the respondents gave their approval to
the president's performance over the past year, while 49.1 percent of
the polled disapproved of his job in office.</P>
      <P>This poll also also shows that Lee, who became the ROC president
following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988 and
was elected to his own term first in 1990 and again in 1996, saw his
disapproval rate overtake his approval level.</P>
      <P>The random telephone survey was conducted on Dec. 4-5 on 1,735
adults in the Taiwan area, with 1,089 of the polled giving their
answers. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The poll also shows that fewer respondents, at 34.2 percent,
approved of Vice Presdient Lien Chan's performance, while 45.4
percent said they disapproved of Lien's job.</P>
      <P>Among other high ranking-officials, the outspoken Taiwan Governor
James Soong, who has voiced his strong opposition to the central
government's decision to marginalize the Taiwan Provincial
Government, won the hearts of most of the respondents, with his
approval rate reaching as high as 79.7 percent, and disapproval at a
mere 7.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Over half of the respondents said they approved of the
performance of Premier Vincent Siew, who formed his Cabinet on Sept.
1. Those who were unsatisfied with Siew's job stood at only 10
percent.</P>
      <P>Of Siew's Cabinet ministers, Education Minister Wu Jin, who is
known for his vigorous pursuit of educational reforms, has the
highest approval rate of 69.8 percent, followed by Justice
Minister Liao Cheng-hao, who has demonstrated a determination to
fight crime, at 64.7 percent, newly installed Foreign Affairs
Minister Jason Hu, at 58.6 percent, Economic Affairs Minister Wang
Chih-kang at 48 percent and Interior Minister Yeh Chin-feng at 43
percent.</P>
      <P>The approval rates for other Cabinet members, including
Transportation and Communications Minister Tsay Jaw-yang, Finance
Minister Paul Chiu, Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling, Central Bank
of China Governor Y.D. Sheu, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang
King-yuh and Environmental Protection Administration Director-General
Tsai Hsung-hsiung, ranged between 30 percent and-36 percent, with
ratings for Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Hsu Chieh-kwei and
Department of Health Director-General Chan Chi-shean at the bottom
with 1.8 percent and 2.3 percent respectively because they are
relatively less known to the public.</P>
      <P>However, the 72 percent of the polled who said Siew should
reshuffle his Cabinet, were divided on the scale of the change, with
those who favored either a total, major or minor shakeup of
government ministers standing at 16 percent, 30.8 percent and 25.2
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Around 58 percent of the respondents said Siew should be given
the full authorization to change his Cabinet lineup, in comparison to
the nearly 8 percent of the respondents who said President Lee alone
should decide upon the reshuffle and 11 percent who favored Lee and
Siew jointly determining the change.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL PROSTITUTION RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In separate raids, police successfully
busted up an international prostitution ring Sunday night, arresting
41 people, including prostitutes, operatives and drivers.</P>
      <P>None of the prostitutes arrested were from Taiwan. They were
holders of passports from Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China,
Malaysia and Singapore. They were in Taiwan on tourist visas, or on
the basis of fallacious marriages with local men, according to Taipei
District Prosecutor Liu Cheng-wu, who directed the crackdown.</P>
      <P>Acting on tips received three months ago, the police decided to
move Sunday night, sweeping down on 40 hotels and hostels in both
Taipei City and Taipei County. Among the arrested were Tsai Teh-liang
and his wife, Chen Hsiao-mei, who were apparently the operators of
the prostitution ring.</P>
      <P>Police had been tipped off that Tsai and Chen ran an underground
brothel named "Lily," employing more than 100 women on their service
list as well as some 60 drivers and bodyguards.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Sunday night raids were only part of the crackdown
action, adding that the international sex ring will not be thoroughly
eradicated until some 110 other people have been nabbed.</P>
      <P>Liu said he believes that the ring is supported by an underworld
syndicate which runs an efficient human smuggling operation from
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He said he will ask Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian and Taipei County
Magistrate You Ching for cooperation in authorizing a crackdown on
nearly 100 hostels in the greater Taipei area, which are thought to
have collaborated in conducting the illicit sex trade.</P>
      <P>According to investigators, the overseas prostitutes charged
between NT$4,000 and NT$10,000 (US$125-US$312.5) for 40 minutes of
their services.</P>
      <P>Fearing that the women could bring an even more serious impact to
Taiwan society besides the illicit activity, Liu ordered the arrested
prostitutes to undergo health exams to determine whether they are
HIV-positive or drug users.</P>
      <P>Liu also called for revisions to existing entry-exit laws. He
said lax guarantor requirements under the regulations should be
revised to make it more difficult for women to remain in the country
as "fake brides" or under the pretense of tourism.</P>
      <P>In addition, Liu urged revisions to anti-prostitution laws that
would enable law enforcement agencies to publicize the names of
customers who frequent the brothels, saying such measures would
provide a greater deterrent to the illicit activity.</P>
      <P>To nip the source of demand is the only effective way to
eradicate the supply, Liu stressed, adding that "the sex trade will
wither if there is no patronage."</P>
      <P>Liu also mentioned that he and his officers had received full
cooperation from Thai police during the last three months in order to
crack the cross-border ring. Cooperation from Hong Kong and mainland
China counterparts, however, has not been significant, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT DOLLAR HAS ROOM FOR APPRECIATION: ROC SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Judging from the fundamentals of
Taiwan's economy, the New Taiwan dollar remains undervalued and there
should be room for its appreciation, David Lee, the Republic of China
government spokesman, said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee, director-general of the Government Information Office, noted
that Taiwan's efforts to push for financial liberalization will make
it difficult for the government to fend off international
speculators. But he expressed belief that the level of the NT dollar
is still too low in view of the fact that the nation's economic
fundamentals are sound. The local currency ended at a rate of 31.775
against one US dollar last week.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is on a week-long tour of the United States, said that
he has been frequently asked during his visit how Taiwan has emerged
unscathed from the financial crisis which swept through Southeast
Asia in recent months.</P>
      <P>He would answered that Taiwan has a sound economic policy and
good fundamentals, adding that Taiwan has a foreign currency reserve
of US$82 billion and a foreign debt of only US$100 million. The ratio
of the foreign debt to its gross domestic product (GDP) is the second
lowest in Asia.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the economic growth of Taiwan is expected to reach
6.7 percent this year, which will not only be the highest rate since
1992, but will also be top among the four Asian tiger economies.
Taiwan's trade surplus for 1997 is expected to reach US$8 billion.</P>
      <P>Lee left Taipei for New York on Thursday. The main purpose of his
trip is to brief major US media on recent developments in Taiwan,
including the islandwide local elections held in late November, the
social order situation, and the approaches and strategies for coping
with the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO SPONSOR APPU ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON JAN. 14-16</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Assembly's efforts to promote
parliamentary diplomacy have paid off as it has been authorized to
host the 61st annual conference of the Asian-Pacific
Parliamentarians' Union (APPU) next January.</P>
      <P>The meeting will be held at the Taipei International Convention
Center on Jan. 14-16 with the participation of parliamentary speakers
and MPs from 24 Asia-Pacific countries and areas, including Japan,
South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Fiji and Guam.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government has attached great importance to
the upcoming extravaganza as the ROC doesn't maintain formal
diplomatic ties with most of the APPU member countries.</P>
      <P>APPU is one of the few international organizations in which the
ROC has managed to participate with its full national title. Mainland
China has repeatedly applied to join the organization with an aim to
replace the ROC, but its bid has consistently failed.</P>
      <P>Since former Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien assumed
the post as National Assembly speaker last year, the National
Assembly has actively sought the right to host an APPU annual
congress.</P>
      <P>Although Hong Kong is also an APPU member, it remains unclear
whether it will send representatives to the Taipei meeting now that
the territory has reverted to mainland China's rule.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew is expected to deliver a keynote speech at
the opening session of the APPU conference, and President Lee
Teng-hui will meet with influential parliamentarians from all APPU
member states during their stay here.</P>
      <P>The Asia-Pacific delegates will also meet with other senior ROC
officials to exchange views on promoting bilateral or regional
cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>The functions of the National Assembly are more limited in scope
than those of the parliament or congress of a Western democracy. In
the ROC, the role of parliament is jointly filled by the National
Assembly and the Legislative Yuan. The Assembly's functions include
amending the nation's Constitution and exercising the power of
confirmation on the appointment of personnel nominated by the
president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP NOT TO FORSAKE 'INDEPENDENCE' PLATFORM: HSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Renan Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) will not forsake its "independence" platform because it
is an important historic document, the party's chairman said here on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Taiwan's latest political situation, DPP
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said Taiwan is already a de facto independent
sovereign country. "It is far more practical to protect Taiwan's
current independent status than to advocate establishment of a de
jure independent Taiwan republic," Hsu claimed, adding Taiwan must
treasure what it already has.</P>
      <P>Hsu said although the DPP will not revise the commitment to
"promoting Taiwan independence" enshrined in the party platform, that
principle will serve only as a symbol of the party's basic stance.
"The practice is similar to Beijing's strategy. The constitution of
the People's Republic of China clearly states that the country
upholds Marxism. However, Beijing has not really implemented Marxist
tenets," he argued.</P>
      <P>While soliciting international support for its cause, Hsu said,
Taiwan must exercise caution and prudence to avoid defying the
general global trends. "Otherwise, we would likely witness a
boomerang effect."</P>
      <P>Hsu has been at odds with many other DPP heavyweights over policy
toward mainland China. At Sunday's seminar, the outspoken DPP
chairman cautiously but firmly explained why he has advocated a
daring "westbound policy" of increased engagement with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Hsu
said, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait cannot avoid greater
across-the-board commercial exchanges in the future. "Taiwan must
take preemptive actions in order to gain an upper hand in the race
with Beijing."</P>
      <P>Claiming that military confrontation is unlikely to erupt between
Taiwan and the mainland under the newly emerging world order, the
optimistic DPP chairman said the outcome of the cross-strait rivalry
will hinge on the economic strength possessed by the two sides. "It
will be a long-term confrontation, maybe lasting 50 to 100 years," he
observed.</P>
      <P>"Since Taiwan is confident in its economic clout, why shouldn't
it take bold steps to boost exchanges in that area with the mainland
to further beef up its economic strength despite the political
standoff?" he reasoned.</P>
      <P>Hsu also urged Taipei and Beijing authorities to learn from the
ordeals Israel, Palestine and Bosnia have endured by avoiding
international interference in their dispute. "The governments on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait should use their wisdom to resolve their
problems on their own accord," he stressed, adding that history has
shown outside involvement often presents only painful options that
are undesirable to the parties directly concerned.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that neither Taipei nor Beijing can
resolve cross-strait disputes solely based on their own wishes or
aspirations. "For its part, Taiwan must do its utmost to work out
concrete measures that would ensure the best possible benefits for
the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Hsu, accompanied by several DPP departmental chiefs, arrived in
New York on Saturday, the first stop on his week-long visit to the
United States aimed at publicizing the party's basic policies on
major issues facing Taiwan as well as at finding out general American
opinions on issues related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The trip has drawn much attention here as the DPP scored a
resounding win in Taiwan's local elections held on Nov. 29. The DPP
won 12 of the 23 mayoral and county chief posts up for grabs in the
nationwide polls, while the ruling Kuomintang garnered only eight
seats and nonpartisan candidates won in three constituencies.</P>
      <P>Hsu and his colleagues left for Washington, D.C. on Sunday
evening. During his stay in the US capital, Hsu is expected to meet
with senior American officials in charge of Taiwan and East Asian
affairs for wide-ranging talks, most notably on the DPP's policy
toward mainland China.</P>

together with internal measures such as incentives, regulations and
preferential government procurement practices.</P>
      <P>Malaysia's recent growth has largely been based on increase in
the volume of capital rather than in its efficient allocation. Total

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO REMAIN A MODEL OF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As East Asia sinks further into economic
quicksand, the best way for Taiwan to assist its victimized neighbors
is by "continuing to be an exemplar" of good economic and marketing
policies, an expert from the Heritage Foundation said here on Monday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Kim Holmes, vice chairman of the US-based
Heritage Foundation, said if other governments, including that of the
United States, truly want to help the nations affected by the Asian
financial turmoil, they should know "what to do, and what not to do."</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
should have not been so hasty in offering to help revive South
Korea's battered economy overnight.</P>
      <P>Such a move will only make matters worse in the long term for
that nation and for the entire Asian economic structure, Holmes
noted.</P>
      <P>Asked how Taiwan is expected to fare in the face of the East
Asian upheavals, Holmes said the island has made commendable
performances in monetary and property rights policies, and can play a
positive role simply by retaining its reputation as a "model" player.</P>
      <P>Holmes said Taiwan, rated the seventh in the world for level of
economic freedom by a recent poll, did not remain relatively
unscathed by the financial crisis without reason. "Other governments
should reflect why Hong Kong and Taiwan could stay out of the
upheavals while Malaysia and Indonesia did not," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the 1998 Index of Economic Freedom compiled by the
Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, the economies of
Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand and Switzerland, in that
order, are the five freest in the world.</P>
      <P>The United States was declared the sixth most liberalized economy
on the globe, while Taiwan ranked seventh, on a par with Britain and
Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>While Japan and Australia, labeled as "mostly free," were tied in
12th position, South Korea came in 24th.</P>
      <P>Mainland China fell in at 120th place, down among countries that
allow only limited freedom in economic activities, such as Albania,
the Congo, Bangladesh and Croatia.</P>
      <P>Economies that were rated among the least free were North Korea
and Laos (both 154) and Vietnam (147), the index showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO BOOST MAINLAND STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In view of a rapidly changing world
political situation, the government should strive to enhance the
understanding of Taiwan among mainland China students studying
overseas, two respected scholars said here Monday.</P>
      <P>Tien Chang-lin, former chancellor of the University of California
at Berkeley, and Shen Chun-shan, former president of National Tsing
Hua University, said the government should seek to increase the
knowledge of mainland students regarding the situation on Taiwan so
that their attitudes toward cross-strait relations would not be so
one-sided.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that the number of mainland students being educated
abroad has increased rapidly in recent years, and that their areas of
study have expanded to the humanities, economics and technology
fields. He added that many young professors at leading universities
such as Harvard, UC Berkeley and Columbia are mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>Such a phenomenon will afford tremendous opportunities for the
Republic of China's national diplomacy, he said.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan students studying in the United States have
contributed much to the maintenance of good relations between those
two countries in the past, he said.</P>
      <P>And today, young mainland scholars are increasingly able to speak
objectively on cross-strait relations because they have a better
understanding of Taiwan. But in a rapidly changing political
environment, Tien said, the ROC government should take more direct
measures to avail itself of the opportunities presented by this
situation.</P>
      <P>Shen also pointed out that mainland students studying overseas
often identify well with Western democracy and are thus able to
appreciate the democratic developments achieved in Taiwan.
Accordingly, when these intellectual elites return to the mainland,
they will take with them a positive image of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shen also voiced concern that too many of Taiwan's young people
studying abroad have been concentrated in the science and information
fields, and have ignored the humanities.</P>
      <P>In the wake of recent controversy surrounding the ROC
government's proposal to accredit degrees conferred by mainland
colleges and universities, Tien commented that many educational
facilities there in fact have high academic standards.</P>
      <P>Tien, who frequently travels between the United States and the
mainland, said the overall academic level on the mainland does not
equal Taiwan's standards. However, he added, the more prestigious
mainland universities often surpass local standards.</P>
      <P>Shen echoed his words, saying that some mainland universities are
superior to the top schools here. He said that they have elite
enrollment and that the mainland students are endowed with a high
sense of purpose, despite having meager budgets for their education.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TV &amp; BROADCASTING EXCHANGE SEMINAR HELD IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A seminar on the exchange of TV and
broadcasting information across the Taiwan Strait opened in Taipei on
Monday, aimed at ushering in cooperation between the two sides in
this field.</P>
      <P>Many heads of TV and broadcast media from both mainland China and
Taiwan attended the seminar to observe the 10th anniversary of the
beginning of cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Guo Baoxing, head of the mainland delegation, pointed out that
although mainland China's TV and broadcasting media can follow and
take part in protocol, research and public relations affairs with
their counterparts from the United States and Europe, it is more
important to develop these relations between the two sides of the
strait, since both sides share the same cultural origins.</P>
      <P>Since cross-strait exchanges began ten years ago, remarked Yen
Jon-chang, deputy director of the ROC's Government Information
Office, they have developed rapidly from nothing, to contact in many
different areas, so that relations have evolved from mere interaction
to that of practical exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chang Liang-jen, deputy secretary general of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation, stressed that a bridge built across the
strait through the news media would be far more significant than the
establishment of direct transport links. TV and broadcasting could be
termed as the most important channel for promoting understanding
between the two sides, Guo added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP'S  RISE  MAY  COMPLICATE CHINA'S UNIFICATION (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  8  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rise of the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in Taiwan may complicate the process of reunification
negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, said an
article carried in Monday's edition of The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>The article pointed out that the landslide victory of the DPP in
the recent elections for city mayors and county chiefs has made it
the "most influential force at the grassroots level" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP is effectively running the daily affairs of 72 percent of
the total population, who generate 83 percent of the national
revenue.</P>
      <P>Its solid performance paves the way for its eventual showdown
with the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in the next presidential poll,
scheduled to take place in 2000, notes the article.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been so overwhelmed by the "unification-independence"
dilemma that there is no escaping a serious political re-think, it
says.</P>
      <P>DPP chairman Hsu Hsin-liang attributed the convincing victory to
the "successful transformation" of the party. Among the key
ideological positions transformed was its stand towards mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The DPP is learning its lesson the long, hard way, says the
article.</P>
      <P>During the presidential election last year, it notes, the DPP
campaigned for independence in an aggressive high-profile fashion.
The result was disastrous.</P>
      <P>It managed to obtain only 21 percent of the votes, the lowest in
all elections since its founding.</P>
      <P>This forced party leaders to review China policy and to adopt a
more pragmatic and conciliatory approach.</P>
      <P>For example, it says, just before the Nov. 29 elections, Hsu
called openly for the establishment of "three direct links" between
Taiwan and the mainland, a major reversal of the DPP's previous
position. "This moderation made the party less intimidating to
voters," it comments.</P>
      <P>Conversely, it adds, President Lee Teng-hui's policy to restrict
Taiwan's investment in mainland China may have been a contributory
factor to the KMT rout.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that his restrictive policy is beginning to
"backfire" as it has alienated most of his ardent supporters in the
business sector. They feel compelled to come out, one after another,
to criticize his policy, the article notes.</P>
      <P>One of them was Chang Yung-fa of the Evergreen Group, who is
known for his past support of the president.</P>
      <P>When Chang spoke against Lee, it left a "bad impression" of the
party and a "sour taste" in the mouths of its supporters, comments
the article.</P>
      <P>So far, it points out, Beijing's reaction has been extremely
cautious.</P>
      <P>The extreme caution shows that mainland China does not appreciate
fully the election's implications and the question of whether Beijing
should establish contacts with the DPP, at least on an informal
level, it says.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China has been preparing for the probability
that the DPP will one day become the ruling party in Taiwan, "the
speedy pace at which this seemed to be taking place still surprised
Beijing", comments the article.</P>
      <P>But one thing is certain. Now that the DPP is enjoying the
majority support from the people, mainland China will have to review
its negotiation tactics, it asserts.</P>
      <P>Since the early 1980s, its "united front" tactics towards Taiwan
have always been based on a separation between the ruling and the
ruled, which Beijing assumes have conflicting interests.</P>
      <P>In Beijing's view, the KMT has vested interests in maintaining
its ruling position and therefore is reluctant to enter into
unification talks, while the general masses know there is greater
benefit in reuniting with a strong mainland China, says the article.</P>
      <P>It follows that Beijing can make use of this conflict to force
the KMT into negotiations.</P>
      <P>Thus, its standard slogan since 1979 has been: "We place our hope
on the authority (of Taiwan), we also place our hope on the people
(of Taiwan)."</P>
      <P>Such a tactic might be effective if the underlying assumption is
correct, the article comments.

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>But Taiwan has changed so
drastically since political reform started in the later years of
former President Chiang Ching-kuo's rule that the people's desire for
unification is no longer what it used to be, notes the Straits Times.</P>
      <P>The latest election results confirm this. Voters supported a DPP
which demanded independence, notwithstanding Beijing's pressure, it
comments.</P>
      <P>So, it asks, if both the "authority" and the "people" are not too
keen on unification, where else can Beijing place its hopes?</P>
      <P>It is clear that Beijing needs to overhaul its entire thinking on
the DPP issue. The problem is complicated by the fact that in future,
Beijing will have to deal with a political force with which it has no
links at all, says the article.</P>
      <P>If it had a choice, Beijing would prefer to deal with the more
predictable KMT, than the erratic DPP, it comments.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has dealt with the KMT for at
least 70 years. It is familiar with its rivals, and there are many
people in mainland China, Taiwan and elsewhere who have good
relations with the senior members of both parties.</P>
      <P>These people can play a mediating role during critical moments in
negotiations, it notes.</P>
      <P>Finally, it adds, there is also the practical problem of who
Beijing should talk to, the fading KMT or the DPP, which is gaining
greater popularity.</P>
      <P>In dealing with sensitive political issues, Beijing has always
preferred a one-to-one approach, the article notes.</P>
      <P>Thus, the rise of the DPP may complicate the negotiation process
somewhat, it comments.</P>
      <P>The sooner Beijing and the political forces in Taiwan come to
grips with this change, the faster and easier it will be for real
negotiations to begin, it concludes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP NOT TO SELL OFF TAIWAN PEOPLE'S INTERESTS: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian said on Monday
that the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) resounding win in the
Nov. 29 mayoral and county chief elections will have a positive
effect on future relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the development of cross-strait
relations in the wake of the DPP victory, the influential DPP
politician said the pro-Taiwan independence party will never "sell
off" the benefits of the people of Taiwan should it become the ruling
party and begin negotiations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the outcome of the latest elections was
critical to the DPP, as it helped the party rebuild its confidence
after its defeat in Taiwan's first direct presidential election in
March 1996.</P>
      <P>The DPP won 12 of the 23 mayoral and county chief posts up for
grabs in the local elections, while the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
garnered only eight seats, the remaining three going to independent
candidates. "The victory has helped our party shake off the
pessimistic sentiments prevalent among DPP members in the aftermath
of last year's presidential election in which the DPP bagged only 21
percent of the vote," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The outspoken mayor claimed that the DPP's latest victory
indicates that the people of Taiwan are able and qualified to
determine the future direction of cross-strait relations, in addition
to pursuing a democratic way of life. "This will contribute to the
positive development of cross-strait ties," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say the DPP's win will also allow for the
adjustment of some old-fashioned concepts which disregard Taiwan in
favor of mainland China and overlook the DPP in favor of the KMT.</P>
      <P>The mayor also said he is confident that the DPP will come to
power in the not-too-distant future, and that it will be the party
most likely to represent Taiwan in negotiations with the mainland.
"And if our party finally negotiates with China, it will under no
circumstances sacrifice the interests or benefits of the people
here."</P>
      <P>With its latest electoral win, Chen said, the DPP's social and
political responsibilities have increased profoundly, as more than 75
percent of Taiwan's population will fall under the party's
jurisdiction at the local level starting on Dec. 20, when all the
newly elected mayors and county magistrates are to assume office.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, the DPP must become an even more mature
and accountable party," Chen said, giving the assurance that the DPP
"will never fool around with" the physical safety or the property of
the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, the DPP will not revise its
pro-independence party platform. "Once we become the ruling party, we
will hold a referendum on the future of Taiwan, a commitment
enshrined in the DPP platform," he said, adding that the timing and
the provisions of the referendum could be determined "flexibly and
pragmatically."</P>
      <P>Touching on the DPP's cross-strait policy, Chen admitted that the
party has yet to forge an internal consensus in this regard. "Similar
lack of consensus can also be seen within the KMT and the (other main
opposition) New Party," he noted. "I hope all the three major
political parties here will first forge their own intraparty
consensus on the issue before seeking a nationwide consensus."</P>
      <P>The mayor also pointed out that he personally objects to a
proposal advocated by some local business leaders that Taiwan start
negotiations with mainland China for direct trade, postal and
transportation links. "I support the government's current `no haste,
be patient' policy toward economic ties with Beijing," he said,
adding that local business executives should put overall national
interests above their corporate interests.</P>
      <P>Chen again mentioned the three prerequisites necessary before he
would consider a visit to the Chinese mainland. "I would visit the
mainland only in my capacity as Taipei mayor, the visit would have to
be permitted by the KMT-controlled central government and it would
have to comply with DPP policy," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that if Beijing continues to deny him a permission
to visit as a popularly elected mayor of Taipei, the chances of
President Lee Teng-hui making a "journey of peace" to the mainland
would also be very slim.</P>
      <P>The seminar, which was sponsored by an association of local
reporters covering cross-strait relations, was held at a conference
room in the offices of the Straits Exchange Foundation, a
semi-official body set up by ROC authorities to handle exchanges with
the mainland in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIA SINICA TO REGULATE ITS PUBLICATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica, the highest-level academic
body in the Republic of China, said on Monday that it will formulate
comprehensive rules to regulate the publication of study results,
particularly those purely based on personal narrative, by its
research fellows.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Yuan T. Lee made the remarks at a news
conference held after Liu Feng-han, a researcher with the academy's
Institute of Modern History, published a biography of Gen. Wen
Ha-hsiung, former Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Force,
based solely on Wen's narrative.</P>
      <P>This narrative included harsh criticisms of the personalities of
former Premier Hau Pei-tsun, ruling Kuomintang Secretary General John
Chang and his wife, attracting much attention from the highly
sensitive local political community.</P>
      <P>Lee, a Nobel prize laureate, said the narrative form of recording
history is a reflection of the narrator's personal feelings, and
should not be confused with hard facts. "The academic value of such
records is not as high as the result of objective academic study," he
said, adding that narration is only one of the many ways of
collecting historical facts or materials.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Academia Sinica Vice President
Yang Kuo-shu said the publication of oral histories should be
carefully regulated to avoid potential libel or invasion of privacy
of "third parties."</P>
      <P>Yang said he will conduct discussions with officials of the
Institute of Modern History to work out detailed rules to regulate
such publications in future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT SHIPPING SEMINAR OPENS IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to promote exchanges of shipping
technology between Taiwan and mainland China, the fourth cross-strait
maritime research seminar opened here on Monday, attended by more
than 100 officials, academics and shipping executives from the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>T.H. Chen, president of the Taipei-based Chinese Maritime
Research Institute, and Cao Zhongxi, vice chairman of mainland
China's Association for Shipping Across the Taiwan Strait (ASATS) and
head of the Taiwan Affairs Office under mainland China's Ministry of
Communications, co-chaired the two-day symposium.</P>
      <P>The seminar was first held in 1994 in Xiamen, a port city in
mainland China's Fujian province, and has been held every year since,
hosted by each side alternately. Over the course of the meetings,
consensus has gradually been reached on opening partial direct
shipping links across the Taiwan Strait, with actual sailings
beginning in April of this year.</P>
      <P>Chen, who also serves as president of the Yangming Marine
Transport Corp., hailed the point-to-point direct shipping which has
helped boost development of bilateral trade. But he stressed that
Taiwan shipping companies will abide by government policy regarding
the establishment of overall direct shipping links with the mainland,
and called on the authorities in Beijing to allow more ports to
operate direct point-to-point shipping services connecting with
Taiwan's offshore transshipment center at the southern port of
Kaohsiung, which became operational in April.</P>
      <P>Delivering a speech at the seminar, Li Jian, ASATS vice secretary
general, called for the early opening of direct and full shipping
traffic between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Li said that the lack of full direct shipping ties is a serious
problem for the shipping sectors of Taiwan and the mainland and that
both sides are hopeful that such ties can be established as soon as
possible. He claimed that direct ties will help shippers on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait to save at least US$100 million per year
in transport costs as they would no longer have to travel via Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations promulgated respectively by Taipei and
Beijing last year, only Kaohsiung and the Fujian ports of Xiamen and
Fuzhou can handle direct shipping across the Taiwan Strait at the
present time. Only six foreign-registered shippers on each side of
the strait have been approved to ply the routes to transport products
destined for a third country or area.</P>
      <P>Lee Mi, a professor at National Taiwan Oceanic University, said
the opening of full direct cross-strait shipping is a purely economic
issue, but that political interference has distorted the issue. He
said that Taiwan and mainland China should forswear ideological
confrontation to jointly study the issue in a rational and
professional manner for the benefit of the people of both sides.</P>
      <P>Zhou Ting-fang, director of the business management school at
mainland China's Wuhan Jiaotong University of Technology, said
Taiwan's reluctance to open full direct shipping links with the
mainland will jeopardize economic development on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The actual distance across the Taiwan Strait is only about 150
nautical miles, but the voyage amounts to 620 nautical miles if
vessels are required to travel via Hong Kong, Zhou pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan- and mainland-bound products from either side of the
Taiwan Strait currently must first be transported to a third party,
usually Hong Kong, before they are allowed to continue to their final
destination, resulting in huge losses in time and transport costs for
shipping agents of both sides.</P>
      <P>Many of the professionals and shipping representatives from both
sides who are participating in the seminar called on both governments
to ease regulations governing cross-strait shipping in order to help
shippers overcome the existing barriers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIRS ITS SUPPORT FOR DRIVE AGAINST LAND MINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has made known to
Canada its support for the drive against land mines despite being
excluded from the signing of an international anti-mine convention,
and two ROC civil groups have been playing active roles in the
non-official international campaign to ban the anti-personnel
devices, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday.</P>
      <P>Because it is not represented at the United Nations, the ROC was
prevented from joining the pact that was signed in Ottawa, Canada by
125 countries last week, Roy Wu, a spokesman for the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Although Canada rather than the United Nations was the organizer
of the Ottawa ceremony, Canada conducted the affair under the
framework of the world body and only invited UN member states to
attend, he said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taipei has conveyed to Ottawa its support for a ban
on land mines, and two Taiwan-based private groups, the Eden Social
Welfare Foundation and Anti-Land Mine Network of Taiwan, took part in
the forum of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) held in parallel
with the conference in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>The two Taiwan groups also signed an NGO declaration aimed at
pooling private groups' resources to prohibit and clear land mines as
well as to help mine victims, said Wu.</P>
      <P>He cited the ROC's efforts last year to help its ally Honduras
clear itself of mines and the Eden Foundation's promise in Ottawa to
raise some US$1 million to purchase 10,000 wheelchairs for those
maimed by land mines as proof of the government's anti-mine efforts.</P>
      <P>The Eden Foundation has already contributed 500 wheelchairs to

    <HEADLINE>NO BAD INTENTIONS BEHIND SURVEY: KMT LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Chen Hung-kee of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), who on Sunday made public the results of a survey
that showed President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President Lien Chan with
low approval ratings, said Monday that there were no bad intentions
behind his commissioning of the poll.</P>
      <P>Chen said the results of the Gallup Poll conducted Dec. 4-5
should serve as a reminder to the KMT that it must go ahead with
further reforms to meet the ever-rising expectations of the people.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,089 adults in the wake of local
elections found that less than 37 percent of the respondents said
they approve of Lee's performance over the past year, while even
fewer respondents, at 34.2 percent, said they approve of Lien's
performance.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that he doesn't think it was improper to commission
a survey in the wake of the local elections that brought the KMT its
first-ever loss of the majority of the 23 mayoral and county
magistrate seats up for grabs.</P>
      <P>Despite the KMT's overwhelming defeat in the local elections,
Chen said that the party still has a good chance to win back the
support of the people. He went on to explain that the poll showed
that 21.9 percent of those interviewed said that they are pro-KMT,
while 13.1 percent said they are inclined to support the opposition
Democratic Progress Party.</P>
      <P>While stressing that the survey was not ill-intentioned, Chen
admitted that some of the poll questions could have been better, such
as the one on the vice president's performance. Chen said that it
would have been better to ask the respondents to rate Lien's
"performance" rather than his "administrative performance."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a high-ranking official at the Presidential Office who
preferred to be unnamed said the Presidential Office has paid
attention to the survey but that it has no plans to explain or
clarify the low approval ratings Lee and Lien received.</P>
      <P>The official, however, said there are too many surveys in Taiwan
and that some of them do not reflect the facts, adding that the
companies conducting the polls should be more objective.</P>
      <P>That the survey was conducted following the KMT's rout in the
elections might be one of the reasons why Lee and Lien did not score
high approval ratings, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEAR MISS BETWEEN AIRPLANES REPORTED IN HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A disastrous collision between two
passenger airliners was narrowly averted last Friday when a
descending Air China plane pulled up rapidly to avoid hitting a China
Airlines plane that was taxying on a runway at Hong Kong's Kai Tak
International Airport, said a local daily Monday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Apple Daily said Air China flight 107 from
Beijing reached skies above Kai Tak airport shortly before 8 p.m.
Friday. But when it tried to land, its pilot found the Taipei-bound
China Airlines flight 666 preparing to take off from the runway it
was bound for, the daily said.</P>
      <P>The pilot of the Air China plane immediately took emergency
action to climb and managed to avoid a disaster.</P>
      <P>After the incident, the plane landed safely on its second try.
Its pilot told the shocked passengers that a plane was moving on the
runway on which his plane was cleared for landing.</P>
      <P>The pilot used the plane's public address system to apologize for
the scare but said that "it was the fault of the Hong Kong control
tower, which had granted me clearance to land."</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong official told CNA on Monday, however, that the Air
China flight was not cleared for landing but rather told to "prepare
for landing."</P>
      <P>Kai Tak is the world's third busiest airport, with one airplane
landing or taking-off every two or three minutes. The Hong Kong
government is building a new airport on Lantau Island that is slated
to open in April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIU CHAO-SHIUAN TO BE NAMED VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Science Council (NSC) Chairman Liu
Chao-shiuan will be appointed to serve as the nation's vice premier,
the Government Information Office (GIO) confirmed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The GIO said Liu will concurrently remain as NSC head for the
time being, with his successor in that position to be chosen when
Premier Vincent Siew reshuffles his Cabinet, which is expected to
occur sometime early next year.</P>
      <P>Liu's appointment is expected to be approved by a regular meeting
of the ruling Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He will thereupon officially take over the vice premiership from
John Chang, who has been appointed as the new Kuomintang
secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Liu said Wednesday that he will focus his efforts on upgrading
the nation's science and technology fields. As development in these
areas requires talented professionals, he said, educational reforms
also will be one of the main priorities.</P>
      <P>Liu, 55, received a bachelor of sciences degree from National
Taiwan University and a doctorate in chemistry from the University of
Toronto in Canada. He has served as the minister of transportation
and communications and as president of National Tsing Hua University.</P>
      <P>The versatile Liu also wrote several kung fu action novels in his
youth under the pen name "Shan Kuan Ting." Many of those works are
still on the market.</P>
      <P>Sources said that Liu was chosen over a number of other
candidates, including Minister Without Portfolio Lin Feng-cheng,
becuase he is younger, possesses a strong scientific background, and
has good connections in educational and cultural fields, all of which
could be beneficial to Premier Siew's Cabinet. Liu is close to Yuan
T. Lee, president of the esteemed research institute Academia Sinica,
and his brother Liu Chao-han is the president of National Central
University.</P>
      <P>The sources said that in choosing his right-hand man, Siew had
ruled out candidates whose background and qualifications were similar
to his own, referring to the premier's specialties in financial
matters, foreign policy and mainland China affairs.</P>
      <P>Liu stood out because Siew was also very impressed by his
performance when he served at the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications and at the NSC, they said.</P>
      <P>Young and energetic, Liu is credited with initiating and
coordinating many projects, including the satellite launch program,
during his 18-month-stint as NSC chairman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP MAGISTRATE-ELECT RENEWS SUPPORT FOR REFERENDUM ON BAYER PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Liao Yung-lai, Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) magistrate-elect for Taichung County in central Taiwan, said on
Monday that he remains committed to holding a referendum to decide
the fate of a proposed project by multinational chemical and
pharmaceutical giant Bayer.</P>
      <P>Liao, who is also the leader of a citizens' alliance opposed to
Bayer's first investment project in Taiwan, stressed that his
anti-pollution stance should not be misinterpreted as an
"anti-business" complex. Low-pollution enterprises are welcome to set
up production bases in the county, he added.</P>
      <P>Liao also expressed dissatisfaction over alleged interference by
the DPP leadership in local affairs, saying that he objects to a
proposal by the party headquarters that a public hearing rather than
a referendum be held in Taichung County to decide if Bayer should be
allowed to set up a chemical manufacturing plant near Taichung
Harbor.</P>
      <P>Both during the recent election campaign and following his
victory in the polls, Liao publicly said on several occasions that
Bayer's investment plan should be subject to a referendum held in the
county.</P>
      <P>His remarks have aroused concern and uncertainty among foreign
investors, evidenced by a statement issued by the European Council of
Commerce and Trade in Taipei earlier this month, in which it demanded
that the ROC government clarify its policy on foreign investment in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang and Sisy Chen, director of the DPP's
publicity department, met with executives of Bayer Taiwan Co. last
week to clarify the party's stance on the referendum as part of
efforts to allay foreign investors' uneasiness over the DPP position.</P>
      <P>Chen said after the meeting that the DPP has no bias against
Bayer's investment project. The party headquarters would coordinate
with Liao to arrange a public hearing on the proposed chemical plant
with participation by scholars, experts, Bayer officials and
representatives from the citizens' group opposed to the plan, she
added.</P>
      <P>An official with Bayer's public relations department said that
the first stage of the investment project has passed the central
government's environmental impact evaluations, but that construction
work cannot start until a land lease is obtained from the Taiwan
Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>The official said that the first stage of construction work,
originally slated to begin last year, is estimated to cost NT$10
billion (US$3.15 billion) and take two and a half years to complete.
The total investment value of the 10-year, three-stage project is
estimated at NT$50 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ TO CALL MEETING ON JUVENILE CRIME PREVENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With juvenile crime increasing in both
frequency and degree of seriousness, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
announced on Tuesday it will call a meeting on Dec. 17 to discuss
effective measures by which to curb the problem.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it will invite officials from the Ministry of
the Interior, the Ministry of Education and other relevant government
agencies to jointly work out strategies for control of juvenile
crime.</P>
      <P>"We need better tactics to implement an effective juvenile crime
prevention package," an MOJ official said, adding it is worrisome
that juvenile delinquents are becoming younger and that the crimes
they commit are becoming more serious.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ tallies, the number of juveniles convicted of
sex-related crimes reached 302 in the first eight months of this
year, up from 197 recorded for the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official said gambling, drug abuse, assault and
burglary have remained the most common juvenile crimes for the past
10 years, accounting for 60 percent of all convictions involving
minors. "It is regretful that some adults have even used contraband
drugs to manipulate young people and direct them to commit crime," he
added.</P>
      <P>The official said the MOJ will cooperate with the Ministry of
Education to launch a campaign to help inculcate law-abiding concepts
among the nation's youth.</P>
      <P>The MOJ will also join forces with local prosecution offices as
well as charitable and religious groups to sponsor more recreational
programs for juveniles, the official added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several law professors and legal experts urged
law-enforcement authorities to reinforce reformatory education and
correctional services for juvenile criminals and delinquents, saying
such programs are far more effective in reducing juvenile crime than
the imposition of stringent sentences on underage convicts.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that reformatory education and rehabilitation
form a critical part of the juvenile penal system. They suggested
that the government seek assistance from religious groups and other
social organizations to help juvenile prisoners cope with grievances
and rid themselves of vengeful sentiments so that they can rebuild
their lives after completing their jail terms.</P>
      <P>Two National Taiwan University law professors -- Chang Kan-mei
and Ho Teh-fen -- also criticized judicial authorities for the
unprecedented sentences meted out to four young rapists on Monday.</P>
      <P>The four school dropouts were given prison terms ranging from 17
to 20 years following their conviction on sexual assault and battery
charges in connection with the rape of several teenage girls earlier
this year.</P>
      <P>The two professors said the sentences were too harsh, adding that
the youths' parents and the entire society should likewise bear some
degree of responsibility for their crimes. "Their parents should also
be penalized for failing to teach their kids proper behavioral
concepts," Professor Chang said.</P>
      <P>She further pointed out that Taiwan's educational system should
be reformed in order to better socialize the younger generation and
reduce juvenile crime.</P>
      <P>Professor Ho urged all relevant government agencies to make
concerted efforts to reach out to young dropouts and encourage them
to continue their education.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO)

year, 70 percent to 80 percent of whom are in Asian countries.</P>
      <P>WHO bacteriologist Bernard Ivanoff said at the opening of the
13th Typhoid Symposium in Denpasar, Bali, Monday that typhoid also
infects 16 to 33 million people a year and most of them live in
developing countries.</P>
      <P>"The typhoid bacteria grows in a place where the sanitation and
hygiene systems do not function well," he was quoted by Indonesia's

attacks the respiratory system.</P>
      <P>Children 8 to 9 years old are most susceptible to this disease.</P>
      <P>Up to now, he said, there is no vaccine to prevent this disease.
"Antibiotic therapy is sufficient to treat typhoid for now."</P>
      <P>He said the number of cases of "S. typh" (typhoid bacteria),

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Securities transaction revenue has reached
the annual targeted goal of NT$57.2 billion (US$1.78 billion) for
fiscal 1998, ending next June, the Finance Ministry announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the Finance Ministry's Department of
Statistics, said that as of Monday, the securities transaction
revenue since the beginning of July has totaled NT$56.89 billion, and
that if Tuesday's turnover on the stock exchange surpassed NT$100
billion, the government's fiscal 1998 target for securities
transaction revenue of NT$57.2 billion will be reached much earlier
than planned.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he was pleased upon being informed that the turnover on
the local bourse broke NT$100 billion at around 10:00 a.m. on
Tuesday, one hour after the opening of trading. The daily turnover
surged to NT$219.25 billion by the end of the day's session, the
highest level since July 29.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu said that the total tax revenue for fiscal 1998
totaled NT$532.6 billion as of the end of November, up NT$82.1
billion or 18.2 percent from the corresponding period of the previous
fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that during the five-month period, the tax revenue
collected by the central and local governments has reached 40.2
percent of the government's targeted goal, compared with the ratio of
35.7 percent achieved during the same period of fiscal 1997.</P>
      <P>Hsu attributed the increase in tax revenue for fiscal 1998 to a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) Chairman P.K. Chiang of the Republic of China told the Tokyo
Shimbun that Taiwan hopes to introduce more Japanese technology.</P>
      <P>Chiang was quoted by the Japanese-language newspaper in its
Tuesday edition as saying Taiwan's business conditions remain good
and its economy is expected to grow by 6.7 percent for the whole of
1997.</P>
      <P>Chiang, however, pointed out in an interview with the newspaper
in Taipei that, affected by the recent Southeast Asian financial
crisis and the close of Japan's Yamaichi Securities, the New Taiwan
dollar has dropped by 14 percent.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the economic relations between the two countires,
Chiang said Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan is likely to amount to
US$17 billion this year. He also expressed the desire to introduce
more Japanese technology into Taiwan, according to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>The CEPD chairman was quoted by the newspaper as saying that the
structure of Japan's enterprises will be more stable if the Japanese
government can reduce its intervention in the business sector.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with Chiang's interview, the Tokyo Shimbun also
carried a report on downtown Taipei's Kwanghua Market, a major
computer and parts retail center. It attributed the market's vitality
to Taiwan's progress in industrial development, its large number of
young professionals in the computer industry and the industry's
ability to respond quickly to new situations.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the Taipei-based CEPD on Monday
forecast Taiwan's economic growth for 1998 at 6.7 percent, as the
island's overall financial and economic climate remains positive and
sound.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that the New Taiwan dollar should rebound to the
level of 29.2 against the US unit sometime next year and that the
local currency will not further depreciate so long as the South
Korean won stops its sharp downward spiral. Continued devaluation of
the won could stir up another round of financial crises in East Asia,
the council added.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, Taiwan may see a slight decline in its
export volume next year, although retail prices will remain stable.
It estimated that the 1998 consumer price index will increase by 3.1
percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRUG ABUSE AMONG TAIPEI YOUNGSTERS SERIOUS: COUNCILORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Taipei city councilors strongly
urged the Taipei City government to resolutely crack down on drugs,
saying that Taipei has become the major drug center in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The councilors, Chen Chin-chi, Chen Yung-teh, and Chen
Chin-hsiang, made the appeal at a city council meeting on Monday as
they described the wide variety of available drugs and rampant abuse
of the illegal substances in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The trio listed more than 20 drugs which they said are easily
available at drugstores, in addition to marijuana or ephedrine which
can be obtained from other channels.</P>
      <P>They lambasted the government for not stringently implementing
its pronounced anti-drug campaign, claiming that it has become a mere
slogan.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-chi said an investigation he conducted with his
colleagues has shown that the tranquilizer Valium has become the new
drug of choice among teenagers, following the craze for FM2,
sometimes referred to as the "rape pill."</P>
      <P>Valium is commonly prescribed for relief of anxiety, insomnia and
muscle cramps, but in large doses, it can cause hallucinogenic
effects. As it is cheap and easily available, it has become popular
with the youngsters. One tablet of Valium sells for as little as
NT$10 (30 US cents), while five injectable doses of the drug sell for
NT$170.</P>
      <P>The councilors said instructions on how to manufacture your own
drugs available over the Internet has further exacerbated the
problem.</P>
      <P>According to their investigation conducted in five areas of
Taipei, they found that the prevalence of drug use varies from age
group and consumption ability.</P>
      <P>In Tienmu, drugs such as marijuana and cannibis are most
popular, while in commercial areas surrounding Tunglin Department
Store, all kinds of drugs are being used. In the posh Anho
residential area, marijuana and MDMA are common.</P>
      <P>In the Y-generation hangout of Hsimenting, the cheap Valium, FM2
and amphetamine are popular, while in areas surrounding National
Taiwan Normal University, the DIY drugs are prevalent.</P>
      <P>Chen said that their investigation has shown that drug abuse is
more serious than the government is willing to admit. He demanded
that officials enforce laws more strictly and make it more difficult
to obtain drugs in local pharmacies.</P>
      <P>They suggested that the Taipei City Government designate 1998 as
the "Anti-Drug Year" and make an all-out effort to crack down on
drugs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said the councilors' survey on 1,000 people in
local pubs and karaoke parlors found that 18 percent of the
respondents said they have tried drugs, while 54 percent of the
polled said that their friends or classmates have tried drugs and
that the most common source of the drugs is from their friends.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER GIVES DIRECTIVES ON NATIONAL DEFENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday demanded the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) collect more information and
intelligence about the Asia-Pacific situation and relations across
the Taiwan Strait in the wake of Hong Kong's reversion to Beijing's
rule on July 1 this year.</P>
      <P>Siew gave the directive after a senior MND official briefed him
on the highlights of the 1998 National Defense Report detailing the
Republic of China's national defense policy and general military
situation.</P>
      <P>In the face of delicate changes in the overall global situation
and cross-strait relations, Siew said, the MND should prudently and
properly use its budget to upgrade the military's combat preparedness
and defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>The premier also directed the ministry to devote adequate
manpower and financial resources to research and development of key
technologies for manufacturing major weaponry systems in order to
ensure self-sufficiency in the defense industry.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC and even the entire Asia-Pacific region face
new challenges following Hong Kong's handover, Siew asked the MND to
step up gathering and analysis of information concerning mainland
China's political, economic and military activities for the Cabinet's
reference.</P>
      <P>Siew also urged the MND to continue carrying out its troop
reduction plan aimed at establishing an elite deterrent force. Under
the plan, the military ranks will be streamlined and the total number
of the armed forces will be cut to 400,000 while overall combat
capability will be enhanced with improved training and
professionalism. The plan is scheduled to be completed by 2001.</P>
      <P>In view of the rising domestic crime rate, Siew ordered the MND
to coordinate with the Ministry of the Interior to help train
civilian law-enforcement officers in order to improve their
crime-fighting capabilities.</P>
      <P>The premier further asked the MND to study the provisions
of mainland China's newly enacted defense law as reference for the
Cabinet to legislate Taiwan's own national defense act. The MND has
drafted a national defense organic act, which is now under the
Cabinet's scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew said renovation of dilapidated residential
communities for military dependents is one of the government's major
construction projects. "The redevelopment plan is expected to help
speed up urban renewal and contribute to local prosperity."</P>
      <P>Siew ordered the MND to establish a fair, open and transparent
tender system for private investors to participate in those
residential community reconstruction projects. "I hope the
redevelopment project can be completed in less than nine years," he
added.</P>
      <P>This is the fourth time that the MND has published a National
Defense Report on the country's defense policy and general military
situation. The 1998 report comprises 26 chapters in five categories
-- the country's security environment and military situation;
national defense policy and armed forces; defense resources and
management; major MND work plans; and the military servicemen and
civilian people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTORS IN M'LAND SHOULD FULLY EVALUATE RISKS: CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   9   (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), warned on Monday
afternoon that Taiwan merchants should evaluate the political and
economic risks in economic and trade relations across the Taiwan
Strait before investing in the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when he met with representatives of Taiwan
enterprises Monday at an MAC-sponsored seminar titled "Taiwan
Merchants' Time," during which he explained the government's "no
haste, be patient" policy toward Taiwan businessmen's investment in
the mainland.</P>
      <P>The seminar was attended by representatives of the Taiwan
Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association who plan to
invest in the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang told the Taiwan investors that Beijing's "unreasonable and
impractical" policies toward Taiwan are the biggest obstacles to the
development of improved cross-strait economic and trade relations.</P>
      <P>According to polls conducted by the MAC, only about 25 percent of
the people on the island hold that Taiwan investment in mainland
China should be liberalized, while most people advocate maintaining
the government's current policy or even adopting a more cautious
stance, he said.</P>
      <P>As to "direct shipping," which is currently forbidden in line
with the policy against the "three direct links," about 60 percent
said that this should only be allowed under the prerequisite of
"having dignity and security," while only 10 percent said they favor
an unconditional opening of cross-strait shipping, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investments in mainland China as of September amounted to
21,000 projects with a total value of US$12 billion, according to
statistics of the Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs. The statistics further revealed that Taiwan investment in
the Chinese mainland accounts for 43 percent of Taiwanese total
investment abroad in the last five years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE'S MANUFACTURING GROWTH EASED TO 6.4 PERCENT IN OCT.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's overall manufacturing output
in October eased to 6.4 percent growth from 13.8 percent in
September, according to the Singapore Economic Development Board
(EDB).</P>
      <P>The electronics industry, a central pillar of the Singapore
economy, registered a lower-than-expected output growth of 4.2
percent year-on-year in October, compared to the shining 16.3 percent
expansion in September.</P>
      <P>The petrochemicals industry, however, continued to be the
strongest performer with another month of triple-digit growth in
October, thanks to the ramp-up of new production, the EDB said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The petroleum industry also performed well, with 13.5 percent
growth in the month, while output of machinery and equipment expanded
by 17.7 percent.</P>
      <P>But pharmaceuticals output suffered a double-digit fall for the
second consecutive month while plastic products output slipped 2
percent due to the electronics slowdown.</P>
      <P>"There was lower output of personal computers and
telecommunications equipment due to fewer orders from the United
States and China respectively," EDB said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, production of semiconductors, computer peripherals
and printed circuit board assemblies was higher than a year ago when
the electronics slowdown had started to bite.</P>
      <P>For the first 10 months, Singapore's electronics output was just
1.6 percent higher than in the comparable period last year.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the figures suggested the recovery in Singapore's
electronics sector remained uncertain.</P>
      <P>October's trade figures showed that export growth of disk drives
fell to 4.6 percent from September's 8.8 percent.</P>
      <P>But the analysts pointed out that there was a calendar effect due
to the Indian festival of Deepavali occurring this year in October
instead of in November as it did in 1996.</P>
      <P>The Singapore government had forecast around 7 percent economic
growth this year. In the first 10 months, manufacturing -- which
accounts for about a quarter of Singapore's Gross Domestic Product --
grew by 3.1 percent.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has adopted pragmatic and free trade
policy to facilitate promotion of trade relations with Mongolia, a
high-ranking official said Tuesday at a seminar on trade
opportunities in that country.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lien, chairman of the Mogolian and Tibetan Affairs

mainland China are now not applicable to Mongolia, and that the
government will help Taiwan businessmen do business and make
investment in Mongolia.</P>
      <P>A 22-member economic and trade delegation, led by Mongolian
investment official Jargalsaojam, came to Taipei Saturday to attend
the seminar sponsored by the China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA).</P>
      <P>Jargalsaojam said in the seminar that the Mongolian government is
offering good tax incentives to encourage foreign investment in the
building of infrastructures, mining, refining, manufacturing, and
other sectors.</P>
      <P>Foreign individuals and companies can also sign contracts with
the Mongolian government to acquire the right to use land for 60
years. The contracts may be renewed for another 40 years, he said.</P>
      <P>CETRA Vice Board Chairman Wu Kuang-hsiung said at the seminar
that Taiwan businessmen are encouraged to seriously consider making
investment and doing business in Mongolia, and that the government
will help them in this regard.</P>
      <P>Mongolia is a good place for Taiwan businessmen to make
investment and seek trade opportunities, because it is rich in
natural resources and beautiful scenery, another CETRA official said
at the seminar.

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan airline executive suggested on
Tuesday that the Republic of China and Japan jointly develop
Ishigaki Island near Okinawa into a transit center between Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>TransAsia Airways Chairman Lin Chia-cheng presented the proposal
at the opening session of the 25th East Asian Economic Conference,
which brought together more than 240 ROC and Japanese business and
industry leaders to explore possible bilateral cooperative projects
in various commercial and industrial fields.</P>
      <P>Lin said Ishigaki Island is replete with tourist resources. Due
to a lack of convenient transport networks, the island has not yet
attracted a large number of investors.</P>
      <P>Lin said Japan should cooperate with Taiwan to develop the scenic
island into an air transit center between Taiwan and the mainland.
Taiwan still bans direct transport links with the mainland. All
flight and shipping services across the Taiwan Strait must
be conducted via a third place.</P>
      <P>"The program, if realized, will benefit Japan, Taiwan and the
mainland," Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that a traveler from Taiwan has to fly 1,500
kilometers to reach mainland China's Fuzhou City via Macau. The
traveler needs to fly only 800 kms to reach Fuzhou if he or she
transits through Ishigaki Island. As a major transit center for
mainland-bound Taiwan travelers other than Hong Kong, Macau can
secure at least US$300 million in profits from Taiwan annually.</P>
      <P>The 84-member Japanese delegation to the conference is headed by
Leijiro Hattori, chairman of the Japanese Interchange Association,
which was founded by Japanese authorities to handle relations with
Taiwan in the absence of official ties. Among the delegates are
senior executives of many large Japanese companies and major trade
associations.</P>
      <P>The 164-member ROC delegation is led by C. F. Koo, honory
chairman of the Chinese National Association of Industry and
Commerce.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the three-day meeting include market-opening
measures and major economic trends in the ROC and Japan; the
possible impact on the Asian economy of Hong Kong's reversion to
Beijing's rule; the feasibility of Taiwan and Japan launching joint
investment projects in third countries under the framework of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum; and the recent financial
crises in many Asian countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CERTAIN POWER' AFTER EARLY SEVERANCE OF ROC-RSA TIES: HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A "certain power" exerted pressure on
Pretoria in early November, trying to persuade South Africa to sever
its formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China ahead of
schedule, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu disclosed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The attempt, devised to humiliate Taipei, was aborted after ROC
diplomats in South Africa made timely and concerted efforts to turn
the situation around, Hu said.</P>
      <P>South African President Nelson Mandela announced in November 1996
that Pretoria will switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing at the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Pretoria have held several rounds of working-level
negotiations on future bilateral relations during the past 10 months.
The two sides basically have reached a consensus and an understanding
on the ending of formal ties.</P>
      <P>Hu, however, admitted that the two sides have had major
differences on certain issues during the negotiations.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Pretoria refused to allow the ROC to
continue to be referred to by its official name and for the ROC flag
to be flown in South Africa after Jan. 1, 1998, even though Taipei
had made these requests "based on international practices that
certain principles remain applicable under the circumstances of no
diplomatic ties."</P>
      <P>During the negotiations, Taipei also expressed that it would like
to maintain its consulates general -- located in Johannesburg, Cape
Town and Durban -- after the two countries cease diplomatic ties on
Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>Pretoria eventually agreed to allow the three offices to remain
open under different names, said Hu.</P>
      <P>Regarding the "certain power" that tried to undermine
Taipei-Pretoria ties, Hu disclosed that a minister from the People's
Republic of China headed a large-scale mainland Chinese trade and
business mission to South Africa in early November.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese mission, which flashed a lot of cash by
placing purchasing orders worth about US$450 million and promising a
similar amount in soft loans to South Africa, was reportedly aimed at
getting Pretoria to advance the date of its severance of formal ties
with Taipei by 50 days, he said.</P>
      <P>Hu, meanwhile, noted that Beijing's pressure tactics weren't
entirely successful. "Otherwise, the outcome would be different
today," he said.</P>
      <P>Pretoria has tried its utmost to ward off Beijing's improper
interference, he said.</P>
      <P>He also praised ROC Ambassador to South Africa Loh I-cheng and
his staff for their unselfish and painstaking efforts during the
final negotiations, saying that they did their best.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABDUCTED MARINE POLICE OFFICER TO BE RETURNED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan marine police officer who was
abducted to mainland China by mainland fishermen nearly two months
ago is scheduled to return to Taiwan on Wednesday, the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Chuang Chen-yao will leave (the city of) Fuzhou for Hong Kong
via air tomorrow afternoon and is expected to arrive in Taipei later
that evening," SEF Deputy Secretary General Lee Ching-ping told a
news conference.</P>
      <P>"Legal Service Department Director You Jui-teh left for Fuzhou
this morning to accompany Chuang home," Lee said, adding that You
reached agreement on Monday via phone and fax with He Zhungshen, a
senior official with the Fujian Red Cross Society, on terms for
Chuang's return.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, reached after several rounds of
difficult negotiations, Taiwan will give a sum of money to certain
mainland Chinese fishermen who were allegedly injured by Chuang. Lee
said the fund will be called neither "compensation money" as the
mainland had demanded, nor "consolation money," as Taiwan had
insisted.</P>
      <P>Lee said the undisclosed sum includes payment for medical bills
incurred by the mainland fishermen. "Except for a receipt, the two
sides will not sign any other agreements or documents concerning the
incident," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that firearms stolen from Chuang by the fishermen
will not be returned along with him. The mainland side has promised
to deliver the firearms to authorities on Taiwan-held Matsu Island in
the near future, when it dispatches a boat to the island to take back
detained illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>Chuang was abducted to Fuzhou, in mainland China's southeastern
Fujian province, on Oct. 11 while he was performing a routine search
of a mainland fishing boat caught illegally operating in ROC
territorial waters near Matsu, which lies closer to the mainland than
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said Chen Zidong, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
the Fujian government, has promised to handle cross-strait fishing
disputes more seriously in the future. "Chen, who is currently in
Taiwan to attend a seminar on improving cross-strait shipping
services, also agreed to restrict mainland fishermen from intruding
into waters off the coasts of Taiwan and its offshore islands," Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Chen paid a visit to Lee on Tuesday morning at the SEF
headquarters. The SEF is a semi-official body founded by Taiwan
authorities to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO US POLICY CHANGES TOWARD TAIWAN: DPP HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said on Monday that US officials have made it
clear to him that there have been no changes in US policy toward
Taiwan, as Washington has no intention of pushing Taiwan to hold
negotiations with mainland China, nor has it worked out an addition
to its "three no's policy" in its dealings with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference on Monday night, Hsu said US
officials have explained to him that the US has simply expressed the
hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume talks as
early as possible.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the DPP has been worried that the US might have adjusted
its policy toward Taiwan, ever since the US State Department stressed
the Clinton Administration's "three no's policy" following the
meeting between US President Bill Clinton and mainland China's
President Jiang Zemin in late October.</P>
      <P>The US's "three no's policy" is that it will not support either
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," nor will it back Taiwan
independence or the island's bid to rejoin the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Parris Chang, the DPP's representative stationed in the US, said
the US side also has assured him that there is not a "fourth no
policy" toward Taiwan, countering a rumor which claims that the US
will not help Taiwan with its national defense if the DPP becomes the
ruling party on the island. He noted that the DPP has demanded that
the US provide Taiwan with military support when necessary.</P>
      <P>In response to a question on recent remarks by President Lee
Teng-hui during an interview with the Washington Post that Taiwan is
already an independent, sovereign country, Hsu said Lee's comments
were just a reflection of reality and that "the DPP totally agrees
with Lee in this regard."</P>
      <P>The pro-Taiwan independence party chairman said the DPP's
mainland China policy is forward-thinking, but that it remains
consistent in always calling for improvement in Taiwan's relations
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Many people are concerned about Taiwan's increased economic
exchanges with mainland China, Hsu said, but pointed out that
economic activities simply will not be curbed by political means. He
also repeated his support to the establishment of direct trade,
transport and postal links across the Taiwan Strait, saying that such
links will benefit both sides.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Hsu also met with Richard Bush, chairman of
the Washington-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), to exchange
opinions on issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>The AIT was set up to handle bilateral exchanges with Taiwan
after the two countries cut diplomatic relations in 1979.</P>
      <P>Hsu arrived in Washington on Sunday and is scheduled to continue
on to Los Angeles on Wednesday before flying back to Taiwan on
Saturday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking economics official on Tuesday
said that environmental protection and economic development are of
equal importance and that the government should support those
enterprises that have observed the government's rules on
environmental impact evaluations in their investment projects.</P>
      <P>Economics Vice Minister Yiin Chii-ming was referring to a planned
investment project in central Taiwan's Taichung County by Bayer
Taiwan Co. and a proposed industrial zone in Chiku in Tainan County.
Both projects are facing strong opposition from some local residents.</P>
      <P>Liao Yung-lai, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
magistrate-elect for Taichung County, has insisted that a referendum
will be held in his county to decide the fate of the Bayer project,
while scuffles broke out Monday between police and some of the
hundreds of Chiku residents who gathered to protest a visit to the
site of the industrial zone by economics officials.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that the first stage of Bayer's investment project has
passed the government's environmental impact evaluation, while the
industrial zone's possible effect on the local environment is still
being studied.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that the proposed Ping Nan Industrial Zone, which would
be a base mainly for petrochemical and steel firms, is the largest
industrial zone development project in Taiwan and has a total
investment value reaching NT$337.7 billion (US$10.6 billion).</P>
      <P>The industrial zone was jointly proposed by the Yiehlung Group
and Tuntex Group some three years ago, but the application for an
environmental impact evaluation was rejected in May 1995 on the
grounds that it failed to meet the required procedures. The
application was resubmitted in June this year.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs will work to help local
residents and environmentalists understand the government's
regulations regarding environmental impact evaluations, he said,
adding that if people have questions about the regulations, the
ministry and the cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration are willing to discuss the issue further.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIDC SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES MD-95 TAIL SECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first completed tail section of the
MD-95 twin-engine 100-seater passenger aircraft, which is designed,
built and assembled by Taiwan's Aerospace Industrial Development
Corporation (AIDC), was unveiled in Taichung on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Introducing the new creation to the public, Economics Minister
Wang Chih-kang said the project, which grew from a cooperation
agreement between the AIDC and the US aircraft maker Boeing, shows
that Taiwan's aerospace industry has proved its qualifications and
ability to build commercial passenger aircraft.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that his ministry has targeted the
development of the precision industry sector on the island as a
priority, revealing that ministry experts have estimated that the
sector could create an annual production value of over NT$300 billion
(some US$9.49 billion). The aerospace industry is the key player in
this sector.</P>
      <P>The AIDC, originating from the military-run Aero-Industry
Development Center which built Taiwan's locally-designed Indigenous
Defense Fighter (IDF), is currently under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, but is scheduled to become fully
privatized within the next three years.</P>
      <P>In Feb. 28, 1996, the state-run corporation won the contract for
designing, manufacturing and assembling the MD-95 tail section, which
was developed in 1995 by McDonnell Douglas, another American airplane
manufacturer incorporated by Boeing in July.</P>
      <P>Boeing estimates that there will be a market demand for 610-1,200
MD-95s in the future.</P>
      <P>The AIDC-built tail section will be transported to a McDonnell
Douglas plant in the United States on Jan. 13, where final assembly
of the aircraft will take place. The AIDC has been contracted to
manufacture a total of 50 of the MD-95 tail units.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEPRECIATING KOREAN WON DEEPENS ROC DEFICIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The depreciating Korean won, which fell
further against the US dollar on Tuesday, reaching a low of 1,400 won
to the greenback, is widening Taiwan and South Korea's trade gap in
favor of Seoul, according to officials from the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Should the won continue to fall, the difference in value between
the New Taiwan dollar and the Korean currency will continue to widen,
resulting in a greater trade imbalance between the two countries,
CEPD officials noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$2.21 billion-worth of commodities to South
Korea in the first 11 months of this year, down 9.2 percent from the
year-earlier level, while importing US$4.59 billion-worth of goods
from South Korea, up 20.8 percent from the same period of the
previous year.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan incurred a deficit of US$2.38 billion with
South Korea during the 11-month period, marking a four-year deficit
high and an increase of 73.7 percent over the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>However, the officials were quick to point out that the deficit,
even if it continues to rise, will not be a major headache for
Taiwan, since South Korea has never been a significant trading
partner of this country.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and South Korea, which has averaged
around US$6-7 billion per year for the last few years, accounts for
only about 3 percent of Taiwan's entire foreign trade, which totals
about US$220 billion annually.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY COMMENT ON REPORTS OF BEIJING'S MIL. DISMANTLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of National
Defense said on Tuesday that he has no knowledge of reported Beijing
plans to dismantle all of its major military regions apart from the
Nanjing "War Region."</P>
      <P>Local media recently reported that Beijing has decided to cut its
People's Liberation Army (PLA) by 500,000 and to dismantle its major
military regions after 1998 with the exception of the Nanjing War
Region, which will be placed under the direct jurisdiction of the
Communist Party of China's Central Military Commission (CMC).</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Kung Fan-ting said the reported
500,000-man downsizing plan is actually part of a PLA program which
has been underway since 1995.</P>
      <P>Kung said that following the collapse of the former Soviet Union,
Beijing has reached agreement with members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) on long-standing border disputes, freeing
itself of the military threat from the north.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Beijing is now able to shift its
military emphasis from the northern to its southeastern coastal area,
as was evidenced by a CMC move in 1993 to designate the area as a
"potential military flashpoint."</P>
      <P>During last year's missile crisis in the Taiwan Strait, which saw
Beijing launch test missiles into waters near Taiwan to intimidate
the ROC people in the run-up to the island's first direct
presidential election, the CMC went even farther, upgrading the
Nanjing Military Region to the "Nanjing War Region," with Taiwan as
its hypothetical enemy, Kung noted.</P>
      <P>Kung pointed out that in addition to increasing its purchases of
advanced military weapons and equipment from foreign countries,
Beijing has aggressively developed the so-called four major battle
skills -- landing, parachuting, urban warfare and mountain warfare --
and has established a rapid response force.</P>
      <P>This military buildup, along with remarks by mainland China's
President Jiang Zemin during his recent meeting with US President
Bill Clinton that Beijing will not renounce its use of force against
Taiwan, fully demonstrates that the mainland has not reduced its
hostility towards Taiwan, Kung said.</P>
      <P>He said that in the face of the military threat from Beijing, the
ROC armed forces, in addition to continuing to monitor the PLA's
deployment, have adopted necessary measures, including modernizing
its navy and air force, to maintain its ability to deter Beijing's
adventurism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL BAIL-OUT FOR SOUTH KOREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US$55 billion rescue package for South
Korea is easily the largest in the International Monetary Fund's
50-year history, according to reports from the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It exceeds the famous bail-outs for Mexico in the 1990s, several
Latin American countries in the 1980s and the UK in the 1970s. It
also comes at a time when the fund has arranged bail-outs worth US$37
billion for Indonesia and US$17 billion for Thailand, the WTO report
pointed out.</P>
      <P>It is not just the financial scale of the response that is so
striking, but its geographical breadth. For the first time since the
Asian crisis broke this summer, European governments are to
contribute a small but symbolic amount to the package. They, along
with the US, Japan, Canada and Australia, are to provide a "second
line of defense," ready if needed, to supplement the main IMF loan of
US$21 billion, World Bank funds of US$10 billion and an Asian
Development Bank advance of US$4 billion.</P>
      <P>Officials of the IMF and the US were anxious to play down
expectations that the signing of the Korean agreement marks a turning
point in the Asian financial crisis. But they are clearly hoping that
such an unprecedented show of strength will surely stop the rot and
begin the process of recovery.</P>
      <P>"It was our judgment, with increasing force over the last two
weeks, that it was important the Korean authorities move quickly,"
the WTO report quoted a senior US Treasury official as saying.</P>
      <P>The US and the IMF certainly need this Korean mega-deal to be a
success because it is the most serious test yet of the strategy for
dealing with the financial crisis that continues to rage over much of
Asia. For although criticism so far of the US and the IMF has been
muted, there are signs of growing discontent in Washington and
elsewhere with the strategy they have pursued.</P>
      <P>The defenders of the strategy argue that it is the right one for
dealing with the modern world economy -- an era of globalized capital
markets, rapid technological change that enables billions of dollars
to be transferred between countries at a moment's notice, and
economic interdependency that makes even the once mighty US economy
vulnerable to shocks from emerging markets.</P>
      <P>The Asia crisis represents "the first 21st century financial
crisis in terms of the speed at which it has been propagated"
throughout the world, the WTO report quoted a senior US official as
saying. "It is to be hoped that the changes we are introducing will
help to produce a 21st century economy."</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economists in Singapore have forecast an
average 5.4 percent growth for Singapore's economy next year.</P>
      <P>The latest forecast remains well within the official 5 to 7
percent range, which the Singapore government has said it now plans
to review.</P>
      <P>Most of the 13 economists polled by The Straits Times newspaper
on Monday said they will not revise their forecasts yet, despite the
government plans for a review in light of the South Korean financial
crisis, saying that their forecast already takes that crisis, as well
as the other factors affecting growth, into account.</P>
      <P>However, the forecast of 5.4 percent is lower than the 5.9
percent indicated by an earlier poll in mid-November, which was
itself lower than the 7 percent forecast in October.</P>
      <P>The forecast for this year's growth remains unchanged at 7.1

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY BRIEFS CANADIAN CONGRESSMEN ON BILATERAL TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fang Chin-yen, the Republic of China's
representative to Canada, hosted a dinner on Monday night in honor of
members of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, and
briefed them on the prospects for bilateral ties, as well as on
Taiwan's current situation and its ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The 63-member group, which has recently reorganized and elected
Ontario Congressman Paul Szabo as its president, is the largest
bilateral group in the Canadian Congress formed to improve relations
with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>ROC Legislator Lee Yeou-chi, president of its counterpart group
in Taipei, sent his congratulations to Szabo on his election.</P>
      <P>At the dinner party, Fang described the ties between Taipei and
Beijing as being paradoxically "close and distant" -- close, because
both parties are eager to talk with the other, distant because they
are far apart in their views of the so-called "one China" which they
both claim to pursue.</P>
      <P>Although there is only "one China," the de-facto ROC ambassador
told his audience, it is an indisputable fact that China has been a
divided country since 1949, with two separate governments on
different sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Beijing claims that it represents the whole of China and that
Taiwan is part of it, said Fang, asking: "How can cross-strait
dialogue be conducted if we are already part of China?"</P>
      <P>Demanding that Taiwan negotiate from a position of servility
rather than on an equal footing with mainland China is no less than
demanding "our dissolution or disappearance," said Fang, stressing
that any negotiations should take place from a position of parity.</P>
      <P>Noting that Canadian congressmen are reluctant to support
publicly the idea of "a divided China ruled by two separate
governments" because of Ottawa's policy of recognizing Beijing as the
sole legitimate government of China, Fang prodded his audience to
promote pragmatic ties with Taiwan in parallel with Canada's official
relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>After emerging from the shadow cast by the controversial
detention of seven Taiwan crewmen from the cargo ship "Maersk Dubai"
on charges of throwing two Romanian stowaways overboard, Fang said
Taipei and Ottawa should focus their efforts on bilateral economic
and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The seven crewmen were extradited to Taiwan on March 21 to stand
trial here.</P>

      <P>Taiwan ranks third among 97 developing
nations surveyed by Britain's Economist magazine in terms of
investment risk, ROC economic officials said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In its third quarter report on investment risk, the Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU) listed Singapore as the least risky place for
investors, followed by Spain and Taiwan, respectively, said Lin
Neng-jong, director for investment affairs under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Among the major Asian countries and areas, Hong Kong came in 7th
place, South Korea in eighth, Malaysia in 14th, Thailand in 20th,
mainland China in 31st, the Philippines in 33rd, Indonesia in 42nd

      <P>The report rates investment risk in developing countries using
the criteria of political risk, economic policy risk, economic
structure and the liquidation risk, said Lin.</P>
      <P>The economic policy risk category takes into account each
country's monetary policy, financial policy, policy on foreign
exchange rates, trade policy and legal policy.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Taiwan, which has remained relatively unaffected by
the current Asian financial crisis, is a hot-spot of foreign
investment, with many foreign firms exploring the possibility of
venturing into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the first ten months of this year, Taiwan registered 549
foreign investment projects with a total investment value of US$3.48
billion, 83.22 percent more than that of same period of last year,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A seminar on the exchange of broadcasts
across the Taiwan Strait entered its second day Tuesday in Taipei,
with representatives from both Taiwan and mainland China seeking to
increase such exchanges and cooperation in the field of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Participants from both sides agreed that the influence and
potential of broadcasting have always been underestimated, but they
said the field's prospects are still bright.</P>
      <P>The broadcasting trends of the future will be narrowing the focus
of individual programs in order to zero in on specific demographic
and geographic groups and building strategic alliances with
multimedia firms so as to get the upper hand in the face of stiff
competition, they said.</P>
      <P>Guo Baoxin, deputy director and secretary general of mainland
China's TV and Broadcasting Association, remarked that radio stations
in the mainland have already focused their programming more, which he
said has led the number of stations there specialized in certain
fields -- such as music, news or information related to
transportation -- to mushroom in recent years.</P>
      <P>Introducing new technology to systems is also important to
broadcast media's future, he said. "A star in the sky, a network on

    <HEADLINE>CANADA URGED TO IMPROVE IMMIGRATION SERVICES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's immigration services in Taiwan,
Hong Kong and mainland China will be discussed between MP Sophia
Leung and Lucienne Robillard, minister of citizenship and
immigration, when they meet Wednesday in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>The backlog and consequent waiting period for many applicants for
Canadian visas will likely be one of the issues discussed between the
first Chinese-Canadian woman MP and the woman minister, Leung's aides
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Leung is a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on
Citizenship and Immigration. She has long shown a special concern
over the high rate of refusal for students and sponsored applicants
from mainland China as well as the long waiting period for Business
Investment Program applicants from Taiwan. Some applicants have
complained they had to wait two years before receiving a decision.</P>
      <P>Meeting Robillard on these issues is "part of her on-going work
to improve (Canada's) immigration services," the aides said. At the
meeting, Leung will be joined by two leaders of the United Chinese
Community Enrichment Services Society of Vancouver, who will relate
to the minister examples of frustration felt by many of the group's
members.</P>
      <P>Leung is also expected to raise the issue of why the Canadian
government has not set up an immigration office in Taiwan. Taiwan
applicants currently have to fly to other countries for interviews,
an unnecessary hardship that also delays the processing of the
applications, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>If Robillard cites budget constraints, Leung said she will argue
that revenues from processing tourist and student visas in Taiwan are
more than enough to maintain an immigration office there.</P>
      <P>Other Canadian MPs have called for a 14-day visa-free treatment
for Taiwan visitors to Canada, whose citizens already enjoy that
privilege on trips to Taiwan. Taipei lawmakers have repeatedly asked
their Ottawa counterparts to urge the Canadian government to
reciprocate.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan were the top, third
and fourth-largest sources of immigrants in Canada. As many as 29,954
Hong Kong people, 17,530 mainland Chinese and 13,205 Taiwanese
emigrated to Canada last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUZHOU INDUSTRIAL PARK PROBLEM WILL BE RESOLVED: LEE KUAN YEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
has expressed confidence that the difficulties facing the Suzhou
Industrial Park (SIP) will be resolved, saying mainland China's
central government does not give promises lightly and will make good
on what it pledges, The Straits Times reported Wednesday in a
dispatch from Guangzhou.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin had said that
he would instruct mainland Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing to work
with Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to resolve the
issue, he was quoted as saying, "I believe the problem will be
resolved."</P>
      <P>Jiang, he added, had told him during talks on Monday in Beijing
that the Suzhou problem was one that could be solved.</P>
      <P>In addition, Jiangsu Governor Zheng Silin had assured him that
the views and policies of the central government must prevail over
those of the provinces. "China is a big country. If the center does
not prevail, how can it govern?" the governor was quoted as telling
the senior minister. Lee added that once mainland China's central
government focused its attention on a problem, it would work on it.</P>
      <P>Lee was answering questions from Singapore reporters on Monday in
Beijing after a dinner hosted by mainland Chinese Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji, the report said. Earlier in the day, Lee had held talks with
both Jiang and Zhu.</P>
      <P>Lee's comments came four days after he had expressed
dissatisfaction with the progress of the SIP, a Singapore joint
venture with the mainland Chinese government to build a
70-square-kilometer modern township in the strategic city on the
Yangtze River.</P>
      <P>The Suzhou municipal government was said to be less than
wholehearted in supporting the project, preferring to give priority
to its own industrial park in the Suzhou New District, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Lee noted on Monday that Jiang had reaffirmed his commitment to
the SIP when he met Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in May
this year. "He meant he wanted the SIP to succeed, not any other park
in Suzhou, and not even any other Singapore project in China. And he
meant it sincerely," Lee was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>He stressed that it was not only the credibility of the Singapore
government that was at stake but also that of the mainland Chinese
government in endorsing the SIP "at a very high level" in 1994. The
SIP's top policy-making body is the Joint Steering Committee
co-chaired by Li Lanqing and Lee Hsien Loong.</P>
      <P>Noting several incidents that showed the Suzhou municipal
government giving more backing to its own Suzhou New District than to
the Beijing-backed SIP, Lee Kuan Yew was quoted as saying, "You are
challenging the credibility and worth not just of the joint effort,
but of the whole government."</P>
      <P>These incidents included a Suzhou vice-mayor telling some German
investors last month that they should put their investments in the
New District and not the SIP, the report said.</P>
      <P>Asked how what he called the "tug-of-war for investments" could
be resolved, Lee was quoted as replying: "There must only be one
team. Either we freeze the SIP and let the New District go, or we
freeze the New District and let the SIP go.</P>
      <P>"Why be divided? We are only wasting time and resources. Even if
we don't lose as a result of the competition, which is unlikely,
it'll be only half as good."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEGOTIATIONS OVER TAIWAN HIGH SPEED RAILWAY COMPLETED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ground-breaking ceremony for Taiwan's
first high-speed railway will be held at Linkou, Taipei County on
Dec. 30, the Taiwan High Speed Railway Consortium (THSRC) announced
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The consortium made the announcement shortly after it completed
negotiations with the Bureau of the High-Speed Railway under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The two parties put the final touches on two agreements -- one on
the construction and operation of the high-speed railway and the
other on the development of railway stations -- on Wednesday,
following many rounds of difficult negotiations.</P>
      <P>According to the terms of the agreements, the consortium must
complete construction of the 345-km Taipei-Kaohsiung high-speed
railway by mid-2003. The contractor will be entitled to operate the
railway for the first 35 years and to manage the railway stations
along its length for the first 50 years.</P>
      <P>The new railway is the first domestic public construction project
to be open to private investors under the build-operate-transfer
(BOT) formula, in which private contractors build the system and
operate it for a specified period of time before transferring control
to the government.</P>
      <P>The MOTC and the THRSC are scheduled to formally sign the two
accords early next year.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said that although the two agreements are
separate, they are still connected to some extent, since if the
consortium is deprived of construction/operation rights for the
railway, its rights to manage the stations will also be invalidated.</P>
      <P>The provisions also stipulate that if the MOTC delays in making
land available to the consortium for construction of the railway, the
contractor will not be allowed to apply for compensation, but will be
able to apply for an extension of the 35-year operating period.</P>
      <P>The agreements further say that the MOTC will reserve the right
to develop three additional stations at Miaoli, Changhua and Yunlin
for the time being, and that the two parties may negotiate this issue
at a later date.</P>
      <P>The THSRC, comprised of five Taiwan companies and two European
firms -- GEC Alsthom S.A. and Siemens Aktiengeselschaft -- beat out
the Chunghwa High-Speed Railway Consortium -- a Taiwan-Japanese joint
venture -- to win the right to build the high-speed railway, which
carries a price tag of about NT$441.9 billion (US$13.9 billion).</P>
      <P>The Bureau of the High-Speed Railway said the MOTC will not
refund the Chunghwa High-Speed Railway Consortium its NT$400 million
tender deposit until it formally signs the BOT agreements with the
THSRC early next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO SIGN OF `BIRD FLU' IN SINGAPORE, SAYS HEALTH MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Bird flu," which has killed two people
in Hong Kong so far this year, has not been detected in either people
or poultry in Singapore, the Singapore Health Ministry said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Preliminary reports suggest that infection from the latest
influenza strain H5N1 -- popularly known as bird flu -- is localized
to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Although the ministry has alerted doctors to be on the lookout
for the new strain, Singaporeans need not worry about catching it,
the ministry said. Travelers to Hong Kong also have little cause for
alarm, it added, as it has not been medically proven that this form
of flu can be transmitted.</P>
      <P>There are only two types of flu virus that affect people -- type
A and type B. H5N1 falls into the first group, but has previously
been found only in birds.</P>
      <P>In domestic poultry, it can lead to a lethal fowl plague, which
decimates flocks, but last week in Hong Kong, a 54-year-old man died
from the flu, and a 13-year-old girl is still in hospital.</P>
      <P>H5N1 is also known as Hong Kong 1997, to differentiate it from a
previous strain called Hong Kong flu.</P>
      <P>It first appeared in Hong Kong in May this year, when it caused
the death of a three-year-old boy. A two-year-old boy was also
infected at that time, but survived.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FOREIGN INVESTMENTS HIT HISTORIC HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has attracted around US$3.48
billion-worth of foreign investment during the ten-month period from
January to October, the highest record since 1952, when the
government began allowing foreign investment, the Industrial
Development and Investment Center under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Neng-jong, chief of the center, revealed that the amount
represents significant growth of 83 percent over the same period of
last year, attributing this growth to Taiwan's success in avoiding
damage from the recent Asian financial storm.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Taiwan has demonstrated its sound economic
fundamentals in the wake of the crisis which has severely damaged the
economic development of most Asian countries, including South Korea,
Taiwan's key opponent in foreign trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's continued sound economic health not only helps the
island attract foreign funds, it also benefits Taiwan's efforts to
develop the island into a high-tech manufacturing center and an
operations hub in the Asia-Pacific area, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to a MOEA survey on the impact of the financial turmoil
on Taiwan businesses, most Taiwan investors in the housing, stock and
entertainment sectors in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia have become
victims of the storm, leading to the closure of a number of
enterprises in the region.</P>
      <P>However, the survey indicates that most Taiwan investors in the
nations of Southeast Asia are engaged in the processing and exporting
businesses, which have been less affected by the turmoil, while some
of them have even profited from income paid in US dollars or other
foreign currencies which have not depreciated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US NEWSPAPER REPORTS GIO CHIEF TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of Taiwan independence had
little bearing on the island's Nov. 29 mayoral and county chief
elections, David Tawei Lee, chief of the ROC Government Information
Office, said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks came during a meeting at the offices of The
Washington Times, the US mass-circulation daily, in which he briefed
key newspaper staff on the current economic and political situation
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Topics of Monday's 90-minute discussion, which appeared in
Tuesday's edition of the paper, included relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, the results of Taiwan's Nov. 29 city
mayor and county chief elections, mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's US visit and the Asian financial storm.</P>
      <P>According to the article, Lee, who is currently visiting
Washington, acknowledged the ROC's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) suffered a
big defeat in last month's elections, in which the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), the island's major opposition party, won 12
of the total 23 constituencies, while the KMT took only eight
constituencies and independents gained three.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said he believes the real test of his party's hold
on power will be next year's vote for national legislators, noting
that if the KMT fails to win a majority in the Legislative Yuan, the
ROC's highest legislative body, it may loss its ruling status.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the result of the upcoming vote will also have
an impact on Taipei's diplomatic relations and cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Questioned as to whether the Taiwan independence movement is more
and more supported by people on Taiwan, the GIO chief said that
although residents say the island's interests should come first, this
doesn't mean they prefer independence to reunification with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>He cited the results of a recent islandwide poll as indicating 85
percent of the population of Taiwan want to see the island's status
quo maintained and that only 10 percent said they support Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Calling the DPP platform's advocacy of Taiwan independence an
obvious violation of the will of the people of Taiwan, Lee said the
KMT will take its rival to task over this in the 1998 legislative
election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, referring to Taipei-Beijing relations, Lee stressed
during the Washington meeting that Taipei always keeps its door open
to negotiations.</P>
      <P>Touching on an assessment that said next spring would be the best
time for the resumption of cross-strait talks, the ROC official
pointed out that differences on the topics of the talks still exist,
noting that his government hopes to talk about practical matters,
including anti-crime issues, while Beijing wishes more for
discussions on political issues, such as the definition "one China."</P>
      <P>Cross-strait negotiations have been suspended since the summer of
1995, when Beijing unilaterally called them off to protest ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in June 1995.</P>
      <P>In reply to questions as to whether Jiang's US visit has had a
negative impact on the ROC-US ties, Lee told the press elite that
Washington had Taipei completely briefed on the entire visit and that
the US government issued assurances that it will never deviate from
its existing Taiwan policies.</P>
      <P>On the financial storm that has hit Asian economies, Lee said
Taiwan has suffered less than others in the region because it enjoys
sound and healthy economic fundaments. The island also has the
highest economic growth among the "four tigers" in Asia, he noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, with Taiwan's dependence on foreign trade
for economic development, the island must keep making efforts in the
promotion of worldwide economic and financial liberalization to allow
fair trade competition.</P>

Chao-shiuan said Wednesday the promotion of educational reforms will
be the focus of his future work.</P>
      <P>Liu also said he will coordinate with government agencies to try
to solicit more budgeting for the educational, scientific and
cultural fields.</P>
      <P>Liu's appointment was approved unanimously in a regular meeting
of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee earlier on Wednesday. He
formally took over the job from John Chang, who was appointed as KMT
secretary-general earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Liu, 55, received a bachelor of science degree at National Taiwan
University and received a doctorate from the University of Toronto.
He has served as the minister of the transportation and
communications, president of the National Tsing Hua University, and
chairman of the National Science Council.</P>
      <P>Liu was reportedly handpicked by Premier Vincent Siew because of
his young and fresh image, which gave him an edge over several
candidates, including Minister Without Portfolio Lin Feng-chen.</P>
      <P>Siew was also impressed with Liu's performance when he headed the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and the National
Science Council.</P>
      <P>His strong science background and good connections in the
educational and cultural fields are also considered a plus. Liu is
close to Yuan T. Lee, president of Academia Sinica, the nation's most
prestigious research institute, while his brother Liu Chao-han is
president of National Central University.</P>
      <P>Liu has said that the pursuit of scientific and technological
development is crucial to the nation, and that educational reforms
will be vital to fostering more talent in those fields.</P>
      <P>The blueprint for turning Taiwan into a regional scientific
center which he helped design when he served as the NSC chairman will

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh said on Wednesday that if Taiwan and mainland China
resume cross-strait negotiations, these talks should first address
technical and functional issues such as the frequent fishery disputes
which occur between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Reporting to a Central Standing Committee meeting of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) on the current situation across the Taiwan Strait
and the means of facing new challenges in bilateral ties, Chang said
Taiwan and the mainland could begin preparations for political
negotiations, but predicted that the mainland will not reduce its
attempts to isolate Taiwan in the international community, despite
the easing of tension between the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that Taiwan and mainland China still
stand a good chance of reaching consensus on the political front if
the mainland can recognize Taiwan as a separate political entity.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ROC government will stick to the policy set
out in the Guidelines for National Unification and step up
cross-strait exchanges, as well as forge a national consensus and
devising a mechanism for negotiations as part of its efforts to
promote ties with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the case of Chuang Chen-yao, a Taiwan marine police
officer who was abducted two months ago by mainland fishermen
operating illegally in ROC territorial waters, Chang expressed the
hope that such cases will not happen again and repeated the ROC
government's determination to safeguard Taiwan fishermen's rights and
national security within ROC territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Chuang had just been released by mainland authorities and was
scheduled to return to Taipei via Hong Kong from the port city of
Fuzhou in mainland China's Fujian province later in the day.</P>
      <P>The mainland side released Chuang after the two sides finally
agreed that the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation would pay
140,000 renminbi (about US$17,000) in "consolation and assistance
money" to the mainland fishermen involved, who were allegedly injured
during the incident. The two sides also signed a "handover
certificate" as part of the deal.</P>
      <P>Chang emphasized that the government's handling of the incident
is not a "precedent," but simply a "one-off" case.</P>
      <P>Chuang was attacked and abducted by mainland fishermen on Oct. 11
near Hsichu island, part of the ROC-governed Matsu island group,
while searching their fishing vessel which had been detained for
illegal entry into ROC waters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA CONFIRMS NEW CASES OF FMD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) confirmed
on Wednesday that new cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have been
detected at three local pig ranches, casting an even darker shadow
over Taiwan's already battered hog industry.</P>
      <P>COA officials said 30 pigs at a ranch in Chupei in the northern
county of Hsinchu, 49 pigs at a farm in Taichung City, and about
60 pigs at a Kaohsiung ranch in southern Taiwan, had contracted the
deadly disease, and that all of them have been slaughtered.</P>
      <P>"Local health officials have also stepped up sterilization
procedures at the three ranches and the surrounding regions," the
officials said, adding that the disease is not expected to develop
into another epidemic because most local pigs have now been
inoculated.</P>
      <P>The officials said the FMD recurrence might be attributable to
the failure of the pig farmers to conduct regular inoculations of
their stock, due to a continuing drop in pork prices.</P>
      <P>An FMD epidemic, the island's first in many decades, broke out in
Taiwan in mid-March this year. Agricultural officials said that
although the epidemic was brought under control by mid-May, sporadic
cases are very likely to occur again in the first year following such
a large-scale outbreak, pointing out that Taiwan will not be classed
as FMD-free for another three or four years.</P>
      <P>The virus found this week at the Chupei, Taichung and
Kaohsiung hog ranches is same "O1" type that caused the epidemic in
March, the officials added.</P>
      <P>As the virus thrives in low temperatures, the officials said,
local pig farmers should maintain a high alert during the winter
season to protect their hogs from contracting the disease again.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, more than 21 million shots of FMD
vaccine have been administered here since March, and the island
currently has only about 8.5 million pigs. Each shot is effective for
about six months, but beyond that period, the possibility of the pig
contracting the disease will increase again.</P>
      <P>COA officials said they will intensify spot checks at pig farms
around the island to ensure that farmers are having their pigs
inoculated every six months.</P>
      <P>The officials said the supply of FMD vaccine is not a problem at
the moment, as local health authorities currently have a stock of one
million doses and private companies have also imported some three
million doses.</P>
      <P>Chen Wu-hsiung, director of the Department of Agriculture and
Forestry under the Taiwan Provincial Government, said hog farmers who
have failed to have their pigs inoculated regularly will be fined
from NT$10,000 to NT$50,000 and will not be compensated if their pigs
die of the disease.</P>
      <P>Chen said it remains uncertain whether the most recent FMD cases
will discourage Japan from resuming imports of cooked pork products
from Taiwan. In fact, Japan now imports cooked meat products from
such FMD-stricken areas as mainland China and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Japan originally agreed to resume imports of cooked meat products
from Taiwan starting next year if Taiwan could meet Japan's
quarantine and sterilization standards.</P>
      <P>Up until March, when it imposed an across-the-board ban on Taiwan
pork products, Japan was Taiwan's largest market for pork exports,
accounting for more than 90 percent of the island's total outbound
shipments.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Singapore nationals and a local man
have been arrested on charges of trading in contraband drugs,
law-enforcement authorities said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Investigators also confiscated more than two kilograms of
high-grade heroin packed in 20 bricks as well as a large sum of drug
money.</P>
      <P>Agents with the Ministry of Justice Bureau of Investigation said
the three Singaporeans of Chinese origin had used sailors serving on
commercial vessels to smuggle drugs into Taiwan for distribution on
the local market.</P>
      <P>The trio, identified as Ho Chin Hoon, Ong See Seng and Lim Chwee
Gim, allegedly have collaborated with drug trafficking rings in
Thailand and Hong Kong in smuggling heroin into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Investigators said they had closely monitored the trio's
activities since they arrived in Taipei on Dec. 5 and checked into a
YMCA hostel in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday evening, the trio met with Chang Chin-tang, a local
drug dealer, at the coffee shop of the Hilton Hotel near Taipei
Railway Station.</P>
      <P>Chang gave NT$2.55 million (US$80,189) to the Singaporeans who
then gave him a key, which would enable Chang to obtain the drugs.</P>
      <P>Investigators arrested Chang as he was opening a storage box in
the basement of Shinkong Mitsukoshi Department Store near Hilton
Hotel to retrieve drugs.</P>
      <P>Later that evening, law-enforcement officers also arrested the

    <HEADLINE>IF ONLY MAINLAND CHINA WERE FREE: ROC AMBASSADOR TO HOLY SEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Ambassador to the Holy See Raymond
Tai expressed his wish for a free mainland China in an article
carried in a US-based newspaper, saying that "if only China were
free, there wouldn't be the conflicts and problems besetting
Beijing-Taipei relations and Beijing-Vatican relations now."</P>
      <P>Tai also reiterated in the article published in the Nov. 2
edition of The Washington Times that the "one country, two systems"
scheme designed by the mainland China for the reunification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait is totally unacceptable to the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Tai said in the article that "at present, the Vatican is the only
sovereign state in Europe which recognizes our government. This gives
us hope that God is on our side and that freedom will eventually
prevail on the Chinese mainland."</P>
      <P>He noted that the lack of freedom on the Chinese mainland is not
the only stumbling block to a unified China. "Different political
systems and ideologies have separated the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait for almost half a century. Currently, while Beijing still
espouses the Marxist-Leninist doctrine and one party rule -- monopoly
of political power by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), a
pluralistic society with a multiparty democracy and a market economy
has been thriving in Taiwan." Tai wrote.</P>
      <P>In addressing the "Taiwan issue," he continued, Beijing adheres
to the principle of "one China" and touts "one country, two systems"
as the formula for China's unification. It claims that the People's
Republic of China (PRC) is the "sole and legitimate" representative
of the Chinese nation and that the ROC is nothing but a local
government of Taiwan under the PRC's jurisdiction, the ambassador
said.</P>
      <P>Of course, this is totally unacceptable to Taipei, Tai wrote,
adding that the ROC's mission is to see the restoration of freedom
and democracy to the Chinese people on the mainland.</P>
      <P>While Taipei also endorses the principle of "one China" and
likewise seeks China's eventual reunification, it insists that a
unified China be democratic and free. "In the meantime," he
continued, "my government opposes the Hong Kong model, i.e., 'one
country, two systems' and counters with the 'one country, two
political entities (governments)' formula, which provides a framework
of modus vivendi before reunification of China materializes."</P>
      <P>Tai said: "Dr. Lee Teng-hui, ROC's president and the first
popularly elected president in Chinese history, is a devout Christian
and a firm believer in religious freedom and human rights. President
Lee has made repeated proposals to the Beijing leadership that the
two governments on either side of the Taiwan Strait should treat each
other as equals and begin a dialogue to explore the process of
peaceful reunification.</P>
      <P>"The main responsibility of a diplomat, in my view, is to make
peace. Thus convinced, I sincerely urge the new leadership in Beijing
to open up completely and allowed the Chinese people to enjoy a
political life akin to that of the Western democracies.</P>
      <P>"As the world approaches the 21st century, it is imperative that
both mainland China and Taiwan continue to develop in a peaceful
environment. My earnest prayer, is that 'peace and solidarity' be
with the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as mankind
embarks on the third millennium."</P>

    <HEADLINE>EUROPEAN CAR MAKERS FEAR ASIAN IMPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Competition in Europe's car market, the
world's second biggest after the United States, is set to intensify
if embattled Asian manufacturers redirect output originally destined
for domestic buyers to Europe, according to reports of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Louis Schweitzer, president of the European Automobile
Manufacturers' Association and chairman of Renault, warned that the
recent economic turmoil in Asia could hit European manufacturers in
their home market, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Schweitzer was quoted as saying that it was too early to tell if
Asian cars would flood into Europe. He warned that any surge in
exports from South Korea, Malaysia or Japan, where demand has
collapsed after recent economic upheavals, would exacerbate Europe's
chronic overcapacity by swamping the market and distorting prices.</P>
      <P>Asian car production will become more sensitive, especially in
France, after the expected announcement by Toyota, Japan's biggest
carmaker, that it will build a new factory in the northern city of
Valenciennes.</P>
      <P>However, Schweitzer stepped back from demanding import
restrictions on Asian cars. "I don't think restriction is an answer.
But it may be a necessary means to obtain an opening on the other
side."</P>
      <P>Such measures might be required for Korea, where sales of foreign
cars remain minimal in spite of Seoul's pledges to liberalize trade.
While Korea exported almost 250,000 cars to Europe last year, the
flow was less than 5,000 units in the other direction.</P>
      <P>Europe's car makers will be debating soon whether to extend the
gentleman's agreement limiting car exports from Japan to Europe,
which expires in 1999. Japanese manufacturers had done better out of
the 1991 deal between the European Commission and Tokyo than
expected, because the European market had not grown as forecast,
allowing Japanese exporters room to expand without breaching the
ceiling. In the first 10 months of this year, sales by Japanese car
makers were almost 12 percent above the previous level at 1.34
million.</P>
      <P>However, Schweitzer said an extension of the gentleman's
agreement was unlikely. Although some European car makers would like
that, there would be political opposition. As a replacement, "a form
of monitoring of developments in the Japanese and European markets
would be welcome," the WTO report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>18TH ANNIVERSARY OF 'FORMOSA MAGAZINE' INCIDENT COMMEMORATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An exhibition of documents, photos,
videotapes and other articles related to Taiwan's struggle for human
rights over the past 50 years opened at the 2-28 Incident Memorial
Hall at Taipei's Peace Park near the Presidential Office on
Wednesday, which was also World Human Rights Day.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, dubbed "Taiwan Human Rights Show - the Judgment
of Hisotry," is also being held to mark the 18th anniversary of the
1979 Formosa Magazine Incident, which was reputed by many as an
important watershed in Taiwan's march toward freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>On display is a collection of 212 historical documents, 134
photos and 15 videotapes recording major events in Taiwan's strive
for basic human rights from 1947 through 1997.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, co-sponsored by the Taipei City Government and
the Taiwan Peace Foundation, also features personal belongings or
articles some well-known former political prisoners, including
incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian and writer Po Yang, used
when they were serving jail terms.</P>
      <P>Chen, Po Yang and several other prominent ex-political prisoners
cut specially installed barbed wires with iron cutters to open the
show, symbolizing their fight against suppression of human rights.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Chen said he hopes the Kuomintang,
which has ruled Taiwan for more than five decades, would lose power
in the not too distant future. "That will be the best judgment of
history," said the mayor, who was jailed for eight months in 1986
for publishing an anti-government magazine. AT the time, Taiwan was
still ruled under martial law.</P>
      <P>Chen said the exhibition is aimed at paying tribute to those who
have contributed to Taiwan's democratization and human rights over
the past five decades. "Without their sacrifice of personal freedom,
youth and even lives, we wouldn't have been able to achieve what we
have today," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Shih Ming-teh, also chairman of the New
Taiwan Research Foundation, signed an agreement with Academia
Sinica's Preparatory Office for the Institute of Taiwan Hisotry on
Wednesday, promising to donate a collection of historical documents
and articles concerning the Formosa Magazine Incident to the
institute, which will be inaugurated in the near future.</P>
      <P>Shih, the top leader of an unauthorized street march in the
southern city of Kaohsiung on Dec. 10, 1979 which later led to the
tragic Formosa Magazine Incident, said his foundation will work hard
over the next two years to collect first-hand data concerning the
incident and will donate the collection to the institute in 1999.</P>
      <P>The march in Kaohsiung was held to mark the inauguration
of the pro-Taiwan independence Formosa Magazine. The participants,
including many noted pro-democracy activists, clashed with riot
police. The event ended up with the arrest of dozens of leading
pro-independence and pro-democracy activists, many of whom were later
given long jail terms.</P>
      <P>Shih, who had spent nearly half of his life behind bars, said it
is important to collect first-hand materials concerning the incident.
"As many participants and witnesses are still alive, we can rely on
their recollections or oral histories to get more facts about the
event," he said.</P>
      <P>Shih, a former chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), was jailed for more than 10 years for his role in the
Formosa Magazine Incident. Many other victims of the incident and
their defense lawyers have later become prominent politicians,
including Taoyuan County Magistrate Annette Lu, Taichung Mayor-elect
Chang Wen-ying, Taipei County Magistrate You Ching, Taipei Mayor
Chen, Legislators Chang Chun-hung and Yao Chia-wen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAD RULES OUT PLEBISCITE ON TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Dec.   9   (CNA)
(By Pan Ying-chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will not seek a plebiscite to determine
whether the people of Taiwan wish to secede from mainland China in
the event it becomes the ruling party, DPP Chairman Hsu Hsing-liang
said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an apparent toning down of the party's pro-independence stance
in a bid to win over international support, Hsu told an audience in a
seminar at George Washington University that "no matter whether you
like it or not, Taiwan's sovereignty is a historical fact which
cannot be changed."</P>
      <P>"Of course we like to see Taiwan moving from de facto
independence to de jure independence, but I believe Taiwan people
know that we have to be patient," said Hsu.</P>
      <P>In a press conference organized exclusively for Chinese-language
mass media reporters after the seminar, Hsu reiterated a pledge that
the DPP will not declare Taiwan's independence after coming to power
on the island because such a move is unnecessary. That echoed a
statement made by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh in Washington two
years ago.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan, has threatened to
use force against the island should it formally declare independence.</P>
      <P>Hsu was asked whether the DPP would continue to campaign for
Taiwan's membership in the United Nations and press on with efforts
to arrange foreign visits for its head of state, especially when such
actions, most notably a trip to the United States by ROC President
Lee Teng-hui in June 1995, have touched Beijing's raw nerves.</P>
      <P>He responded that the DPP always seeks better relations with
mainland China via peaceful dialogue and increased contacts.</P>
      <P>Touting the DPP's mainland policy as being "more advanced" than
that of other political forces in Taiwan, Hsu said his party will try
to promote ties with Beijing in the field of economics, with top
priority being the establishment of "three links" with the mainland
-- meaning direct postal, trade and transportation links.</P>
      <P>In performing the balancing act of raising the island's
international profile without offending mainland China, Hsu advocated
pursuing more unofficial exchanges with other nations. He said that
approach could serve the island's purposes without appearing as a
provocative action designed to expand Taipei's presence on the
international stage at Beijing's expense.</P>
      <P>Parris H. Chang, the DPP's top representative in the United
States who appeared with Hsu at the press conference, chimed in
saying that "the DPP will act responsibly toward Beijing, and will
not attempt to provoke or humiliate it and intentionally cause
tensions." Chang noted that opposition local administrations now
represent 71 percent of Taiwan's population after winning 12 of the
23 seats up for grabs in last month's local elections.</P>
      <P>Hsu's delegation is slated to leave for Los Angels on Wednesday
night after a three-day visit here. The group will return to Taiwan
on Dec. 13.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT NEGOTIATIONS SHOULD TAKE PLACE ON EQUAL FOOTING: GIO CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has been seeking
to develop substantive relations with mainland China, but Beijing
needs to remove two major obstacles to the development of such
relations, Dr. David Tawei Lee, spokesman for the Republic of China
government, said here on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an address at a luncheon of the American Enterprise Institute,
Lee, director general of the Government Information Office (GIO),
said Beijing needs to renounce the use of military force against
Taiwan to achieve reunification between Taiwan and the Chinese
mainland. In addition, Beijing should treat the Taipei government as
an equal partner at the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taipei and Beijing have governed their
respective areas of China separately for 48 years, and that "only an
equality of status can accurately reflect reality and allow a
constructive dialogue to begin."</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Taiwan is now a mature democracy and that its
democratically elected government has to conduct itself in accordance
with the prevailing popular will.</P>
      <P>As the results of a recent public opinion survey indicate, the
majority of the voters in Taiwan either prefer the status quo or want
to leave the unification issue to the future. In the process of
developing bilateral relations with the mainland, the ROC government
has to make sure that the security and welfare of the 21.6 million
people of Taiwan is not compromised, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee suggested that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
resume dialogue, beginning with the discussion of functional issues
of mutual concern that arise from the ongoing person-to-person
exchanges between the two sides. The two sides should also try to
find areas where they can cooperate, such as the economic and
cultural fields. They should also take gradual steps to reduce the
enormous differences between them in their standards of living and
political systems, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to allow cross-strait relations to be restored
to the level of the 1992-1995 period, when both sides agreed on the
premise of "one China" but permitted each side to make its own
interpretation of what that meant.</P>
      <P>On the recent mayoral and county magistrate elections in Taiwan,
Lee acknowledged that the ruling Kuomintang suffered a serious
setback, capturing only eight of the 23 contested areas against the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party's victories in 12 counties
and cities. The other three went to independents.</P>
      <P>However, in his view, the results of the elections have little
effect on relations between Taiwan and mainland China, because they
focused mainly on local issues, such as crime, the environment and
social welfare, with no debate on the issue of whether Taiwan should
opt for reunification or independence.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Tuesday morning, Lee, accompanied by officials from
the GIO and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office,
called at the offices of the Washington Post and had a discussion
with its department chiefs on various issues relating to Taiwan.

      <P>If was also deemed urgent for both nations to cooperate in third
areas, saying that multilateral cooperation is crucial in the face of
the Asian financial crisis. If inflation is allowed to fuel trade
competition, the result will be disastrous, Koo quoted the conference
participants as saying.</P>
      <P>As the number of Japanese tourists to Taiwan has seen only

    <HEADLINE>ECCT, AMCHAM CONCERNED ABOUT REFERENDUM ON BAYER INVESTMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Council of Commerce and Trade
(ECCT) along with the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan on
Wednesday repeated their concern over a proposed public referendum on
an investment plan by German conglomerate Bayer Taiwan Co in
Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An ECCT official stated that Taiwan has made substantial progress
in many areas over the past year, citing the transparent bidding
process for the island's first high-speed rail system and
improvements in the traffic control and garbage disposal problems.</P>
      <P>But despite those improvements, the ECCT official said calls for
a public referendum on the Bayer investment project have called into
question other aspects of Taiwan's investment climate.</P>
      <P>Liao Yung-lai, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
magistrate-elect for Taichung County, has indicated he will go ahead
next month with a referendum on whether county residents favor the
construction of a chemical manufacturing facility by Bayer, despite
earlier approval of the project by the central government.</P>
      <P>The European trade official claimed that such sentiment has
produced great impact on domestic and foreign investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said European investors in Taiwan's pharmaceutical industry
continue to grapple with unfair regulations and pricing policies. In
addition, he claimed, European pharmaceutical manufacturers have
received discriminatory treatment under Taiwan tax laws.</P>
      <P>Although the ECCT supports Taiwan's goal to turn the island into
a regional operations hub, it feels that the progress of such an
ambitious project is painfully slow, he said.</P>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) also said the holding
of a referendum as part of the approval process for a private
investment project would be unprecedented and inconsistent with the
concepts of transparency and certainty in regulatory procedures, all
of which it said are essential to maintaining a viable and attractive
investment climate.</P>
      <P>AmCham President Jeffrey Williams said that Taiwan can be proud
of its rapid progress toward full democracy, adding however that the
referendum concept as part of the approval process for private
investment project would create a significant barrier to investment
and should be avoided accordingly.</P>
      <P>The first stage of construction for the Bayer project in Taichung
Harbor, originally slated to begin last year, is estimated to cost
NT$10 billion (US$312.5 million) and take two and a half years to
complete. The total investment of the 10-year, three-stage project is
estimated at NT$50 billion.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister
Jason Hu will soon sign an agreement in Taipei on the framework for
future relations with South Africa after official ties between the
two nations are cut at the end of this year, diplomatic sources here
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>South African President Nelson Mandela announced on Nov. 27 last
year that Pretoria will shift its diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing from Jan. 1, 1998.</P>
      <P>In previous rounds of negotiations, the two nations have reached
agreement on their new ties and South African Foreign Affairs
Minister Alfred Nzo signed the formal pact in Pretoria a few days
ago, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Outgoing ROC Ambassador to South Africa Loh I-cheng, who is
scheduled to leave Pretoria for home Friday, will bring back a copy
of the agreement to be signed by Hu.</P>
      <P>Both sides, however, have a tacit understanding not to reveal
details of the pact prematurely, the sources said.</P>
      <P>But Nzo made it clear during a recent press briefing that there
will be difficulty in meeting Taipei's demand that it be allowed to
use its national name, emblem and flag, and that a consular-level
relationship be maintained.</P>
      <P>Loh also told members of the overseas Chinese community here
earlier that the ROC's embassy in Pretoria and consulates-general in
Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town will continue to operate under
different titles.</P>
      <P>He added that the ROC's property in South Africa will be secured
and the ROC personnel stationed here will continue to enjoy
diplomatic immunity and other privileges.</P>
      <P>As to the bilateral accords on various cooperative programs which
were suspended by Taipei following Pretoria's announcement of the
change in relations, Loh said they will be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis after the new bilateral framework is established.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the content of the accord will be announced by
the foreign affairs ministries of the two nations.</P>
      <P>Loh hosted a dinner party at a Pretoria country golf club Tuesday
to bid farewell to his friends here. Attending the party were some
200 guests, including South African Defense Minister Joe Modise,
former Foreign Minister Pik Botha, the South African president's

      <P>Hsu then asked Sisy Chen, director of the DPP publicity
department, to further clarify the opposition party's stance on the
topic during a press conference for Chinese-language media reporters.</P>
      <P>Chen said DPP headquarters has not held any detailed discussions
regarding a proposed referendum on Bayer's first investment project
in Taiwan. Liao Yung-lai, DPP magistrate-elect for Taichung County,
has said he remains committed to holding such a vote to decide
whether the chemical plant should be built in his county.</P>
      <P>After Hsu's return to Taipei, party leaders will arrange a public
hearing to discuss whether referendums are a desirable means of
determining the fate of controversial investment projects, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the first stage of Bayer's investment project had
passed governmental environmental impact evaluations only two days
before the DPP delegation embarked on its US mission. Three
DPP-recommended experts took part in those evaluations, Chen said,
adding that according to her understanding the pollution levels
produced by Bayer's proposed facility should be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Hsu and other DPP members arrived in New York on Dec. 6 for a

    <HEADLINE>ABDUCTED MARINE POLICE RETURNS HOME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chuang Chen-yao, the marine police who was
abducted by mainland China fishermen to the coastal city Xiamen of
Fuzhou in October, returned to Taipei via Hong Kong Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>In a press conference held at the CKS International Airport,
Chuang said he was happy to be home after being under virtual house
arrest for two months in the mainland. He said he had remained
confident that the Republic of China government would negotiate his
return.</P>
      <P>Chuang was released after long and laborious negotiations between
Taipei and Beijing and after Taipei agreed to pay a condolence fee of
140,000 renminbi (US$17,500) to mainland fishermen for losses they
claimed to suffer during the confrontation that resulted in Chuang's
abduction.</P>
      <P>Chuang said that on Oct. 11, he and his colleague were
conducting a check on a mainland fishing boat spotted in Matsu
waters. When the Taiwan marine police boarded the boat, about 15
mainland fisherman wielding sticks, axes and bottles to attack them.
Chuang was injured in the melee while his colleague jumped overboard
after the fishing boat fled toward the mainland shore.</P>
      <P>One mainland fisherman was also injured in the scuffle. The
Taiwan side agreed to pay up to 140,000 renminbi in condolence money
as a condition for Chuang's release.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-ping, deputy secretary general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), who accompanied Chuang at the press conference,
expressed regret over the way in which Beijing handled the incident,
saying that it had adversely affected the development of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Lee said that from 1993 to September this year, mainland fishing
boats have made 548,630 illegal entries into Taiwan waters, not only
endangering the safety and livelihood of fisherman and the marine
ecology, but also affecting cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Lee urged mainland China to effectively prevent its fishermen
from entering Taiwan waters so as to create a smooth reciprocal
atmosphere between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>SEF Legal Service Department Director You Jui-teh, who has
conducted several rounds of negotiations with Beijing regarding
Chuang's abduction and return, had traveled to the mainland to pick
up Chuang. He said that each side maintained a different
understanding of the incident, which made handling the matter
exceptionally time-consuming.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan claims that Chuang was abducted by mainland
fishermen while performing his duties, the mainland has insisted that
the fishermen did not enter Taiwan waters illegally, and thus their
boat was not subject to inspection by Taiwan police.</P>
      <P>Taipei believed that Chuang could be repatriated after he was
fully recovered from his injuries and negotiations on compensation
could be left until later, but that the mainland continued to hold
him in order to facilitate its demands for compensation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO SEPARATE ECONOMICS FROM POLITICS IN DEALING WITH MONGOLIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In line with its pragmatic diplomacy, the
`epublic of China will separate economic affairs from political
matters in its future dealings with the Mongolian People's Republic.</P>
      <P>Although recognized as an independent state around the world,
Mongolia is still technically considered part of ROC territory,
government sources explained Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to increasing trade between Taiwan and Mongolia, the
ROC government's Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) is
proposing that the Central Asian region be reclassified as an area
distinct from other parts of mainland China in economic-related
matters. At the same time, Taipei will stick to its political stance
that Outer Mongolia, as it is known locally, is a part of the
national territory, said the sources.</P>
      <P>Outer Mongolia was part of Chinese territory until 1911, when it
seized upon the chaos of the Chinese revolution and declared
independence with the backing of Russia. Although the move was later
accepted by the People's Republic of China afterward, Mongolia's
independence has never been never recognized by the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Under the government's new draft guidelines, which were worked
out jointly by the MTAC and the Mainland Affairs Council, Mongolia
will be exempted from rules governing economic ties with mainland
China. Henceforth, Taiwan businessmen, after obtaining permission,
will be allowed to import goods from Mongolia without being subject
to relatively more stringent limitations on trade imposed on
transactions with mainland China.</P>
      <P>As to investment projects in Mongolia, those will be reviewed by
relevant authorities on a case-to-case basis in the absence of
written statutes. Taipei may negotiate an investment protection pact
with Mongolia if investments in that country by Taiwan businessmen
continue to increase, said the sources.</P>
      <P>The policy to exempt Mongolia from the rules governing trade with
mainland China was initiated by MTAC Chairman Kao Koong-lian at a
meeting of the ruling Kuomintang's policymaking Central Standing
Committee on Oct. 15 and was ordered to be studied in detail by KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>It is expected to take force after being approved by the Cabinet,

      <P>The South Korean won plummeted to a

precipitated a drop in the Taiwan currency.</P>
      <P>However, experts from the Council for Economic Planning and

in midday trading in foreign exchange markets on Thursday. Interbank

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of Taiwan's
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), paid a visit to
prominent mainland Chinese political dissident Wei Jingsheng on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This was the first time the two famous political dissidents from
opposite sides of the Taiwan Strait had met to exchange views on the
development of democracy in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsu is currently on a publicity tour of the United States, while
Wei arrived here in mid-November after being released by mainland
authorities on parole for receiving medical treatment.</P>
      <P>During their hour-long talks, Hsu expressed tribute to Wei for
his devotion to promoting democracy and human rights on the mainland.
"I admire you for your courage to fight communist authorities for
freedom and democracy," the leader of Taiwan's largest opposition
party said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wei reminded the pro-(Taiwan) independence DPP not
to underestimate the possibility of Beijing attacking Taiwan if the
island formally declares independence.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is waiting for Taiwan to give it an excuse to launch an
attack," Wei said, adding that if the island declares independence,
the communist government is unlikely to sit idle.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's best-known dissident also urged Hsu to remain
cautious in dealing with the Chinese Communists and not to be
deceived by them.</P>
      <P>Wei later told reporters that his breakfast meeting with Hsu was
a happy encounter. "We talked like old friends as we have shared
similar experiences of fighting for freedom and democracy," he said,
adding the meeting has helped change his perception of the DPP and
enhance his interest in Taiwan-related affairs, particularly the
realities of Taiwan's political environment.</P>
      <P>Hsu also described his meeting with Wei as "amicable and
cordial." He also revealed that Wei has accepted his invitation to
visit Taiwan at a "convenient time."</P>
      <P>Hsu was originally scheduled to meet with an official from the US
Department of Defense on Thursday, but the meeting was canceled at
the last meeting for unknown reasons.</P>
      <P>Hsu, accompanied by several DPP department chiefs, arrived in the
United States last weekend to meet with local Chinese community
leaders and American officials in charge of Taiwan and East Asian
affairs. The group has exchanged views on a range of issues,
including the DPP's policy toward mainland China and the party's
development plan following its resounding win in Taiwan's latest
nationwide mayoral and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP delegation has already visited New York and will also
make a stopover in Los Angeles before returning to Taipei at the end
of this week.</P>

      <P>A mainland Chinese delegation attending
a shipping seminar held in Taiwan will be given a tour of Kaohsiung
Harbor next Monday by the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau (KHB) of the Taiwan
Transportation Department.</P>
      <P>KHB officials, who have been keeping the planned tour low
profile, said that it would merely be a visit to the harbor and urged
people not to read too much into the event.</P>
      <P>The mainland delegation will arrive in Kaohsiung on Dec. 15, be
briefed by KHB authorities and then tour Kaohsiung Harbor on board a
sightseeing boat.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has yet to open its large port facilities --
including those in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Qingdao, Dalian and Tianjin
-- to Taiwan's shipping companies. As a result, the indirect shipping
business across the Taiwan Strait that was initiated in April has not
been as successful as expected, the KHB authorities noted.</P>
      <P>The KHB, however, will not set up a meeting between the mainland
delegation and Taiwan shipping merchants nor arrange for the group to
tour the trans-shipping service region.</P>
      <P>The proposal for cross-strait trans-shipping service was made in
May 1996. For lack of a friendly response from Beijing, however, only
the mainland harbor cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou and Taiwan's
Kaohsiung were opened for the trans-shipping business, a situation
that has kept business turnover low.</P>
      <P>Only some 100,000 containers having been trans-shipped since
April, and shipping companies plying the cross-strait route have
suffered a heavy deficit. Hence shipping merchants in Taiwan are
pinning much hope on the on-going cross-strait shipping meeting being
held in Taipei.</P>

next year, but not high enough to cause inflation problems,
according to a report issued Thursday by the Committee of Economic
Research and Development of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The 1997 report on the committee's review and forecast of the

      <P>The report pointed out that the economy of Taiwan has been
growing normally for 12 months, and that investment and production
capability have also kept increasing during the period. This
situation is helpful to future economic development , it said.</P>
      <P>The financial turmoil in Northeast Asia is a most volatile
factor that may affect the economic development in Taiwan, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and

prices in Taiwan will rise 3.12 percent in 1998 due to the

    <HEADLINE>MAC CLOSELY WATCHES M'LAND DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has been aggressively
pursuing diplomatic relations with other nations in the manner of an
emerging world power, the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC officials noted that since the start of this year mainland
Chinese leaders have exchanged state visits with the heads of foreign
nations more frequently than ever before.</P>
      <P>They noted that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited
Russia in April and the United States in October, followed by
mainland Chinese Premier Li Peng's trip to Japan in November.</P>
      <P>World leaders visiting mainland China this year included French
President Jacques Chirac in May, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto in September and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in
November.</P>
      <P>Jiang attended the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit
meeting in Vancouver in November, and will also attend the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit meeting this month.</P>
      <P>The officials said the frequent overseas trips of mainland
leaders indicate that Beijing has been using its newly acquired world
stature to launch a series of diplomatic offensives.</P>
      <P>They said that after mainland China took over Hong Kong in July
and smoothly concluded in September the 15th Communist Party Congress,
during which Jiang reportedly consolidated his leadership position,
Beijing's international stature reached a new pinnacle.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said that Beijing's aggressive diplomatic moves
have put heavy pressure on Taipei, further squeezing Taipei's
"pragmatic diplomacy" in the international community, adding that
related developments need to be closely watched.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the officials said the improvement of relations
between mainland China and the United States will hinge on the
practical concerns of both sides, adding that support for and
opposition to the Clinton administration's policy of engagement with
Beijing are roughly equal in strength.</P>
      <P>They also said the improved Beijing-Moscow ties could be
attributed to a Russian sense of insecurity over the expansion of
NATO. But in the future, they added, Russia will have to rely on the
West and not the mainland to complete its free-market economic
reforms.</P>
      <P>In a world predominantly headed by such powers as the United
States, European Union, Japan, Russia and mainland China, they
observed, mainland China is at a low rung in economic development,
research standards and national defense, and also lags behind in

    <HEADLINE>FMD-FREE PIGS TO BE MARKED WITH EAR-TAGS: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting in mid-December, all healthy pigs
raised in Taiwan will be marked with ear-tags to prove that they have
been vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the Council of
Agriculture (COA) announced on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The cabinet-level council made the announcement after discussing
new anti-FMD measures with major local hog industry associations in
the wake of the discovery of new FMD infections at three local pig
ranches earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-chi, director of the COA's Animal Industry Department,
said the ear-tag measure is aimed at encouraging local pig farmers to
properly and regularly vaccinate their swine in order to fend off the
recurrence of an FMD epidemic on the island.</P>
      <P>"Those who fail to abide by the regulations will be fined from
NT$10,000 to NT$50,000 and will not be compensated if their pigs die
of the illness," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>He said all 211 of the swine verified to have contracted the
deadly disease in Chupei, Taichung and Kaohsiung, have already been
slaughtered, adding that the areas surrounding the pig ranches have
been thoroughly sterilized to contain the infection.</P>
      <P>All the infected pigs were discovered either at wholesale markets
or pig-pens, Chen said, which means none of them had been distributed
to retail markets. "Local consumers need not panic over the reports
of new FMD cases," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said his department has directed local animal disease
control offices to intensify monitoring of the 20 wholesale pig
markets around the island to prevent any sick swine from entering
retail markets.</P>
      <P>The COA has also banned the movement of any swine raised within
three kilometers of the three affected hog ranches, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan has now entered a high-risk period,
when an FMD epidemic is most likely to re-occur, firstly because the
FMD virus usually thrives in low temperatures, and secondly because
the FMD vaccine is effective for only six months. "By now, many pigs
which were vaccinated between March and May need to be inoculated
again," he added.</P>
      <P>Under a massive vaccination program, a total of 21 million doses
of the vaccine have been administered to local swine since an FMD
epidemic, the island's first in many decades, broke out in Taiwan in
mid-March this year. To curb the spread of the disease, nearly four
million pigs were slaughtered from March to July.</P>
      <P>Chen said the COA has continued to monitor FMD-control measures
since July 15 when the last case of FMD infection was uncovered. Up
until Dec. 6, no new cases had been reported.</P>
      <P>All three farms where FMD-infected swine were found over the past
week are small-sized ranches and usually use spoiled food to feed
their pigs, Chen said, adding that this might be the source of the
new infections.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has only 8.5 million pigs and some four million
doses of FMD vaccine in stock. Against this background, Chen said,
it's unlikely that an FMD epidemic will sweep the island again.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many local governments have stepped up protective
measures to prevent any sick pigs from other cities or counties from
entering their jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>According to health experts, the FMD disease is only contagious
among cattle, sheep, pigs and other cloven-hoofed animals. The
symptoms include necrosis around the animal's mouth, feet and udders.
Some afflicted animals will eventually lose their hooves before
finally dying of the illness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WILL CHINA BE NEXT SOUTH KOREA?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,   Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Who will be next in line for an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue package? "Certainly China
looms, since it has all the policy problems of South Korea and
Thailand, only on a grander scale and with less political
legitimacy," a Canadian commentator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Terence Corcoran of The Globe and Mail said the IMF's "Mr. Bean
assessment of South Korea's economic condition had proved dead
wrong." But such failure was not supposed to occur in the wake of the
1995 Mexican crisis, he claimed.</P>
      <P>The IMF created a so-called "early earning system" that would
allow it and the market to detect looming national economic crises.
"Whatever mechanisms exist, they obviously didn't work," Corcoran
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Despite its warning system, the IMF is full of optimism toward
mainland China, according to the Canadian columnist. He quoted a
former IMF official as praising Beijing for having "begun to master
the art of soft-landing" and adding that given the mainland's large
stock of currency reserves, "it may well be that China will not need
financial assistance from the fund."</P>
      <P>Corcoran warned that the true secret of the IMF is its "ability
to maintain a facade of supreme confidence and stability while it
plunges from catastrophe to catastrophe."</P>
      <P>Even as its own policies and programs are revealed to be shams,
"the IMF goes through life like a sophisticated Mr. Bean, leaving a
trail of unintended consequences and escalating turmoil," he noted.
In short, when the IMF sneezes, financial markets spend years
cleaning up the mess, he said.</P>
      <P>He went on to criticize the IMF's secretive way of dispensing
credit, saying "it keeps a tight rein on information about its
practices and policies. It's impossible to know where the billions
go, how they are allocated, who benefits and who loses," he added.</P>
      <P>Some Ottawa observers asked: If the IMF is not competent in
solving national financial crises, then why not allow "regional
funds," like the one proposed by Japan, to play a role in the
regional economy?</P>

    <HEADLINE>RI PRODUCERS WORRIED OVER RUBBER PRICE DROP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-Chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesian rubber producers are worried
over a sharp drop in the rubber price in international markets to
below production cost, a state-owned plantation official said here
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The drop was prompted by Thailand, the world's largest rubber
producer, who sold it at cheaper prices and in large volumes because
of the economic crisis in the country," Edward Sitorus, director of
PT Perkebunan Nusantara XIII, was quoted by Antara news agency as
saying.</P>
      <P>Sitorus said the rubber price in the world market was down to
US$0.70 a kilogram. "This is the lowest price of rubber I have ever
seen."</P>
      <P>Smallholders and plantations alike will benefit if the price can
reach a minimum of US$1.00 per kilo.</P>
      <P>The rubber price was US$1.5 per kilo in 1994, US$1.3 in 1995, and
US$1.1 in 1996.</P>
      <P>The commodity's market had also been weakened by the state of the
domestic rubber processing industry, Sitorus said.</P>
      <P>Normally, Sitorus said, if Indonesia had so many processing
industries, it could supply the domestic market.</P>
      <P>But in fact, the country has been depending on rubber imports, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ir Basran Madry, director of plant rehabilitation and
extensification at the Ministry of Agriculture, said the affected
plantation area for 1996 was 14 million hectares.</P>
      <P>Total production of plantation products from those areas amounted
to 12 million tons, with about half of the total production being
exported.</P>
      <P>"National earnings from the export amounted to US$5 billion,"
Madry said.</P>
      <P>Total area in 1997 amounted to 14.05 million hectares, 11.39
million hectares for smallholders and 2.67 million hectares for large
plantations.</P>
      <P>The largest area of big plantation production was oil palm (1.469
million ha), followed by rubber (543,000 ha). For smallholders, the
largest area was planted with coconut (2.675 million ha) followed by
rubber (2.992 million ha).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has retained its
position as the world's third most profitable place to invest in for
the next one to five years, according to the Business Risk Service
(BERI).</P>
      <P>In the BERI's latest ranking, the ROC remained tied with Japan
for the third spot with the same score of 76.</P>
      <P>In its November report, the US-based risk consultancy ranked
profit opportunities for the world's 50 major countries for next year
and the next five years.</P>
      <P>Switzerland remained in the top spot with a score of 82 (same as
the previous rank and score in July).</P>
      <P>Singapore also retained its second position in the new rating
with the same score of 78.</P>
      <P>The ratings of other countries in Southeast Asia dipped because
the financial crisis sparked by the free fall of the Thai baht in
early July has resulted in the plunge of the baht, Indonesian rupiah
and Malaysian ringgit, which shed between 30 percent and 50 percent
of their value against the US dollar. The Singapore dollar fell by
12.7 percent in that period.</P>
      <P>BERI gave Malaysia a score of 57, down from 59 in its previous
report in July. Its rating slipped one notch to 19th.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's score dropped from 46 to 44, and its rank fell from
34th to 39th.</P>
      <P>Thailand's score dipped three points to 47, and it slipped from
28th to 29th spot. The Philippines also dropped to 39th spot, tied
with Indonesia, from 37th with a score of 42.</P>
      <P>The assessment of profit opportunity is based on ratings in three
key areas: operations risk, which covers the general business
environment; political risk; and remittance and repatriation, which
measures the ease with which private foreign companies can transfer
profits and capital abroad.</P>
      <P>Following are the top 10 countries in BERI's latest rating, with
composite scores (previous rank/score in parentheses):</P>

    <HEADLINE>IS CANADA CATCHING CHINESE FLU?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian daily expressed worry Wednesday
that Canada's leaders, by showing "alarming insensitivity" to
protesters during last month's APEC conference in Vancouver, are
becoming more like their mainland Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>One of the justifications for doing business with repressive
regimes is that, over time, they will adopt Western values of respect
for human rights, The Ottawa Citizen said in an editorial.</P>
      <P>The risk, however, is that "in consorting with the devil, we
begin to act more like him," warned the Citizen. This is just
something to consider on International Human Rights Day, it added.</P>
      <P>The daily was commenting on how the Canadian leaders reacted to
anti-APEC protests in Vancouver last month. It was shocked by
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien's knock-off line in response to
police hauling out pepper spray at protesters on the UBC campus: "For
me, pepper is what I put on my plate."</P>
      <P>Another insensitive Canadian leader was Chretien's International
Trade Minister Sergio Marchi, who vaguely dismissed the Vancouver
clashes as an "altercation on the university campus." This conjures
up mainland China's vague reference to "an incident at Tiananmen
Square," the editorial noted.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that University of British Columbia law student
Craig Jones has accused the Canadian government and police of trying
to muzzle free speech. Jones recounts being arrested as he stood
outside his student residence -- a space he was entitled to occupy,
even under the security guidelines -- because he refused to
relinquish a sign that read "Free Speech." It would be seen by
passing motorcades moving such dictators as Indonesia's Suharto and
mainland China's Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Earlier, four UBC student protesters were held until they signed
an undertaking not to participate in any more public protests --
anywhere, at any time -- against APEC, the Citizen said. An
aboriginal chief says her welcome speech to APEC leaders was
canceled because it contained a reference to human rights, it added.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail reported from Vancouver on Wednesday that the
Prime Minister's Office and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
were accused of violating the constitutional rights of protesters
during the APEC meeting.</P>
      <P>"The suit is just the latest embarrassment for the federal
Liberal government," the Mail said, noting that so far, the fallout
from the Vancouver summit "has been mostly negative, with repeated
criticisms from APEC protesters and civil libertarians" that
Chretien's handlers "tried to stage-manage protests, interfered in
security arrangements and censored a speaker who had been invited to
attend the conference."</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAYER UNDECIDED ON TAIWAN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Horst Mueck, chief of the Bayer Group's
Taiwan branch, said on Thursday that Bayer's headquarters in Germany
will have the final say on the fate of the company's NT$49.2 billion
investment project in central Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Mueck's remarks came after the Legislative Yuan on Wednesday
passed the first reading of an amendment to the Self-Governance Law
for Provinces and Counties, which would allow local governments to
hold public referendum on major public affairs.</P>
      <P>Mueck said Bayer Taiwan will proceed with the investment plan as
scheduled until the company's headquarters makes a final decision on
whether or not to withdraw the project from Taiwan, adding that the
decision will depend on the results of the vote following the third
reading of the amendment at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Bayer's plan to build a plant to produce toluene di-isocyanate
near Taichung Harbor has provoked strong opposition from local
residents, and county magistrate-elect Liao Yung-lai of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has insisted on holding a public
referendum to decide the fate of the project.</P>
      <P>When asked about whether Bayer will conduct negotiations with the
DPP or the Taichung County government on the issue, Mueck said Bayer,
as a business group, will not get involved in Taiwan politics.
However, he pointed out that it will be a heavy blow to Taiwan's
investment climate if the Taichung County government really resorts
to a public referendum to decide on the future of the plant.</P>
      <P>Addressing a joint committee question-and-answer session in the
Legislative Yuan, newly appointed Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said
the local government had better work out a detailed explanation to
help the public gain a comprehensive understanding of the issues
involved before holding public referendums on important local
affairs.</P>
      <P>He said the local government should provide a legal basis and a
well-thought-out procedural system before holding a referendum, in
order to allow the public to make a "wise decision."</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said his council has no intention of
avoiding monitoring from the local government by applying directly to
the Interior Ministry for construction and usage licenses in order to
push the Bayer investment project through before any referendum is
held in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>"The CEPD has no need to fend off the referendum, as a public
vote of this kind has no legal basis in Taiwan," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the CEPD has decided to send Bayer's documents and
reports of the results of its long-term communication with the local
people to the Taiwan Provincial Assembly as a reference of public
opinion on the issue, since the assembly requires proven "strong
public support" for its passage of Bayer's case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, also a DPP heavyweight,
said neither the DPP nor the central government should interfere in
the Taichung County government's plan to hold a referendum, as it is
a local issue.</P>
      <P>Holding referendums is only a means of soliciting public opinion,
which he said is not a reflection of anti-business feeling and will
not hinder job and investment opportunities at the local level.</P>
      <P>Chen said the fate of the Bayer investment plan should be decided
by the residents of Taichung County and called on the outside world
not to judge the issue from a political point of view.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's anti-submarine
capability can cover the entire Taiwan Strait, naval authorities
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The ROC Navy can detect any activities by submarines in the
entire Taiwan Strait," said a senior naval officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The officer was commenting on a report by the Far Eastern
Economic Review that the ROC Navy failed to detect a mainland China's
Russian-made K-class A-77 submarine which navigated to Southeast Asia
via the Taiwan Strait in November.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based weekly said in its Dec. 18 issue that the
incident indicates that there is a loophole in Taiwan's submarine
combat capability. It further said mainland China has four K-class
submarines, including two 636-type subs, which are more advanced and
quieter than the A-77 craft.</P>
      <P>"The foreign media report is not true," the officer said.
According to the ROC's defense regulations, the officer said, the
navy would immediatetly cope with any submarine that intrudes into
waters east of the median line of the Taiwan Strait, but would not
necessarily issue a news release on such events.</P>
      <P>Under the ROC regulations, the navy would closely monitor
submarine activities in waters west of the median of the Taiwan
Strait, but may not necessarily take any countermeasures.</P>
      <P>"We have consistently maintained the capability to detect,
contact and cope with unidentified underwater targets in accordance
with our anti-submarine regulations," the officer asserted.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Far Eastern Economic Review observation that
Taiwan would be able to detect K-class submarines in its nearby
waters only after all the six Lafayette-class missile frigates it has
ordered from France join services, the officer argued that such
comments indicate that the weekly neither understands Taiwan's
anti-submarine capability nor the basic situation of its navy.</P>
      <P>The officer said Taiwan has taken delivery of five
Lafayette-class frigates, five of which have been formally
commissioned.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the officer said, among the ROC's warships,
the six Knox-class frigates leased from the United States
have the strongest anti-submarine capabilities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROPOSED INDUSTRIAL ZONE MUST MEET ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said
Thursday that if the proposed Pingnan Industrial Zone in southern
Taiwan fails to pass an environmental impact assessment, the
government will not allow construction to begin.</P>
      <P>Wang said the officials from the Industrial Development Bureau
and the Environmental Protection Administration are currently working
with local authorities to conduct an evaluation of the environmental
surroundings at the proposed site of the industrial zone in Tainan
County.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the stance of the ministry is consistent with the
wishes of local people. But he added that if the proposed industrial
zone is ultimately deemed environmentally sound, the public should
give its full support to the development project.</P>
      <P>However, if the assessment determines that construction of the
industrial zone would produce negative consequences for the local
environment, the government will not allow the project to be carried
out, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Pingnan Industrial Zone, which would be the largest
industrial development project in Taiwan, will house the island's 7th
naphtha cracker, an integrated steel mill and an exclusive harbor
facility.</P>
      <P>Environmental activists and advocates of the project have clashed
several times over the NT$400 billion (US$12.42 billion) investment.</P>
      <P>Plans for the joint project between the Yieh Loong Group and the
Tuntex Group were submitted to the government for review three years
ago, but were rejected on grounds of improper procedures. A revised
project outline was recently submitted by the investors. But
environmental activists believe the development of a industrial zone
in Pingnan could be detrimental to the ecology of the wetland area.</P>
      <P>Wang also said the government understands the position taken by
foreign companies after the European Council of Commerce and Trade
and the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan expressed concern over
the future of investment projects, such as the one proposed by German
conglomerate Bayer in Taichung Harbor.</P>
      <P>Wang said that a public referendum at the current juncture on the
Bayer project will affect the willingness of foreign investors, and
that the ministry will continue to communicate with the local
government on the issue.</P>
      <P>Taichung Magistrate-elect Liao Yung-lai has said he plans to go
ahead with a public referendum next month on the fate of the Bayer
investment project.</P>

for the past nine months. They aim to tackle long-standing barriers,
above all in developing countries, to international competition in
banking, insurance and securities.</P>
      <P>A WTO accord also would subject national policies on financial
services to binding multilateral rules and disciplines.</P>
      <P>The United States, European Union and Japan have tabled offers
that pledge liberalization beyond their commitments two years ago
when the WTO first tried to reach an accord on financial services.</P>
      <P>However, hopes for an accord this time around are seen hinging on
Washington, which says it won't sign unless developing countries such
as those in Southeast Asia move to open their markets further.</P>
      <P>"No one can predict at this stage what all the elements of the
imminent conclusion will be," Ruggiero said. "But it is hard to image
in this final phase that all of our achievements will be allowed to
slip away."</P>
      <P>Brazil deposited an offer earlier this week, while Colombia,
Indonesia, Thailand and Romania are expected to chip in soon,

    <HEADLINE>THREE PERCENT PETROLEUM PRICE HIKE EXPECTED SATURDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A petroleum price hike of 3 percent can be
expected on Saturday, and consumers in Taiwan are likely to see three
other price hikes by next June.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, President of
the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) Pan Wen-yen said on
Thursday that a petroleum price hike will be announced on Friday at
the earliest, but that the most likely time for the announcement will
be Saturday.</P>
      <P>He said the CPC is still seeking to obtain approval from the
Economics Ministry to raise the price by more than the current
maximum of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>It is within the CPC's power to raise petroleum prices by up to 3
percent, but if the increase is over 3 percent, it has to be approved
by an advisory committee on energy and electricity rates under the
Economics Ministry.</P>
      <P>CPC Chairman Chen Chao-wei said the CPC has no choice but to
raise prices to reflect the increased cost of purchasing imported
crude oil in the wake of the sharp devaluation of the Taiwan dollar.
But under pressure from the Legislative Yuan, Chen added that the CPC
is likely to raise petroleum prices in stages instead of all at once.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that based on the current foreign exchange rate of
NT$31.93 to the US dollar and the international crude oil price of
US$18.27 per barrel, the CPC will incur an additional NT$22 billion
(US$676 million) in purchasing costs over the next seven months. With
a 3 percent price hike, sales revenue will only increase by NT$5.2
billion during the seven-month period, he added, pointing out that if
the CPC wants to make up its losses in purchasing costs, it will have
to make four 3 percent increases by next June.</P>

      <P>On the eve of the severance of
diplomatic relations between Taipei and Pretoria, South African
President Nelson Mandela on Thursday conferred the Order of Good
Hope, Grand Officer on the outgoing Republic of China Ambassador, Loh
I-cheng.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, which took place at Mandela's residence in
Pretoria, the president described the order as the highest honor that
his government offers to foreigners who have contributed to the
well-being of the people of South Africa.</P>
      <P>He said that during his tenure, Loh has played a very important
role in encouraging both the ROC government and the business sector's
participation in South Africa's reconstruction and other development
programs.</P>
      <P>Mandela noted that during Loh's tenure, trade between Taiwan and
South Africa increased from US$800 million to over US$1.4 billion,
while Taiwan investment grew to US$1 billion. Loh has served as the
ROC envoy since 1990.</P>
      <P>He said Loh "deserves the honor" as he has made great efforts in
promoting a long-lasting relationship between the people of the two
nations. He also asked Loh, who is scheduled to leave for Taipei on
Friday, to convey his best regards to ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Mandela announced late last year that his government will shift
its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing from Jan. 1, 1998.</P>
      <P>Since then, negotiators from the two nations have held several
rounds of talks on establishing a framework for future ties, and
recently reached an accord. Details of the new framework, however,
have yet to be announced.</P>

      <P>After successfully developing two new types
of bulk carrier with displacements of 165,000 tons and 149,000 tons,
respectively, the state-run China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) recently
unveiled a new fuel-efficient bulk carrier of 80,000 tons which they

      <P>Sources at the CSBC's Kaohsiung headquarters said the new ship,
patterned on the design of a much smaller 45,000 ton carrier, has a
length of 225 meters, a width of 27 meters, and a height of 18.7
meters. It has passed international seaworthiness tests with high
scores, said the sources.</P>
      <P>With a 13,299 horsepower engine, it reached a speed of 16 knots
in a test voyage on sea with waves no bigger than three degrees,
while loaded with 30,000 tons of cargo and with a clean and smooth
hull.</P>
      <P>The vessel's striking fuel-efficiency is expected to create a

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO PARTICIPATE IN WORLD EFFORTS TO CUT GREENHOUSE GASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In line with world efforts to help save the
earth from catastrophic global warming, Taiwan will work out plans to
cut greenhouse gas emissions, a technology counseling meeting
sponsored by the Executive Yuan decided on Thursday.</P>
      <P>A report issued after the meeting said that even though the ROC
is neither a member of the United Nations nor a participant in the
just-concluded global climate conference in the Japanese city of
Kyoto, Taiwan will make efforts to cut its greenhouse gas emissions
and will submit its plans to the UN by next March.</P>
      <P>The report said that greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan reached
149 million metric tons in 1991, 83 percent of which was carbon
dioxide and 15 percent methane. Most greenhouse gases were emitted as
a by-product of energy consumption, accounting for 78 percent of the
total, while landfills were the main source of methane.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions ranked in 27th place among 160
countries around the world and accounted for 0.5 percent of the total
global emissions. It is estimated that Taiwan will see an increase in
such emissions over the next 14 years, with annual growth forecast at
3.1 percent, signaling an urgent need for the government to control
such emissions.</P>
      <P>The report said that as the government has been pushing for trash
recycling and the setting up of several new incinerators around the
island, the emission of methane is expected to be brought under
control, and government efforts should therefore focus on the control
of carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Total carbon dioxide emission reached 170 million metric tons in
1996, an increase of 52 percent compared with the 1990 level. The
figure is estimated to climb to 294 million metric tons by 2010,
making Taiwan's per capita carbon dioxide emission the highest in the
world.</P>
      <P>The report proposed several emission-cutting measures such as
reduction of energy consumption, trash recycling, increasing use of
low-carbon or non-carbon energy, the changing of the island's
industrial structure, and reforestation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian court on Wednesday renewed
antidumping duties on bicycle imports from Taiwan and mainland China,
prompting Canada's three major manufacturers to celebrate.</P>
      <P>"We won," exulted lawyer Geoff Kubrick, just after the Canadian
International Trade Tribunal in Montreal issued its ruling.</P>
      <P>The Canadian bike makers had argued that their industry of 1,300
employees and sales of C$300 million (US$211 million) would be in
jeopardy if the five-year protection against cheap foreign bikes were
allowed to expire this month.</P>
      <P>"This guarantees the survival of the Canadian industry," claimed
Kubrick, who represented the manufacturers in court.</P>
      <P>"Now these Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers will have to pedal
their dumped bicycles somewhere else," he said in a jubilant voice.</P>
      <P>The trade court will release the reasons for its decision in two
weeks, but Kubrick believes it will note that Europe, Mexico and
Argentina have anti-dumping rulings in effect against mainland
Chinese and, in some cases, Taiwanese bicycles.</P>
      <P>Bikes that cost more than C$325 (US$230) are excluded from the
ruling. The three companies all have their plants in Quebec. They are
industry leader Procycle, which makes many brands including CCM and
Peugeot, and owns Rocky Mountain Bicycles of Delta, British
Colombia.; Raleigh Industries of Oakville, Ontario, with its plant in
Waterloo, Quebec; and Victoria Precision, based in Montreal.</P>
      <P>The three supply about half of Canada's bicycles. Taiwan supplies
16 percent, mainland China 7 percent and other countries 18 percent.</P>

      <P>A decision by the Canadian government to
extend the anti-dumping tariff on Taiwan-made bicycles will have only
limited impact on Taiwan's bicycle exports, the Economics Ministry

      <P>An official with the ministry's Board of Foreign Trade said that
the five-year anti-dumping tariff on Taiwan-made bicycles, which
expired on Thursday, is to be extended according to a decision made a
day earlier by the Canadian international trade court. The court will
announce details of the tariff extension in two weeks, he said.</P>
      <P>Saying that local manufacturers expected the result, the official

pointing out that Taiwan only exported some 173,600 bicycles to
Canada last year.</P>
      <P>An official of Giant, Taiwan's leading manufacturer, said that
the Canadian government's verdict didn't take local makers by
surprise, adding that his company only exported some 14,000 bicycles
to Canada last year, a quite small ratio compared to the one million
bicycles the company exported worldwide during the same period.</P>

      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), on Friday said that
clearing up public misgivings over an investment project in central
Taiwan by the German-based conglomerate Bayer will be the council's
top priority.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks after he and Liao Yung-lai,
magistrate-elect of Taichung County, appeared on a local cable TV
program Thursady night.</P>
      <P>Liao, who had earlier insisted on linking the fate of the
investment project to the outcome of a public referendum, seemed to
soften his stance. He said that he would welcome every possible
method by government agencies, including public hearings, to ease
concerns over the project before initiating a county-wide vote.</P>
      <P>Liao also said he would not insist on holding the public
referendum next month as previously planned, suggesting instead that
an opinion survey of Taichung County residents could be conducted
before putting the matter to a vote.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that the government's first priority at present is to
ease public misgivings over the possible threat posed by Bayer's
proposed chemical plant project to the local environment.</P>
      <P>Liao said residents in Taichung have worries about the pollution
levels that will be created by the Bayer facility and the potential
danger to public safety. He claimed that the CEPD has failed to
inform Bayer officials about such concerns, and has also neglected to
clearly explain the manufacturing process associated with the
chemical plant to the public.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he would continue discuss the matter with Bayer over

Communist Party (CCP) Secretary-General Jiang Zemin, mainland China's
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang remarked on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tang, speaking at a press conference, further emphasized that
communication channels between Beijing and Taipei are not necessarily
limited to the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Tang's remarks were made in response to questions from Western

China President Lee Teng-hui urging the resumption of cross-strait
talks.</P>
      <P>Tang said that during the 15th National Congress of the CCP in

Taiwan Strait could begin with the termination of the hostilities
between the two sides. However, Tang claimed, that overture has not
seen an active or formal response from the Taipei authorities.</P>
      <P>Regarding the meaning of a "formal response," Tang said he was
referring to Jiang's standing eight-point proposal, which suggested
"negotiations as a first step in formally putting an end to
hostilities under the one-China principle; the two sides should
shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding Chinese sovereignty and
territorial integrity and work out plans for future development of
cross-strait ties."</P>
      <P>As to whether such a response should be made through the ARATS
and the SEF, Tang stressed that contacts do not necessarily have to
proceed under established mechanisms.</P>

      <P>Kao Ming-chien, head of the hospital's neurosurgery department,
told the press Friday that following a 12-hour long process of
observation, they found that Hsieh's condition has not deteriorated.</P>
      <P>However, the doctor said, he is suffering from pneumonia which
occurred as a result of choking due to a large amount of food in his
stomach at the time of the stroke.</P>
      <P>Kao explained that an aneurysm that resulted in serious cerebral
hemorrhaging was the culprit behind the apoplexy which nearly took
Hsieh's life. Nevertheless, the NA deputy speaker remains in critical
condition.</P>
      <P>Taipei political circles were shocked over the incident as Hsieh,
a well-known stalwart of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), had played a
key role in the passage of KMT-guided amendments to the Republic of
China Constitution earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was elected in 1986 to the National Assembly, which fills
the role of the nation's parliament in conjunction with the
Legislative Yuan. He had previously served as county representative.</P>
      <P>With a frank, upright and generous personality, Hsieh has
numerous friends in both political and business circles, which has
allowed him to enjoy broad influence and a high-ranking position in
the NA.</P>
      <P>The political heavyweight has also gained the nickname "The King
of Palau," due to his successful investments in that West Pacific
island nation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also maintains a close relationship with ROC President Lee
Teng-hui, who on Friday sent his Secretary-General Huang Kun-huei to
the hospital to inquire about the deputy speaker's condition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIPS SALES ACROSS ASIA RISE, WITH EXCEPTION OF JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the financial turmoil in
Asian countries, world semiconductors sales hit their highest mark of
the year in October as sales reached nearly US$ 12 billion, an
increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year,
according a Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) report released
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The San Jose-based SIA's report was made public in the midst of
predictions that the near-meltdown performance in some of Asian
countries' currency and stocks markets would drag the price and
demand of chips to the bottom.</P>
      <P>"With the exception of Japan, global sales continued to build
upon the momentum of a growth trend that surfaced at the end of the
first quarter," said Doug Andrey, SIA director of information systems
and finance. "Japan's sales, computed in US dollars, were crimped by
the depreciation of the yen against dollar."</P>
      <P>The Asia-Pacific market, excluding Japan, showed across-the-board
sales gains. October sales reached US$ 2.73 billion, a 1.7 percent
gain from September's total and a 21.4 percent jump from October 1996
sales.</P>
      <P>"The Asia-Pacific market remains strong despite the recent
currency crisis in Korea and other Asian countries," Andrey said.
"Over the long term, demand for semiconductor products should
continue to expand in all markets, including Asia-Pacific, because
chips are fundamentally improving the way we live, work and
communicate."</P>
      <P>According to the Global Sales Report for October, sales rose
steadily in three of the four major chip markets, with Europe showing
the most dramatic month-to-month gains. Sales in the American market
and the Asia-Pacific market continued to show the most dramatic
year-to-year growth.</P>
      <P>With total sales of US$11.99 billion, October was also the
strongest sales month since March 1996 when sales hit US$12.11
billion.</P>
      <P>The SIA report puts all Asia Pacific countries, excluding Japan,
into one category, therefore the specific sales of chips in Taiwan is
not available, a spokesman for the association said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE'S AEROSPACE INDUSTRY FLYING HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's aerospace industry revenue
is expected to grow a robust 16.7 percent to S$1.84 billion this year
with investments rising 18.9 percent to S$145 million.</P>
      <P>Its output growth next year is expected to continue at a
double-digit rate and new investments will at least equal this year's
as the industry strives to obtain a larger share of regional and
global markets, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The industry's average output growth was 7.7 percent a year
between 1993 and 1996.</P>
      <P>The EDB pointed out that the strong growth resulted from the
sector having capitalized on the global upturn in the aerospace
industry as well as from new investments over the past three years.</P>
      <P>This year's investments are expected to create 800 new jobs in
the industry which currently employs 9,485 workers.</P>
      <P>Of the 55 aerospace companies in Singapore, 20 were new outfits
that had set up operations in the last three to four years, EDB said.</P>
      <P>It added that the aerospace industry's output contributed just
over 1 percent to Singapore's manufacturing output last year, but the
value-added amount contributed by each worker came close to the
manufacturing sector's national average of S$76,924 last year. This
year, the value added by each worker in the aerospace industry is
expected to rise 10 percent to S$84,439.</P>
      <P>Aircraft repair and overhauls, the main contributor to the
industry's output, is expected to grow 16.8 percent and account for
87.3 percent of total output this year. Seventy percent of this is
generated in Asian markets.</P>
      <P>It is understood that Singapore has more than 40 percent of
Asia's aircraft repair and overhauls market.</P>
      <P>Output of aerospace manufacturing operations is likely to account
for 12.7 percent of the industry's output.</P>
      <P>The EDB said Asia was expected to lead the growth in the world
air travel market in the long term despite its economic crisis. The
region was expected to receive 35 percent of global aircraft
deliveries over the next 10 to 20 years.</P>
      <P>And the Asia-Pacific region would lead worldwide growth in the
aircraft repair and overhauls market over the next decade, it added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRES IN JAKARTA UP 60 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-Chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The incidence of fires in Jakarta
increased by 60 percent this year, a fire-fighting official said.</P>
      <P>The head of the city's fire services department, Suharso, said on
Thursday a total of 1,186 fires occurred in the city this year while
only 723 fires were recorded last year.</P>
      <P>Fires this year have so far claimed the lives of 38 people.</P>
      <P>Suharso said carelessness and electrical facilities were the most
dominant causal factors in the incidents.</P>
      <P>"Our people still underestimate possible danger of fires from
things such as oil lamps, cigarette butts and old electrical
instruments," he was quoted by Antara news agency as saying.</P>
      <P>The fires in 1997 caused up to 97 billion rupiah in material
losses apart from the fire at the Bank Indonesia office tower that
killed 15 people on Monday.</P>
      <P>The city fire brigade has a total of 2,557 personnel and 178
vehicular units.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police on Thursday interrogated four more people as
witnesses in the recent fire which gutted the top four floors of Bank
Indonesia tower.</P>
      <P>Chief of Jakarta Metropolitan Police Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata said
21 witnesses had been questioned earlier in connection with the
blaze.</P>
      <P>"But we do not rule out the possibility that they will become
suspects in the event strong evidence is produced regarding their
involvement with the fire," he said.</P>
      <P>The 21 witnesses include Bank Indonesia employees, construction
workers and cleaning service workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chief of the Indonesian Police Gen. Dibyo Widodo said
the cause of the fire was still under investigation.</P>
      <P>Chief of the Jakarta Metropolitan Police's Detective Unit Col.
Gories Mere, who met Widodo on Wednesday, said the blaze started on
the 24th floor.</P>
      <P>"We are awaiting the result of a laboratory test to name suspects
in the fire," Widodo said.</P>
      <P>Police officers were seen guarding the top three floors of the
25-story building which was to be inaugurated early next year.</P>

      <P>The Canadian dollar traded below seventy US
cents, dropping to as low as 69.98 US cents Thursday morning before
recovering to 70.11 US cents at 2:00 p.m. The drop opens the door for
the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates.</P>
      <P>It was the first time the dollar had dropped that low in nearly
twelve years. Not even the late 1995 Quebec referendum brought the
Canadian currency down that far.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank were not
waiting. They announced that mortgage rates will rise between a fifth
and just over a third of a percentage point on terms ranging from one

      <P>At both institutions, the rate for a one-year closed mortgage
will be 6.10 percent, up from 5.9 percent, with a five-year term
going up from 6.7 percent to 7.05 percent.</P>
      <P>The CIBC said it had to raise the rate because of the rising cost
of borrowing money on the bond market.</P>
      <P>Current prime rate at Canada's major commercial banks was 5.5
percent. The Bank of Canada, or central bank, rate was 4 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BECOME A 'BRIDGE TO ASIA': SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To make Taiwan a regional financial center,
the government has put forth an implementation plan guided by five
overriding values broadly categorized as liberalization, cooperation,
efficiency, transparency and excellence, Premier Vincent Siew said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the Conference on the Development of a Regional
Financial Center in Taiwan, Siew said the government envisions a
regional center "open for business," which will facilitate the free
flow of capital and remove impediments to trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also endeavor to reduce trade barriers, call for
cooperation among foreign and local entities, and work to build
public-private partnerships, Siew told his audience. "We would like
to be not only a gateway but also a bridge to Asia," he noted.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taiwan will make every effort not only to reduce the
cost of doing business in Asia but also to "maximize benefits for all
stakeholders, whether they are individual parties to transactions or
members of the greater community at large."</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the Republic of China would like to build a
level playing field for business and attract as many players as
possible. "To promote accessibility and accountability, the regional
financial center favors transparency of transactions and free flow of
information. Furthermore, the ramp to the information superhighway
has been constructed," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the government's most important goal in this plan is to
build a center "synonymous with excellence," whose quality of service
and supporting infrastructure will be first rate.</P>
      <P>Capital markets have become globalized as impediments to foreign
participation in the local bourse are removed, he noted. From July
1995 to August 1997, foreign capital in the local stock market grew
from US$5.8 billion to US$10.9 billion. Concurrently, domestic public
companies are being encouraged to issue depository receipts or
corporate bonds overseas, he said.</P>
      <P>"My government will continue to foster and promote trade by
staying the course toward the greater liberalization and
globalization of the Taiwan market," he added.</P>
      <P>"We believe that a balance between competition and cooperation
should be maintained with other financial markets in the region," he
said.</P>
      <P>As the economies of Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai flourish
and the movement of capital accelerates, closer coordination and
interaction are essential, Siew stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, secretary general of the ruling
Kuomintang, said on Friday that there is no conflict between
identifying yourself as Taiwanese and being a national of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was born in mainland China and brought up in Taiwan,
said he believes that most Taiwanese would not deny they are ROC
nationals.</P>
      <P>A survey made public earlier this week by the cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council showed that more than 37 percent of those
interviewed described themselves as "Taiwanese," a figure that for
the first time surpassed the percentage of those who said they are
both "Taiwanese and Chinese" in previous similar polls.</P>
      <P>"Our country is the Republic of China," Chang said, adding that
anyone who identifies with this place can say he is Taiwanese. There
is no conflict between being Taiwanese and an ROC national, he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that when those interviewed in the survey were asked
if they think of themselves as "Chinese," this could have made them
think "mainland Chinese," which he said might be the reason why the
number of people calling themselves Chinese was low in the poll.</P>
      <P>Those who said they are Taiwanese would not deny that they are
also ROC nationals, Chang said, adding, "If you refuse to possess an
ROC passport, how could you travel around the world?"</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to a proposal by a ranking
official of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) that Taiwan provide a US$10
billion loan to help South Korea overcome its financial crisis, an
official with the cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said on Friday that financial assistance by an
individual country is inappropriate and that such acts should be
conducted through regional aid-providing mechanisms.</P>
      <P>M.F. Yeh, director of the Economic Research Department under the
CEPD, said international assistance to South Korea would be better
made through regional mechanisms and that the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) should consider accelerating the pace of its allocation of
relief funds to that county if its first batch of US$57 billion is
insufficient.</P>
      <P>In addition to the IMF, other regional organizations such as the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and the Asian Development
Bank should also offer to help South Korea cope with its financial
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Yeh's remarks came after Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the KMT's
Business Management Committee, said on Thursday that the financial
turbulence in South Korea is far more serious than what Taiwan has
perceived and that Taiwan should take the initiative by providing a
loan of US$10 billion to help South Korea recover from the current
financial disaster.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan made such a move, Liu said, it might lead Japan to
provide another loan of US$30-40 billion, which, coupled with the
IMF's US$57 billion, would be enough for South Korea to control the
situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>111 NEW HIV CASES IN LAST 90 DAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 111 new HIV cases were reported in
Taiwan in the past three months, bringing the total number of those
on the island infected with the virus that leads to AIDS to 1,654,
the Department of Health (DOH) said Friday.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said that among the new cases reported since
statistics were last compiled on Sept. 10, 105 are local people,
while six are expatriates, including one student, a Thai woman, two
tourists, a worker and a foreign bride. By gender, 98 are males,
while 13 are females.</P>
      <P>The officials said that though the island's total number of
patients under 18 years old who are HIV-positive is not so large as
in other nations, the fact that 62 percent of this group became
infected through sexual behavior is alarming.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that Taiwan has so far had 33 HIV-positive people
under 18, five of whom have died. Twelve of the 33 are 12 years old
or younger, most of them hemophiliacs, while the remaining 21
contracted the virus from sexual behavior.</P>
      <P>DOH officials also expressed worries about the rising number of
HIV-positive women, noting the ratio between men and women patients
was 19 to 1 in 1992, but that it is now at to 9 to 1.</P>
      <P>Infections between spouses have also risen sharply. Although only
one baby could be confirmed to be infected with HIV, the officials
said the actual number is likely higher.</P>
      <P>They noted that the theme of World AIDS Day is to keep children
from the shadow of AIDS. Though people 18 or younger who are
HIV-positive account for only about 2 percent of the total number of
those with the deadly virus here, that ratio has been increasing
steadily as a result of insufficient sex education among youngsters,
they said.</P>
      <P>First lady Tseng Wen-hui said on the same occasion that 99
percent of child AIDS sufferers contracted the disease from their
mothers. She lauded the Republic of China's ally El Salvador, noting
that even though that country does not have the economic might of the
ROC, it has a shelter for young AIDS sufferers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang, who sought out survivors and scoured archives, wrote the
newly published book, "The Rape of Nanking: the Forgotten Holocaust
of World War II."</P>
      <P>She suggests that "the custodian of the curtain of silence was
politics." Civil war engulfed China after Japan surrendered in 1945,
and neither the Nationalist nor the Communist Chinese government
pressed for reparations the way Israel did from Germany, the CP
noted.</P>
      <P>The United States, eager to have Japan on side against communism,
refrained from pushing the issue, Chang writes.</P>
      <P>Right-wing leaders in Japan have called the Nanking massacre an
exaggeration, a lie. But there are also Japanese who vigorously block
attempts to rewrite history.</P>
      <P>After a 32-year court battle, historian Saburo Ienaga, 84, won a
partial victory in August against the Japanese Education Ministry
which ordered him to revise or delete references to atrocities in a
textbook he wrote.</P>
      <P>Japan's Supreme Court ruled that the ministry acted illegally in
censoring his mention of the death camp and human experiments run by
a Japanese biological warfare unit in occupied northeastern China.</P>
      <P>But the court upheld the ministry's authority to screen textbooks
and an order that Ienaga remove a reference to rape in a passage that
reads:</P>
      <P>"When the Japanese army occupied Nanking, they murdered large
numbers of Chinese soldiers and civilians, and many of the Japanese
officers and soldiers raped Chinese women."</P>
      <P>The ministry's rationale: troops everywhere rape women during war

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE CANADIANS REMEMBER RAPE OF NANKING  (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  11  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sixty years ago this weekend a fate so
horrific befell the Chinese city of Nanking that its aftershocks are
still being felt today, the Canadian Press (CP) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 13, 1937, after a final night of battles under clear
skies and a half moon, Imperial Japanese troops poured into Nanking,
China's capital at the time, the CP said in a dispatch from Toronto.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing six weeks, the Japanese invaders unleashed a
bloodbath that became known as the "Rape of Nanking," said the
report.</P>
      <P>Unarmed inhabitants were slaughtered en masse throughout the
walled city. The women were raped, humiliated and butchered. Corpses
lined the meandering banks of the Yangtze River and filled ponds and
trenches, the CP said.</P>
      <P>The city now called Nanjing, 300 kilometers west of Shanghai,
will sound its air raid sirens Saturday and observe three minutes of
silence, it said.</P>
      <P>In Canada, it pointed out, Chinese communities from Vancouver to
Toronto and elsewhere grapple with the question: To remember or not
to remember?</P>
      <P>Those who believe remembrance will collar the capacity for evil
so often unleashed by war are marking the anniversary while trying to
curb any anti-Japanese sentiments.</P>
      <P>"When we organize activities of this type we are always mindful
about harmony between our two communities," the CP quoted Dr. Joseph
Y.K. Wong, a family physician coordinating a commemorative peace
concert in Toronto.</P>
      <P>"We always remind the Chinese community that we are doing this
not because of hatred," Wong was quoted. "This is done because we
don't want this horrendous part of history to happen again."</P>
      <P>Canada's ethnic Japanese say that they, as Canadians, had nothing
to do with Japan's wartime behavior and in fact suffered from it.</P>
      <P>The National Association of Japanese Canadians joined three other
groups last month in petitioning Japan to apologize for war crimes.</P>
      <P>It shows that concern for human rights "transcends cultural
boundaries," association president Randy Enomoto said from Vancouver.</P>
      <P>"We're proud of our cultural identity too, but that does not
extend to war crimes which happened in the 1930s and '40s," Enomoto
said.</P>
      <P>The Nanking death toll remains a highly charged controversy. Many
estimates put it between 200,000 and 300,000, though arguments that
it should be far higher or much lower are fervently put forth,
according to the CP.</P>
      <P>But survivors, witnesses, film, photographs and confessions by

    <HEADLINE>CPC ANNOUNCES 2.94 PERCENT PETROLEUM PRICE HIKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
on Friday announced a petroleum price hike of 2.94 percent to help
offset losses caused by the ongoing devaluation of the Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>CPC Vice President Tsai San-lung said that from Friday midnight,
gasoline prices will rise by NT$0.4 (US$0.012) per liter, while
diesel prices will increase by NT$0.3 per liter and fuel oil by
NT$172 per kiloliter.</P>
      <P>This is the third time the CPC has raised petroleum prices this
year, following two increases in January and April.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to ease public concerns over inflation pressure
imposed by the price hike, Tsai said that the increase will only push
up the consumer price index by 0.126 percent and the wholesale price
index by 0.155 percent.</P>
      <P>He said the price increase was based on the exchange rate of
NT$29.5 to the US dollar and the international crude oil price of
US$16.992 per barrel. If these figures can be maintained until the
CPC adopts a floating petroleum price policy, scheduled for January
at the earliest, the CPC will not consider raising petroleum prices
again, he added.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said that it is within the
CPC's power to raise petroleum prices by up to 3 percent and that he
has approved the increase. As it is not high enough to reflect the
increased cost of purchasing imported crude oil, the CPC is expected
to fall short of its targeted surplus by nearly NT$10 billion for
fiscal 1998, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Based on a foreign exchange rate of NT$31.93 to the US dollar and
an international crude oil price of US$18.27 per barrel, the CPC will
incur an additional NT$22 billion in purchasing costs over the next
seven months. With a nearly 3 percent increase, sales revenue will
only increase by NT$5.2 billion during the seven-month period.</P>
      <P>The CPC's targeted surplus for fiscal 1998 was set at NT$22
billion. With a NT$7 billion surplus gained between July and October,
the CPC is still expected to fall short of its targeted surplus by
nearly NT$10 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO MORE FRIGATES TO ENTER NAVAL SERVICE</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Navy of the Republic of China will
see its defensive capabilities further upgraded with the addition of
two more advanced types of frigates which are to be commissioned on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two frigates, called "Panchao" and "Wuchang," will be put
into service immediately after being commissioned by the navy.</P>
      <P>The "Panchao," which has been delivered by the China Shipping
Corp. (CSBC) to the Tsoying naval base in southern Taiwan, is the
sixth of a series of the Perry-class frigates which the CSBC began
building for the Navy in 1994.</P>
      <P>The "Panchao" high-speed patrol frigate, modeled on the US-made
Perry-class frigate, is equipped with its original weapons system and
two US-made S-70C anti-submarine helicopters, as well as 40 mm and 76
mm guns and locally made Hsiung Fung II anti-ship missiles.</P>
      <P>The powerful CSBC-built Perry-class frigates now form the
backbone of the ROC fleet, effectively upgrading its
three-dimensional air-defense, anti-ship and anti-submarine
capabilities.</P>
      <P>The "Wuchang," the fifth of six Lafayette-class frigates which
the ROC has ordered from France, is also equipped with powerful
weapons and anti-submarine systems.</P>
      <P>The Lafayette-class frigates, whose unique design and
construction render them invisible to radar, are currently owned only
by France, the ROC and Saudi Arabia.</P>
      <P>The "Wuchang" arrived at the Tsoying naval base on Monday after a
voyage from France which lasted for more than 40 days.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and South Africa have concluded
annual fishing cooperation consultations in Capetown, in which the
South African authorities agreed that the annual fishing fee for each
Taiwan vessel operating in their territorial waters will remain
unchanged next year, according to the Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>COA officials said the Taiwan delegation at the negotiations was
headed by Kuo Chin-lau, deputy director of the council's fisheries
department, while South Africa was represented by its own fisheries
officials.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, 26 Taiwan fishing boats will be
allowed to fish in South African territorial waters next year, with
the annual fee for each vessel set at US$11,500.</P>
      <P>The COA officials said that due to heavy pressure from its local
fishermen's groups, the South African delegation had intended to
reduce the quota of Taiwan fishing vessels to 20, but great efforts
on the part of the Taiwan delegation had persuaded the South Africans
to agree to a quota of 26.</P>
      <P>The agreement also stated that the quota for swordfish be raised
from 55 to 70 metric tons, while the quota for tuna be reduced from
2,200 to 2,000 metric tons.</P>

      <P>Although the bank deposit shared by
President Lee Teng-hui and his wife has increased by some NT$13
million (US$406,200), their assets are otherwise almost the same as
one year ago, according to documents Lee and his wife have filed with
the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Most of the increase comes from Lee's salary and interest on the
couple's bank deposit. Lee has NT$350,000 (US$10,937) in a personal
account, in addition to a golf club membership card. He also shares
two golf club memberships with his wife Tseng Wen-hui, while she
personally owns four cards.</P>
      <P>Golf club cards are valuable assets in Taiwan, some of which can
fetch millions of NT dollars on the market.</P>
      <P>The Lees have the same number of cards as last year.</P>
      <P>Tseng included a sapphire with a street value of NT$850,000

1,200,000, which were valued on Friday at NT$58.5 per share.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew, who took office on Sept. 1,
submitted a list of assets including a bank deposit -- some of which

members registered an accumulated bank deposit of NT$6 million. This
total is about NT1.2 million more than one year ago, when Siew was

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) plan to ship low-grade radioactive waste to North Korea is
"impractical," said former chancellor of the University of California
at Berkeley, Tien Chang-ling, on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tien said it would be better to store the waste somewhere within
the nation's own borders, at least for the next twenty years.</P>
      <P>Tien, now a technology advisor to the Executive Yuan, made the
remarks in a written statement at an Executive Yuan technology
advisory meeting held at the Civil Aeronautics Administration.</P>
      <P>The meeting was presided over by Premier Vincent Siew and Vice
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>Tien said that although it is an attractive and technically
feasible proposition to ship radioactive waste overseas, it is not a
"practical" idea, considering Taiwan's sensitive position in the
international community.</P>
      <P>He stressed that for the next two decades, it would be better to
store low-level nuclear waste on the island while continuing to
search for long-term storage and disposal sites, whether here or
overseas.</P>
      <P>Taipower and North Korea signed a contract last year allowing the
company to ship up to 60,000 barrels of low-grade radioactive waste
to North Korea for permanent disposal. The plan has drawn a storm of
protest from South Korea and environmental activists from other
countries.</P>

      <P>Several Republic of China trade officials
are scheduled to leave for the United States on Saturday to attend

for joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, director general of the ROC Board of Foreign

technical issues will be the major topics of the meeting, which is to
open in Washington on Monday.</P>
      <P>Differences between the two sides concerning policy reforms, such
as Washington's demand for Taiwan's easing of quota restrictions on
American tobacco and alcohol, pork, chicken, rice, and offal, as well
as proper tariff management, will be excluded from the upcoming

resolved.</P>
      <P>ROC-US WTO bilateral talks are entering their final stages,
although the most complex problems have still to be worked out, the

government purchases, tariff and quota management, along with
agricultural matters, will be included in Monday's agenda.</P>

world market share of 8 percent by that time, Tung said Taiwan is
actively bidding to join the organization.</P>

      <P>The Foreign Affairs Ministry on Saturday
said that Republic of China Ambassador Loh I-chen, who was scheduled
to leave Pretoria for home on Friday, will remain in his post for a
little longer to "take care of important administrative affairs."</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesman Roy Y.Y. Wu denied that Loh
has postponed his return because there has been some change in the
framework of future relations between the ROC and South Africa.</P>
      <P>South African President Nelson Mandela announced Nov. 27, 1996
that Pretoria will shift its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing from Jan. 1, 1998. Since then, negotiations have been held
between officials of the two nations to develop a framework for
future relations.</P>
      <P>Quoting diplomatic sources in Pretoria, a CNA dispatch from
Johannesburg reported on Wednesday that after several rounds of
negotiations, Taipei and Pretoria have finally reached an agreement
on their future ties, and that a formal accord will be signed by the
foreign ministers of the two nations in the near future.</P>
      <P>Under the new framework, the ROC embassy Pretoria and its
consulates general in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban will
continue to operate, but under different titles, while ROC personnel
stationed in South Africa will continue to enjoy diplomatic immunity
and other privileges.</P>
      <P>"Since diplomatic negotiations involve many factors, a
comprehensive agreement may only be reached at the last moment," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>As to whether Taipei will take the initiative and cut official
ties with Pretoria before South Africa and mainland China sign the
communique establishing diplomatic links on Dec. 28, Wu said he
doesn't have any information about this, adding that the matter has
to be decided by the "highest government authorities."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S CURRENCY EXPECTED TO DEPRECIATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Dec. 13, (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The value of the renminbi, the currency
of mainland China, will remain stable for the next couple of months,
but is expected to depreciate by 5 percent in the latter half of
1998, according to the latest economic report published by the
Solomon Brothers Securities Corp. of the United States.</P>
      <P>A decrease in mainland China's exports, an increase in imports
and reduced foreign investments are all listed as factors which will
affect the depreciation, the report said.</P>
      <P>The economic report also forecast that mainland China's GDP in
1998 will be 8 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang is
calling for a meeting with economists and entrepreneurs next week for
discussions on possible repercussions from South Korea's currency
turmoil and a latent financial crisis in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports have said that some 26 security
firms in mainland China may be closed in the face of new financial
instability.</P>
      <P>With nearly 20,000 local companies maintaining operations on the
mainland worth over US$20 billion, Taiwan should watch out for any
possible change on the mainland to avoid being affected by any crisis
which might arise there, Wang noted, pointing out, however, that
should the mainland become embroiled in an economic upheaval, Taiwan
will find it difficult to remain unscathed.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the financial crisis in Northeast Asia is now
being seen as the key "uncertainty" factor in deciding Taiwan's
domestic economic development for next year.</P>
      <P>He stressed that it is critically important for Taiwan to fully
understand the situation and work out contingency plans to counter
any possible spread of the financial crisis affecting most of Asia.</P>
      <P>The regional turmoil which began in Thailand in July, as a result
of the Thai government's de facto devaluation of the Thai baht, has
forced Thailand's economic growth estimates down to 1.5 percent in
1997 from 1996's 6.4 percent. The economies of Malaysia, Indonesia
and the Philippines have also taken a battering.</P>
      <P>In South Korea, the Korean won has continued to dive in the wake
of a loss of confidence which has snowballed. The amount of bad debts
has skyrocketed to 2.6 trillion won and stock markets have plummeted,
while many of the 26 leading enterprises in the country have closed
down or announced widespread layoffs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has fared well over the last several months by comparison,
despite the fact that the Taiwan currency has depreciated by 15
percent. Taiwan's economy posted an enviable growth of 6.93 percent
in the third quarter of this year, marking a single-quarter high
since the fourth quarter of 1994. It is estimated that the annual
growth for 1997 will top at least 6.72 percent.</P>
      <P>For 1998, however, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is not so
optimistic, on the grounds that many Southeast Asian countries will
sink further into the economic morass, while the fate of the Korean
and mainland Chinese economies will also remain uncertain, Wang
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE PIPS HONG KONG AT TOP BUSINESS LOCATION IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has toppled Hong Kong as the
best place in Asia to do business over the next five years, according
to the London-based Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU).</P>
      <P>In a new 16-country study measuring business operating costs,
both Singapore and New Zealand climbed a rung higher to overhaul Hong
Kong and clinch the top two spots.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, ranked sixth in the previous 1992-96 study, dropped one
notch to seventh position in the EIU's new 1997-2001 ranking.</P>
      <P>EIU spokesman and Business Asia editor Adam Aston was quoted as
saying: "Hong Kong's fall in rank is not the result of any dramatic
change in 1997. Strong growth, low taxes, property rights and free
trade will remain in place."</P>
      <P>He said the risk was that mainland China might not honor its
promise to maintain Hong Kong's freedoms and government intervention
was likely to become more widespread.</P>
      <P>"In contrast, Singapore is predicted to retain its standing for
the next five years with further improvements pushing up its absolute
score on the index," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The EIU study predicts that mainland China's business environment
will improve slightly over the next five years.</P>
      <P>The mainland remained on the 14th place in the new ranking.</P>
      <P>Beijing will continue to encourage foreign investment while
trying to protect domestic industries from competition, the EIU said.</P>
      <P>It added that political risks would mar the outlook for
businesses in the Chinese mainland despite continuing efforts to
reform and liberalize the system gradually. This was also the case
for countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Australia was ranked fourth, followed by Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan,
South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka,
mainland China, Vietnam and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>The ranking is based on a comprehensive set of variables
including political, macroeconomic, and foreign investment
environments, market opportunities, government policies towards
private enterprise and competition, trade and foreign exchange
regimes, taxes, financing, labor markets and infrastructure.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bank of Canada raised its trend-setting
rate to 4.5 percent from 4.0 percent as the Canadian dollar came
under pressure on international markets Friday.</P>
      <P>"Volatility in international financial markets, tied to events in
Asia, has continued to affect Canadian markets," the central bank
said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"This action by the bank is designed to contribute to more
settled domestic markets in which investors can focus more
confidently on the strong fundamentals favoring noninflationary
growth in the Canadian economy," it added.</P>
      <P>All major banks announced that their prime lending rate would
move to 6.0 percent from 5.5 percent effective Monday. Prime rate is
the rate the banks use when dealing with their best corporate
customers.</P>
      <P>Two major commercial banks, the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce and the Royal Bank of Canada, did not wait for the central
bank to move up its rate. The two hiked their mortgage rates by 20 to
35 basis points Thursday for one- to seven-year loans. A basis point
is 1/100th of a percentage point.</P>
      <P>The Canadian dollar has been under pressure on world markets for
several weeks. It opened at 70.18 US cents Friday, up 0.10 US cents
from Thursday's close.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC TURMOIL SET TO DOMINATE ASEAN SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's economic turmoil will dominate
the talks at the informal ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur on Monday,
when ASEAN leaders will also meet their counterparts from mainland
China, Japan and South Korea in a historic conference of Asian
leaders.</P>
      <P>This was to have been a celebratory summit to commemorate ASEAN's
30th anniversary and its expansion to include Laos and Myanmar in the
grouping last July.</P>
      <P>But the financial crunch precipitated by falling currencies and
stocks in the Asian tiger economies has taken the fizz out of the
event, Singapore-based newspaper The Straits Times reported Friday in
a dispatch from Kuala Lumpur.</P>
      <P>Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea -- all recipients of huge
bailout packages sanctioned by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
-- and Malaysia have just begun implementing austerity measures that
will slow down Asia's economic growth in the next few years.</P>
      <P>This summit of ASEAN and East Asian leaders will instead be an
occasion for them to rethink their economic strategies and seek new
ways to overcome their difficulties.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin is expected to restate
Beijing's willingness to foster closer economic and political ties
with ASEAN, the report said.</P>
      <P>For strategic and political reasons, Chinese leaders are keen to
deepen the relationship and this will be explored in the
ASEAN-Chinese mainland talks on Tuesday, it added.</P>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has said that ASEAN's
greatest challenge is how to meet the growing economic competition
posed by a rising mainland China, it said.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's meeting could give shape to what Chinese officials have
called a "partnership of good neighborliness and mutual trust" for
the new century, it noted.</P>
      <P>Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had earlier this year
called for an annual summit between Japan and ASEAN, as well as
bilateral security talks with Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Dubbed in some quarters as the Hashimoto doctrine, it envisages a
leading role for Japan in Asian affairs. This concept has yet to be
explored in detail, said the report.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's President Suharto yesterday canceled plans to join
the summit on doctors' advice. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas will
represent him at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Outgoing South Korean President Kim Young-sam will also not
attend the meeting, as South Koreans are going to the polls on Dec.
18 to elect a new leader. He will be represented by Prime Minister
Koh Kun.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN-East Asia summit will be watched closely by Western
countries, notably the United States.</P>
      <P>Washington opposes the formation of an East Asian Economic
Caucus, an idea conceived by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, who
is chairing the conference, the report noted.</P>
      <P>But Japan and South Korea also demur at the thought of a
pan-Asian grouping opposed by the United States, their staunch ally.</P>
      <P>This is why the gathering is called the ASEAN-9 Plus Three
summit. In any case, it is not certain whether this will become an
annual event, the newspaper said.</P>
      <P>On regional security, the main issues are likely to be Cambodia
and the competing claims in the Spratly Islands.</P>
      <P>The latter is an issue which could cause armed conflict between
claimant ASEAN countries and mainland China.</P>
      <P>ASEAN members, notably Vietnam and the Philippines, want Beijing
to freeze its activities in the South China Sea and reaffirm the
non-use of force to settle the rival territorial claims in the
potentially mineral-rich Spratly atolls.</P>
      <P>On Cambodia, ASEAN's primary consideration is that there should
be free and fair elections next year before it can become an ASEAN
member, the report said.</P>
      <P>Cambodia's membership, which has been postponed indefinitely,
will realize ASEAN founding fathers' vision of uniting all 10
Southeast Asian countries in a single entity.</P>
      <P>ASEAN leaders will also endorse the Vision 2020 statement to
chart the grouping's future direction, the report said.</P>
      <P>On the summit sidelines, Prime Minister Goh will have bilateral
meetings with Vietnam's Pham Van Khai, Myanmar's Gen. Than Shwe and
mainland China's Jiang, it said.</P>
      <P>He will also meet United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
who will be in Kuala Lumpur as Malaysia's guest, it added.</P>

      <P>Indonesia's national carrier Garuda has
set up a cargo cooperation agreement with four foreign airlines,
including Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL).</P>
      <P>A Garuda spokesman said that the agreement's objective is to

agreement, Garuda gets a cargo capacity allocation of 35 tons using
MD-11 and A-300 freighters owned by Korean Air every Monday and
Thursday serving the Batam-Jakarta-Seoul route," the spokesman was
quoted by the Indonesia Times as saying, while the agreement with
China Airlines allows Garuda an allocation of 20 tons in CAL's A-300
freighters every Monday on the Jakarta-Taipei-Los Angeles route.</P>
      <P>Similar deals have also been set up with a French and a Dutch

    <HEADLINE>FAMILY DOCTOR ATTRIBUTES LIEN CHAN'S GOOD HEALTH TO GOOD HABITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A wine connoisseur, he doesn't drink during
daytime and knows when to stop. He doesn't smoke, works out a lot,
and follows healthy dietary rules.</P>
      <P>That, says Lien Chan's family doctor Wang Cheng-yi, is how the
vice president has retained his energy levels over the past years,
even during times of stress.</P>
      <P>In a new book by Dr. Wang, he attributes Lien's good health to
his "moral culture." A considerate person with a mild disposition,
Lien plays by the rules and is never slow to show his appreciation
for others.</P>
      <P>Dr. Wang, concurrently vice president of the National Taiwan
University Hospital, who himself had long wondered why Lien is so
energetic and high-spirited, got his answer while serving as Lien's
personal physician and accompanying him on several overseas trips
over the last few years.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Lien loves fish and believes that eating fish does
not lead to weight-gain. Possessed of a good appetite at all times,
Lien always empties his dishes and hates to waste food. He's also a
balanced eater -- consuming a larger amount of vegetables and fruit
than meat, the doctor noted.</P>
      <P>A wine connoisseur, Lien has a keen appreciation for the grape.
However, he doesn't drink much, and never during the day, Wang said.
Citing Lien's drinking philosophy -- "to be a good drinker, but never
to get drunk" -- Wang said Lien knows when to stop with regard to
alcohol.</P>
      <P>People may not know that besides golfing, Lien maintains the
habit of walking 10,000 steps each day, which is another possible
source of his energy, Wang pointed out.</P>
      <P>He swims too -- about 30 minutes at a time during weeknights --
and that allows him to enjoy good-quality sleep, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The doctor also lauded Lien's respect for "the men who know."
Particularly with regard to the health and medical fields, Lien
respects the experts, listens to their opinions and follows their
instructions, and that's another reason for his success in
maintaining good health, Wang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KEEPING STATUS QUO REMAINS MAINSTREAM OPINION: MAC POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 80 percent of the people on
Taiwan favor keeping the status quo for the time being, prior to
either eventual unification with the Chinese mainland or a
declaration of independence, according to a poll conducted by the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Results of the poll were published on Friday by the MAC, a formal
administrative agency under supervision of the Republic of China
premier. It was revealed that, with regard to the situation across
the Taiwan Strait, maintaining the current state of relations between
the two sides is still the mainstream opinion among local people.</P>
      <P>The poll indicates that those who advocate either quick
unification with or separation from the mainland account for no more
than 20 percent of the population. Hence the landslide victory of the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party in the recent local
elections is by no means an indication that the strength of the
independence faction is gaining ground, the MAC stressed.</P>
      <P>Changing attitudes about the national identification of people in
Taiwan are also noteworthy. Those who consider themselves as
"Taiwanese" account for 36.9 percent, which is the highest level ever
indicated in such polls. It is the first time that number surpassed
the percentage of those who identify themselves as "Taiwanese and
Chinese at the same time," which stood at 34.8 percent. It is also
far more than the number of island residents who identify themselves
as "Chinese," which accounted for 23.1 percent of those surveyed, the
MAC officials said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will attempt to recruit more
professional talent in the science and technology fields from both at
home and abroad, hoping to establish and staff world-class research
institutes within five years, Premier Vincent Siew said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a ceremony marking the conclusion of the 18th annual
meeting of the Cabinet's science and technology advisory group, Siew
said one of the top concerns in Taiwan's sci-tech development is how
to maintain a steady input of sci-tech resources.</P>
      <P>Another key concern is how to integrate existing resources from
the academic, industrial and governmental sectors so as to acquire
top-notch sci-tech manpower and key technologies -- the two necessary
factors for raising Taiwan's international competitiveness, Siew
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew noted that all the suggestions and proposals
presented by the 14 overseas advisors during the six-day meeting will
be adopted as important points for revising the ROC government's
sci-tech white paper compiled last year, the first of its kind.</P>

      <P>Mainland Chinese advertising in Taiwan
should be regulated by law, counselors to the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said unanimously at a meeting Saturday.</P>
      <P>They said that mainland Chinese advertisements have often appeared
in Taiwan's news media, and that most of them contain Communist

      <P>He pointed out a recent advertisement in a Taiwan evening
newspaper as an example. The headline of the ad reads, "Tong Yang
City that Vigorously March Towards the 21st Century." There are two
pictures of Communist officials in the ad. In addition to messages
of investment opportunities in the city, the copy of the ad
highlighted the "political achievements" made by Communist China in
modernizing the city.</P>
      <P>He said the counselors worried that mainland Chinese authorities

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking Republic of China economics
official on Saturday departed for France to promote a joint project
involving the manufacture of parts and components for Mirage
jetfighters, one of the world's most advanced combat aircraft.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming, who is leading a
delegation to make inquiries regarding the project, revealed that his
group will also seek opportunities to join France in a highly
sought-after deal to develop jumbo passenger aircraft.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Economics Affairs (MOEA), in the
wake of the ROC's purchase of 60 French-built Mirage 2000
jetfighters, the government hopes to forge broader cooperative
relations with France in producing parts and components as well as
engines for the aircraft.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOEA said, after South Korea's withdrawal from
an international project guided by Airbus Industrie to produce A3XX
jumbo jets in the wake of its recent economic woes, the ROC will seek
to fill the vacancy by teaming up with France's Latecoere, the
world's third largest fuselage maker, to produce fuselages for the
A3XX airplanes.</P>
      <P>The 600-seat ASXX, which enjoys the largest passenger capacity in
the world, is expected to be flying by the year 2003.</P>
      <P>Yin told the CNA that his France trip is also aimed at finding

    <HEADLINE>DIRECTOR PAI CHING-JUI DIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Film director Pai Ching-jui, famous for his
productions in the 1970s and '80s, died of heart failure Friday
night. He was 66.</P>
      <P>Pai was meeting friends in a hotel when he suddenly collapsed. He
was rushed to the Cathay General Hospital in a comatose state and
showed no vital signs despite emergency treatment. He was pronounced
dead at 11:23 p.m.</P>
      <P>Pai had worked as a reporter, and studied painting and stage
design in Rome. After learning to make films in Italy, he returned to
Taiwan to join the Central Motion Picture Corp.</P>
      <P>Veteran film critic Huang Jen noted that Pai was the first
director from Chinese cinematic circles, in either Taiwan, Hong Kong
or mainland China, to study filmmaking in Italy, the mecca of the new
wave realism genre. He is credited with introducing the realistic and
wholesome style that had swept the whole world to the Taiwan movie
scene.</P>
      <P>He also brought with him modern editing equipment from overseas,
which contributed significantly to upgrading the technical quality of
Taiwan-produced pictures.</P>
      <P>Pai helped elevate numerous actors and actresses who worked with
him to stardom, including Ke Chun-hsiung, Kuei Ya-lei, Tang Pao-yun,
and Josephine Siao.</P>
      <P>In 1968 and 1969, he won consecutive honors for best director at
the Golden Horse Awards, the Taiwan equivalent of the Oscars, for his
work in "Lonely Seventeen," and "The Bride and I."</P>
      <P>Some of Pai's other most famous films include "Coldest Winter in
Peking," "Home Sweet Home," "Girlfriend."</P>
      <P>He also collaborated with directors Lee Han-hsiang, Hu
King-chuan, and Lee Hsing to produce "Happiness, Anger, Sorrow and
Joy," a film composed of four separate segments.</P>
      <P>Pai became the third member of that group to depart the Taiwan
movie scene within the past year, with all three succumbing to heart
problems. Lee Han-hsiang was in Beijing filming the epic story of the
razing of Ahfang Palace when he suffered a heart attack last Dec. 17.
Hu died while undergoing coronary bypass surgery on Jan. 14.</P>
      <P>The Golden Horse Awards ceremony is scheduled to be held at Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall Saturday night during which a lifetime
achievement award will be conferred on Lee and Hu. After learning of
the unexpected passing of Pai, the Actors Guild said it will solicit
the same honor for Pai.</P>
      <P>A retrospective of Pai's films has been planned for January, film
industry officials said.</P>
      <P>The short and stocky Pai has been known for his romantic affairs.
His present wife Chang Hwa, a mainland actress 38 years his junior,
received approval to live in Taiwan only two years ago. The pair met
when Pai was filming in the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NANKING HOLOCAUST OBSERVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sixty years ago on Dec. 13, invading
Japanese troops poured into Nanking, then the capital of China,
unleashing a bloodbath unprecedented in the contemporary history of
mankind.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing six weeks, more than 300,000 Chinese, mostly
unarmed civilians, were slaughtered en mass after being tortured and
mutilated.</P>
      <P>The New Tungmenghui, a pro-unification political organization
headed by Hsu Li-lung, former chief of the Cabinet-level Vocational
Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen, held a photo exhibition
on the "Rape of Nanking" to remind people of the atrocities committed
by the Japanese Imperial Army 60 years ago.</P>
      <P>On display at the exhibition, held at the Dr. Sun Yat-sen
Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei, were 80 photos showing Chinese
civilians being buried alive, or being used for bayonet practice by
Japanese soldiers.</P>
      <P>Others showed naked Chinese women photographed with their
Japanese rapists or, even worse, old women being sexually abused
after they were raped.</P>
      <P>Several photos depicted corpses lining the meandering banks of
the Yangtze River and filling ponds and trenches.</P>
      <P>Others bore witness to the horrific human experiments conducted
by the Japanese "731 biological warfare unit," the so-called "comfort
women" -- Chinese women forced to become sex slaves for Japanese
soldiers, and the killing of Taiwanese by their conquerors.</P>
      <P>Hsu said more than 30 million Chinese were killed during Japanese
invasion. "We cannot forget the history although we can afford to not
seek revenge," Hsu added.</P>
      <P>"We could again fall victim to Japanese invaders simply by
forgetting the lessons of history," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, hundreds of local residents gathered in the morning in
front of the Taipei office of the Japan Interchange Association --
Tokyo's de facto embassy here, to protest against the crimes
committed 60 years ago. They pelted the office building with eggs to
vent their anger.</P>
      <P>Also in Nanking (Nanjing), air raid siren was sounded and three
minutes of silence were observed by the five million citizens of the
city, 300 kilometers west of Shanghai, to remember the holocaust,
according to foreign wire service reports.</P>
      <P>Similar activities were also held in United States, Canada,
Singapore, Australia and Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO DISPOSE OF NUCLEAR WASTE BY ITSELF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-hsiuan said Saturday
that Taiwan shall find out how to dispose of low-radioactive nuclear
waste by itself.</P>
      <P>Tien Chang-ling, technological adviser to the Executive Yuan,
said in a study report issued Saturday that it is not feasible to
ship Taiwan's nuclear waste overseas for disposal under the
current situation.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Power Company signed a contract with North Korea last
year for disposal of its nuclear waste from nuclear power
plants. South Korea has strongly protested against the arrangement.</P>
      <P>Tien, who is former chancellor of the University of California
at Berkeley, recommended to store the low-radioactive nuclear waste
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to Tien's recommendation, Liu said the Atomic Energy
Council of the Executive Yuan and some other relevant government
agencies shall work together to find out how to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>"The problem shall be solved by ourselves," he said.

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec. 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Conflicts between employers and employees
in Fujian Province in southeast China mainland are increasing,
the "Chinese Youth" newspaper reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The central organ publication of the Communist Youth League also
reported that the conflicts have resulted in two cases of arson,
killing more than 30 people in Jinjiang City in the last three
months.</P>
      <P>The report quoted local officials as saying that employers'
failure to pay wages on time have caused many conflicts, and that
workers may resort to arson and other violent actions to vent their
anger.</P>
      <P>Workers at a sports goods factory owned by a Taiwan investor in
Fuzhou City went on strike recently because the employer announced to
lower their wages in November and some of the female workers who
joined in the strike have been fired, the report said.</P>
      <P>Workers in the city have said that if employers ignore the newly
enacted "Labor Law," arson attacks will be unavoidable.
 The report also said that in the first 11 months of this
year 18 employers in Quanzhou City have escaped without paying the
wages they owed. They included six Taiwan investors, 7 foreign
companies, and 4 mainland Chinese private enterprises.</P>
      <P>The report quoted local officials as saying that local
authorities hesitate to enforce the labor law for fear of
scaring away foreign investors, and that under such circumstances,
arson attacks, such as those happened recently in Mawei and Jinjing,
will occur in other places.

      <P>Two separate accidents killed at least
eight persons and injured 14 others in the southern Taiwan county of
Kaohsiung on Saturday, police said.</P>
      <P>Seven workers died and 12 suffered injuries at a construction

      <P>Meanwhile, a gas explosion at the Talin Refinery Plant of the
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), killed one and injured two others.</P>
      <P>This was third major accidents for the refinery in five years. A
similar explosion in 1993 prompted a large-scale protest by residents
around the plant. A leakage of crude oil at Kaohsiung port in 1996
triggered another waves of protest by residents. As a result, the
accidents-stricken CPC has to pay over NT$600 million (US$19 million)
in compensations to residents.</P>
      <P>The injured from the two accidents were rushed to nearby

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian said on
Sunday that he is not considering to run for the chairmanship of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and that the top priority for him
now is to administrate the city well.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after attending the opening ceremony of an
athletic competition of mentally retarded children held at the
Chieshou Junior High School.</P>
      <P>As to the disputes sparked within the DPP over the remarks made
recently in the United States by DPP Chairman Hsu Shin-liang and Sisy
Chen, director of the DPP's Propaganda Department, related to the
issues of Taiwan independence and an investment plan by the German
Bayer Group in central Taiwan, Chen said it is very normal that there
are different opinions within a democratic political party and that
there is no need for outsiders to make a tempest in a teapot.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the most important thing for him at present is to
run Taipei City and that he has no time for "daydreaming" about the
DPP chairmanship, adding that the idea to run for the post "has never
come to mind."</P>
      <P>He stressed the DPP is as unified as ever and he is confident it
will become Taiwan's ruling party early in the next century.</P>
      <P>Chen revealed that he will call a meeting on Monday to report his
"Taipei experience" to other DPP-affiliated city mayors and county
chiefs and exchange opinions with them on issues to help upgrade
administrative efficiency and the living quality of the people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An 18-member group composed of Republic of
China National Assembly (NA) deputies arrived here Saturday on a
transit stop en route to Taipei after concluding a two-week visit to
Burkina Faso and Senegal.</P>
      <P>The nonpartisan group, led by National Assembly Speaker Fredrick
Chien of the ruling Kuomintang, was the first mission of its kind
ever to visit African countries as a means of paving the way for a
planned visit by President Lee Teng-hui to the region next year.</P>
      <P>NA Deputy Huang Yeng-huang of the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and Wang Chih of the New Party said that the two
African diplomatic allies attach great importance to their relations
with the ROC and that they were very touched by the warm welcome
extended by the peoples of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Huang and Wang attributed the deep friendship of the peoples of
Burkina Faso and Senegal with the ROC to the outstanding performance
of ROC diplomatic and technical missions stationed there, saying
their hard work has paid off and played a significant role in
strengthening bilateral relations with the two countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC NA deputies first paid a week-long visit to Burkina Faso,
where they were received by President Blaise Comparore and met with
other ranking officials.</P>
      <P>In addition to exchanging opinions and holding seminars on issues
of mutual concern with their Burkina Faso counterparts, the
delegation, accompanied by ROC Ambassador Sainting Kung, also visited
local farms developed with the assistance of ROC agricultural
missions. More than 2,000 local farmers, waving the national flags of
the two countries, lined the road and performed folk dances to
welcome them.</P>
      <P>During a six-day visit to Senegal, the delegation was received by
President Abdou Diouf and signed with the Senegal parliament an amity

      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of the major

would be all right to him if Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian is elected
new chairman of the party.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who is one of the leaders of the DPP's Formosa Faction,

      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities have
deployed more paramilitary forces to ensure that labor unrest in
various parts of mainland China will not affect the capital, the
South China Morning Post reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The report quoted mainland Chinese sources as saying Saturday
that the party leadership had instructed railway offices in areas
with high jobless rates to prevent large groups of workers
from boarding Beijing-bound trains.</P>
      <P>The leadership was afraid political stability would be
jeopardized if large-scale demonstrations were held in the capital,
they said. Areas badly hit by unemployment include the three
northeastern provinces, in addition to the inland provinces of
Sichuan and Henan.</P>
      <P>Laid-off workers there have staged frequent rallies and other
protest actions to demand better unemployment benefits and new jobs,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>A labor source was quoted as saying that "local railroad
officials have been told that they can, if necessary, call in
soldiers and paramilitary police to stop laborers from boarding trains
to Beijing."</P>
      <P>"Such actions have, on many occasions, resulted in long delays
of trains bound for the capital."</P>
      <P>The source said provincial and municipal administrations had
been instructed to prevent jobless workers and their relatives from
making trips to Beijing to hand in petitions to the authorities.</P>
      <P>It is understood that heads of localities who fail to stop labor
unrest from spilling out of their areas will be penalized by central

    <HEADLINE>BAYER PROJECT IMPORTANT TO TAIWAN'S ECONOMY: DPP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), stressed on Sunday that while the fate of
German-based Bayer Group's proposed investment project in Taichung
County is important to Taiwan's continued economic development, it
should not be decided solely by the local government.</P>
      <P>At a press conference following his return from a week-long US
visit late last night, Hsu said that even if Bayer's first investment
project in Taiwan is put to a public vote among county residents, the
DPP headquarters cannot avoid its responsibility to conduct
discussions on the referendum issue.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the proposed referendum on Bayer's project has
aroused concern and anxiety among foreign investors, evidenced by
statements issued by the European Council of Commerce and Trade
(ECCT) and American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham). The DPP must also
work out a comprehensive party policy toward major investment
projects, he added.</P>
      <P>Soon after its overwhelming victory in the Nov. 29 local
elections, Taiwan's largest opposition party was thrown into crisis
when infighting broke out over the Bayer investment project.</P>
      <P>Attacks on Hsu and his leadership mounted when he was leading the
DPP delegation on the US visit. Several DPP heavyweights made remarks
critical of what they called intervention by party headquarters in
local affairs, with some even declaring they will not support Hsu's
re-election as the DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>Hsu, however, said that he doesn't think the intraparty conflict
over the Bayer issue is serious, adding that he is not concerned over
his personal political future. It is more important to successfully
transform the DPP during the remainder of his tenure, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu went on to say his relationship with DPP Secretary-General
Chiou I-jien is quite good and he hopes it will remain so until the
end of his term in the mid-1998. Chiou was reportedly ready to resign
as he insisted that the DPP magistrate-elect in Taichung County
should be left alone to decide whether a referendum on the Bayer
project should be held.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that if the DPP wants to replace the Kuomintang (KMT) as
the nation's ruling party, it should assure the people that it has
the ability to maintain economic prosperity and safeguard national
security.</P>
      <P>Asked for his comments on the possibility that Taipei Mayor Chen
Shui-bian might seek to become the next DPP chairman, Hsu said he
would welcome such a development. He added that Chen's leadership
would be advantageous for the popular Taipei mayor personally as well
as for the party.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen, director of the party's Publicity Department who
accompanied Hsu on the US visit, said that not much time had been
spent discussing the Bayer investment before they embarked on the
overseas trip. However, the time has come for DPP officials to sit
down and discuss the issue practically and calmly, she asserted.</P>
      <P>If the referendum takes place, it will inevitably affect the
willingness of foreign enterprises to invest in Taiwan due to the
uncertainty such a precedent would create, Chen said. She added that
if every major project must be affirmed through a public vote, local
governments will have difficulty in pushing through major investment
projects and in initiating civic construction work.</P>
      <P>Chen also said at the press conference that in order not to
aggravate tensions within the party, she will not resign from her
position for the time being. But she added that was likely to
transpire at the end of the year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian saw a 76
percent approval rating in a recent poll conducted by the United
Daily News, while Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yin won 59 percent approval
and Taiwan Governor James Soong's popularity peaked at 82 percent.</P>
      <P>Despite still-high popularity, Chen's approval rating slipped 8
percent compared with the level found in a similar poll conducted one
year ago. Chen's approval stood at 76 percent in 1995.</P>
      <P>Twenty-three percent of Taipei citizens interviewed in the poll
taken on the eve of Chen's third anniversary in office labeled his
performance "very satisfactory" and another 53 percent rated it
"satisfactory," while 20 percent expressed dissatisfaction with the
Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,119 adults taken on Dec. 9-11 also found
that a high approval rating does not necessarily mean a high support
rating, as the percentage of those who said they would support Chen's
re-election stood at only 59 percent, far below the 76 percent of
respondents who approved of his performance in office. Twenty percent
of the polled said they would not support Chen's re-election and 18
percent did not respond.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Wu saw his approval level decline when 16 percent
of Kaohsiung citizens surveyed said they are very satisfied with his
performance and 43 percent said they are "satisfied." The 59 percent
approval rating Wu obtained this year was lower than the 64 percent
garnered last year and 77 percent received in 1995.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 849 adults in Kaohsiung City conducted on
Dec. 12-13 found that the percentage of respondents dissatisfied with
Wu's performance rose to 33 percent, from 26 percent in 1996 and 9
percent in 1995.</P>
      <P>Conversely, Taiwan Governor Soong's popularity rate climbed to 82
percent this year, compared with 77 percent and 78 percent in 1996
and 1995, respectively.</P>
      <P>Thirty-nine percent of those polled described Soong's performance
as quite satisfactory, while 43 percent said it is satisfactory. Only
5 percent of those interviewed said they are dissatisfied with
Soong's performance, down 3 percent from the similar poll last year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu was regarded as
the most popular cabinet minister by local college students,
according to a recent survey.
 The results of the survey, made public on Sunday by the ROC
Chinese Culture Association, show that Hu scored the highest approval
rating of 72 percent, followed by Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao
with 65 percent, Education Minister Wu Jin with 56 percent, and
Premier Vincent Siew with 55 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, Hu and the other three were far ahead of
other cabinet ministers. The students were asked to judge from the
officials' administrative efficiency, clean image and ability to
handle emergency situations.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs
Commission and Lin Cheng-chih, chairwoman of the Council for Cultural
Affairs, were the two cabinet members who scored the lowest approval
rating of about 27 percent each in the poll.</P>
      <P>The association attributed the low ranking of Kao and Lin to the
lack of understanding by college students of their respective
organizations.</P>
      <P>The poll also indicates that improvement of social order was a
major concern of college and university students. They are also very
concerned about the problems of money politics, the improvement of
education and living qualities.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was carried out from Dec. 1 to Dec. 10, polled
1,180 students from 18 colleges and universities, with a margin of
error of 2.5 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOREAN-STYLE FINANCIAL WOES UNLIKELY TO OCCUR IN TAIWAN: CHIU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea's financial woes are unlikely
to appear in Taiwan because the two countries' economic fundamentals
are completely different, Minister of Finance Paul Chiu said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Chiu
said economists and financial experts around the world share the view
that the Republic of China and South Korea have provided
illustrations of two different developmental types.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has seldom intervened in banking operations
and does not rely heavily on foreign investment for the country's
economic growth, Chiu noted.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the minister said, Taiwan has continued to enjoy steady
economic growth and foreign trade surplus. "Our annual economic
growth rate is comparable to our money supply growth rate. This is
very important in maintaining financial stability," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chiu said, Taiwan's financial situation
is solid and unlikely to be affected by fallout from the South Korean
debacle.</P>
      <P>Chiu pointed out that South Korean authorities have often
intervened in banking operations, which have traditionally been asked
to offer huge low-interest loans to a dozen or so large South Korean
conglomerates or "chaebols" to support their sometimes rash global
expansion plans.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, foreign capital accounts for 12 percent of South
Korea's capital formation, while its average annual economic growth
rate is only about 6.7 percent. "The phenomenon leads to an overly
high growth rate in its money supply, which eventually becomes a
burden on the Korean economy."</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Chiu said, South Korea has suffered deficits in its
foreign trade for many years. "South Korea should have depreciated
its currency long before, and its delay in doing so has resulted in
its recent financial fiasco," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chiu said Taiwan learned a bitter lesson from the collapse of
Cathay Trust Co. and the financial difficulties encountered by
several other trust firms between 1983 and 1984. "We have since
banned investment trust companies from investing in non-banking
businesses and unlisted stocks to ward off any possible financial
crises," he said.</P>
      <P>According to a Finance Ministry-proposed package of amendments to
the current bank deposit insurance regulations, Chiu said, all
financial institutions will be required by law to join a
government-sponsored deposit insurance program to better protect the
interests and rights of individual depositors. Under the current law,
joining such an insurance program is not mandatory. The revised
regulations will take effect after being approved by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chiu went on to say that the Finance Ministry and the Central
Bank of China will cooperate closely in supervising bank operations
in order to avoid any financial fiascoes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE THAN 150 ARRESTED IN SECOND VICE CRACKDOWN</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 150 prostitutes, brothel
operators and drivers were arrested by police early Monday morning,
in a large-scale crackdown on international sex rings.</P>
      <P>Liu Cheng-wu, a prosecutor with the Taipei District Prosecutors'
Office who oversaw the operation, said this is the first time that
police and investigative authorities have clamped down on hotels and
hostels allegedly involved in the sex trade. He vowed to continue
such operations until all illegal sex-related business on the island
has been eradicated.</P>
      <P>More than 500 police and investigators from both Taipei City and
Taipei County were mobilized on Sunday night for the operation. They
raided 84 hotels and hostels in the greater Taipei and Keelung City
areas and arrested more than 150 people, most of whom were brothel
owners or managers, drivers and prostitutes.</P>
      <P>Some of the prostitutes arrested were call girls from Hong Kong,
Macau, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, who entered Taiwan on
tourist visas or were sold and cheated into prostitution in Taiwan by
"snake-head" human cargo smuggling groups.</P>
      <P>Liu said this second crackdown is aimed at deterring the efforts
by Southeast Asian criminal rings to transport foreign prostitutes
into Taiwan. He promised to continue the crackdown on the sex trade
and vowed to seize the two major snake-heads who are suspected of
being the ringleaders of a group involved in smuggling prostitutes
from Thailand.</P>
      <P>Acting on tips reached in September, police authorities launched
the first round of the operation one week ago to break an
international prostitution ring called "Lily," arresting 49
prostitutes and scores of drivers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA'S ARMS EXPORTS TO THIRD WORLD INCREASING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada, which claims to be a leader in
peacekeeping, increased its military exports to Third World countries
such as Algeria, Indonesia, mainland China, India and Turkey last
year, according to an annual report on exports of military goods.</P>
      <P>The report, released on Friday, shows that while there were no
military exports to Algeria in 1995, in 1996 Canada exported
C$45,442-worth of military training equipment for use in simulation
exercises.</P>
      <P>The military-backed regime in Algeria has been accused of
complicity in horrific attacks on civilians.</P>
      <P>Military exports to Indonesia -- which has waged a brutal
military occupation of East Timor since 1975 -- went from zero in
1995 to C$1.7 million last year. Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's foreign
minister, stressed that the exports include aviation-related
equipment and aircraft parts.</P>
      <P>Canada's military exports to mainland China, which stood at only
C$7,316 in 1995, surged to C$149,941 last year, including sales of
radar system components. Mainland China has also been upgrading its
anti-riot police equipment since 1989.</P>
      <P>Turkey, a NATO ally, nearly tripled its military imports from
Canada, from C$2.4 million in 1995 to C$6 million last year, largely
because of the sale of aircraft parts, armored personnel carrier
parts and navigation systems.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that Canada's military exports included
firearms, ships for scrap, sonar, and other military equipment and
parts.</P>
      <P>Military exports to India, which has been accused of military
brutality against insurgent groups, increased from C$45,110 in 1995
to $510,733 last year. Those exports included firearms, ships for
scrap, sonar and bomb-disposal suits.</P>
      <P>The export of gas mask parts and ammunition accounted for an
increase in arms exports to Mexico from C$55,573 to C$304,818.
Exports to Morocco, engaged in a low-intensity conflict in the
Western Sahara, rose to C$232,400 from C$37,836 the year before.
These exports included simulator parts for military training.</P>
      <P>Exports to the Philippines soared from C$447,999 in 1995 to C$2.9
million last year because of the shipment of firearms, large-caliber
ammunition parts, propellants and aircraft parts.</P>
      <P>Canada's total military exports amounted to C$459 million in
1996, down marginally from the C$463 million exported in 1995. But
the share of exports that went to low- and middle-income countries
jumped to 14.5 percent, up from 8.6 percent the year before.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOB LOSSES MAY GENERATE ASIAN SOCIAL TENSIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's financial turmoil could lead to
"catastrophic" social consequences because there are few safeguards
to protect the millions of people who will lose their jobs in the
coming months, according to reports of the Geneva-based International
Labor Organization (ILO) on Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Starting as the Southeast and East Asian economies do from a
prolonged period of high growth, even a deceleration of growth would
generate social tensions," Michel Hansenne, Director General of the
ILO, was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>In Asia "there is typically no system of unemployment benefits or
mechanism for facilitating retraining and redeployment," Hansenne was
quoted as saying. "Consequently, retrenched workers will have to fend
for themselves."</P>
      <P>Job losses are mounting throughout Asia, even in countries that
just months ago were experiencing labor shortages. Thai officials say
as many as 1.5 million people are expected to be sacked by the end of
next year. South Korean job losses will total more than 900,000 next
year, according to the labor ministry there. Unemployment in
Indonesia will also rise by 1 million, labor union leaders say.</P>
      <P>The ILO regional director for Asia, Joe Thurman, said job losses
in the current crisis will have an impact on a high proportion of
well-paid white collar workers, noting that 6,000 of Thailand's
finance workers have lost their jobs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UIGHUR SEPARATISM TRIGGERS FEAR OF DISINTEGRATION IN MAINLAND CHINA (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec. 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the Uighur separatist movement is
too small to be a real threat to mainland Chinese rule, it stirs a
visceral fear of chaos and disintegration, a major Canadian newspaper
reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Kashgar, northwestern China, the Toronto Star
said that over the past year, militant Uighur separatists have set
off several bombs in the remote northwestern province of Xinjiang,
and have even slipped through the security net to strike in Beijing,
it added.</P>
      <P>The fear has grown as a national psyche developed through
centuries of unrest and foreign invasions, and still defines the way
mainland China sees the rest of the world, and its place in it, the
report said.</P>
      <P>In Kashgar, a desert oasis on the ancient Silk Road, Mao Zedong's
statue still stands tall.</P>
      <P>Perhaps that's because there is little else in Kashgar, beyond
soldiers and apparatchiks, to remind the Uighur people that theirs is
a Chinese city, the Star said.</P>
      <P>They have a saying here: "If you want to know how big China is,
you must see Xinjiang. If you want to understand what Xinjiang is,
you must visit Kashgar."</P>
      <P>Kashgar's 3.1 million people come from 13 of mainland China's
minority ethnic groups, including Uzbeks, Mongols and Kazakhs. But
more than 90 percent of the city's people are Uighurs.</P>
      <P>Uighurs have a lot more in common with neighbors living across
the border in countries such as Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and
Tajikistan than they do with their rulers in Beijing, the report
pointed out.</P>
      <P>In the early years of communist rule, well over 90 percent of
Xinjiang's people were Uighurs. But as infrastructure improved,
Chinese settlers arrived by the million, it said.</P>
      <P>The province has more than 13 million people today, only about 7
million of whom are Uighurs, it noted.</P>
      <P>At the current rate of migration, Han Chinese will form the
majority by early in the 21st century. This creates a feeling of
being colonized, which makes many Uighurs angry, according to the
Star.</P>
      <P>Hao Chang Shun, Kashgar's vice commissioner, is Han Chinese and
speaks Uighur. He's not a Muslim, but says, with the certainty of
absolute power, that he knows a real one from a charlatan.</P>
      <P>He brought up the matter of the Xinjiang's separatists himself,
midway through his interview with the Star's Asia Bureau Chief Paul
Watson, who filed the report.</P>
      <P>"Some people want to make Xinjiang separate from China," he
quoted Hao as saying. "They do exist, but they are very few. The
people want unity with China and don't want to be separated."</P>
      <P>Gulamettin Pahta, a leader of the Uighur independence movement in
the US, told Watson: "We just want to live as humans. We don't want
to disappear. We want equal rights and self-determination. That's it.
And we don't want these Chinese stealing everything from our rich
country."

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pahta fled Kashgar with his family and some 10,000 other Uighurs
five years after the communist victory, when he was 18 years old.</P>
      <P>Now 65, he lives in New York, where he is the founding president
of the Eastern Turkistan National Research Center, one of several
groups that want Uighur independence.</P>
      <P>Pahta is old enough to remember the days when that didn't sound
like such a fantasy because Xinjiang declared short-lived
independence as the Republic of East Turkistan in 1945.</P>
      <P>The chances of it ever happening again are very slim, Watson
pointed out. Mainland China has far too much at stake in Xinjiang,
such as gold, uranium, oil, natural gas, nuclear missiles -- and
national unity, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Pahta said, "Before the communist takeover in 1949, there were
only 6.3 percent Han Chinese (in Xinjiang), according to official
sources. Now they're almost 50 percent. They've become a majority in
our country."</P>
      <P>Mainland China has 55 official minority groups, and the majority
Han Chinese have fought for centuries to keep them united in a stable
country, especially in border regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet,
Watson reported.</P>
      <P>Xinjiang is rich in oil and natural gas, which mainland China
needs a lot of as its economy takes off. By some estimates, the
region has more oil than Saudi Arabia, perhaps one-third of the
world's reserves.</P>
      <P>Yet it's one of the country's most backward provinces, and the
Uighur people are among the poorest of minorities, which makes
industrial mainland China seem like a giant, sucking leech, the Star
correspondent said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly elected and former city and county
chiefs from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) shared
their experiences in running local governments at a DPP conference
held in the Taipei International Convention Center on Monday.</P>
      <P>Some 12 newly elected DPP city and county chiefs, as well as past
DPP chiefs, attended the meeting, including former Ilan County Chief
Chen Tien-nan and former Changhua County Chief Chou Ching-yu, as well
as high-level DPP staff.</P>
      <P>Participants, riding on the wave of their late November local
election victory, discussed enthusiastically whether to hold such
meetings on a regular basis, whether to form a strategic alliance of
DPP city and county chiefs, and the future of relations between local
and central government.</P>
      <P>The DPP won a stunning victory in the Nov. 29 local election,
taking 12 seats of the 23 up for grabs, while the ruling Kuomintang
only managed to capture eight, the other three going to independent
candidates.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said
the purpose of the conference will be to pass on and share the
experience of DPP members, as well as to upgrade the role and power
of local government, in the hope that cities and counties can propose
a revision of the law to give more power to local governments.</P>
      <P>The conference will also seek to build reciprocal exchanges
between the central and local governments, in the hope that the
Executive Yuan will give more respect to local governments and will
seriously consider the idea of inviting local administrative chiefs
to take part in Executive Yuan floor meetings, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian said that although the
experiences of various city governments are all slightly different,
he said the theme of his administration has never been too far from
the watchwords of "dignity, safety and development" espoused by the
government.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he is committed to permitting Taipei citizens to
receive dignified service from civil servants. In the field of public
safety, he stressed that he is striving to cut fires and traffic
accidents to the minimum, and is continuing to crack down on video
game parlors and illegal sex trade operations in residential areas.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that he will seek the support of all Taipei's
citizens to maintain the continued development of their city.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City mayor will preside over a general discussion
later in the afternoon, during which the participants will discuss
how to form a strategic alliance of DPP city and county chiefs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CORE PACIFIC GROUP TO ACQUIRE YAMAICHI HK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Core Pacific Group (CPG)
has agreed to acquire the Hong Kong operations of the failed Japanese
Yamaichi Securities later this month, marking the first international
merger to be made by a Taiwan stock brokerage firm.</P>
      <P>According to a Core Pacific spokesman, CPG and the Japanese
brokerage giant Yamaichi Securities forged a draft accord on the
merger last week, and a formal agreement is expected to be signed in
Tokyo on Dec. 19.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, CPG will acquire 100 percent of the share
capital of Yamaichi International (HK) Ltd., which includes Yamaichi
Securities (Hong Kong), Yamaichi Futures (Hong Kong), and Yamaichi
International Nominees (Hong Kong), valued at more than HK$500
million, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>It is not believed that the collapse of Yamaichi Securities in
Japan will have any negative impact on its Hong Kong affiliates,
which have been operating normally.</P>
      <P>Following the merger, CPG will retain the existing 114 staff
members of the Yamaichi affiliates in Hong Kong, including the
general manager of Yamaichi International Hong Kong, according to the
spokesman.</P>
      <P>Several financial conglomerates, including mainland China's
International Securities, the United States' AIG, and Taiwan's Grand
Cathay Securities have shown keen interest in acquiring Yamaichi's
Hong Kong operations in the wake of the recent failure of the mother
company, but were beaten to the punch by CPG, which offered better
terms and conditions, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The merger, if successful, will allow CPG the opportunity to make
inroads into Hong Kong, mainland China and even Japan, fulfilling CPG
founder Shen Ching-chin's dreams of expanding his Taiwan business
into multinational financial operations.</P>
      <P>Shen, who began his working life as a sailor and textiles
exporter, developed skill in utilizing US quotas, and is a clever
stock speculator. He founded the CPG about a decade ago and the
company today is involved in stock brokerage operations, real estate
development and other businesses.</P>
      <P>The group, which claims to have assets worth about NT$150 billion
(US$4.68 billion), was once included as one of the top 10 business
conglomerates in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ARMED SERVICES DO NOT SUPPORT SEPARATISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The armed services of the Republic of China
definitely do not support separatists and those who advocate changing
the official name of the country, Vice Minister of National Defense
Wang Wen-hsieh said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang's remark was made in response to questions raised by the
National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan. He added that all
ROC current territory -- Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu -- will be
under military threat from mainland China if the ROC declares
independence.</P>
      <P>The armed services of the ROC exist based on the ROC
constitution; it is the obligation of the armed services to defend
the constitution, Wang noted, stressing that even if the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) becomes the ruling
party, it is unlikely they will declare Taiwan independent.</P>
      <P>As a result of the landslide victory of the DPP in recent city
mayor and county chief elections, more than 70 percent of Taiwan's
population are now under the rule of the DPP at the local government
level, which has led to speculation that the DPP will soon become the
ruling party, thus bring up the question of the role of the ROC
military in the face of such changes.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was quoted as saying that the military should
understand politics but not interfere in politics, said the armed
services of the ROC will fight for the survival of the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of whether the military will be loyal
to the constitution if it is revised by the DPP through referendum,
Wang said that he believes that any responsible party will weigh the
consequences of the survival and security of the nation prior to any
revision of the constitution or change in territorial sovereignty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>C-119 TRANSPORT PLANES TO BE DECOMMISSIONED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After serving in the ROC Air Force for
nearly four decades, the C-119 transport planes will be
decommissioned on Friday, air force officials said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said a ceremony will be held on Friday at Pingtung
Air Force base, the home of the US-made planes, to formally retire
the aged craft. Taiwan is the only nation in the world that still
uses the planes.</P>
      <P>The air force began taking delivery of the transport planes from
the United States in the late 1950s, and the transports became the
backbone of the air force's transportation operations, until they
were largely replaced by the C-130 Hercules in the early 1990s. The
Hercules has three times the payload of the C-119.</P>
      <P>In the C-119's heyday, the air force maintained six squadrons
containing over 100 of the lumbering planes.</P>
      <P>After the decommission ceremony, the transport planes will be
dismantled and any schools or institutions that can afford
transportation fees will be able to apply to have them for teaching
or exhibition purposes.</P>
      <P>Taipei City government has already obtained one of the planes,
which it plans to install in the Hsinsheng Park for permanent
exhibition.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Fiji President Kamisese Mara
personally presided over an opening ceremony for his country's
representative office in Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Mara expressed delight that his Taipei
visit has coincided with the inauguration of the Fiji trade and
tourism office here.</P>
      <P>"The event highlights the long-standing cordial friendship
between our two countries," the Fiji head of state said, adding that
he hopes the new office will help boost bilateral trade and tourist
exchanges in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Noting that globalization is the wave of the 21st century, Mara
said international cooperation has become ever more important. "We
look forward to strengthening cooperation with the Republic of China
in various fields," he added.</P>
      <P>Mara also expressed his gratitude for all the assistance the ROC
has extended to Fiji and other South Pacific island nations.</P>
      <P>Many ROC officials and members of the diplomatic corps attended
the opening ceremony. Among the well-wishers were Tzen Wen-hua, ROC
vice minister of foreign affairs; John Feng, director of the Protocol
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Daryl Johnson,
director general of the Taipei office of the American Institute in
Taiwan; and Hugh L. Stephens, director of the Canadian Trade Office
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Josaia Maivusaroko, who has just retired from his post as Fiji
commerce and industry vice minister, will be Fiji's first
representative to the ROC. Maivusaroko, who also once served at
Fiji's embassy in Belgium, arrived in Taipei earlier this month to
arrange for the opening of the representative office.</P>
      <P>Fiji has no formal diplomatic ties with the ROC, but substantive
relations between the two countries are traditionally cordial. Mara
previously visited Taipei in 1994 and 1996.</P>
      <P>The ministers of foreign affairs of the two countries signed a
joint communique in October 1996 on mutual recognition, which is only
one step short of establishing full diplomatic ties. Fiji is the
third country to sign a mutual recognition communique with the ROC,
after Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The ROC has already set up a representative office in Fiji and
has also sent agricultural and sugar industry experts to that country
to assist in its economic development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACER ANNOUNCES US$40M INVESTMENT IN WALES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acer Peripherals Inc., an offshoot of Asian
computer giant the Acer Group, on Monday announced a US$40 million
investment project in Wales, UK, to make television and computer
monitors for the expanding European market.</P>
      <P>The monitor manufacturing complex, to be located in a suburb of
the Welsh capital of Cardiff, will create at least 1,000 jobs for the
region.</P>
      <P>In a simultaneous announcement in Cardiff to mark the
multi-million dollar investment, David Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of the
Welsh Development Agency, said: "The decision by such a prominent,
world-class Asian company to choose Wales is a significant
endorsement for the growing role Wales is playing in the
international intelligent technology (IT) industry and its ongoing
initiatives to create a high-tech workforce."</P>
      <P>"Acer will be a significant boost to the local economy. It will
make a significant contribution to enhancing our skills base and will
be a major new customer for Welsh suppliers," Rowe-Beddoe noted.</P>
      <P>Acer is likely to depend on a huge volume of key electronic
components supplied from other companies located in South Wales. The
four largest IT-accredited molding companies in Britain which are
likely to compete to supply the casings for Acer's monitors are all
based in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>K.Y. Lee, president of Acer Peripherals Inc., who was also
present at the ceremony in Cardiff, said: "One of the prime factors
in our choice of location was the supply infrastructure within the
region. We will be able to buy all key components from Welsh-based
suppliers."</P>
      <P>Increasing demand in Europe prompted Acer to look at potential
locations in Holland, Scotland, the North East of England and Wales
for a European manufacturing base. The Welsh Development Agency
showed Acer's project team around a range of sites in North, West and
South Wales before the team opted for a 50-acre site at Cardiff,
which proved closest to key suppliers.</P>
      <P>Acer made the decision also out of consideration of its need to
be near major ports, since the bulk of its output will be exported to
continental Europe. A perceived loyal and positive work ethic
demonstrated by the Welsh workforce, and Wales' track record as a
proven base for the manufacture of consumer electronics also affected
Acer's decision, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Acer plans to reach full production over a
five-year timetable. A small team of senior employees and engineers
will be seconded to Wales in late 1998 to oversee the launch of
production. Thereafter, the company is expected to recruit all of its
employees from within Wales. The facility will employ approximately
200 people by the end of 1998, with the figure growing gradually to
reach 1,000 in the year 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE THAN NT$500 MILLION REQUIRED TO MEND DAMAGE TO CPC REFINERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As much as NT$515 million will be needed to
repair the damage caused by the explosion of an oil tank in the Talin
refinery plant of the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in southern
Kaohsiung County, according to a report submitted on Monday by the
Commission of National Corporations to the Ministry of Economic
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The report points out that about NT$460 million will be needed
for major structural repairs to the plant, while an additional NT$55
million will be required to repair three damaged tanks and pipes, and
broken windows in the control room.</P>
      <P>The explosion, the second similar accident to occur in the CPC's
Talin plant in the last five years, took place on Sunday at about
2:45 p.m., killing two workers and injuring two, while another one
remains missing.</P>
      <P>Initial investigation has revealed human error to be the most
probable cause of the accident, as cigarette lighters and a bottle of
wine were found at the site.</P>
      <P>The incident has stirred up strong protests from local residents,
who demanded the CPC move the plant elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-ching, vice chairman of the Commission of National
Corporations, said operations of the more than 10 remaining tanks at
the Talin plant have been immediately suspended for the moment, but
added that they will resume operations after being checked.</P>
      <P>He said the CPC will continue searching for the missing worker
and has already delivered compensation money to the families of the
two fatalities. He pointed out that the CPC is still assessing who
should be held responsible for the accident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO WORK OUT STRATEGY TO MEET KYOTO PROTOCOL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew has directed relevant
government agencies to work out concrete, effective measures in a
comprehensive and systematic manner to help reduce Taiwan's
contribution to global warming in accordance with the newly passed
international agreement on cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Siew gave the directive after hearing reports by government
officials in charge of economic affairs and environmental protection
on the highlights of the treaty passed by a group of industrially
advanced countries at Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto on Dec. 11 to
limit emissions of gases which cause global warming.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol calls for the United States to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels, while Europe
and Japan will make cuts of 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively,
below 1990 amounts. The reductions will be achieved between 2008 and
2012.</P>
      <P>Siew said that although the Republic of China is not a signatory
to the Kyoto Protocol, it is very likely to be the target of the next
wave of action on greenhouse gas emission-cutting. "As an
export-oriented country, the ROC is vulnerable to global trade
sanctions," the premier said, adding that the ROC must begin to brace
itself as early as possible for stricter world regulations on
greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Siew demanded that all relevant government departments finalize a
comprehensive package of measures by the end of next May for reducing
Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet standards set for
newly industrializing countries or developing countries.</P>
      <P>The premier said the Ministry of Economic Affairs should review
the domestic industrial structure and energy policy, while the
Council of Agriculture should accelerate reforestation and reinforce
forest management, and the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) should collect first-hand information about measures adopted by
Kyoto treaty signatories to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>EPA Administrator Tsai Hsun-hsiung said Taiwan must adjust its
industrial structure, upgrade its energy efficiency and promote
energy conservation in order to meet its target of significantly
slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 2014.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan must trim carbon dioxide emissions by 162
percent if it wants to limit its greenhouse gas emissions at its 1990
level by 2010. The island will have to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by 81 percent and 31 percent, respectively, if it wants to
control greenhouse gas emissions to the 1995 and the 2000 level.</P>
      <P>"By any standard, we have to overhaul our energy policy and
industrial development strategy to meet the new anti-global warming
requirements," Tsai said, adding that such adjustments will certainly
have a great impact on Taiwan's future economic development.</P>
      <P>According to an EPA report, Japan and South Korea plan to build
more than 20 nuclear power plants in order to meet the Kyoto
Protocol's provisions on greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>As former Premier Lien Chan once promised that Taiwan will not
build any more nuclear power plant after the completion of its
controversial fourth nuclear plant, Tsai said Taiwan may have to
increase the use of natural gas in power generation in order to cut
carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-hsiuan said the cabinet will call a
national energy meeting in the first half of next year to discuss
possible adjustments to the country's energy policy, particularly the
suitable ratios of various forms of energy in overall energy
supplies.</P>
      <P>The EPA study also shows that the petrochemical, steel and cement
industries are Taiwan's top three sources of greenhouse gas
emissions. To cope with the new global trend, the report suggests
that the government restrict the development of industries that
consume large amounts of energy and emit large amounts of greenhouse
gases.</P>
      <P>Against this background, observers said, the fates of two
controversial investment projects -- Tuntex Group's plan to build a
petrochemical complex and Yiehlung Group's plan to build an
integrated steel mill in coastal region of Tainan County -- have
become quite uncertain.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Their crucial task is to grapple with the region's economic
crisis caused by a financial crunch that has overshadowed what was to
have been a commemorative summit to mark ASEAN's 30th anniversary and
its expansion to nine members.</P>
      <P>Senior ASEAN officials have spent the past two days working
feverishly on a statement that could be adopted by their leaders, The
Straits Times reported on Monday in a dispatch from the Malaysian
capital.</P>
      <P>In essence, the statement will call for urgent measures to stop
the slide in the region's currencies, as well as for a new mechanism
to complement the International Monetary Fund's role in restoring
confidence and stability in Southeast Asian economies.</P>
      <P>With much of the legwork done on what needs to be fixed, the job
is now for the ASEAN leaders to endorse the proposed reforms, or
better still, come up with new ideas.</P>
      <P>This means that they have to go well beyond what their finance
ministers and officials had suggested, the report said.</P>
      <P>At the minimum, the hope is that a positive note from the ASEAN
leaders will send the right signals to the financial markets and
underline their resolve to overcome their economic problems with
reforms and austerity measures.</P>
      <P>ASEAN finance ministers have, among other things, recently
proposed that a regional surveillance mechanism be set up to warn
member economies headed for trouble.</P>
      <P>This is a ground-breaking move that could go some way to
fostering greater transparency, the lack of which has been blamed for
much of the region's economic difficulties.</P>
      <P>On Sunday night, the ASEAN leaders had a working dinner hosted by
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad, the report said.</P>
      <P>Mahathir, chairman of the summit, also had a series of bilateral
meetings in which the currency crisis took top billing. Among those
he met were Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and mainland
China's President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>A Thai spokesman said Mahathir and Chuan agreed that the IMF
should speed up its study on currency trading and the impact of
volatile funds on developing economies.</P>
      <P>They also agreed that a global approach was needed to help Asian
economies overcome their current financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi told a press
conference on Sunday that the IMF's tough prescriptions for East
Asian economies had failed to improve the situation, the report said.</P>
      <P>"Maybe you cannot give Panadol to everybody... This, I think, is
a matter of great concern. I think we would expect to see a more
concerted effort by ASEAN countries to deal with the present crisis,"
he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Unlike Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, Malaysia is doing its
best to avoid going to the IMF for a financial lifeline, the report
said.</P>
      <P>The report also noted that the absence of Indonesia's 76-year-old
President Suharto, ASEAN's most senior head of government, will be
keenly felt at the summit.</P>
      <P>Told by his doctors to rest at home, he is being represented by
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN leaders will be meeting their counterparts from
mainland China, Japan and South Korea for the first time at Monday's
summit, when the economic crisis and regional security will dominate
the talks, the report said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan chicken farmers were urged on Monday
to stay highly alert to possible invasion of the "bird flu" from Hong
Kong which has killed two people and infected seven others, forcing
the territory's poultry market to close for cleanup operations.</P>

      <P>In addition, COA experts advised chicken farmers to separate
chickens from other types of poultry such as ducks and geese, since
these species may act as intermediary agents to spread the virus to

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN ECONOMIES WILL RECOVER AND EMERGE STRONGER: LEE KUAN YEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asian economies will recover and emerge
stronger from the current financial turmoil, Singapore's Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew said recently.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the financial turmoil in Asia does not
suggest that the Asian economic model has fundamental flaws, he said
in an interview published in the Dec. 4 issue of German business
magazine Wirtschaftswoche.</P>
      <P>Lee was asked during the interview whether the ongoing turmoil in
Asian markets means the so-called Asian century is over before it has
begun.</P>
      <P>He dismissed the fanfare over the Asian century as "hype," but
noted that it is a fact that Asia will play an important role in the
new century because of mainland China's growing importance.</P>
      <P>"China will overtake the United States in terms of GNP (Gross
National Product) in the next century.</P>
      <P>"This alone will shift the weight of the world balance from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. The present crisis in Asia is not going to
change this historic perspective," Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>He added that while the turmoil reflects some common problems in
Asia, such as overly-close connections between politicians and
businesses, it does not indicate any fundamental flaw in Asia's
economic model.</P>
      <P>The crisis will turn dangerous only if some countries postpone
measures to tackle their problems, he said.</P>
      <P>But countries which act quickly will recover within two years, he
predicted.</P>
      <P>Asked if the "Asian miracle" will turn into an "Asian malady,"
Lee said: "No, it won't be that bad. But I do not want to minimize
the problems either.</P>
      <P>"What we are experiencing now has been developing for years. The
old structures have not been adjusted to the new challenges."</P>
      <P>For example, South Korea's state-directed development was correct
for the country until the mid-1980s, when it was plugged into the
world economy and subject to world prices and it could no longer
direct developments at a national level.</P>
      <P>As for Japan, its troubles arose from its banks and Finance
Ministry not understanding early enough the impact of global
financial markets on the country, he said.</P>
      <P>On whether the Asian or Western models of development will turn
out to be more successful, Lee said only time will tell, but he
believes the Confucian system will survive.</P>
      <P>He elaborated: "It is a system which focuses on man's
self-improvement -- a man who takes his destiny into his own hands.</P>
      <P>"Good families can develop only under those conditions, and from
good families develop good extended families and clans and eventually
good relationships between people and rulers.</P>
      <P>"I personally believe that this Confucian system will pass the
test of time."</P>
      <P>He disagreed that family-oriented values will necessarily
disappear as a society becomes more affluent.</P>
      <P>Singapore, for example, has become richer, but family ties have
remained strong, in part because the state has designed social and
tax policies that have helped preserve the family unit.</P>
      <P>On the state's role in the economy, the Senior Minister said that

    <HEADLINE>BRITISH FIRM TO HELP CLEAR MINE FIELDS ON ROC-HELD KINMEN ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense has hired
a British company to help remove land mines in a township on the
offshore frontline island of Kinmen as part of the Republic of
China's efforts to support a global campaign to ban anti-personnel
land mines, military authorities said on Monday.</P>
      <P>A group of executives from Specialist Gurkha Services UK Ltd.
made an inspection tour of Hsiputou in Kinmen on Monday afternoon in
preparation for clearing land mines planted in the region many
decades ago. The British team, headed by Gurkha's Chairman Mark
Ranson, was accompanied on the inspection tour by Col. Lee Tze-kuang,
deputy director of the Engineering Service under the Army Logistics
Command, and several Kinmen civilian officials.</P>
      <P>The British firm is scheduled to start de-mining operations in
the Hsiputou region before the end of this month, according to
military sources.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, which lies closer to mainland China than to Taiwan,
currently has nine abandoned mine fields, with six at Hsiputou, two
at Houpan and one at Shuangjushan.</P>
      <P>The Defense Ministry has set aside a budget of NT$380 million
(US$11.69 million) for removing all land mines from the nine fields
over the next three fiscal years. The mine field in front of a temple
dedicated to Gen. Lee Kuang-chien at Hsiputou township is the first
region to be de-mined. Gurkha has won the NT$47 million de-mining
contract through an open tender. The mine-clearing project is
scheduled to be completed by May 20, 1998.</P>
      <P>Gurkha is founded by retired engineering servicemen of Britain's
Gurkha Corps. The company has helped clear land mines in Mozambique,
Afghanistan, South Korea, Cambodia, Swaziland, Kuwait and several
other countries or areas around the world.</P>
      <P>Ranson, who visited Kinmen once before in October 1996, said
mine-clearing is like conducting archeological excavations. "Security
is a top concern," he stressed, adding that Kinmen's land mines are
covered by thick earth and intertwined with plant roots. "We must pay
much heed to ensure safety."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES LIFTED ON KOREAN DRAMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union has lifted anti-dumping
duties on South Korean-made DRAMs, the most common type of computer
chip, after manufacturers reached an industry-to-industry accord on
data collection, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The EU may do the same for Japan if a similar agreement can be
reached, according to reports from the Geneva-based global trade
regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Removing measures against both countries could end one of the
EU's largest and longest-running dumping disputes, after minimum
pricing undertakings were imposed on 11 Japanese manufacturers in
1990, and on three South Korean groups in 1993.</P>
      <P>DRAMs, or dynamic random access memory chips, are the basic
building block for intelligent electronic devices from video
recorders to PCs. The EU market is worth some US$ 5.7 billion
annually, with Japanese and Korean manufacturers accounting for 80
percent.</P>
      <P>Anti-dumping measures were suspended for 21 months from 1995,
after a rise in DRAM prices. But they were reimposed in phases
between March and June this year, after a worldwide slump in chip
prices, despite complaints from EU electronic goods manufacturers
that this would push up their costs.</P>
      <P>The EU industry body -- the European Electronic Component
Manufacturers' Association (EECA) -- began talks in July with its
Korean and Japanese counterparts on an industry-to-industry accord
that would allow the duties to be lifted, but also promised swift
investigation of any future dumping complaints.</P>
      <P>EECA reached a reciprocal accord with the Korean Semiconductor
Industry Association in September requiring manufacturers to collect
data on cost of production and export prices.</P>
      <P>The accord contains no minimum pricing element, and has been
cleared by the European Commission's competition authorities. It is
similar to a deal reached on another type of semiconductor chip,
"flash" Eproms, and is seen as model for resolving dumping disputes
in other sectors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG MAYOR URGES TIMETABLE FOR REMOVAL OF CPC PLANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yin on Monday
lambasted the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) for failing to impose
strict industrial safety measures on its facilities, demanding the
state-run corporation set a timetable for removing its two refineries
in the city.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in the past two years, a total of 16 CPC-related
industrial accidents have occurred, killing and injuring dozens of
its employees and members of the public. This proves the CPC's lack
of ability and sincerity in strengthening safety measures and in
preventing the recurrence of similar accidents, he added.</P>
      <P>The latest incident came on Saturday when an oil tank at the CPC
refinery in Kaohsiung's Talin district exploded, killing two workers
and injuring two others, while one worker remains missing. It was the
second such explosion at the same location within five years, and
residents around the Talin plant have threatened to besiege the
compound until the CPC meets their demand to relocate the facility.</P>
      <P>Wu said that two CPC refineries, the one in Talin and another in
the Tsoying district, have not only brought environmental pollution
problems to Kaohsiung City, but also have seriously endangered the
lives of its residents.</P>
      <P>The CPC has long used Kaohsiung as its production base, but with
its headquarters in Taipei, the company did not pay any taxes to the
Kaohsiung City Government until three years ago, Wu pointed out. "The
CPC owes Kaohsiung residents too much," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Wu said that when construction began on the nation's fifth
naphtha cracker in Tsoying seven years ago, the CPC promised to
remove the refinery within 25 years. Several years have since passed,
Wu noted, but the CPC has not announced any plans about the removal.</P>
      <P>While urging the CPC to raise industrial safety standards to
better protect the lives of its employees and of Kaohsiung residents,
Wu also demanded that the company set a timetable for removal of both
the Tsoying and Talin plants as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>South African Ambassador to the ROC H.E.
Cornelius van Niekerk Scholts said on Monday that Pretoria is set to
reveal its arrangement for continuing unofficial ties with Taipei
after it shifts diplomatic recognition to Beijing at the beginning of
next year.</P>
      <P>Refusing to elaborate, the last Pretoria envoy to Taipei said in
response to reporters' questions that the new framework will allow
decades-old bilateral relations, especially the close economic ties,
to continue after Jan. 1, 1998, in the absence of official
recognition.</P>
      <P>South African President Nelson Mandela announced on Nov. 27,
1996, that Pretoria would switch its diplomatic loyalty to Beijing at
the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>Taipei has conducted three rounds of high-level talks and eight
rounds of working-level negotiations with Pretoria since that
announcement in an attempt to forge a new framework for bilateral
relations, but no outcome has been announced.</P>
      <P>South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in Pretoria on
Dec. 1 that the talks had stalled over Taipei's demands to retain its
consulates and to continue using its official national name after
1998.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator
Parris Chang said Monday that although the agreement with Pretoria
may not accommodate all Taipei's demands, relations will nonetheless
be on a higher level than those afforded under similar arrangements
reached with Washington and Tokyo. He added that the ROC-South
African framework is certain to trigger protests from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang also revealed that South Africa will use the term "liaison
office" to describe its representative office in Taipei, while the
ROC will employ the name "Taipei," rather than "Taiwan," in the title
of its representative office in Pretoria.</P>

      <P>The government-imposed quota on the number
of mainland Chinese who are married to people from Taiwan and have
applied for residency here on that basis will be expanded to 2,200

      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), the new quota

      <P>The MOI explained that the relaxed regulation was approved as a

the fact that an average of 21,268 persons each year are emigrating
abroad.</P>
      <P>However, despite the increased quota, mainland Chinese spouses
who are now filing marriage-based applications for Taiwan residency
will have to wait until July 2005 for approval as nearly 17,000

      <P>However, Chiang said: "The 'country' refers to the Republic of

      <P>The DPP, which swept to an overwhelming victory in November's

      <P>While denying allegations by the opposition that the KMT uses the
armed forces to consolidate its grip on power, the defense minister,
himself a KMT member, cautioned in the same breath against any
ambitions harbored by some DPP members to declare independence.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that the armed forces do not care which party rules
the country, so long they are defending the Republic of China, rather
than a so-called "Taiwan Independent State" or any other entity.</P>
      <P>Chiang dismissed Lin's question as to how the armed forces would

    <TEXT>
      <P>German-based Bayer Group took one step
closer to beginning construction on its project in Taichung County
when the Taiwan Provincial Government on Monday agreed to lease land
for the multinational's first investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The lease agreement, however, must be approved by the Taiwan
Provincial Assembly, which is scheduled to close its current session
on Friday.</P>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to make approval by the assembly possible
before the week's end, the Taiwan Provincial Government rushed
through authorization of the contract during an administrative
meeting.</P>
      <P>Provincial government spokesman Hwang Yi-chiou said after the
meeting that the Taiwan Provincial Assembly had earlier asked that
the land lease agreement meet three conditions: that a careful study
be made of the environmental impact of the project, that the terms of
the contract be fair, and that consent for the project be given by
residents living near the proposed investment site in the Taichung
Harbor area.</P>
      <P>Hwang said that on the sensitive issue of local consent, Bayer
had submitted a copy of over three thousand signatures by harbor area
residents in support of the project, proving that the petrochemical
giant has kept up good communications with the public.</P>
      <P>Under the contract, the Taiwan Provincial Government will lease
90 hectares of its land in the Taichung Harbor area to Bayer Group
for a period of 50 years for the purpose of constructing chemical
plants. Bayer has the right to ask for an extension of another 50
years after expiry of the lease.</P>
      <P>The rental rate will be 5 percent of the government-set land
value plus royalties charged for the use of the land. The rent,
calculated on annual basis, at current land prices would be about
NT$154 per square meter, that is, NT$100 million for the 90-hectare
construction base.</P>
      <P>Even if the Taiwan Provincial Assembly approves the land lease,
the fate of the Bayer project is still full of uncertainty as it may
face a referendum to be held in the county, an unprecedented
occurrence in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party magistrate-elect in Taichung

      <P>In line with world efforts to help save the
earth from catastrophic global warming, Taiwan should work out plans
to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Premier Vincent Siew said on Monday.</P>
      <P>After being briefed by the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) on the conclusions of the global climate
conference held in Japan last week, Siew instructed the EPA to submit
emissions-cutting measures by May.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the Environmental Protection Administration, the
Economics Ministry, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
and the Agricultural Commission should work together to set
reasonable reduction level in greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>The EPA's report said that greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan
reached 149 million metric tons in 1991, 83 percent of which was
carbon dioxide and 15 percent methane. Most greenhouse gases were
emitted as a by-product of energy consumption, accounting for 78
percent of the total, while landfills were the main source of
methane.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions ranked in 27th place among 160
countries around the world and accounted for 0.5 percent of the total
global emissions. It is estimated that Taiwan will see an increase in
such emissions over the next 14 years, with annual growth forecast at
3.1 percent, signaling an urgent need for the government to control
such emissions.</P>
      <P>The report proposed several emission-cutting measures such as
reduction of energy consumption, trash recycling, increasing use of

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of politicians from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) left for Seoul on
Tuesday to observe the South Korean presidential election scheduled
for Thursday.</P>
      <P>The delegation, headed by DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang, will also
visit Japan following its South Korea visit.</P>
      <P>Hsu's Seoul visit has drawn much attention as he is an old friend
of Kim Dae-jung, the leading opposition candidate in the current
South Korean presidential race. Kim, 72, recently said he would
promote nonpolitical exchanges with the Republic of China if he wins
the election.</P>
      <P>Kim is a spiritual leader of South Korean political dissent. Both
Kim and Hsu have been jailed and forced to live in exile for many
years due to their pro-democracy stances. This is Kim's fourth bid
for the presidency. He currently leads the field of candidates in
opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Hsu said prior to his departure that he and his DPP colleagues
will visit campaign headquarters of the three top contenders in the
South Korean presidential race -- Kim Dae-jung of the opposition
National Congress for New Politics; Lee Hoi-chang of the majority
Hannara or Grand National Party; and Rhee In-je of the New People's
Party.</P>
      <P>"We will attend campaign forums of the three main candidates to
hear their speeches as well as meet with other South Korean
politicians, scholars and experts," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Members of the DPP delegation include Sisy Chen, director of the
DPP's publicity department; Legislators Wang To, Lin Feng-hsi and
Tsai Huang-lang; National Assembly Deputy Chang Chuan-tien; and
Taiwan Provincial Assemblyman Chou Hui-ying.</P>
      <P>The DPP delegation is scheduled to fly to Japan on Friday, where
the group will meet with several influential figures in the Japanese
political arena. Hsu would not reveal the identities of the Japanese
politicians the delegation plans to meet.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, another DPP heavyweight,
is also expected to visit Japan in the near future.</P>
      <P>Japanese sources said political circles in Tokyo have attached
great importance to Hsu's and Chen's visits as the pro-Taiwan
independence DPP scored a resounding win in the ROC's recent
elections for local government chiefs. After all of the newly elected
city mayors and county magistrates have taken office on Dec. 20, more
than 70 percent of Taiwan's 21.3 million people will be under DPP

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
asked the South African government to step up protection of ROC
diplomats and their families after an ROC diplomat was injured in a
robbery in Johannesburg, MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ministry has asked Loh I-cheng, ROC ambassador to
South Africa, to convey Taipei's concern to the South African Foreign
Ministry.</P>
      <P>Timothy Yang, director of MOFA's Department of African Affairs,
will visit Nicky Scholtz, South African ambassador to the ROC over
the matter Tuesday or Wednesday, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Feng Tai, ROC consul-general in Johannesburg, was attending a
party in honor of Ambassador Loh hosted by Chen Yuan-yen, president
of a Taiwanese association in southern Africa, at Chen's residence in
Johannesburg Sunday night when the assault took place.</P>
      <P>Loh and his wife left early at about 8:00 p.m. Feng and seven
others continued chatting in the living room when three men suddenly
broke in at around 8:48 p.m., armed with pistols and an AK-47
automatic rifle.</P>
      <P>Feng and other quests were forced to hand over their money and
valuables. The robbers hit Feng and another guest, surnamed Lin, on
the head with the butt of the rifle.</P>
      <P>The assailants fled after one of them forced Chen upstairs to
open a safe and was injured by a shotgun blast fired by Chen's son.</P>
      <P>Feng and Lin were rushed to a nearby hospital where Feng received
five stitches in his head. Lin was in good condition after treatment.
Another woman guest also suffered injuries after she was kicked
several times.</P>
      <P>Feng appealed through the local media for all Taiwan businessmen
and overseas Chinese to be more vigilant of their safety in
Johannesburg.</P>
      <P>Police in Johannesburg said that five men were involved in the
robbery, including the three who broke into Chen's house and two
others who kept watch outside the residence.</P>
      <P>Two suspects from Zimbabwe have been arrested, while a manhunt is
under way for the other three men.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC TAKES MEASURES TO INCREASE WORKPLACE SAFETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) on
Monday called an interim meeting of directors and supervisors,
wherein it was decided to set up a task force and launch a campaign
to increase workplace safety in the wake of an explosion at its Talin
refinery in southern Kaohsiung County on Sunday.</P>
      <P>CPC Chairman Chen Chao-wei said the state-run unit must
thoroughly overhaul its operations and practices to rebuild its image
and reputation after a strings of accidents in recent years.</P>
      <P>He added that CPC department chiefs, starting immediately, will
not receive overtime pay and that this year's annual performance
bonuses allocated for workers at the Talin plant will be deducted as
part of the compensation money for victims of the accident.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the CPC workers' yearly bonuses will
be used as compensation funds.</P>
      <P>It was also decided in the meeting that a "workplace safety task
force" will be established to improve the safety standards of CPC
operations and to review the company's contractor system in a bid to
fully implement its workplace safety requirements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CPC is scheduled to release a namelist of
personnel at the Talin refinery who were found to be negligent in
their duties.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation has shown that human error is probably
the cause of the accident, which killed three workers and injured
two.</P>
      <P>The explosion stirred up strong protests from local residents,
who demanded the CPC suspend operations at the Talin plant and move
it elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-ching, vice chairman of the Commission of National
Corporations under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said it would be
hard for the CPC to relocate the plant due to difficulties in
acquiring land lots.</P>
      <P>Although operations of the more than 10 remaining tanks at the
Talin plant have been temporarily suspended in order to carry out
inspections, Chen said a complete suspension of operations at the
plant is also difficult, as that will have a big impact on the supply
of petroleum products in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>The Talin plant produces up to 40 percent of Taiwan's unleaded
petroleum and fuel oil, according to Cheng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS INVOLVING FOREIGNERS INCREASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of traffic accidents involving
foreign nationals has increased significantly in recent years as more
and more expatriates have come to Taiwan for business, sightseeing,
work and study, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to ministry tallies, about 2 million foreign nationals
visit Taiwan annually and the number of foreigners residing on the
island exceeds 200,000.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that the total number of
expatriate-related traffic accidents increased 89.7 percent between
1995 and 1996.</P>
      <P>The MOTC recently conducted an opinion survey of foreign
businesspersons with an aim to understand their views on Taiwan's
traffic problems.</P>
      <P>More than 90 percent of those surveyed said they have
difficulties finding English-language editions of publications
detailing traffic rules, instructions or related information.</P>
      <P>Many respondents said they have to rely on radio or television
programs to understand Taiwan's traffic regulations and general road
conditions.</P>
      <P>About 66 percent said they have a "fair" understanding of
Taiwan's traffic rules, and more than half of the respondents said
their knowledge about local traffic regulations mainly comes from
their friends.</P>
      <P>Asked about their opinions concerning Taiwan's traffic
environment, 84 percent said sidewalks in all major cities around the
island are inconvenient because they are often occupied by cars,
motorcycles or bicycles. Moreover, many sidewalks are blocked by
public facilities or other barriers and many of the walkways are in
need of repair.</P>
      <P>Many expatriates also criticized rampant violations of traffic
rules by local drivers, saying reckless changes of traffic lanes,
speeding, drunk driving and disobeying traffic signals are all too
common on Taiwan's highways and city streets.</P>
      <P>Only 30 percent of the respondents said Taiwan's mass
transportation systems are convenient, and a mere 10.2 percent said
they frequently take city buses or use mass rapid transit systems and
other means of public transportation.</P>
      <P>Although many foreigners praise convenient taxi services here,
quite a few also complain that taxi drivers often purposely take
detours or demand additional fares. Some respondents said many taxi
drivers fail to abide by traffic regulations.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said relevant government agencies should publish
foreign-language editions of local traffic rules for the convenience
of foreign visitors and residents.</P>
      <P>The officials also suggested that special classes be added to
vocational training programs for foreign laborers to help them
understand Taiwan's traffic regulations and special conditions.</P>
      <P>The officials further said traffic violators should be subject to
higher fines and that those who violate articles of the Criminal Code
should also be penalized through court proceedings as a deterrent to
repeat offenses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S. AFRICAN PLANT SOLD TO MAINLAND CHINA SAID REDUNDANT FOR YEARS</HEADLINE>

(By J.S. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A plant at the Pelindaba nuclear
facilities west of Pretoria, which was recently sold to mainland
China, has been redundant for a number of years, according to the
Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC) of South Africa on Monday.</P>
      <P>The high-technology plant was used to make the zirconium tubes
that sheath the fuel for nuclear reactors.
 The AEC said in a statement "it became politically possible and
cheaper to source the product from abroad."</P>
      <P>The sale was approved on July 18 this year following an
international tendering process, the AEC said, adding that clearance
was received from the South African Council for the Non-Proliferation
of Weapons of Mass Destruction.</P>
      <P>"Apart from three items for which no clearance has yet been
received, the sale of the plant has been approved to Pacific
Development Services (based in South Africa), who will in turn
on-sell to the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation of Beijing,"
the statement said.
 Pacific Development Services had arranged a team of engineers,
scientists and technicians to dismantle the plant and erect it again
in mainland China.
 The AEC said the sale of the plant did not include the transfer of
any technology to any party.</P>
      <P>Built in the 1960s, Pelindaba was intended to supply South Africa
with nuclear fuel.
 According to the opposition National Party, the facilities built
six atom bombs which were destroyed shortly before the 1994 general
elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA EXTENDS IMMIGRANT INVESTOR PROGRAM FOR ONE YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian government announced Monday
the extension of its immigrant investor program for one more year,
until Dec. 31, 1998.</P>
      <P>Lucienne Robillard, minister of citizenship and immigration, said
the amendments to the regulations will extend her authority to
approve new provincial government funds and extend offering periods
for existing provincial government funds.</P>
      <P>The current rules governing the approval and operation of
provincial government funds will continue to apply. Minimum
investment amounts, holding periods and the tier system for
investment will remain the same.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not apply to Quebec, which operates its own
investor program under the terms of a 1991 agreement with Ottawa.</P>
      <P>The program allows wealthy investors to obtain entry to Canada as
landed immigrants if they make a minimum investment. It was
introduced 10 years ago by the Conservative government of Brian
Mulroney.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese have become Canadian immigrants or citizens
through this program. In 1996, a total of 781 Taiwanese applied for
landed immigrant status as investors, down from 833 in 1995.</P>
      <P>The most common investment is in provincial-approved mutual funds
designed to serve immigrants. The minimum investment required is
C$350,000 in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, and
C$250,000 in the other provinces.</P>
      <P>The program has drawn criticism that some of the money invested
has been a front to obtain a visa. In addition, immigrants have
complained of being bilked by investment funds that qualified under
the program but were not run professionally.</P>
      <P>Robillard increased the minimum investment by C$100,000 last
March and tightened regulations to restore confidence in the program.</P>

at a base in southern Taiwan to enhance its defense capability in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Wu Shih-wen presided over the
inauguration ceremony for the frigates Ban Chao and Wu Chang on
Tuesday morning. Over 400 guests, including Yu Cheng-nan, chairman of
the China Shipbuilding Corp., representatives from France and the ROC
Navy attended the event.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that Ban Chao was the sixth of a series of vessels
modeled on US-made Perry-class warships. China Shipbuilding Corp.
started construction of the vessel in May 1994, and conducted a
series of rigorous tests after its completion.</P>
      <P>The high-speed vessel is equipped with modern weaponry systems,
two anti-submarine helicopters, artillery and locally developed
Hsiungfeng anti-ship missiles. It possesses anti-aircraft, cruise and
anti-submarine capability. The frigate also can conduct interception,
anti-blockade, escort and other operations.</P>
      <P>The Wu Chang is the fifth of six Lafayette-class frigates
purchased from France to be delivered. The French-made warship
arrived in Taiwan on Dec. 8. It is also equipped with anti-submarine
and combat weapons systems, and has the advantages of low-noise
propulsion and a "stealth" design to evade detection by enemy forces.</P>
      <P>Wu said the two frigates will immediately be included in a series
of combat training exercises so that naval personnel can familiarize
themselves with the ships' state-of-the-art features.</P>
      <P>Taiwan stuck a deal with a deal with France in 1991 to purchase
six Lafayette-class frigates at a cost of US$2.8 billion. Four of the

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING NARROWING ROOM FOR FUTURE CROSS-STRAIT NEGOTIATIONS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said that Beijing has further narrowed the room for future
cross-strait negotiations while continuing to insist that such talks
be conducted under the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>MAC, a formal administrative agency under supervision of the ROC
Cabinet, made the claim after comparing an eight-point proposal
announced by mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in January 1995
with the contents of a political report he delivered to the 15th
National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held last
September. Jiang is concurrently the CCP general secretary.</P>
      <P>In his report to the CCP congress, Jiang said: "Under the
prerequisite of 'one China,' any issue can be discussed, and any
comment and proposal, if it is helpful to the reunification of the
motherland, can be put forward."</P>
      <P>According to MAC officials, that statement had already been
contained in his previous eight-point proposal. However, the earlier
version had held that all issues could be discussed under the "one
China" principle, "including those of concern to the Taiwan
authorities."</P>
      <P>As a result, the MAC officials analyzed, Beijing has narrowed the
space for conducting cross-strait talks, while continuing to insist
upon the "one China" principle as a basis for discussions.</P>
      <P>In Jiang's report at the CCP congress, two preconditions were
set: the "one China" principle must be observed, and the subject
matter of cross-strait talks must be limited to topics "helpful to
the reunification of motherland," the MAC officials noted.</P>
      <P>Such developments once again underscore Beijing's unilateral
approach to setting an agenda for talks, the officials stressed. They
also said Beijing has now apparently narrowed of the scope of any
such negotiations down to only those issues seen as useful to
bringing about reunification on its own terms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TURNING TAIWAN INTO INVESTOR HAVEN SAID HELPFUL TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Taiwan can become a haven for foreign
investors as a "Switzerland of the East," such a development would
provide a tremendous boost to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Those remarks were made on Tuesday at a seminar on cross-strait
relations sponsored by the ROC Elite Women's League. The participants
consisted of outstanding figures from political and economic circles,
women's groups and the business sector.</P>
      <P>Huang Yao-yu, director of the Kuomintang's Department of Mainland
Operations, said the determining factors affecting cross-strait
relations come from forces in both the mainland and Taiwan, as well
from as the international community.</P>
      <P>He said the top priority for the ROC will be its basic survival
and continued development, while mainland China will seek preserve
its territorial integrity and national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>He said that if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait could find
common ground in pursuit of their interests, it would help foster a
more stable environment for cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-ling, a researcher at Academia Sinica, said that women
have contributed much to building peaceful, stable, and mutually
beneficial cross-strait exchanges. In order to make a fresh start in
the coming millennium, she said, the government must map out a new
framework for medium- and long-term development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Professor Bian Yu-yuan of National Taiwan University spoke from
an economic approach, saying that, in comparison with the mainland,
Taiwan excels in business management, marketing and manufacturing.
But she criticized the approach toward the mainland taken by Taiwan's
political leadership due to the influence of conservative forces and
a lack of confidence.</P>
      <P>She said that under its financial liberalization policies, Taiwan
has the ability to develop itself into a "Switzerland of the East" or
a global business center. The island could also become a bridgehead
for multinational enterprises seeking to make inroads to mainland
markets. Bian said such developments will help foster improved
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Entrepreneur Lee Tzu-chia said that the problems of land
acquisition and labor shortages have forced many local businesses to
go overseas. At the same time, she noted, the multinational Bayer
Group's investment project in central Taiwan has raised controversy.</P>
      <P>Such phenomenon seem to indicate that Taiwan has forgotten that
its economy is built upon trade, Lee said. Only if the island can
develop itself into an attractive location for foreign investors can
it force the mainland to pay due attention and respect to its
existence.</P>
      <P>From the perspectives of economic relations, population size and
internationalization, Taiwan also needs the mainland to achieve
sustained development, Lee said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-US WTO TALKS ACHIEVE MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major breakthroughs have been achieved
in negotiations between the Republic of China and the United States
concerning terms for Taiwan to join the World Trade Organization
(WTO), delegates from both sides said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The two countries began the 16th round of WTO talks in the US
capital city on Monday, with Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the
Board of Foreign Trade, and David Burns, a senior adviser to the US
Trade Representative, heading their respective delegations.</P>
      <P>During the first day of negotiations, the two sides resolved many
disputes over issues related to further liberalization of Taiwan's
trade regime, government procurements and service market opening.</P>
      <P>"The meeting proceeded smoothly in an amicable atmosphere and we
have achieved breakthroughs on some technical issues," Chen said at
the end of the first-day consultations.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan has agreed to open its market to
foreign-made motorcycles with 150cc engines or larger two years after
it joins the WTO and to finalize necessary reforms of its commercial
port construction surcharge collection system within 15 months
following its formal entry to the Geneva-based world trade regulatory
body.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also promised to scrap a regulation requiring coal
importers to simultaneously purchase Taiwan-produced coal and to sign
an international commercial aircraft agreement immediately after its
WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Touching on the opening of service markets, Chen said the US is
generally satisfied with Taiwan's fast-paced deregulation of its
telecommunications market. Meanwhile, the ROC has promised to revise
its insurance law after entering the WTO to allow foreign mutual
insurance companies with net worth of NT$2 billion (US$61.35 million)
to open branches in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Concerning the government procurements deregulation, Chen said
the ROC has agreed to open two major categories of products --
electric engineering and transportation equipment, such as rail cars
-- to foreign bidders two years after its WTO entry. Chen said the
Cabinet's Public Construction Commission has set up a special
committee to handle disputes over the implementation of government
purchase contracts. At the request of foreign contractors, the
committee will help settle such disputes through the administrative
system.</P>
      <P>Chen said the two sides will discuss issues concerning Taiwan's
tariff reduction schedule, management of tariff-quota system and farm
trade-related problems on Tuesday. "If all goes well, this round of
talks will end on Wednesday as scheduled," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen further said certain policy-related issues, such as quotas,

      <P>The United States is one of the three WTO members which have yet
to finalize bilateral WTO talks with the ROC. The other two are the

    <HEADLINE>ASEAN UNVEILS GRAND VISION 2020 PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) on Monday unveiled its grand vision for the next
millennium: a clean and green region where the economies of each
member state are integrated even more closely.</P>
      <P>Vision 2020 would see a free flow of professionals and other
services between countries, governments consulting each other in
financial and macroeconomic policies and joint efforts to make ASEAN
a leading producer of food, agricultural and forestry products.</P>
      <P>Also envisioned is a regional power grid and a Trans-ASEAN Gas
and Water Pipeline, The Straits Times reported Tuesday in a dispatch
from Kuala Lumpur.</P>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on Monday hailed the
Vision 2020 statement, saying: "Although it may get less attention in
the media than the currency crisis, it actually contains many bold
ideas for ASEAN integration."</P>
      <P>He noted that member countries had agreed to come out with an
action agenda to implement the plan quickly. The agenda will be
endorsed at the formal ASEAN summit to be held in Vietnam next year.</P>
      <P>A key component of the vision statement is titled "ASEAN 2020:
Partnership in Dynamic Development."</P>
      <P>The leaders have pledged to move towards closer economic
integration and to narrow the gap in levels of development among
member countries.</P>
      <P>They also pledged to:</P>
      <P>-- fully implement the ASEAN Free Trade Area;</P>
      <P>-- realize the ASEAN Investment Area by 2010 and a free flow of
investments by 2020;</P>
      <P>-- promote a modern and competitive small and medium enterprises
sector in the region;</P>
      <P>-- promote the opening up of the financial sector and work closer
in money and capital market, tax, insurance and customs matters;</P>
      <P>-- and, develop a harmonized trans-ASEAN transportation network
and link the planned information highways and multimedia corridors.</P>
      <P>The Vision 2020 statement also outlined its goal of being "A
Community of Caring Societies." It envisioned a region wherein
hunger, malnutrition and poverty would no longer be basic problems
and wherein strong families would tend to their children, youth,
women and elderly.</P>
      <P>The leaders also want a set of agreed rules of behavior to evolve
in dealing with drug trafficking, environmental pollution and
cross-border crime.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AFTA TO BE IMPLEMENTED AHEAD OF 2003 DEADLINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) will be
implemented earlier than the 2003 deadline to boost trade among
regional economies hit by currency crisis.</P>
      <P>The leaders of nine ASEAN countries meeting in Kuala Lumpur
agreed Monday that they should increase trade among themselves as a
way of overcoming "the unprecedented devaluation of their
currencies," The Straits Times reported Tuesday in a dispatch from
Kuala Lumpur.</P>
      <P>They said in a joint statement that "intra-ASEAN trade could not
only continue as before but could even be expanded so long as prices
remained competitive."</P>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in Kuala Lumpur on
Monday it was significant that the ASEAN leaders agreed to accelerate
the implementation of AFTA and called for greater intra-ASEAN trade
and investment, the report by the Singapore-based daily said.</P>
      <P>Officials from ASEAN member countries have been asked to study
the possibility of establishing methods of payment that can assist
each other in conserving foreign exchange holdings.</P>
      <P>To boost intraregional trade, the leaders agreed that the
implementation of AFTA and the ASEAN Investment Area be accelerated,
the report said.</P>
      <P>The AFTA agreement aims to achieve free trade in the region no
later than the year 2003 in the six core ASEAN countries of
Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN Investment Area is aimed at helping the region compete
for foreign investment with large countries like India and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Monday that the
decision to increase intra-ASEAN trade is not a form of
protectionism, the report said.</P>
      <P>He was quoted as saying: "It's not regional nationalism. It's
purely because we don't have foreign exchange to buy from outside the
region."</P>
      <P>Asked if this move would send a wrong signal, he was quoted as
replying: "We are responding to a situation beyond our control. When
we had money, we bought from outside. We are not forming a trade
bloc. This is not regionalism, blocism or whatever."</P>
      <P>Rodolfo Severino, Philippine undersecretary for foreign affairs,
said that the earlier implementation of AFTA will certainly stimulate
growth in the region and would be a signal to the private sector to
look at the intra-ASEAN market more closely, the report said.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN heads of government also discussed the progress of the
Mekong Basin Development Cooperation. They agreed that the proposed
plan for the trans-Asian railway from Singapore to Kunming in the
Chinese mainland be implemented on a consortium basis involving all
ASEAN countries, the report said.</P>
      <P>The United States, Japan and countries in Europe will also be
invited to help build the railway, it added.</P>
      <P>Leaders from the nine member countries also agreed to establish
an ASEAN Foundation to develop exchange programs in the area of human
resources. A memorandum of understanding on the setting up the
foundation was signed Monday by foreign ministers of the member
countries.</P>
      <P>The nine member countries have pledged to contribute between
US$100,000 and US$1 million to the foundation, the report said.
Malaysia will give M$1.5 million, it added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAYER'S CASE DEPENDS ON PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY: SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong said
on Tuesday that the Taiwan Provincial Assembly will have the final
say on the fate of a NT$49 billion investment plan by Germany's Bayer
Group in central Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Soong said the Taiwan Provincial Government, in conjunction with
central government policy and expert opinion, has approved Bayer's
application to lease a plot of provincial government-owned land near
Taichung Harbor for construction of the projected plant.</P>
      <P>As the investment plan is of major importance to the central
government, Soong said it is natural that the provincial government
will provide support and cooperation for the case, but added that the
Taiwan Provincial Assembly, the central government and the Taichung
County authorities will have the final say on the issue.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, as a
organ which reflects public opinion, can strike a balance between the
issues of economic development and environmental protection, because
its decision on the Bayer case will not only have an impact on
Taiwan's economic development, but also on Taiwan's promise to
cooperate with the international community.</P>
      <P>Soong also expressed his disapproval of the insistence of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP's) Liao Yung-lai, the newly elected
Taichung County magistrate, on holding a public referendum to decide
the fate of the Bayer investment plan.</P>
      <P>"If every issue must be decided by a referendum, then what are
public opinion organizations for?" he asked, pointing out that
holding a referendum is not the only means of assessing public
opinion.</P>
      <P>Bayer's plan to build a plant to produce toluene di-isocyanate
near Taichung Harbor has encountered strong opposition from local
residents who fear that the plant will cause heavy pollution, and
Liao has insisted on holding a public referendum to decide whether or
not Bayer can continue with the project.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Assembly is scheduled to screen the
investment project later this week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DECEASED TYCOON WAITS ON ICE WHILE FAMILY FIGHTS OVER CASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Deceased fruit tycoon Chen Cha-mou, who
died on Aug. 9, 1993, has still not received a proper burial or
cremation, it was discovered recently.</P>
      <P>Chen, who reportedly left a multi-billion dollar estate, has been
kept on ice at his home in Chinchou Street in downtown Taipei for
four years and four months as a result of discrepancies among his
children over the burial site, as well as a dispute over the
distribution of his wealth.</P>
      <P>During a city council plenary session on Tuesday, Taipei city
councilors Lin Jui-tu and Kang Shui-mu inquired to city government
authorities in charge of funeral and burial affairs whether or not
Chen's offspring have violated any regulations by neglecting their
late father's remains for so many years.</P>
      <P>Wu Er-min, director of the Taipei City Funeral and Burial Affairs
Department, said that according to existing statutes, Chen's children
have not violated any regulations, adding that officials can at best
advise the Chen family to handle the burial as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the city government revise relevant burial
regulations, in order to prevent similar situations from developing
in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen has not been buried because his eldest and third sons
disagree over the site of their father's burial. The eldest insists
that the old man be buried along with their mother on Yangmingshan in
suburban Taipei, while the third son claims that he must be buried on
Mt. Kuanyin, near the Tamsui River, saying that only by resting there
will the old man bless his offspring.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the family, including three sons, two daughters and
several daughters-in-law have been engaged in a dog-fight over his
legacy from within one year of his death.</P>
      <P>Members of the family have filed several lawsuits against each
other since the second year of Chen's death. The suits involve the
disappearance of stocks and securities worth several billion NT
dollars, and the disappearance of time deposit certificates and cash
worth over NT$1 billion earned from the sale of 12 tracts of land in
suburban Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST MAINLAND-BASED TAIWAN FIRMS WISH TO SHIFT OPERATIONS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of Taiwan businesses with
operations in mainland China would like the ROC government to help
them shift their operations to other countries, according to a report
published on Tuesday in the mass-circulation evening newspaper the
China Times Express.</P>
      <P>The report, citing the results of a survey carried out by the
Taipei Managers and Executives Association, shows that 54.2 percent
of Taiwan businesses currently operating on the mainland would like
the government to help them transfer their operations to other
countries and that they would also like to see it help set up banks
on the mainland and train professional talent to be stationed there.</P>
      <P>M.C. Chen, chairman of the association, was quoted by the report
as attributing the results of the survey to the increasing lack of
confidence of Taiwan firms in mainland China's investment climate
since Hong Kong's return to Beijing rule in July.</P>
      <P>As Southeast Asia sinks further into the financial morass, Chen
suggested that Taiwan businesses slow down their investment on the
mainland and consider shifting their operations to other countries,
especially because the mainland Chinese renminbi and the Hong Kong
dollar are facing strong pressure of devaluation, which will result
in greater business risk and financial demands, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>Chen was cited as pointing out that although Taiwan and mainland
China are likely to resume talks next year, the two sides remain
divided on several issues of major concern, casting a shadow over the
business community's hope that cross-strait economic exchanges will
soon start warming up.</P>

    <DATELINE>Rome,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
on Monday it is studying the feasibility of handling visa-related
services in Taipei for Republic of China nationals intending to visit
Greece.</P>
      <P>"Greece has expressed its hope that our representative office in
Taipei would help handle visa services for ROC nationals to save
their time," an Italian Foreign Ministry official said.</P>
      <P>As such a request involves many technical problems, the official
said, relevant Italian authorities are still mulling the issue.</P>
      <P>Greece currently offers landing visas to ROC nationals.
However, the country has decided to stop issuing landing visas
after it begins to implement the Schengen Agreement on Jan. 1, 1998.
For the convenience of ROC passport holders, Greece has approached
Italy for assistance in issuing Schengen visas to Greece-bound ROC
travelers.</P>
      <P>According to the Schengen Agreement, a person who has obtained a
visa from any of the Schengen signatories can travel to any other
member country.</P>
      <P>An official with the ROC's representative office in Rome said
Greece's move to seek Italian assistance is a good-will gesture to
the ROC. "It will be far more convenient for ROC nationals to apply
for visas to Greece in Taipei than at the airport of Athens," he
noted, adding it usually takes at least three hours or even seven
hours to get a landing visa at the Athens International
Airport.</P>
      <P>The Italian representative office in Taipei currently receives
more than 120,000 visa applications from ROC nationals a year. That
means the office has to process 600 applications on every work day.
It remains unclear whether the Italian office has enough manpower to
help Greece handle visa applications from prospective ROC visitors.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's show of force in the
Taiwan Strait in the run-up to the Republic of China's first direct
presidential election last year was a great mistake, Vice President
Lien Chan said in an exclusive interview with CNA on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait competition involves a choice of way of
life and related political, social and economic systems, Lien said
military means cannot resolve cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"It was regretful that mainland China conducted missile tests and
menacing war games in waters near Taiwan in the run-up to the ROC's
historic presidential election on March 23, 1996," the vice president
said.</P>
      <P>Lien said he earnestly hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
will work together to create a peaceful environment for the
cultivation of rapprochement and the avoidance of any possible
conflicts in the region.</P>
      <P>Lien, who finished his concurrent duty as premier in late August,
said the ROC's current military policy is to establish an effective
deterrent force to safeguard its national security.</P>
      <P>"We have adopted a strategy for effective deterrence and have no
intention of employing military means to resolve cross-strait
issues," the scholar-turned politician stressed.</P>
      <P>Lien went on to say that mainland China has continued to increase
its military budget and beef up its combat capability in recent
years. "Mainland China's military build-up has exerted pressure on
many neighboring countries, and this was a major factor that prompted
Japan and the United States to amend their defense cooperation
guidelines in order to revamp their security alliance," he observed.</P>
      <P>Touching on the maintenance of peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region, Lien said a collective mechanism should be
established in the region to safeguard regional security, peace and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Lien further said the best collective security arrangement would
be one which includes all the countries of the Asia-Pacific under a
framework which is not targeted at any particular hypothetical enemy.</P>

substantially in the first 11 months of this year, with export
amounting to US$111.57 billion and import to US$103.84 billion,
according to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>Trade surplus totaled US$7.73 billion in the period, a reduction
of 38 percent from a year earlier, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export and import trade are expected to expand next
year, because of the devaluation of Taiwan currency and increases in

      <P>Taiwan's surplus in trade with Hong Kong reached US$24.08
billion during the 11-month period, an increase of US$1.63 billion

1996.</P>
      <P>However, during the 11-month period Taiwan suffered a deficit of

same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Export in November exceeded the US$11 billion mark for the first
time, indicating that the devaluation of the Taiwan currency has

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BECOME ASIA'S SILICON VALLEY IN THREE YEARS: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Output from Taiwan's information technology
(IT) industry is expected to make up 40 percent of the island's
overall production in three years, making the Republic of China the
"Silicon Valley" of Asia, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With its IT industry continuing to flourish, CEPD officials said,
Taiwan will join the ranks of the developed countries by the
beginning of the 21st century, dubbed the "century of information
revolution."</P>
      <P>In October alone, Taiwan received export orders for IT products
worth US$1.88 million, marking a single-month record in electronics
sales in Taiwan. As of the end of October, nine of Taiwan's IT
products ranked first place in production value in the world.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials attributed the Taiwan IT industry's outstanding
performance to the efficient vertical and horizontal sharing of labor
among the up- mid- and down-stream sectors of the industry.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the information and electronic industry contributed 34.1
percent of Taiwan's overall industrial production, and that figure is
expected to shoot up to 40 percent in 2000.</P>
      <P>The workforce in the IT industry, which is capital- and
technology-intensive, has seen an annual growth rate of 3.4 percent
since 1992, as compared with an average of -5 percent in the textiles
industry, which is labor-intensive, CEPD officials noted.</P>
      <P>With the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, which is
currently Taiwan's "Silicon Valley," in the north, the start of
construction of the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park in the
south, and plans to begin development of a third science park in
Miaoli, central Taiwan in 1999, Taiwan's ambition of becoming a
sci-tech island is gradually materializing, the officials added.</P>

the president of the Panchiao District Court, where the Alexanders
offered their blessings to Chen through an interpreter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN SEES RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE NEXT YEAR  (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Tuesday
that he foresees the resumption of cross-strait dialogue sometime
next year.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA at his office, Lien said that
he believes Beijing is now ready for the dialogue with Taipei it
suspended in the summer of 1995.</P>
      <P>"I am confident that we will resume the long-awaited talks next
year," said the vice president, who relinquished his concurrent
office as premier on September 1. He did not set a time.</P>
      <P>Beijing suspended scheduled talks between its Association for
Relations across the Taiwasn Strait (ARATS) and Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) in the summer of 1995 to vent its anger at
President Lee Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>He said the talks should focus mainly on technical issues arising
from the increasing unofficial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"However," Lien said, "non-technical (political) issues can also
be pondered."</P>
      <P>With important internal issues settled, Beijing is now able to
shift more of its attention to relations with Taiwan, repeatedly
calling on Taipei to enter into "political negotaitions." Chief among
the questions were Beijing's takeover of Hong Kong on July 1, the
15th Chinese Communist Party National Congress and President Jiang
Zemin's visit to the United States in October.</P>
      <P>On reginal security, Lien said Beijing's massive military
buildup, as evidenced by its huge defense spending, has been viewed
with grave concern by its neighbors, Japan in particular. Tokyo has
countered with a new set of defense guidelines, under which Japan is
obliged to provide military facilities and necessary noncombat
assistance for the United States to cope with contingencies in Asia.</P>
      <P>The revised US-Japan mutual defense arrangements came after
Beijing conducted war games and test-fired missiles into the Taiwan
Strait in 1996.</P>
      <P>In the face of the new threat, Lien said, the Republic of China
on Taiwan has improved its deterrent forces to effectively curb
Beijing's possible military adventurism, but he prefers a new
collective security system to safeguard peace in the region.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that the SEF and ARATS should use the existing
channels of dialogue, although the "level" of talks should be
upgraded step by step. "We do not wish to open new channels of
dialogue," he said, "and we cannot expect high-level meetings (as
proposed by Beijing) to solve the long-standing, thorny issues at one
time."</P>
      <P>"War cannot solve the cross-strait issue," Lien pointed out. "The
issue is one of differences in political and economic systems as well
as ways of life," he said.</P>
      <P>"It was also a big mistake for Beijing to conduct war games and
launch missiles in an attempt to intimidate the people of Taiwan in
the run-up to the country's first popular presidential election in
March last year," Lien pointed out.</P>
      <P>The vice president said that he will continue to travel abroad.
"It's very natural for government leaders to go abroad to promote
friendship and understanding with friendly countries," he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's allegations that such trips are aimed at promoting
either `two Chinas' or `one China, one Taiwan' are totally
groundless," he said.</P>
      <P>During the past few years, Lien paid visits to Austria, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Ukraine, Nicaragua, the
Vatican, Ireland and Iceland. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN SEES RESUMPTION OF DIALOGUE (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Commenting on communist China's moves to press South Africa for
an earlier-than-scheduled severance of ties with the Republic of
China on Taiwan, Lien said it fully reflects nothing but Beijing's
bigoted narrow-mindedness, making it impossible for the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait to achieve what he termed a "win-win" situation in
the near future. Taipei does not see its diplomacy vis-a-vis Beijing
as a "zero sum" game. Lien believes both sides are capable of winning
in the diplomatic arena.</P>
      <P>South African President Nelson Mandela announced on Nov. 27 last
year that Pretoria will shift its diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing from Jan. 1, 1998. Taipei and Pretoria have since
conducted several rounds of negotiations to work out a framework for
future bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Lien flatly ruled out the possibility that the Republic of China
on Taiwan might take the initiative and sever ties with South Africa
before Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is safe from the financial turmoil which has embroiled
many newly industrialized economies in Asia, including Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea, Lien declared. The island's economic
fundamentals are sound: it has no foreign debts, holds foreign
exchange reserves of well over US$85 billion, with its national
economy growing more than five per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>He attributed Taiwan's success to the enforcement of sound
government policies over the past years.</P>
      <P>Lien said that Taipei is willing to provide relief for its
financially stricken neighbors. But, he added, the relief must be
arranged by world organizations, like the International Monetary Fund
and the Asian Development Bank, rather than on a nation-to-nation
basis.</P>
      <P>He took to task Liao Yung-lai, Taichung magistrate-elect of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), for calling a referendum to
decide the fate of an approved NT$49 billion (US$1.5 billion)
investment project by Germany's Bayer conglomerate in that county.</P>
      <P>Such a move, Lien said, will confuse foreign investors and
gravely hinder investment from aboard, which is of very great
importance to the island.</P>
      <P>Defending Taipei's "go-slow" mainland investment policy, Lien
said it aims only to limit high-tech projects worth over NT$50
million (US$1.53 million) each. "In fact, we are actively promoting
cross-strait economic exchanges on a step-by-step basis," he
declared.</P>
      <P>He also predicted a sharp depreciation of the renminpi next
summer. Asia's liquidation crisis and a decline in foreign investment
will force Beijing to depreciate its currency, he said. "Taiwan
investors," he cautioned, "should seek to purchase currencies other
than the renminpi as a hedge."</P>
      <P>On the possibility that he may run with Taiwan Governor James
Soong on the same ticket in the 2000 presidential election, Lien said
it is too early to talk about the question now. Many changes may
occur in the next two years to make any talk to that possibility
futile at present, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAW AMENDED TO STOP AIRPLANE SIT-INS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The use of on-board sit-ins as a form of
protest by air passengers against perceived maltreatment by airlines
has been misused to such an extent that the Taiwan legislature has
amended relevant laws to impose restrictions against this type of
behavior.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Tuesday passed the third reading of an
amendment to the Civil Aeronautic Law which stipulates that the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) should help settle passenger
disputes.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the institution will form a commission based on the
new law to take charge of managing complaints related to flight
delays.</P>
      <P>The amended law also rules that if a sit-in protest occurs
despite official mediation, law enforcement personnel stationed at
the airport can be mobilized to ensure passengers disembark.</P>
      <P>The reformed law also specifies a ceiling for compensation,
pointing out that the amount of compensation airlines should be held
liable for relating to mistakes resulting in delays should be tied to
ticket prices.</P>
      <P>Civil aviation businesses on the island welcomed the amendment,
and pledged their willingness to deal with passenger complaints
through communication rather than through legal procedures.</P>
      <P>In recent years, there have been many instances of Taiwan air
travelers refusing to disembark from commercial flights because of
delays or perceived poor service.</P>
      <P>The most series of incidents occurred in February, when heavy fog
disrupted flight schedules at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
in northern Taoyuan County. Several sit-ins occurred, prompting the
authorities to take legislative steps to resolve a problem which was
harming Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>The amended regulations also state that any passenger who makes
bomb threats or who otherwise makes false reports which might affect
flight safety, will face a maximum jail term of three years, or a
maximum fine of NT$1 million (US$31,250).</P>
      <P>Any passenger whose behavior actually endangers flight safety,
will face a jail term of 3-10 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual ministerial-level energy meeting
between the Republic of China and Indonesia is scheduled to open here
on Dec. 22, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and Indonesian Energy
Minister I.B. Sudjana will jointly preside over the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>A 28-member ROC delegation composed of officials from the MOEA,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Atomic Energy Council, and the
state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. and Taiwan Power Company (Taipower)
will take part in the meeting with a 23-member Indonesian delegation
to discuss issues related to the development of electrical power,
coal mines and natural gas resources.</P>
      <P>Taipower and its Indonesian counterpart are slated to sign a
memorandum of understanding on bilateral exchanges of personnel,
management information and energy development programs during the
meeting.</P>
      <P>The annual conference has been held alternately in Taiwan and
Indonesia since 1990, providing a regular channel of dialogue for the
two countries to hold bilateral consultations on energy development
and related issues.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintains close economic relations with Indonesia, an
official with the Atomic Energy Council said, pointing out that
Taiwan imported 7.6 million barrels of crude oil from that country in
1996 and that the figure for the first nine months of this year has
already amounted to 8.8 million barrels, up 48 percent from the same
period of 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO JOIN AIRBUS NEW PLANE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea's recent financial crisis has
brought a new opportunity to Taiwan's fledgling aerospace industry,
as a major French commercial aircraft manufacturer has decided to
cooperate with Taiwan instead of cash-hungry South Korea to develop
new aircraft models.</P>
      <P>Latecoere Co., France's third-largest commercial airliner
manufacturer, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Republic
of China's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Tuesday expressing
its intention to form strategic alliances with Taiwan firms for the
joint development of new passenger planes.</P>
      <P>The preliminary cooperative agreement was signed at Latecoere
headquarters in the southern French city of Toulouse on Tuesday when
an ROC delegation, headed by Vice Economics Minister Yin Chi-ming,
visited the company.</P>
      <P>Under the accord, Taiwan's state-run Aerospace Industry
Development Corp. (AIDC) will join forces with Latecoere in
participating in Airbus Industrie Group's new commercial aircraft
development project.</P>
      <P>Airbus, the world's second-largest commercial airliner
manufacturer after Boeing Co., and its subsidiaries such as AIR and
ATR, are planning to develop A340-500 and A340-600 wide-body jumbo
jets as well as several new models of regional jets.</P>
      <P>Latecoere is one of Airbus' major contractors, specializing in
producing fuselages. It originally planned to cooperate with major
South Korean aerospace firms in the new Airbus development projects,
but the outbreak of a financial crisis in South Korea early this year
has left many of its large conglomerates or chaebols plagued by a
dire shortage of cash. Against this backdrop, Latecoere decided to
switch to Taiwan to seek possible joint-venture partners.</P>
      <P>Yin said Taiwan so far only has experience in cooperating with
American aerospace companies. "By cooperating with Latecoere, we'll
be able to gain easier access to Europe's aerospace technology," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Latecoere is also the European Union's first commercial aircraft
manufacturer to form cooperative ties with Taiwan. "The partnership
is expected to help open new markets for our aerospace makers," said
David Chu, director of the MOEA's Committee for Aviation and Space
Industry Development (CASID), who is accompanying Yin in France.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CASID has also signed a preliminary industrial
cooperation pact with the Matra Group's defense industry division.
The accord was inked by Yin and Matra Chairman C.O. Thomas at Matra
headquarters on Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the accord, Matra promises to transfer to
private Taiwan companies technical know-how needed to produce spare
parts and components for Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters in order to help
upgrade Taiwan's aerospace technology.</P>
      <P>Yin said Matra is quite strong in the fields of remote control,
space communications and automated technology. Some 30 percent of the
Mirage fighter's core parts and components are supplied by Matra.
"Matra has finally agreed to cooperate with Taiwan companies in
manufacturing Mirage parts and components only after many years of
difficult negotiations," Yin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has ordered 60 Mirage 2000-5s from France as part of its
efforts to beef up its air defense capabilities. More than 10 Mirages
have already been delivered.</P>
      <P>Another French Mirage contractor, CSF Group, which provides
avionics systems, has also expressed interest in developing
cooperative ties with Taiwan firms. If a cooperative deal is struck,
Yin said, CSF will be able to provide Taiwan with expertise for
repair and maintenance of remote control devices, radar, aviation
guidance equipment and other electronics parts.</P>
      <P>However, Yin added: "Further discussion is needed before the two
sides can finalize an accord."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong business tycoon Lim Por-yen was
detained Wednesday morning by the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office
on charges of bribery.</P>
      <P>Lim, chairman of Asia Television (ATV) and Lai Sun Development of
Hong Kong, was taken into custody on charges of bribing Taipei county
government officials with offers of some NT$300 million (US$9.3
million).</P>
      <P>Lim was arrested on Tuesday at Chiang Kai-shek international
airport where he was departing for Hong Kong after visiting Taipei
for several days, during which he attended the Golden Horse movie
awards presentation ceremony on Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to chief prosecutor Hsueh Wei-ping, evidence shows that
Lim offered some NT$300 million to Taipei county government officials
so that his Sanshia-based Dollar Textile manufacturing company --
occupying a tract of several hectares -- could be rezoned to be
included in an area earmarked for development for a proposed National
Taipei University.</P>
      <P>Hsueh pointed out that Chuang Yu-kun, director of the Taipei
County Land Administration Bureau, who was detained earlier this
month for involvement in another land rezoning scandal, received
about NT$100 million from Lim for helping to rezone Lim's factory
from cheap industrial land into commercial and residential land.</P>
      <P>The other NT$200 million, according to Hsueh, was believed to
have been distributed to at least three other county officials, also
as bribes for the rezoning project.</P>
      <P>In addition to illegal rezoning, Chuang and the Taipei County
officials were also accused by prosecutors of excessively assessing
Lim's land and factory facilities, enabling him to receive several
billion NT dollars in cash compensation from the government under a
land acquisition program for the university development plan.</P>
      <P>The National Taipei University development plan has been on the
drawing board for eight years, held up by land acquisition problems
and disputes over land acquisition compensation.</P>
      <P>The university, to be located on a tract of 55 hectares in
Sanshia in the south of Taipei County, is expected to generate
business opportunities worth NT$1.2 billion per year in the Sanshia,
Shulin and Tucheng regions after it is completed.</P>
      <P>The octogenarian Lim is also believed to have bigger wealth other
than the reported multi-billion dollar assets in his Lai Sun Group
and three other Hong Kong listed companies.</P>
      <P>Beginning with garment factories in Hong Kong in the 1950s, Lim
expanded his operations to the real estate business in the 1970s. In
the 1980s, he bought out ATV, to become an entertainment tycoon.</P>
      <P>Lim has operated at least two weaving plants, including Dollar
Textile, in Taiwan. But the plants ceased production in recent years
after Lim relocated their manufacturing facilities to mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIDS PATIENTS LEGALLY PROHIBITED FROM DONATING BLOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan carriers of the AIDS-causing HIV
virus will be legally prohibited from donating blood in order to
protect the health of people who receive blood transfusions,
according to the newly-passed AIDS Prevention Law.</P>
      <P>The revised AIDS Prevention Law, which cleared the legislature
floor on Tuesday, stipulates that HIV carriers or AIDS patients who
make blood donations in an attempt to have their blood checked, will
face jail terms of up to seven years as punishment for disregarding
the health and safety of others, even if the tainted blood has not
been administered.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the non-profit Chunghua Blood Foundation
has repeatedly announced that AIDS patients and HIV carriers are
forbidden to donate blood, some people in this group have continued
to give blood to blood centers, risking the health of other,
otherwise healthy people, a foundation official said.</P>
      <P>AIDS patients and HIV carriers are also prohibited from having
sex or sharing syringes and needles with other people without telling
the truth about their deadly disease. Those caught doing so will also
risk up to seven years behind bars.</P>
      <P>The revised AIDS Prevention Law stipulates that the state-run
Central Health Insurance Bureau will be responsible for checkups and
treatment of the island's AIDS patients and that deceased AIDS
victims will have to be cremated instead of buried. It also states
that AIDS patients should receive equal treatment to healthy people,
and that they are entitled to equal opportunities in schooling,
medical care, and employment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, AIDS screening work conducted by seven medical centers
islandwide last year found that 2 percent, or 25 out of 938 people in
the group categorized as being at high-risk of contracting the
disease were confirmed to have been unknowingly infected. The
high-risk group included homosexuals, heterosexuals, drug abusers,
family members of AIDS patients, prostitutes, and medical personnel.</P>
      <P>Among the group, heterosexuals were found to be most at risk of
contracting AIDS, as some 95 percent of the newly-diagnosed AIDS
patients were heterosexuals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-SWEDISH TIES GROWING STEADILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Substantive relations between the Republic
of China and Sweden have continued to grow steadily over the past
decade, the de facto ROC ambassador to the Scandinavian country said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lu Ping-yen, head of the Taipei Mission in Sweden, told a
Legislative Yuan committee meeting that although the Swedish
authorities are generally friendly toward Taiwan, there is still much
the ROC can do to reinforce bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>As many Swedish companies are scrambling to enter the vast
mainland Chinese market, Lu said, Taiwan must step up efforts to
reinforce trade and economic cooperation with Sweden by increasing
its investments there.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's aggressive diplomatic offensive,
Lu said he hopes more Taiwan business people will travel to Sweden to
explore trade and joint-venture opportunities to help cement two-way
ties.</P>
      <P>Lu, who returned to Taipei earlier this week for home
consultations, said commercial, cultural and tourist exchanges
between the ROC and Sweden have grown steadily since the two
countries exchanged representative offices several years ago. Sweden
has been directly issuing visas in Taipei to prospective ROC visitors
since November 1993.</P>
      <P>Four Swedish parliamentary delegations have visited Taiwan over
the past year, and three ROC Legislative Yuan missions also paid
visits to Sweden this summer, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Swedish parliament formally set up a pro-Taiwan
task force on Nov. 26, comprised of more than 60 Swedish
parliamentarians. Lu said pro-Taiwan Swedish lawmakers have so far
introduced five bills aimed at boosting cooperation with Taiwan in
various fields.</P>
      <P>Lu said the ROC and Sweden have held 13 economic cooperation
conferences and five transportation-related meetings over the past
few years. High-ranking economic officials have also exchanged
frequent visits.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Sweden amounted to US$1.2
billion in 1996, with Taiwan incurring a trade deficit of about
US$400 million. Major Taiwan exports to Sweden included computers and
peripherals, communications equipment, bolts and screws, and
bicycles, while automobiles, paper products, telecommunications
equipment, machinery and steel products formed the bulk of Swedish
exports to Taiwan. Lu said ROC-Swedish trade is expected to grow by 9
percent this year.</P>
      <P>Sweden has maintained full diplomatic ties with mainland China
since May 1950. Their trade volume surpassed ROC-Swedish trade for
the first time in 1992. By 1996, their annual trade had already hit
US$1.78 billion, with Sweden posting a surplus of about US$900
million.</P>
      <P>Sweden joined the European Union (EU) on Jan. 1, 1995 and it
became a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council
(UNSC) in January this year. "As a result, Sweden has to consider
overall EU external policy and its relations with mainland China, a
UNSC permanent member, in formulating its policy toward Taiwan," Lu
said, adding that such considerations have been major hindrances to
upgrading the status of the ROC's representative office in that
country.</P>
      <P>For all the difficulties, Lu said, the Taipei mission in Sweden
will continue to do its utmost to expand contacts with Sweden's
private and public sectors to solicit their support for the ROC's bid
to take part in major international organizations and activities.
"We'll also invite more Swedish politicians, academics, journalists,
business leaders and social celebrities to visit Taiwan to enhance
their understanding of the ROC's general situation and its national
cause and basic policy," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite anticipated pressure on goods
prices following Taiwan's currency devaluation against the US dollar,
prices on the island are not expected to jump precipitously, an
economic official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman for the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), made the remarks while reporting on the impact of
the global financial turmoil on Taiwan's economic development at a
meeting of the ruling Kuomintang's policy-making Central Standing
Committee.</P>
      <P>He said that the New Taiwan dollar has been found to have been
over-devalued, according to a series of assessments of the CEPD and
many professional economic institutes.</P>
      <P>If the Taiwan unit remains in the range of 30-31 to the
greenback, Chiang noted, local prices will not jump by more than 3
percent next year, due to factors such as the NT dollar gains against
Southeast Asian currencies and the South Korean won.</P>
      <P>International crude oil prices are expected to show only a
moderate increase in 1998, while an estimated rise in the
productivity of local manufacturers, and over-production in the
nations of Southeast Asia will also help Taiwan maintain stable
prices, the CEPD leader pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to a CEPD survey of 100 large companies in
the manufacturing sector on the island, the number of businesses
suffering a decline in foreign orders in November was 18 percent
higher than those enjoying increasing orders.</P>
      <P>Local manufacturers likely to suffer shrinking orders registered
21 percent more than those expecting to enjoy gains, the
early-December survey showed, indicating that general exports from
Taiwan are expected to face a slow-down in development.</P>
      <P>However, the survey also showed that around 85 percent of the
businesses polled believe the recent financial storm will not force
any changes in Taiwan's planned domestic investment projects for
1998, seeming to suggest that the financial crisis has had only a
minor impact on the country's manufacturing sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARATS DENIES CHAIRMAN'S RESIGNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking official of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) denied on
Tuesday that ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, mainland China's top
negotiator with Taiwan, resigned from his post in mid-November.</P>
      <P>ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei told the Taiwan press in a
telephone interview that "he has never heard of such a thing," and
that "Wang remains in very good shape."</P>
      <P>Tang's remarks came after a Hong Kong-based magazine reported in
its latest edition which hit newsstands on Tuesday that Wang had
tendered his resignation on Nov. 24 for health reasons.</P>
      <P>The report said Wang had come under strong criticism from ranking
Beijing officials for remarks on the controversial "one China issue"
which he allegedly made to Hsu Li-nung, chairman of the New
Tungmenhui, a Taiwan-based pro-unification political group, during a
Nov. 16 meeting in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Wang had been reported earlier as telling Hsu in the meeting that
"one China" is a unified entity comprising the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, a different slant on Beijing's normal stance on the
subject.</P>
      <P>Tang denied the reports and said that although conditions are not
yet ripe for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume talks, the
mainland Chinese side is preparing to conduct preparatory
consultations with Taiwan in order to open bilateral negotiations on
political issues under the framework set up by the ARATS and its
Taiwan counterpart -- the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>He stressed that the structure of bilateral negotiations remains
unchanged and added that mainland China has never changed its stance
and attitude toward the disputed "one China issue."</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are the semiofficial organizations authorized
by Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle bilateral exchanges in
the absence of government-to-government contacts between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Regular SEF-ARATS talks were unilaterally suspended by Beijing
after ROC President Lee Teng-hui paid a visit to the United States in
1995.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu met his mainland counterpart Wang for

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR TIMELY MEASURES TO WARD OFF FINANCIAL CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday urged
relevant government agencies to study the causes of the recent
financial crises in many Asian countries and work out precautionary
measures to fend off the occurrence of any similar fiasco in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Lee gave the directives in his capacity as chairman of
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) after hearing a report on the latest
international financial trends and Taiwan's economic outlook by P.K.
Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), at a weekly meeting of the KMT Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Lee said the government's economic and financial departments have
so far performed well in coping with the recent region-wide financial
storm.</P>
      <P>"The government has managed to respect the market mechanism while
maintaining domestic financial stability amid the regional financial
turbulence," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The president, who has a doctorate in agricultural economy,
suggested that domestic financial authorities take even more active
measures to maintain a mature, healthy economic climate that will
ensure steady economic growth.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Lee said, the Central Bank of China should consider
further lowering of the bank reserve requirements, while the Ministry
of Finance can ease restrictions on stock investment by local banks
and accelerate screening of applications for establishing mutual
funds to invest in the local bourse. "These measures will help
stabilize the local securities market and sustain our economic
growth," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chiang said at the KMT meeting that Taiwan's economic growth rate
will be able to exceed 6 percent next year, despite the financial
turmoil in the rest of the region.</P>
      <P>"Our 1998 economic growth rate is expected to fall between 6.3
and 6.7 percent," Chiang forecast optimistically, adding that his
forecast is based on a combination of factors.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Chiang said, several large private and public
investment projects, including construction of a high-speed railway
and a high-tech industrial park in southern Taiwan, will be launched
next year, which will be a driving force to bolster Taiwan's economic
growth.</P>
      <P>Other factors which will contribute to Taiwan's economic growth
include a continued rise in labor productivity, stable wages and an
anticipated drop in labor costs, Chiang noted, adding that the
government's strenuous efforts to improve the investment climate will
also help stimulate private investment.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the Asian financial storm has so far only had a
limited adverse impact on Taiwan's economy, even though the
depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar has triggered rises in local
interest rates and the wholesale price index.</P>
      <P>The cabinet's chief economic planner warned that the
competitiveness of local petrochemical, food processing and steel
industries may be somewhat weakened by the recent financial storm.
"Nevertheless, the impact will remain limited," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chiang further said the depreciation of the NT dollar against the
US dollar is not expected to fuel strong inflationary pressure
because of stable international crude oil prices and over-production
of some raw materials in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Except for the United States, Taiwan's major import sources also
include Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asian countries. The NT
dollar has appreciated significantly against the South Korean won and
the currencies of several Southeast Asian countries, while its parity
rate with the Japanese yen remains almost unchanged. "All these
factors will help minimize the adverse effects of the NT dollar's
devaluation against the greenback," Chiang explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GLOBAL TRADE IN GOODS UP 5 %</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Maurus  Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World trade in goods grew by 5 percent in
volume terms last year, slightly below the average for the five
previous years, but appears to have accelerated again in 1997,
according to reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Giving his annual overview of developments in the international
trade system to WTO members, Renato Ruggiero, WTO director general,
said that 1997 was a good year for trade.</P>
      <P>Although he gave no estimates, he said both world trade and
output were likely to be higher this year than in 1996, when they
rose by 5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>However, Ruggiero warned that East Asia's financial crisis could
lead to an expansion of exports from the region and a slowing in
import demand in the coming year. He urged other WTO members to show
understanding and appealed to East Asian governments not to reverse
economic liberalization which, he said, could inhibit longer-term
recovery prospects.</P>
      <P>According to the WTO, 1997 has already seen a narrowing of
regional differences in economic performance, with slower though
still strong growth in East Asia, continuing rapid growth in Latin
America, and stronger economic activity in western and eastern Europe
compared with 1996.</P>
      <P>The overall improvement in economic performance will spill over
into improved real export growth for 1997, the WTO said, although the
value of exports may grow more slowly because of the continued
appreciation of the dollar.</P>
      <P>In 1996, dollar appreciation and lower prices for some
commodities and semi-manufactured goods lowered the growth by value
of world merchandise trade to only 4 percent. Nevertheless, the total
value of exports topped the US$5,000 billion mark for the first time,
at US$5,120 billion.</P>
      <P>Exports of commercial services grew by 5 percent in value terms
last year to reach US$1,260 billion. This was well down from the 14
percent growth recorded in 1995, although much of the difference is
accounted for by the rise in the dollar.</P>
      <P>Commercial services trade rose particularly fast in Latin America
and Asia, up by 8 percent last year, the WTO report said.</P>

      <P>This was the first time the de facto American embassy in Taipei

drug trafficking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>AIT spokesperson Susan Stahl confirmed that Johnson met with Liao

      <P>According to media sources, a US Federal Bureau of Investigation
agent stationed at the American Embassy in Japan was also present at
the Johnson-Liao meeting.</P>
      <P>The reports said Johnson had exchanged views with Liao on how to
strengthen bilateral anti-crime operations in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties between Taipei and Washington.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Liao reportedly expressed the ROC government's
desire to sign an agreement to facilitate joint crime-fighting
operations.</P>
      <P>As the meeting took place one day after a noted Hong Kong
business tycoon was detained by ROC law-enforcement authorities for
alleged involvement in a corruption scandal stemming from a land deal
in Taipei County, local media said Liao and Johnson might have
discussed possible cooperation in investigating illegal money
laundering.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The slide of the Hong Kong stock market is
a short-term phenomenon, and the territory's bourse should be back on
track within six months, participants in a seminar said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>That view was expressed by a group of scholars and experts from
Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as government officials from the Central
Bank of China, Ministry of Finance and the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, during a seminar on the implication of
financial turmoil on the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>William Li, director of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Department of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, said there was also a
consensus among the participants that mainland China's currency will
not be devalued in the short term. The seminar was sponsored by the
MAC.</P>
      <P>Li said the meeting examined the factors which caused the recent
slide of the Hong Kong bourse, the future direction of that stock
market, the effect of the Asian financial turmoil on Hong Kong's role
as an international financial hub, and the overall economic
implications of pegging of the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar.</P>
      <P>Li pointed out that after the reversion of Hong Kong to mainland
Chinese rule last July, the Hang Seng index had risen to 16,000,
which he said was a departure from the fundamentals, and that the
recent slide merely reflected a correction of that trend.</P>
      <P>Thus, analysts predicted that if the territory's economic base
remains sound, the stock market in Hong Kong will be back on a steady
course within six months.</P>
      <P>The participants believed that the pegging of Hong Kong's
currency to the US dollar has contributed significantly to financial
stability in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). If
the SAR government abandons such linkage and allows a devaluation of
the HK dollar, they said that would stimulate exports on a limited
basis, but would also trigger import-induced inflation and increase
the foreign debt burden.</P>
      <P>Li said the participants also believed that the exchange rate of
the mainland currency will not be readjusted in the short term. They
predicted that Beijing will maintain stringent foreign exchange
controls and continue to register huge trade surpluses.</P>

      <P>US President Bill Clinton said Tuesday
that the United States has not changed its position on the security
of Taiwan and would view any resolution of the Taiwan issue by force
with the "greatest possible concern."</P>
      <P>In response to questions on relations between Taiwan and mainland

Department, Clinton pointed out that the whole framework of America's
relations with mainland China is embodied in the three joint
communiques between Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Within that framework, he said, the United States recognizes "one
China," while Beijing makes a commitment to a peaceful resolution of

      <P>Roughly 9,000 of the genes had never been described before in any
organ -- a significant addition to what scientists believe are the
75,000 to 100,000 genes that regulate the human body's development
and functions, the daily said.</P>
      <P>In terms of long-term medical significance, American scientists
say the work is a "milestone in the development of a new science
called molecular cardiology," according to the report.</P>
      <P>A companion piece to the main thesis states: "In essence,
although this database has presented us with the advantages of a
dictionary of molecules, our scientific aspirations are to use this
to create great novels, i.e., to use these molecules to answer
critical problems in cardio-vascular biology and medicine."</P>
      <P>The report said the researchers "used their database to pinpoint
100 genes that their initial surveys suggest are involved in
congestive heart failure."</P>
      <P>The paper was co-authored by David Hwang and Adam Dempsey. Hwang,
a graduate student at the University of Toronto, said only 10 of
these genes have previously been linked to heart failure.</P>
      <P>Moreover, while the ordering or the relative importance of these
genes is still unknown, simply finding a "gene complex" creates its
own variety of heretofore unknown scientific issues, the report
added.</P>
      <P>The newspaper called the Toronto group's findings "a
technological tour de force," adding that they also represent the
fruits of an unusual collaboration in which institutions in both
China and Hong Kong gave research grants to support basic science in
Canada.</P>
      <P>The publication of the paper in open scientific literature is
also being praised for its altruism, especially since a Toronto
company contributed C$1 million to the research project.</P>
      <P>As one scientist said: "At a time when most comprehensive tissue
and disease-related databases remain in the private domain of
biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms, it is particularly admirable
that a database of this size has been introduced into the public
domain."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Financial crisis griped South Korea brings
about a wonderful opportunity for Taiwan firms to get that country's
technology know-how and marketing skill in semiconductor, automobile
parts and railroad cars maintenance, but better do so only after Feb.
21 when Seoul swears in a new president, said an economic official
here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Listing semiconductor, auto parts and railroad car maintenance as
the three categories most worthwhile to invest for Taiwan firms, Chen
Min-hsiang, a Board of Foreign Trade official told reporters that
Taiwan imported more than NT$70 billion (US$2.12 billion) worth of
auto parts from South Korea thus far this year, and has bought from
South Korea NT$600 million (US$18.18 million) -worth of railroad cars
which still need the regular maintenance of its manufacturers.</P>
      <P>As to South Korea's semiconductor industry, it ranks third in the
world said Chen who has just returned on Monday from a fact-finding
trip to Seoul.</P>
      <P>In light of the South Korea's financial crisis which has seen its
currency devalued by more than 50 percent, Chen encouraged Taiwan
investors to venture into the Korea markets which is starved of hard
currency necessary to meet its short-term debts.</P>
      <P>The crisis takes a heavy toll on South Korea's business. Five
huge trade firms have declared bankruptcies on top of some 1,400
small and medium sized business firms that have gone out of business.
The number of South Korean banks with the authority to negotiate has
been cut down from 30 to four, all of them were overseas-based,
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>As the financial woe is not troublesome enough, political
uncertainty ahead of Thursday's presidential elections deepen the
crisis with different candidates prescribing different remedies for
the country's tattering economy, said Chen.</P>
      <P>He suggested local businessmen who are interested in acquiring
South Korea firms throwing in their money only after a new president
takes office and set out his economy policy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang on Wednesday
announced a major personnel reshuffle aimed at streamlining its party
apparatus in the aftermath of its embarrassing defeat in the Nov. 29
nationwide mayoral and county magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>The reshuffle involved four departments at the KMT headquarters
-- the organization affairs department, the secretariat, the cultural
affairs department and the Sun Yat-sen Institution on Policy Research
and Development.</P>
      <P>The party's decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC)
approved the personnel reshuffle at its weekly meeting chaired by
President Lee Teng-hui, who concurrently serves as KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>Lee lauded the reshuffle, including the appointment of a woman as
the party's spokesperson, which he described as "bold and daring."</P>
      <P>"All four newly appointed KMT department chiefs are top-notch
party workers. I'm confident that they will be able to fulfill their
duties," Lee said at the CSC meeting.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General John Chang, who assumed his post earlier
this month, said he personally initiated the new lineup after
extensive consultations with party elders as well as grassroots party
workers.</P>
      <P>Chang said there will be another round of personnel changes
following the Jan. 20 elections for township chiefs and city and
county councilors.</P>
      <P>Most prominent among the latest personnel changes was the
replacement of the party's official spokesperson or director of the
cultural affairs department.</P>
      <P>Huamg Li-ching, 42, who currently serves as deputy director of
the KMT women's affairs department and head of the party's Taoyuan
branch, will succeed Tsai Pi-huang as the KMT's spokesperson and
director of the cultural affairs department.</P>
      <P>Huang, a graduate of the Central Police College, will be the
103-year-old party's first female spokesperson.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who has been criticized for his sometimes loose remarks,
will replace Chuang Hui-yi as director-general of the Sun Yat-sen
Institution on Policy Research and Department.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chun-chan, a law-enforcement officer turned
legislator, will replace Hsu Wen-chih as director of the
organizational affairs.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, a former chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council and a legal expert, will assume the post as
the director-general of the party's secretariat. Shi lost his bid
for the magistrate post in his native Nantou County in the Nov. 29
local elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LATE 'BANANA KING' CHEN CHA-MOU REMAINS UNBURIED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By  Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four years after the death of billionaire
Chen Cha-mou, his remains have yet to be interred because of
disputes among his children over the burial site and rights to his
inheritance, Taipei City Councilor Lin Juei-tu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin visited Chen's former mansion in Yangmingshan, suburban
Taipei, where his coffin has laid for over four years.</P>
      <P>Lin said the body of Chen, who made his fortune selling bananas
to Japan and has been dubbed the "Taiwan banana king," has been
embalmed and the coffin is sealed, thus there is no hygiene problem.</P>
      <P>But he urged Chen's children to fulfill their filial duty so that
their father can be put to final rest.</P>
      <P>A governess said that since Chen's death on Aug. 9, 1993, his
body has laid in the old mansion, adding that she and a butler light
incense for him every day. "None of Chen's children lives here," she
said.</P>
      <P>Lin said Chen Ching-chung, Chen's third son, has insisted that
his father be buried together with his grandmother and mother at a
family graveyard in Yangmingshan, saying that the "feng shui," or
geomantic qualities, of the location are most suitable.</P>
      <P>But Chen Chien-chung, Chen's eldest son, said his father had
hoped to be buried on Kuangyin Mountain, but died without declaring
so in a will.</P>
      <P>After Chen's death, his children also squabbled over their
rightful share of the inheritance, and the case has gone to court.</P>
      <P>Councilor Lin, who wants to help resolve the problem after it
recently came to light through media reports, said the nation's Civil
Code stipulates that, in circumstances as those in Chen's case, the
children of the deceased must share responsibility for handling the
remains.</P>
      <P>A Taipei City official in charge of funeral-related affairs said
there is presently no legal provision to force a burial, and thus he
can do nothing about the matter.</P>
      <P>Lin said that as it will take too long to review relevant
statutes, he plans to ask Vice President Lien Chan, whose daughter is
married to Chen's grandson, to intervene in sorting out the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA WILL NOT DEVALUE CURRENCY TO MAINTAIN GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will boost domestic
demand by increasing spending on infrastructural development, rather
than devalue its currency to spur exports, in order to maintain
economic growth in the face of the current Asian financial crisis, a
leading Asian analyst said.</P>
      <P>Daryl Ho, regional economist of the Hong Kong-based Jardine
Fleming Group, said this was because mainland economic planners can
control only fixed capital formation, The Straits Times reported
Wednesday in a dispatch from Beijing.</P>
      <P>He ruled out domestic consumption as an engine of growth, citing
levels of massive unemployment. Consumer spending is expected to
achieve only single-digit growth in the short term.</P>
      <P>He said that over the longer term, however, measures have to be
taken to stimulate such consumption because it will be difficult to
sustain investment spending.</P>
      <P>Mainland China will finance the infrastructural spending through
its huge pool of domestic savings, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that a slowdown in investments from South Korea
and Japan, reeling under the crisis, will not have a major impact on
mainland China's foreign investments, as 70 percent of it comes from
Hong Kong and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Foreign investments, affected by tax changes last year, were
already declining before the crisis erupted, he noted.</P>
      <P>The South Korean meltdown has made mainland China's economic
planners painfully aware of its similarities to its East Asian
neighbor, in particular the cozy relations between the government and
business enterprises.</P>
      <P>The analyst said he expected Beijing to speed up reforms,
especially in the banking system. Reforms which are needed include
granting loans based on commercial considerations rather than
officials' whims.</P>
      <P>"Whether that can in fact be achieved is a different question,"
he was quoted as commenting.</P>
      <P>In addition, officials will be more conservative now about making
the mainland currency fully convertible. For instance, it is unlikely
that they will merge the country's domestic and foreign stocks in the
next two to three years.</P>
      <P>He said he does not expect mainland China to devalue the renminbi
as it will still enjoy a large balance of payments surplus next year,
despite reduced exports and investment inflows.</P>
      <P>Overall, as exports contribute 10 percent to 15 percent to the
economy, Beijing will focus on the remaining 85 percent and boost
domestic demand, he commented.</P>
      <P>He predicted that mainland China's economy will grow by 9 percent
in 1997 and 8 percent in 1998.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIAO SETS CONDITIONS FOR DELAYING OR SUSPENDING REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
magistrate-elect in Taichung County, Liao Yung-lai, said on Wednesday
that if two conditions are met, a proposed referendum on German-based
Bayer Group's investment project in his county could be delayed or
suspended.</P>
      <P>After a meeting with Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, Liao said that if a review of the
project by a special task force favors the company's environmental
safeguards, and if approval of a lease for construction of chemical
plants under the plan is not rushed through the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly this week, he will not insist on putting the issue to a
public vote.</P>
      <P>Liao stressed that he will take responsibility in forming a task
force of chemical experts to gain a better understanding into and
conduct a thorough examination of Bayer's first investment in Taiwan.
If the investigation finds Bayer's planned operations are unlikely to
produce excessive levels of pollution or pose a threat to public
safety, Liao said he will not hesitate to also explain those facts to
his constituents.</P>
      <P>However, before such steps are taken, Liao said, he hopes the
provincial assembly will delay screening the Taiwan Provincial
Government-approved contract under which provincial-owned land in the
Taichung Harbor area will be leased to Bayer Group for a period of 50
years for the purpose of constructing chemical plants.</P>
      <P>The assembly, which is scheduled to close its current session on
Friday, has the final say on the fate of the land lease agreement.</P>
      <P>Liao said he and Chiang both agree that the Bayer's NT$49 billion
investment project is important to the continued economic development
of Taiwan as well as Taichung County. But as many local residents
continue to have misgivings over the project, more efforts should be
made to communicate with the public, he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he believes his meeting with Liao was helpful to
finding workable solutions to the dispute. Asked if Bayer will
consider withdrawing the investment proposal if the land lease is not
obtained by year's end, Chiang said he will attempt to persuade the
multinational giant not to make such a decision so hastily.</P>
      <P>Since so much time has already been put into planning the
project, Bayer should give the provincial assembly more time to
discuss the matter and, in the meantime, keep good communications
with the residents of Taichung County, Chiang added.</P>

      <P>Legislator Lu Shiu-i may be near the end of
his life, but he hopes other lung cancer patients may benefit from
his final endeavors.</P>
      <P>Lu has handed a brochure promoting a charity concert to each
visitor at his bedside recently, earnestly inviting them to attend
the event.</P>
      <P>Though weakened by lung cancer, the legislator wants others to
have healthy lungs, Lee Yuan-chih, a doctor at the National Taiwan
University Hospital said.</P>
      <P>Lee, who also serves as the chairman of a lung transplant
foundation, said that Lu has controlled his condition reasonably well
over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Lu took the initiative for organizing the fundraiser in
September, saying that the White Heron Foundation, chaired by his
pianist wife Chen Yu-hsiu, wanted to raise money for lung cancer
patients at its annual concert. The legislator said he hoped to help
others who needed lung transplant operations.</P>
      <P>However, doctors soon found that Lu's cancer had spread to the
brain.</P>
      <P>Yet, the onslaught of the cancer has not dampened the enthusiasm
of Lu, who has been one of the most outspoken advocates for public
interests in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee said he cannot but admire Lu, although he feels pity
because, in the terminal stages of cancer, Lu is no longer suitable
to receive a lung transplant.</P>
      <P>Lee also lamented the fact that Lu's efforts may not even raise
enough for one lung transplant operation, estimated to cost up to
NT$3 million (US$92,3076).</P>
      <P>The charity concert will be held at Dec. 28 at the National

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is to bring in 2,100 more foreign
domestic helpers while scaling down the number of alien laborers,
according to a new policy currently under study.</P>
      <P>Chang Chang-chi, vice chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs,
said in a briefing to a Cabinet panel Wednesday that a poll conducted
by the council had found more than 19,000 Taiwan households urgently
need domestic helpers, or 2,100 more than the ceiling of 16,900
provided under the current regulations.</P>
      <P>Local sanitariums, nursing homes and other facilities which are
seriously understaffed will be open to licensed foreign caregivers
under the new plan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the number of foreign laborers employed in the
construction and manufacturing industries, presently standing at
4,378 and 159,970 respectively, will be frozen and eventually reduced
after current contracts expire in order to make room for local
workers in those sectors.</P>
      <P>Under the council's new plan, the quota of foreign laborers for
these two sectors will be lowered by 5 percent from current levels.</P>
      <P>However, contractors for major investment projects, those with a
capitalization of more than NT$200 million (US$6.06 million), will be
allowed to import foreign labor without being subject to the
limitation.</P>
      <P>Service industry businesses, including financial institutions and
insurance companies, which are eager to hire managerial staff from
overseas, will remain off-limits to foreign white-collar workers, in
order to provide incentives to local professionals in these sectors.</P>
      <P>In order to rid the island of dead-end and environmentally
unfriendly industries, enterprises in those areas will be prevented
from using cheaper overseas foreign labor to cling to life, according
to the new plan.</P>
      <P>The policy is expected to be finalized and take effect early next

      <P>Siew said that as relations between Taiwan and Argentina in

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), a powerful group of nine developing countries, agreed to
accelerate the reduction of regional tariffs to combat their economic
crisis, an influential European newspaper reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN member countries had decided at a summit meeting to
import more from their member countries because sharp depreciation of
several currencies against the US dollar had made regional goods
cheaper, the Financial Times said.</P>
      <P>"We do not have the foreign exchange to buy from outside the
region," the Financial Times quoted Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian
prime minister, as saying. He insisted the agreement did not mean
that ASEAN was turning into an exclusive trade bloc.</P>
      <P>ASEAN, which comprises Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore,
the Philippines, Vietnam, Burma, Laos and Brunei, has set a target of
bringing tariffs down to less than 5 percent by 2003 on almost all
items traded within the group. Imports from outside ASEAN are subject
to different, generally higher, duties.</P>
      <P>Officials said it was possible the 2003 deadline could be brought
forward but they added this was an issue for economic ministers to
decide at a later date. Mahathir indicated that ASEAN's drive to buy
more from within the region could be extended to include purchases
from mainland China, Japan and South Korea for certain items.</P>
      <P>The leaders of mainland China, South Korea and Japan are also
attending ASEAN's informal summit, which was called to celebrate the
30th anniversary of the Southeast Asian group. It is the first time
the leaders of Asia's most powerful nations have met without US
participation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IRANIAN SWINDLING RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police have busted an Iranian swindling
ring in Taipei and arrested three key suspects, the foreign affairs
department under the National Police Administration (NPA) announced
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since their arrival on Dec. 12, NPA officials said, the three
Iranians have stolen more than NT$100,000 (US$3,076.92) from a dozen
local shops by pretending to convert their US dollar holdings into
New Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>The trio, identified as Fereyboun, his wife Lailla and friend
Motpaba, were caught red-handed on Wednesday evening when they were
stealing some NT$36,000 from a cashbox at a convenience store in
downtown Taipei. The trio took a baby girl with them in an attempt to
distract the shopkeepers.</P>
      <P>NPA officials said the group arrived at the store driving a
rented car. Fereyboun first approached a shopkeeper asking to convert
a greenback note into local currency. His accomplices then approached
the cashbox and stole the money while the shopkeeper was busy talking
with Fereyboun.</P>
      <P>Police said the trio have used this method to steal money from at
least 10 local stores, including a Japanese food restaurant, a
bowling alley, motorcycle shops and several convenience stores. The
Iranians usually used the pretext of converting US cash into NT
dollars, but they sometimes asked to change a NT$1,000 bill into
smaller denominations. In some cases, they even asked shopowners to
give them bills bearing serial numbers starting with a specific
English letter.</P>
      <P>NPA officials urged local shopkeepers to remain alert when
approached by foreigners or strangers seeking to convert currency in
order to prevent financial losses.</P>
      <P>The NPA's foreign affairs department set up a special task force
in November to shadow suspicious visitors from the Middle East as
there have been signs that criminal rings from the region have
resumed activities in Taiwan since this summer, law-enforcement
authorities said.</P>

of trade workshops, such as the current one which attracted the
Fujitsu Group subsidiary to Taiwan in search of suppliers.</P>
      <P>Fujitsu Peripherals, founded in 1984, currently employs around
800 personnel to manufacture computer monitors, LCD projection
devices, printers and motherboards. Its 1996 turnover reached 50
billion Japanese yen, 60 percent of which came from sales of
monitors, according to CETRA.</P>
      <P>In order to accommodate rapidly expanding production, the

      <P>Wei Jingsheng, mainland China's most famous
dissident, has accepted an invitation to visit France on Jan. 14,
l998, according to the French National Assembly.</P>
      <P>The legislative body passed a resolution introduced by a liberal
congressman to formally invite Wei to France so that he can relate to
the sympathetic French people his story of sacrifice and struggle for
human rights and democracy in mainland China, reports from the
assembly said.</P>
      <P>Wei will also be asked about present human rights conditions in
the mainland and the possibilities for improvement, as well as about
future prospects for the democratic movement there.</P>
      <P>After spending 18 years in prison for his advocacy of human
rights and democracy in the Chinese mainland, Wei was released on
"medical parole" on Nov. 16 and went to the United States.</P>
      <P>Since his release, Wei has been received as a mentor within the
exiled Chinese pro-democratic movement. It is expected that his visit

    <HEADLINE>BAYER SAYS LAND-LEASE AGREEMENT CRUCIAL TO INVESTMENT PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The German-based Bayer Group will withdraw
plans for its investment project in central Taiwan if the Taiwan
Provincial Government fails to approve a land-lease agreement, a
representative for Bayer said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Company spokesman Chen Chia-chung made the statement at a public
hearing on the controversial project convened by the opposition New
Party caucus in the Taiwan Provincial Assembly.</P>
      <P>The assembly is due to review a Taiwan Provincial
Government-approved contract under which provincial-owned land in the
Taichung Harbor area will be leased to the multinational chemical
giant for a period of 50 years for the purpose of constructing a
chemical plant.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Horst Mueck, chairman and president of Bayer
Taiwan Co., "has his back to the wall now," and that if Bayer fails
even to procure land for the facility, it can hardly talk about
future investment plans, much less actual construction work for the
project.</P>
      <P>Sung Ai-ke, New Party assemblyman who convened the public
hearing, questioned why Bayer ha
d not sought to communicate with the
provincial assembly earlier, but is now attempting to pressure the
lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>Chou Shih-chang of the ruling Kuomintang said the dispute
surrounding Bayer's investment project has arisen from a campaign in
Taichung County to hold a referendum to decide the fate of the NT$49
billion (US$1.5 billion) project.</P>
      <P>Chou said it is not fair for provincial assembly to shoulder the
entire responsibility for the outcome of the matter.</P>
      <P>Tsao Chi-hung of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party said
his party would not be influenced by what he called threats from
Bayer to cancel the project on the eve of the decision on the
land-leasing contract.</P>
      <P>The assembly, which is scheduled to close its current session on
Friday, will have the final say on the land-lease contract.</P>
      <P>After meeting with P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), on Wednesday night,
Taichung County Magistrate-elect Liao Yung-lai of the DPP said that
he will not insist on putting the issue to a public vote if a task
force okays Bayer's environmental safeguard proposals, and if
approval of the leasing agreement is not rammed through the assembly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTMENT WILLINGNESS NOT AFFECTED BY FINANCIAL CRISIS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent Asian financial crisis has not
affected local manufacturers' investment willingness, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council conducted a telephone poll of senior
executives from 100 large local manufacturing companies early this
month with a view to understand the impact of the regionwide
financial storm on trade and investment activities.</P>
      <P>Eighty-four percent of those interviewed said they will not
change their domestic investment plans set to be launched next year
as a result of the recent Asian financial turbulence.</P>
      <P>Only 8 percent indicated they may scale back future domestic
investments because of the economic difficulties. However, roughly
the same number of respondents said they plan to increase domestic
investment in the coming years.</P>
      <P>"The survey results indicate that the Asian financial crisis has
not weakened local manufacturers' confidence in the domestic
investment climate," a CEPD official noted.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, investors in heavy industries are less
likely to revise plans than are their counterparts in light
industries.</P>
      <P>The same survey also found that about one-third of the
respondents expect export orders to decrease over the next three
months (December through February 1998). As a result, these
manufacturers said they plan to lower export prices in order to
upgrade competitiveness in the world market.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, 34 percent forecast that they
would receive fewer export orders in the coming three months; 53
percent said they believe orders will remain almost the same; while
13 percent said they expect orders to increase during the
December-February period.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy was that 35 percent of companies with Southeast
Asia as their main export markets foresee a decrease in export
orders, while none of them expects a surge in new orders.</P>
      <P>An even higher 38 percent of companies with Hong Kong (including
mainland China) as their major export outlet predicted that orders
for the next three months will decline, while 12 percent said they
believe new orders will continue to rise.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said the figures indicate that, under the cloud of
regional financial disturbances, local manufacturers are not
optimistic about prospects for exports to Southeast Asia and Hong
Kong for the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>Some local manufacturers foresee a slowdown in mainland China's
exports for the next year because the mainland currency has
appreciated significantly against major Southeast Asian currencies,
which could undermine the competitiveness of mainland products and
thus cut mainland China's demand for intermediary materials from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, more than half of those surveyed,
particularly those eyeing Hong Kong and European markets, have
decided to cut export prices in order to maintain their market
presence. Hong Kong is a major conduit for indirect trade across the
Taiwan Strait as Taiwan still bans direct trade, postal and
transportation links with mainland China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office has asked a
close associate of Hong Kong business tycoon Lim Por Yen to come
forward and clarify his role in a local land rezoning scandal.</P>
      <P>Chief Prosecutor Hsueh Wei-ping said the man, surnamed Ho, had
brokered a deal to bribe Taipei County administrators so that land
housing Lim's Sanhsia-based Dollar Textile Manufacturing Co. could be
rezoned to be included in an area earmarked for development as part
of a proposed National Taipei University.</P>
      <P>Lim, the 83-year-old chairman of Asian Television (ATV) and Lai
Sun Development of Hong Kong, was arrested Wednesday morning by the
Taipei District Prosecutor's Office on charges of bribery.</P>
      <P>Lim had been detained on Tuesday at CKS International Airport as
he was returning to Hong Kong after visiting Taipei. During his stay
in Taiwan, Lim attended the Golden Horse film industry awards
ceremony on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said Ho had bribed Chuan Yu-kun, director of the Taipei
County Land Administration Bureau, into making a fraudulent
assessment of the value of Lim's land and factory facilities. That
enabled Lim to receive several billion NT dollars in compensation
from the government under a land acquisition program for the
university development plan in Sanhsia, Taipei County. Investigators
are also looking into charges of illegal money laundering in
connection with the scam.</P>
      <P>The university plan has been on the drawing board for eight
years, held up by land acquisition problems and disputes over
compensation to landowners.</P>
      <P>Hsueh urged Ho, who is presently in Hong Kong, to come to Taiwan
as soon as possible to answer investigators' questions.</P>
      <P>In view of Ho's suspected role in the case, Hsueh said he will
not rule out seeking means to persuade other individuals involved in
the scandal to cooperate with the prosecutor's office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN MEETS SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seoul,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kim Dae-jung, the leading opposition
candidate in the current South Korean presidential race, said on
Thursday that if he wins the election, he plans to take steps to
improve relations between South Korea and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kim, 72, made the statement when he met with Hsu Hsin-liang,
chairman of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
who arrived here earlier this week to observe campaign activities in
the run-up to the Dec. 18 South Korean presidential election.</P>
      <P>Kim and Hsu are old friends. During their talks, Kim lauded
Taiwan for its vibrant small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
solid economic development and smooth democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>The spiritual leader of South Korean political dissent said
now-jailed former President Roh Tae-woo had committed a mistake when
he cut diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan in
1992.</P>
      <P>Kim said South Korea has much to learn from Taiwan's SME
developmental experience. In South Korea, he said, political forces
have often intervened in economic activities. The South Korean
government has wasted many national resources by giving favors to the
country's dozen or so large conglomerates, or chaebols, while
neglecting the development of SMEs, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Kim said if he is elected, he will overhaul South Korea's
development strategy and promote simultaneous and parallel economic
and political reforms.</P>
      <P>Kim said although South Korea has undergone fast-paced
democratization at the central level, its democratization at the
local level only began two years ago.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Kim said, Taiwan has long implemented democratic
elections at local levels, laying a solid foundation for its overall
political development.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Kim, who has been jailed and forced to live in
exile for many years due to his pro-democracy stance, said Taiwan
would become a mature democracy only after its opposition party comes
to power.</P>
      <P>Later on Thursday, Hsu met with another opposition South Korean
presidential candidate, Rhee In-je of the New People's Party, for
wide-ranging talks. He also paid a visit to a senior official of
South Korea's ruling Grand National Party in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Hsu, accompanied by several senior DPP officials, arrived in
Seoul on Tuesday. The DPP delegation will leave for Japan on Friday,
where the group will meet with several influential Japanese
politicians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>16TH ROUND OF ROC-US WTO TALKS ENDS WITH SATISFACTORY RESULTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 16th round of negotiations between
the Republic of China and the United States over terms for Taiwan to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO) concluded on Wednesday with
satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>"The two-and-half-day talks have achieved major breakthroughs on
many topics related to protocal issues, government procurements and
insurance market opening," said Chen Ruey-long, head of the ROC
delegation.</P>
      <P>Chen, also director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, told
a news conference at the end of meeting that the two sides still
need consultations on certain policy-related issues, such as staging
of tariff reduction for a number of sensitive agricultural and
industrial products and opening of professional services.</P>
      <P>"We'll discuss unsolved thorny issues via fax and hope to work
out mutually acceptable measures before the end of next January,"
Chen said, adding that if all technical issues can be settled by
then, ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang will travel to
Washington, D. C. next February to seek major breakthroughs on
policy-related issues, particularly those related to tariff-quota
administration on imports of such sensitive products as rice,
alcohol, tobacco, pork, chicken meat and animal intestines.</P>
      <P>During his February visit, Wang is expected to meet with the US
Trade Representative to push for an early conculsion of the bilateral
WTO talks to facilitate Taiwan's entry to the Geneva-based world
trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Chen outlined the concrete results achieved at the 16th round of
talks as follows:</P>
      <P>-- On government procurement-related issues, Taiwan has
agreed to open more industrial products to foreign bidders two
years after its WTO entry.</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan will revise its insurance law after entering the WTO
to allow foreign mutual insurance companies with net worth of more
than NT$2 billion (US$61.35 million) to open branches in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan will open its markets to foreign-made motorcycles with
150 cc engines or larger two eyars after its WTO accession and to
finalize necessary reforms of its commercial port construction
surcharge collection system within 15 months following its WTO
entry.</P>
      <P>--Taiwan has also promised to scrap a regulation requiring coal
importers to simultaneously purchase Taiwan-produced coal and to
sign an international commercial aircraft agreement immediately
after it joins the WTO.</P>
      <P>Chen said staging of tariff reduction for certain sensitive
agricultural and industrial products remains the greatest obstacle
in ROC-US WTO talks. The United States demanded that Taiwan
gradually lower its tariff rates on a number of agricultural and
industrial products to WTO standards by 2004 and that tariff cuts
for most of those products should be completed by 2002. Taiwan has
difficulties meeting such deadlines, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The US is one of the three WTO members that have yet to finalize
bilateral accession terms negotiations with the ROC. The other two
are the 15-member European Union and Switzerland.</P>

      <P>Officials and experts in health,
agriculture, police administration, customs and quarantine affairs
from all over the nation gathered on Thursday to try to figure out a
way of preventing an epidemic of the "bird flu" which has afflicted
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) under the Executive Yuan, which
convened the meeting, emphasized that the island should be alert to
"bird flu," although the epidemic, caused by the H5N1 influenza
strain which originally appeared in chickens, has not been
conclusively proven to be harmful to humans.</P>
      <P>According to the latest foreign wire reports from Hong Kong,
there are currently nine suspected or confirmed cases of "bird flu"
in humans, two of which have been fatal.</P>
      <P>The H5N1 virus has never been reported in Taiwan, but despite
this, the COA still urged Taiwan people who plan to visit Hong Kong
in the near future to be especially careful with regard to
sanitation, while the National Quarantine Service (NQS) has posted

(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS), Singapore's de facto central bank, said on Wednesday that
Singapore's economic fundamentals are strong and it sees no reason
for the Singapore dollar to weaken.</P>
      <P>In a written reply to press queries, the MAS said it intervenes
in the foreign exchange market from time to time to iron out
short-term fluctuations and that it does not publicize its exchange
rate operations.</P>
      <P>"As Singapore's economic fundamentals remain sound, we see no
reason that the Singapore dollar should weaken," it said.</P>
      <P>The Singapore dollar firmed at below 1.68 to the US dollar on
Wednesday, partly because of talk that the MAS had intervened in the
market.</P>
      <P>This followed a slump in the currency to a more-than six-year low
of 1.7047 on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Singapore dollar has lost nearly 7 percent against the US
dollar in the last three trading days as players have sold it down on
the perception it needs to weaken further for Singapore's exports to
remain competitive regionally.</P>

    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-Chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia enjoyed a foreign trade surplus
of US$7.7 billion in the January-November period this year, Industry
and Trade Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He said the value of the country's exports in the period reached
US$39.5 billion and its imports US$31.8 billion.</P>
      <P>The value of non-oil exports was recorded at US$30.8 billion, the
minister said after reporting the status of the country's trade
balance to President Suharto.</P>
      <P>Tunky said that, compared to the same period of last year, the
value of imports was down by 0.5 percent. He added, however, that
most of the imports were non-oil products valued at US$28.8 billion.</P>
      <P>He said the surplus of US$1.9 billion in non-oil trade was
recorded at only US$1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>He said he had previously hoped non-oil exports this year could
reach US$42 billion.</P>
      <P>Tunky said he had reported to the president that the price of
cooking oil had gone up in the last few months because producers had
preferred to export the commodity rather than sell it at home
following the increasing price of crude palm oil (CPO).</P>
      <P>In view of that situation, the government decided that 75 percent
of the country's CPO production had to be reserved for domestic
demand, with the other 25 percent being allowed for export.</P>
      <P>Tunky said producers would provide 350,000 tons of CPO equivalent
of cooking oil although the monthly domestic demand is only 150,000
to 200,000 tons.</P>
      <P>He said the government also planned to impose an additional tax
on CPO exports, adding that the tax schedule would be made known to
the public after he had discussed the matter with the finance
minister.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew Thursday agreed to
preliminarily set the country's 1998 economic growth rate at 6.7
percent, as proposed by the Council for Economic Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Siew said he agreed to the proposal after hearing a briefing
made by CEPD Chairman Chiang Pin-kung on the council's 1998 plan for
national development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy has grown 6.7 percent in 1997, while consumer
price index has risen only 1.1 percent. To help maintain the record
of high economic growth and low inflation, the CEPD proposed to
preliminarily set next year's goal for economic growth at 6.7
percent.</P>
      <P>Siew said after the briefing that the current financial turmoil
in Asia will inevitably affect world trade and the financial market
next year. He urged all relevant government agencies to map out
plans to weather the financial storm, so that the economy of the
country will continue to grow as planned next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO  PREDICTS GLOBAL GROWTH IN TRADE OF SEVEN PERCENT FOR 1997</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) predicted on Thursday that global growth in trade will be
around 7 percent in real terms for 1997.</P>
      <P>In the new "WTO Annual Report 1997," the world trade body stated
that world trade and output growth are expected to accelerate in
comparison to 1996. The report's early assessment of trade in 1997 is
based on economic indicators available at the time of writing in
August 1997.</P>
      <P>Events during the fall are not captured in the assessment.
Nevertheless, it appears that the 7 percent figure remains broadly in
line with expectations.</P>
      <P>The effects of developments in Asian financial markets will
become apparent in data for 1998. Regarding the Southeast Asian
region, the report maintains that, while recent developments in the
financial sector in a number of these countries will continue to pose
policy challenges in the months ahead, most of the economies
concerned are expected to grow at rates above the world average in
1997.</P>
      <P>The WTO annual report highlights some of the major trends in
trade policy during 1997. For example, on Feb. 15, 69 governments
agreed to wide-ranging liberalization measures in basic
telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>On March 26, forty governments agreed to cut customs duties on
information technology products, beginning on July 1, 1997, with the
aim of eliminating all duties on these products by 2000.</P>
      <P>International trade in information technology products amounts to
some US$600 billion annually, while domestic and international
revenue generated in the basic telecommunications sector is roughly
the same amount.</P>
      <P>In its review of developments in world trade in 1996, the report
provides a more detailed analysis, confirming and expanding on the
findings of the WTO secretariat's preliminary assessment published in
April 1997.</P>
      <P>The report examines in greater depth trade flows by region and
product, intra-trade of regional integration agreements, and trends
in commercial services trade.</P>
      <P>World trade slowed down markedly in real and nominal terms in
1996.</P>
      <P>Real merchandise exports grew by 5 percent -- much less than in
the two preceding years -- but remained above the sluggish growth
rates of the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>There was also a general slowdown by region, with only Africa on
the export side and Latin America on the import side recording higher
growth in 1996 than in 1995.</P>
      <P>The analysis is supported by a full volume of trade statistics
and charts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Rotary International President Glen W.
Kinross said on Thursday that he was unaware of the name change of
Taiwan's official designation registered in the organization and
pointed out that the world body, devoted to promoting goodwill and
peace, would not interfere in political issues.</P>
      <P>Kinross stressed that Rotary International has not come under
pressure from Beijing, as, in compliance with the organization's
charter, only democratic countries are entitled to host Rotary
chapters.</P>
      <P>According to C.K. Huang, former chairman of the Rotary Club in
Taipei, the name change issue which arose during a September
gathering of Asian-Pacific Rotary members in Bangkok aroused strong
protests from Rotarians from Taiwan. The ROC chapter's designation
was changed from "Taiwan in ROC," into "Taiwan China" at the meeting,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Rafael G. Hechanova, one of the 19 board members of Rotary
International, said he will raise the issue at the organization's
next board meeting to allow relevant personnel to fully understand
the seriousness of the matter.</P>
      <P>Glen, who arrived here on Wednesday for a week-long visit, also
praised the remarkable performance of Taiwan Rotarians, who have
raised more than US$1 million in funds, one of the top-ten largest
amounts among Rotary Clubs worldwide, for Rotary International
programs to help the poor around the world.</P>
      <P>As an organization committed to helping abused children and poor
people around the world, Glen said Rotary International has
constructed 1,500 buildings for the poor in Asia and that its efforts
to eliminate poliomyelitis has paid off, as the epidemic has been
eradicated almost everywhere, except for some countries in Africa and
in Pakistan.</P>
      <P>He urged greater efforts from the 1.2 million Rotarians
worldwide to help prevent children from becoming victims of sexual
abuse and violence.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by local Rotarians, Glen also visited a park in
downtown Taipei which was built with a US$500,000 donation from
Taiwan Rotarians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMITTEE DELAYS DECISION ON BAYER'S LAND-LEASE CONTRACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A committee of the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly delayed making a decision on the controversial Bayer
investment project on Thursday, instead referring the German chemical
giant's land-lease contract to an ad hoc panel for further study.</P>
      <P>The transportation committee of the assembly instructed a panel
which has been set up exclusively for the project to consult public
opinion more thoroughly and review Bayer's environmental protection
measures before reporting back to the committee.</P>
      <P>The committee, which has the options of either approving the
contract and sending it to the full floor for final approval by the
assembly, or turning it down, chose to withhold its decision pending
more careful consideration, while about one thousand anti-Bayer
activists demonstrated outside the assembly building.</P>
      <P>The latest twist in the controversy makes it very unlikely that
the land-lease contract will receive a green light before the end of
the year, since the assembly is to recess on Friday.</P>
      <P>Bayer Taiwan Chairman Horst Mueck, whose company has threatened
to withdraw the project unless granted the lease before the end of
the year, said he regretted the committee's decision, adding that he
will inform the firm's German headquarters of the new development and
await further instructions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, P.K. Chiang, Chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, urged Mueck to postpone any hasty decision
and give the island another chance.</P>
      <P>The architect of Taiwan's policy aimed at transforming the island
into a regional operations hub expressed his worry that a divestment
by Bayer on the island will undermine the operational hub project.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office chief David Tawei Lee also urged
Bayer to continue to make its case vigorously to the public and not
to scrap it too hastily. He also promised that the central government
will try to persuade the ad hoc panel of the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly to give the plan a fair review.</P>
      <P>Although welcomed by the central government, Bayer's plan to
build a NT$50 billion chemical plant in Taichung County on land
rented from the provincial government, is opposed by local
conservationists and residents who claim the firm wants to bring in
obsolete and potentially dangerous technology.</P>
      <P>The future of the plant plunged deeper into uncertainty when a
anti-Bayer activist and a member of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party was elected county magistrate on Nov. 29.</P>
      <P>Liao Yung-lai, who grabbed the county's top job on a promise of
putting the project to a referendum, has set the central government's
teeth on edge by pledging to block construction of the plant if the
voters veto the project in the upcoming referendum.</P>
      <P>He and his supporters also called on the Provincial Assemblymen
to reject the firm's request for a lease.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The family of one of the victims of a
gas explosion which has claimed the lives of 14 people since the
accident occurred in September in the southern city of Kaohsiung, has
decided to use part of their compensation to buy an ambulance and
donate it to the Kaohsiung Fire Department.</P>
      <P>Hwang Juei-lin, 30, a firefighter, was seriously injured when he
and his colleagues, who were first at the scene of the explosion,
were trying to control the flames following the huge gas explosion
Subsequent blasts caught Hwang off-guard, causing him to suffer burns
to 95 percent of his body.</P>
      <P>Hwang was rushed to the 806th Army Hospital for treatment, where
doctors amputated his legs to save his life. His condition remained
stable until Tuesday night, when he suddenly succumbed to
complications from his injuries.</P>
      <P>The explosion on Sept. 13 occurred when workers from the China
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) were attempting to move a gas pipe as part of a
road-widening project. The careless workers failed to check if the
pipe had been purged of gas before cutting it, leading to a series of
three huge explosions. Three people were killed outright, while 22
were hospitalized.</P>
      <P>His mother said Hwang, who she adopted when he was only 40 days
old following his parents' divorce, got along quite well with his two
older sisters and two younger sisters. She described Hwang as always
ready to help others.</P>
      <P>As a firefighter, Hwang was used to being first at the scene of
accidents to rescue people. When a fire broke out at a restaurant in
Taichung, central Taiwan, in February 1995, Hwang was among the first
firefighters to reach the scene. He succeeded in rescuing a number of
people from the fire, which took the lives of 64 customers who were
dining in celebration of Valentine's Day.</P>
      <P>Hwang asked for a transfer to Kaohsiung City one year ago to be
closer to his long-time girlfriend, who lives in the southern city.
They had been together for 13 years and had planned to get married in
October in a mass wedding held by the Kaohsiung government, his
mother said.</P>
      <P>For the past three months, Hwang's fiancee has been on a leave of
absence from her company, a department store in Kaohsiung, in order
to go to the hospital every day to accompany and take care of him.</P>
      <P>Hwang's mother said that although the family has yet to receive
the NT$13 million compensation promised by the CPC, they have decided
to buy an ambulance at a cost of NT$3 million, which they will name
"Juei Lin," in memory of her brave son.</P>
      <P>She said the ambulance will be donated to the Kaohsiung Fire
Department on Dec. 29, coinciding with the day of Hwang's funeral.</P>

turn to the International Monetary Fund to try to weather the storm.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the island's smooth avoidance of the financial
turmoil to its sound economy, tiny foreign debt and huge reserves of
foreign capital.</P>
      <P>Professing keen interest in Taiwan's thriving small- and
medium-sized enterprises, and its successful science-based industrial
parks, Phan accepted Chang's invitation to send a fact-finding team
to Taiwan in the near future, said Chang.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China government on Friday
congratulated veteran South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung on
his election as the next head of state of his country.</P>
      <P>"We congratulate Kim on his electoral victory," Roy Wu, spokesman
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said, adding that the ROC looks
forward to reinforcing relations with Kim's administration based on
the principles of equality and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>Wu said the termination of long-standing formal diplomatic ties
between the ROC and South Korea in August 1992 was an "unfortunate
historical event."</P>
      <P>"Even though it was Seoul, not Taipei, that should be held
responsible for the breakoff, the ROC still attaches great importance
to its relations with South Korea," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Since the two countries are close neighbors and share a long-term
friendship, Wu said he sees no reason the ROC and South Korea cannot
continue to maintain reciprocal cordial relations.</P>
      <P>"We hope the new South Korean government will learn from
historical lessons, treasure its traditional friendship with the ROC
and take positive forward-looking measures to normalize bilateral
relations with sincerity, good will and mutual respect," Wu urged,
adding that by so doing, both countries will benefit and regional
stability and prosperity will also be further guaranteed.</P>
      <P>Taipei-Seoul relations have remained at a low ebb since South
Korea switched its diplomatic recognition to Beijing in August 1992.
In retaliation, the ROC cut direct air links with South Korea shortly
thereafter. Direct flights between the two countries have not yet
been resumed.</P>
      <P>Kim, 73, head of the National Congress for New Politics, won
Thursday's South Korean presidential election by capturing
slightly more than 40 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>The spiritual leader of South Korean political dissent said

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RATED AS FREE COUNTRY BY FREEDOM HOUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Edward Han &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is listed as one of the world's
81 free countries by the US-based Freedom House in its 1997 global
survey on the status of democracy, individual liberties and political
rights.</P>
      <P>The privately funded organization on Thursday released the annual
survey, which divides the nations of the world into three categories
-- free, partly free, and not free -- based on a set of criteria
which rates 191 countries and 60 territories according to their
degree of respect for political rights and civil liberties.</P>
      <P>In the evaluation, a scale of one to seven is used to evaluate
the democratic conditions in each of the countries and territories,
with a score of between one and 2.5 constituting the "free" category
to indicate an overall respect for civil and political rights.</P>
      <P>Scores in the three to five range are given to those entities
considered "partly free," which indicates the presence of widespread
corruption, legal injustice, racial conflict or civil war that serves
to curtail the level of civil and political rights.</P>
      <P>The nations and territories receiving a score of between 5.5 and
seven are labeled as "not free" and citizens in those areas enjoy
almost no degree of democracy under repressive governments or
tyrannical leaderships that deprive citizens of their most basic
rights.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, although enjoying a fast-developing economy over
the past few years, is rated "not free," receiving the lowest
possible score of seven. There are a total of 53 countries in that
category.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, listed along with the mainland as an "independent
country," is ranked in the "free" category, an indication that its
efforts toward promoting individual freedoms, political democracy and
social equality have born fruit.</P>
      <P>As for Hong Kong, it is categorized as a "territory" under
Beijing's rule and is considered "partly free." The survey found the
former British colony has witnessed less freedom since Beijing took
control of its sovereignty in July.</P>
      <P>Another mainland territory -- Tibet -- is rated by Freedom House
as one of the world's five least free areas.</P>
      <P>Under Beijing's rule, the Freedom House survey found that
Tibetans, who have different lifestyles and customs from the Chinese,
are granted few civil liberties, not to mention political rights.</P>
      <P>Freedom House is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting
democratic values around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCIAL  CRISES MAY BE LOOMING IN MAINLAND CHINA: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is facing three major economic
problems, and its currency is under growing pressure to depreciate,
according to a research report made by the Committee of Economic
Research and Development of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The report, released Friday at a symposium in Taipei on how to
deal with the financial situations in South Korea and mainland
China, said the renminbi is now under growing pressure to
depreciate, because the circulation of the currency has increased by
more than 50 percent since Beijing changed its foreign exchange
regulations in 1994, and because mainland China is facing three major
economic problems.</P>
      <P>It is however hard to tell at the present time whether a serious 
financial crisis will surface soon in mainland China, the report
said.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that the recent drastic devaluation of Southeast
Asian currencies may blunt mainland China's competitive edge in the
world markets, and the lowering of tariffs in October on 4,874 items
of commodities by 26 percent will certainly encourage mainland
Chinese imports. Mainland China's trade surplus may plummet as a
result.</P>
      <P>Foreign investment in mainland China is expected to reduce next
year because of the financial and stock market turmoils in many
Asian countries, bringing another economic problem to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's shaky financial structure could also cause a
serious problem when the financial crisis in Asia is getting worse,
the report added. (by Ed Hsieh)</P>

      <P>Leading businessman Bambang Trihatmodjo on
Thursday called for the establishment of a special team of
professionals to help the government tackle the economic crisis
currently facing the nation.</P>
      <P>Bambang, who is President Suharto's second son, told reporters on

such a team was needed to follow up on the president's general
economic policies.</P>
      <P>He also called on his father to include players from the private

      <P>"I really hope Pak Harto (Suharto) will set up a special team to
handle the crisis," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.</P>
      <P>He said that the reason for the team was the current cabinet
ministers' reportedly slow response and poor initiative in handling
the crisis.</P>
      <P>"That's the reason why I suggested the establishment of the
special team," said Bambang, who was also hit by the crisis when a
bank he partially owned, Bank Andromeda, was closed down by the

    <HEADLINE>ROC-PANAMANIAN TIES REMAIN SOLID: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the Republic of China and
Panama will remain solid even after the Central American country
signed an agreement with mainland China to upgrade the status of its
representative office in Hong Kong, a senior official with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Lung-yuan, director of the ministry's Central and South
American Affairs Department, said Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladarez reassured Taipei of his country's firm commitment to the
ROC only last week.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Balladarez had asked Panama's Labor and
Social Welfare Minister Mitchell Doens and Housing Affairs Minister
Francisco Sanchez Cadenas to convey a message to that effect to the
ROC when the two Panamanian officials visited Taiwan earlier this
month.</P>
      <P>"Balladarez has directed the two ministers to assure us that
friendly relations between Panama and the ROC will remain unchanged,"
Huang told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said Panama and mainland China
signed an accord at the United Nations headquarters in New York on
Wednesday to upgrade Panama's provisional economic and trade office
in Hong Kong to a formal office.</P>
      <P>The pact was signed by Ambassador Leonardo Kam, Panama's
permanent representative to the UN Office in Geneva, and Qin Huasun,
mainland China's permanent representative to the United Nations, the
reports said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on that development, Huang said the change in the
designation or status of Panama's representative office in Hong Kong
will by no means affect long-term cordial relations between the ROC
and Panama.</P>
      <P>Panama was forced to close its consul general in Hong Kong on
July 1 this year when Beijing took control of the territory. With
Beijing's consent, Panama set up a provisional economic and trade
office in Hong Kong to handle commercial and shipping affairs
following Hong Kong's handover.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RULES OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN TAIWAN AND HONG KONG AFTER 1997: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the long anticipated year of 1997 now
coming to an end, what of the regulations concerning exchanges
between the people of Taiwan and Hong Kong?</P>
      <P>Since its handover to Beijing's rule on July 1, 1997, Hong Kong
has been regarded by the government of the Republic of China as a
special region separate from other parts of the Chinese mainland.
Exchanges between people of Taiwan and residents of Hong Kong are
regulated in accordance with the Statute on Relations with Hong Kong
and Macao, the Taipei-based Department of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) remarked on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the department, "Hong Kong residents"
refers to those persons who are permanent residents of Hong Kong and
who do not hold passports issued by the government of Great Britain
or any other country besides the Hong Kong government.</P>
      <P>As to whether ROC citizens and civil servants can visit Hong Kong
after 1997, officials of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department
said persons entering Hong Kong will follow normal regulations and
will not be subject to special restrictions, while residents of Hong
Kong entering Taiwan must have approval from the ROC authorities.</P>
      <P>Due to changes in the legal and political status of Hong Kong and
Macao after 1997 and 1999, respectively, the ROC government has made
a series of parallel adjustments in its policy toward those two
territories.</P>
      <P>The fundamental principle behind the new statute was that as long
as the two territories retain a high degree of autonomy, the ROC
government will regard them as special regions separate from the rest
of the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department took an
additional step in stating that, as Hong Kong residents are no longer
considered overseas Chinese after July 1, 1997, the ROC government
will no longer issue identification certificates to residents of the
territory. However, for Hong Kong residents who hold overseas Chinese
identification papers issued by the ROC government before July 1997,
the certificates will remain valid.</P>
      <P>After July 1997, the ROC government stopped issuing passports to
Hong Kong residents. But persons who possess passports obtained
before the territory's change of status can renew the documents
through regular procedures, the officials stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY FORESEES THAW IN TIES WITH SOUTH KOREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seoul,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Y.C. Chiang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's de facto ambassador
to South Korea said on Friday that he foresees a thaw in Taipei-Seoul
relations following the inauguration of newly elected South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung next spring.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsun-hsien, head of the Taipei Mission in Korea, which
represents ROC interests in South Korea in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties, made the optimistic forecast after the veteran South
Korean opposition leader won Thursday's presidential election for the
National Congress for New Politics.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ROC representative office had maintained close
contacts with the three main contenders -- Kim Dae-jung, Lee
Hoi-chang and Rhee In-je -- in the run-up to the election.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that Kim Dae-jung's associate, Kim
Jong-pil, chairman of another opposition party, the United Liberal
Democrats (ULD), has been very friendly toward the ROC. The two
opposition parties cooperated to defeat the majority ruling Grand
National Party in the latest presidential race.</P>
      <P>Kim Jong-pil, a veteran rightist politician who once served as
prime minister during the presidency of the late Park Chung-hee,
played a crucial role in helping Kim Dae-jung win his fourth bid for
the presidency.</P>
      <P>Lin said Kim Jong-pil is the most friendly toward Taiwan among
the leaders of the various South Korean political parties. He has
consistently attended the annual ROC Double Ten National Day
reception sponsored by the Taipei representative office in Seoul. He
is also the only prominent South Korean politician who has not yet
visited Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lin said he earnestly hopes that the inauguration of the Kim
Dae-jung administration will open a new chapter in ROC-South Korean
relations, which have remained at a low ebb since Seoul switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in August 1992.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possibility of resuming direct air links between
Taipei and Seoul, Lin said there is no timetable for the resumption
of direct flight services.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cut direct air links with South Korea shortly after Seoul
established formal diplomatic ties with Beijing. Over the past five
years, South Korea has repeatedly expressed its desire to resume such
links.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ROC is willing to discuss the issue with South Korea
based on the principles of equality and reciprocity. "In the process
of negotiation, we hope South Korea will respect our sovereignty and
national dignity," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Lin also confirmed that all three major South Korean presidential
candidates had approached his office to explore the possibility of
the ROC offering loans to cash-hungry South Korea, but pointed out
that as the ROC and South Korea currently have no diplomatic ties,
the two sides have yet to formally discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, the chief financier of the ROC's ruling Kuomintang,
suggested after a recent fact-finding trip to South Korea that the
ROC offer US$10 billion in loans to South Korea to help it weather
its current financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Lin said if the ROC really wants to assist South Korea after the
inauguration of the new South Korean government, aid could be given
in the form of investment in its capital market or industries in
addition to offering loans. South Korea has opened its capital
markets to foreign investors, and foreign nationals can now hold up
to a 50 percent stake in Korean companies.</P>
      <P>On the development of relations with North Korea, Lin said South
Korea basically does not object to foreign countries' engagement with
Pyongyang, so long as such developments do not disrupt South Korea's
national security and the stability of the Korean peninsula.</P>
      <P>While engaging North Korea, Lin said the ROC has consistently
abided by the principles that engagement should be in Taiwan's
national interests, should not affect the ROC's international image,
and should not jeopardize regional stability and peace in Northeast
Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAYER SUSPENDS INVESTMENT PROJECT IN TAIWAN (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bayer Taiwan announced on Friday that it
will suspend a project to invest in a petrochemical plant in central
Taiwan, saying it will now pursue contingency plans to build the
plant in the United States.</P>
      <P>Bayer said in a statement Friday that it was disappointed that
"after 24 months of intense negotiations on our investment project in
Taiwan," talks on the project will be suspended immediately.</P>
      <P>It said that despite the fact that an environmental impact
assessment has been finalized, the Taiwan Provincial Assembly has
decided not to review the land-leasing agreement with Bayer or to set
a clear time frame for the finalization of the approval process.</P>
      <P>The provincial assembly on Thursday decided not to review the
lease agreement until its next session. The agreement would lease
land in the Taichung Harbor area to Bayer for a period of 50 years
for the purpose of constructing the chemical plant.</P>
      <P>Bayer said it was deeply disappointed over the aborted project,
especially after its intensive efforts to convince authorities on
Taiwan as well as the local public of the project's benefits.
Alternate plans to locate the plant in Baytown, Texas, will now be
pursued.</P>
      <P>But Horst Mueck, chairman and president of Bayer Taiwan, said
that though the project has been suspended, the present investment
and operations of Taiwan Bayer, as an independent company, will not
be affected.</P>
      <P>Mueck said the suspension only means the company will cease
efforts on that particular project. As to whether there is any chance
of its revival, he stressed that decision will be up to Bayer
headquarters in Germany.</P>
      <P>Bayer Taiwan spokesman Chen Chia-chung said the company lost
about US$10 million because of its abandonment of the proposed
project. He added that the local company was instructed to suspend
the proposal because authorities on Taiwan had not given a clear time
frame for beginning the project, which Bayer deemed unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, government officials and business leaders here
expressed shock over Bayer's announcement, saying it has dealt a
heavy blow to the image of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang said although Taiwan has
been rated by the London-based Economist magazine as the third best
area for investment stability, the island's efforts in that regard
could go down the drain with the withdrawal of Bayer's project.</P>
      <P>To avoid a domino effect upon other ongoing investment projects,
Wang said, he will begin communication with 21 cities and counties
around the island starting next month, and at the same time will
continue to solicit foreign investment.</P>
      <P>But Wang also said that the Bayer case has set a bad example,
noting that it will fuel the uncertainty about investment in Taiwan
and will put a damper on the local investment climate as well.</P>
      <P>He said that businessmen are concerned over the future of
Taiwan's industrial development. The economics minister pointed out
that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has always claimed it is
not opposed to business, and stated that it is high time for the
opposition party to match its words with deeds.

      <P>Business leaders echoed Wang's words by saying that the case will
deal a blow to the local investment environment, and they blasted the
government for failure to exercise its authority.</P>
      <P>Wang You-chang, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of
the ROC, said that the case has damaged the image of Taiwan. He
lamented that the project, which has been in the pipeline for so
long, could be reversed in a single day because of the newly elected
Taichung County magistrate, referring to Liao Yung-lai of the DPP,
who had vowed to hold a public referendum to decide to fate of the
project.</P>
      <P>Chu Chih-yang, chairman of the Council for Industrial and
Commercial Development, said the government should put itself in
Bayer's shoes, asserting that Taiwan businessmen would also decline
to go overseas if they had to pass a public vote by the local people.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, said the government should care more about overseas
investment to insure that foreign investor do not have to worry about
other such impediments.</P>
      <P>Lin Min-ling, speaker of the Taichung County Council, regretted
Bayer's decision, saying that irreparable damage has been made and
that the credibility of Taichung and even of Taiwan has been
compromised.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, efforts to salvage Bayer's NT$49 billion (US$1.5
billion) investment project continued on Friday, despite the
company's announcement.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), called on the Premier Vincent Siew to report on
the handling of the case.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he has talked with Liu Ping-wei, speaker of the
Taiwan Provincial Assembly, over the phone on Friday, hoping that the
assembly will pass a conditional resolution to provide a final
opportunity to keep the project in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Bayer had told him that if the assembly could pass a
conditional resolution, the company headquarters would still be
willing to proceed with the project.</P>
      <P>However, as the assembly closed its current session on Friday
morning without making any solid promise, Bayer was left in limbo,
according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the CEPD, which is responsible for pushing through
the project, will not abandon its efforts on the project until the
final moment.</P>
      <P>The assembly's decision not to review the land-lease agreement
was considered the last straw for Bayer, following calls earlier in
the month for a public vote on the project, which also came as an
unexpected development for the German chemical giant.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force on Friday
formally decommissioned its C-119 transport aircraft which have been
in service for 43 years, an air force spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The ROC established its first squadron of C-119s, better known as
"the Flying Boxcar" in November, 1954, taking over many of the craft
left behind by the US troops who moved out of Taiwan at that time.</P>
      <P>The air force began to phase out its C-119 fleet after 1981, when
it started to become difficult to obtain spare parts and components,
eventually leaving Squadron No. 103, based at Pingtung airport, as
the last unit in the world using the lumbering planes.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the four C-119s of Squadron No. 103 are
still in good shape and that one of them will carry out its last
mission on Saturday when it flies to the Hsinchu airbase, where it
will be delivered to a technology college in northern Taiwan for
education purposes.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that during its years of service, the fleet
successfully carried out two very important missions: transporting
back to Taiwan, without the backup of in-air refueling or
satellite\radar guidance, former ROC army troops trapped in the
border area between Thailand and Laos in 1961; and airlifting relief
goods to flood victims in the Philippines in 1972.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft now
forms the backbone of the air force's transport fleet.</P>
      <P>The air force currently has 17 of the huge planes following the
loss of one in a crash on Oct. 10, and is expected to take delivery
of another four which were ordered last year at a cost of US$50
million apiece.</P>
      <P>He said the air force is also considering purchasing either
Indonesian-produced CN-235 planes or a new type of transport aircraft
manufactured by the Lockheed Martin Company of the US to fill the gap
left by the C-119s.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENGLISH  WILL  BE  LESS  IMPORTANT  IN  50  YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>English will decline in importance in
the next century, but it will still remain the world's most
influential language in 2050, American linguist David Graddol
predicts.</P>
      <P>It will still be the only language which is usable in every part
of the world, but languages such as Chinese, Hindi and Spanish will
compete in influence with it in their respective regions, he said.</P>
      <P>Graddol has developed a model to forecast the spread of languages
around the world in the British Council's publication "The Future of
English?" He presented his findings at the Fourth International
Conference on World English held in Singapore on Friday.</P>
      <P>Explaining how his forecast model worked, he said it uses United
Nations demographic projections for each country, calculates the
proportion of people in the country who now speak each language, and
makes some forecasts about the future.</P>
      <P>Based on these estimates, Chinese will be spoken by the largest
number of people in the world, with Hindi/Urdu and Spanish coming
next.</P>
      <P>Following are the top 10 languages in 2050, as forecast by
Graddol:</P>
      <P>Native speakers (millions) Young native speakers</P>
      <P>(aged 15 to 24)</P>
      <P>1. Chinese 1,384 Chinese 166</P>
      <P>2. Hindi, Urdu 556 Hindi, Urdu 74</P>
      <P>3. English 508 Arabic 72</P>
      <P>4. Spanish 486 English 65</P>
      <P>5. Arabic 482 Spanish 63</P>
      <P>6. Portuguese 248 Portuguese 33</P>
      <P>7. Bengali 229 Bengali 32</P>
      <P>8. Russian 132 Russian 15</P>
      <P>9. Japanese 108 Japanese 11
 10. German 91 Malay 11</P>
      <P>But as the number of speakers alone does not determine how
influential a language will be, other economic and social indicators
are also used.</P>
      <P>For example, Chinese was spoken as a first language by the most
number of people in the world in 1996, with over one billion native
speakers.</P>
      <P>English had only 372 million first-language speakers, but was
more influential in the world of ideas and the global economy,
because of its "economic strength," Graddol noted.</P>
      <P>In his models, he derived a crude index of "economic strength" by
assigning a proportion of Gross Domestic Product and trade in each
country to different languages according to the pattern of language
use in each country.</P>
      <P>Because of the economic might of the United States today, English
tops the league in all of these categories, with German, French and
Japanese following in sequence.</P>
      <P>English also retains its premier position if social indicators
such as literacy rates and education provisions are factored in.</P>
      <P>The following chart shows the global influence of the world's
major languages at present:</P>
      <P>1. English 100 (index of 100 represents the</P>
      <P>position of English in 1995)</P>
      <P>2. German 42</P>
      <P>3. French 33</P>
      <P>4. Japanese 32</P>
      <P>5. Spanish 31</P>
      <P>6. Chinese 22</P>
      <P>7. Arabic 8</P>
      <P>8. Portuguese 5</P>
      <P>9. Malay 4
 10. Russian 3</P>
      <P>Graddol predicted that the development of technology and
globalization will decrease the influence of English, rather than
increase it.</P>
      <P>He said an increasing amount of content will be produced in local
languages. "Already, on the Internet, you can use your web browser in
a variety of languages, you can translate web documents with a click
of the mouse.</P>
      <P>"On satellite television, more programs are being beamed in local
languages," he added.</P>
      <P>At the same time, English will continue to be a useful "neutral
broker" and be used by foreigners who share no common language, he
said.</P>
      <P>"The future is going to be more plural. It won't be an either-or
situation. People will be more multi-lingual, and different languages
within each region are going to become more important," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERIOR MINISTRY INVESTIGATING MYSTERIOUS CULT ACTIVITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior said on
Friday that its religious affairs department will investigate
activities of the so-called "God Saves the Earth Flying Saucer
Foudnation," which has not formally registered with the ministry.</P>
      <P>"We'll deal with the case in accordance with the law if the
mysterious cult is found to have any activities violating the
Criminal Code or other domestic regulations," said a ministry
official.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, about 120 Republic of China
nationals have traveled to the United States in preparation for mass
suicide in Garland, Texas next March.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, the ministry official said although
the constitution provides for religious freedom, religious
activities should not violate existing laws and regulations.</P>
      <P>The official said the ministry has asked county and city
governments to help probe mysterious cult activities.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu confirmed that the ROC's
representative offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco had
recently helped a family of four, who had joined the mysterious
cult, the God Saves the Earth Flying Saucer Foundation, return to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The family, including a couple and their two children, went to
the US together with other members of the cult to attend cult
activities. As the couple's father, identified only by his surname
"Chou," worried about their safety, he asked the Foreign Ministry to
assist in advising his offspring to return home.</P>
      <P>Wu said many other cult members are believed to still stay in
the US. As the ministry didn't have a list of cult members, it's not
easy to trace their whereabouts.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ministry has requested the US Federal Bureau of
Investigation and police authorities to help investigate the cult's
activities and ensure the safety of cult members from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said minisitry officials stationed in Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Houston will offer all necessary assistance to cult
members if they want to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Criminal Investigation Bureau said it will
contact Chou and his family in order to learn more about the cult's
activities.</P>
      <P>Chou, who runs a convenience store in Homei township in the
central Changhua County, said his son and daughter-in-law were
not happy after their return. "They would brief the public on the
cult's doctrine and activities after they regained calm," he
said.</P>
      <P>Chou's daughter and her family, also members of the cult,
have not yet returned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, the cult has recruited some 200
members in the past few years. Many of the members have said they
wanted to seek peace in the United States, compalining about rising
crime and declining moral standards in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A key member of the cult was quoted as saying that mainland
China would invade Taiwan in 1999 so the members would seek
salvation from God in a farm in Garland near Dallas, Texas next
March.</P>
      <P>The members who have traveled to the US reportedly included more
than 20 children because the cult encourages entire families to kill
themselves so that their bodies could be picked up by flying saucers.</P>
      <P>According to a report by the Hsinchu County Police Headquarters,
the cult once applied for accreditation with the Interior Ministry
under the name of the ROC Soul Research Association. The Interior
Ministry said it will check whether the two groups have any
correlation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CULT MEMBERS EMIGRATE TO US FOR GOD'S BLESSING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Houston,  Dec.  18  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>"How it is possible for us to conduct a
collective suicide as we have all chosen to leave Taiwan for the same
reason -- to escape from an expected disaster which will occur in
1999?" a member of the so-called "Truth Cult" said here on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The cult member from Taiwan, surnamed Wu, made the remarks in an
interview with CNA to explain the cult's belief and rebut a report
alleging that the members are planning to kill themselves to seek
eternal life.</P>
      <P>Wu said their organization has different beliefs from another
cult which claims that "God" or "super intelligent beings" will pick
up the remains of the believers in flying saucers.</P>
      <P>Recent newspaper reports from Taiwan indicated that over 100
members of the so-called "God Saves the Earth Flying Saucer
Foundation" have left for Dallas, Texas, where they are said to be
planning to commit mass suicide so that their bodies can be picked up
by UFOs.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, approximately 200 Taiwan people have
been recruited by the US-based cult, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Wu, who holds a doctorate, told CNA that he, like the other
members of Truth, joined the cult because they believe they can find
peace and safety in the United States. They are looking for life
here, not death.</P>
      <P>However, the cult member acknowledged that he still expects to go
to heaven, a place without disaster and hardship, under God's
guidance.</P>
      <P>The Truth Cult is currently supervised by a Chinese man,
identified as Chen Heng-ming, who has predicted that the world will
end in 1999, while Taiwan will be destroyed one year earlier, in
1998.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Chen has asked his Taiwan followers to emigrate to
the US, which he describes as the last pure land in the world. The
cult leader also pointed out that Garland, near Dallas, where Wu and
the other Truth members from Taiwan are living, is blessed with luck.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO REOPEN CHANNELS OF CONSULTATION WITH TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of
the Executive Yuan Friday urged mainland China to reopen the channel
of consultation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally closed down the consultation channel after
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to his alma mater in the United States
in the summer of 1995 angered Beijing leaders.</P>
      <P>Soon after that, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), an unofficial intermediary organization set up in
Beijing in 1991 to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
formal relations, sent a message on June 16, 1995 to its counterpart
in Taipei, the Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF), saying that "We will
keep in touch with you again at an appropriate time in the future."</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Hseu Ke-sheng said Friday in a regular
press conference that both parties have the responsibility to keep
the "institutionalized" channel of consultation open, as the
establishment of the channel was agreed upon by the two parties after
careful negotiations.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the work to fight cross-strait smuggling,
drug trafficking, and other crimes, and to resolve other problems
caused by increased civilian exchanges, it is necessary to reopen the
consultation channel, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to honor the promise given in the above
message and begin consultations on matters of mutual concern.

    <HEADLINE>FORECAST PUTS CONSUMER PRICE INDEX GROWTH AT 3 PERCENT NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an economy forecast for next year, a
local research institute has put the growth of the consumer price
index (CPI) at 3.34 percent, and predicts that the New Taiwan dollar
will weather the current financial storm to surge to an average of
30.14 to the US dollar.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research, a non-profit civil
think-tank, attributed the CPI's relative low growth of 1.4 percent
in 1997 to a bumper harvest and the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
epidemic which swept the island's swine population early this year.</P>
      <P>The institute said the epidemic, which prompted many countries to
ban pork imports from Taiwan, diverted Taiwan's huge stocks of pork
destined for export to the domestic market, helping to curb CPI
growth.</P>
      <P>However, the institute pointed out, it also provided a relatively
lower base against which next year's inflation will be measured, and
this may result in a correspondingly higher CPI growth rate.</P>
      <P>That factor, combined with the devaluation of the local currency,
the impact of which is expected to be felt next year in the form of
import price hikes, is estimated to drive up the CPI by 3.34 percent.</P>
      <P>Putting aside the unpredictability of the local bourse, the
institute estimated that private spending will grow by 6.59 percent,
against the 7.65 percent figure recorded for 1997.</P>
      <P>That estimate was based on the launch of the new five-day work
week next year and the NT dollar's stronger buying power against the
currencies of Southeast Asian nations, despite rising prices which
might dampen consumers' willingness to spend.</P>
      <P>Private sector investment will continue this year's trend by
growing by 12.11 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports are expected to post a meager gain of 8.25
percent next year because its competitive advantage gained through NT
dollar devaluation will be eroded by further depreciation of
Southeast Asian currencies, said the institute.</P>
      <P>Imports of military equipment will keep expanding at 7.33
percent, against 13.18 percent recorded this year, a reduction caused
more by the broadening of its calculating base than any actual cuts
in military expenditure, said the institute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO HELP MAINLAND CHINA WITH MARKET REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has pledged to launch a A$20
million program to help mainland China develop its market economy by
sending public sector experts to Beijing and other mainland cities.</P>
      <P>The program was announced by Prime Minister John Howard when he
greeted mainland China's Vice Premier Li Ruihuan in a reception in
Sydney earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Howard said the Australian experts will help mainland China
undertake developments in finance, taxation, enterprise reform,
social security and public sector administration systems under the
program.</P>
      <P>Li, who ranks fourth in the Beijing leadership, is the most
senior mainland Chinese official to visit Australia.</P>
      <P>Bilateral ties between the two countries in 1996 were strained by
a series of incidents, including Australia's support of the US
deployment of two aircraft carriers to Taiwan during a mainland
Chinese missile shooting practice off the island, the sending of a
senior Australian minister to Taipei, the visit of the Dalai Lama to
Australia and the renewal of a defense and military pact between
Australia and the US</P>
      <P>Ties improved with the first official visit of Prime Minister
John Howard to Beijing in late March this year, followed by trips to
mainland China by Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer and other senior Australian ministers.</P>
      <P>Australia switched diplomatic ties to mainland China from Taiwan
in late 1972, But Canberra still maintains unofficial relations,
including trade, culture and sports, with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is facing a serious problem in its state
enterprise sector due to its mounting debts and inefficiency, and is
trying to privatize its state-owned firms.</P>
      <P>But the state enterprises, numbering more than 300,000 and
employing over 100 million people, are a very hard nut to crack.</P>
      <P>The Australian government will send its public sector specialists
to advise mainland China on ways of tackling the problems.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Howard and Li spoke of political differences
between Australia and mainland China, but they said they preferred to
set aside the differences and work on economic cooperation so that
both countries can benefit.</P>
      <P>"It is not always bad to have differences because it is the
differences... that render necessary exchanges and cooperation," Li
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STANDS FIRM ON UNIFICATION PRINCIPLES: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By M.C. Chou and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government stands firm
on its mainland policy of promoting the unification of China, and any
accusation by the international community that it is seeking to
hamper China's unification is unfair, Chang King-yuh, chairman of the
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said here on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has stuck to and will continue sticking to the
three phases set out by the Guidelines for National Unification to
achieve eventual unification with mainland China, Chang said, adding
that this has been and will continue to be Taiwan's stance on the
issue, despite the recent victory of the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party in local elections on Nov. 29.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a meeting with members of the local
press and academics while responding to questions on the current
state of relations across the Taiwan Strait and potential
developments between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chang said that since the ROC government lifted a ban on
cross-strait travel in 1987, it has always actively advocated
cross-strait exchanges, pointing out that the mainland is the one
which is trying to jeopardize harmonious cross-strait ties, as
Beijing has spared no efforts in trying to block bilateral activities
and isolate Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Answering question from a reporter from Agence France-Presse on
the impact of the meeting between US President Bill Clinton and
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in late October, Chang
repeated that the ROC government will not interfere in US dealings
with mainland China and that the US should maintain parallel
relations with Taiwan and not sacrifice the interests of Taiwan's 21
million people while seeking to improve ties with the mainland.</P>
      <P>He added that the US assured the ROC government that no secret
agreement was reached in the Clinton-Jiang meeting and that
Washington has repeated its call that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should resolve their disputes through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Responding to the question on Taiwan's increased trade reliance
on the mainland Chinese market, Chang said the ROC is a free country
which will not fully ban Taiwan businesses from investing on the
mainland, but added that it must impose some restrictions to
forestall any potential investment risks.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that it will be hard for the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to achieve economic integration if mainland China
continues to hinder Taiwan's efforts to take part in international
activities and refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite mainland China's efforts to blockade the island, Chang
said Taiwan is still willing to help the mainland develop its economy
and upgrade its standards of living.</P>
      <P>On the "one China, two systems" issue, Chang said the ROC
government will never accept Beijing's formula for unification.</P>
      <P>Citing Hong Kong as an example, Chang said the former British
colony has experienced a setback in its democratic and legal systems,
as well as a noticeable reduction in the number of tourist arrivals,
since its reversion to Beijing's rule in July under the "one China,
two systems" scheme.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan and the mainland can only create a "win-win"
situation when Beijing recognizes the reality that the two sides are
two separate political entities and treats Taiwan on an equal
footing based on mutual trust and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>Chang, who arrived here from Madrid on Wednesday after concluding
the annual national development council meeting with Taiwan academics
and experts residing in Europe which took place there, is scheduled
to proceed to Brussels on Friday and next to Bonn, to explain the
ROC's mainland policy to the local press and political sectors there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMAN TRADE OFFICE REGRETS SUSPENSION OF BAYER PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The German Trade Office in Taipei on Friday
expressed regret over the German-based Bayer Group's decision to
suspend its first proposed investment project in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gunther Tetzner, director of economic affairs of the German Trade
Office in Taipei, said his office believes the multinational chemical
giant's decision to suspend the project was based on careful
consideration and study and that they understand and respect Bayer's
decision.</P>
      <P>Tetzner said Bayer's decision to suspend its proposed project to
set up a chemical production base in Taichung County, central Taiwan,
will inevitably cause concern and uncertainty among foreign
investors, but added that the degree of impact on foreign investors'
willingness to invest in Taiwan remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>Although Bayer's decision should not be interpreted as a result
of Taiwan's investment climate getting worse for foreign investors,
the German Trade Office in Taipei still regrets the abandonment of
the NT$49 billion investment project, he added.</P>
      <P>Horst Mueck, chairman and president of Bayer Taiwan, announced
earlier in the day that as the multinational had failed to obtain the
land required for the construction of its proposed plant in Taichung
County, the investment project will be suspended immediately.</P>
      <P>The European Council of Commerce and Trade (ECCT), which issued a
statement earlier this month expressing its worry that the new
Taichung County chief-elect insisted on linking the fate of Bayer's
project with a proposed referendum in his county, refused to make any
further comment on the issue.</P>
      <P>ECCT Secretary General Richard Tangye said on Friday that the
council has already made its stance on the issue very clear and it
would be improper to make any comment at this time.</P>
      <P>On learning of Bayer's announcement, the Democratic Progressive
Party's magistrate-elect for Taichung County Liao Yung-lia expressed
the hope that Bayer won't get discouraged by the setback, adding that
Bayer is welcome to locate in Taichung County if the project it
introduces is non-pollutant and safe.</P>
      <P>Liao, who opposed the Bayer project on the grounds that it would
have brought excessive levels of pollution and might have posed a
threat to public safety, asserted that the central government should
take part of the responsibility for Bayer's suspension of the
investment project.</P>
      <P>He said that even though the project had passed the central
government's environmental impact assessment, the local residents had
no faith that the government would have the ability to monitor the
chemical plant. In past years, the government has disappointed his
constituents many times by failing to control or deal with pollution
problems in the county, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO  SALARY  CUTS  FOR  INDONESIAN  GOVERNMENT  WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia will not cut the salaries of its
government employees as have Thailand and Malaysia, because this will
not ease the monetary crisis, State Minister for Administrative
Reforms T.B. Silalahi said on Friday.</P>
      <P>"What is best for other countries may not be good for us,"
Silalahi was quoted by Antara as telling a seminar on administrative
studies at the State Administrative Institute.</P>
      <P>Indonesia has been actively promoting the welfare of its
government employees, in an effort to improve their performance, he
said.</P>
      <P>"How could we cut their salaries in this situation?" he asked,
adding that government employees in Thailand and Malaysia are more
prosperous than their Indonesian counterparts.</P>
      <P>Silalahi said the best way to face the monetary crisis is to
tighten the budget, for instance by limiting expenditures for travels
and private parties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN  CRISIS  HITS  AUSTRALIA'S  ECONOMIC  RECOVERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's financial crisis will hit
Australian economic recovery this year and reduce the country's gross
domestic product by half a percentage point in the following year,
although the government can still achieve a budget surplus in its
first term (from March 1996 to early 1999).</P>
      <P>In a mid-year economic and fiscal outlook report, Federal
Treasurer Peter Costello described the crisis as "the biggest
financial meltdown we have seen in our lifetime in the region."</P>
      <P>He said the Asian crisis will limit Australia's GDP growth to
3.75 percent in fiscal 1997-98 and knock about 0.5 percent off its
GDP growth to 3.25 percent in 1998-99.</P>
      <P>He predicted the crisis will almost halve Australia's export
growth this year from 7 to only 4 percent.</P>
      <P>"We are in the midst of major external challenges at the moment.
If it had not been for Asia, both this year and next year would have
seen substantially stronger growth than we are now forecasting," he
said.</P>
      <P>"If not for the impact of developments in East Asia, the
continuation of the momentum in domestic growth achieved in 1997-98
would have likely led to significantly stronger growth in 1998-99,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the government forecast the GDP would grow by
4 percent or even higher.</P>
      <P>The report also forecast that stronger economic activity in
Australia, combined with softer export growth, will see the current
account deficit increase substantially over the next two years.</P>

(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced on
Friday that all SIA flights worldwide will be smoke-free from
February 1, 1998, fulfilling its commitment towards providing
smoke-free services.</P>
      <P>SIA's efforts were recognized in 1995, when the World Health
Organization awarded SIA the World No-Tobacco Day medal and citation
for that year.</P>
      <P>Currently, SIA operates over 1,000 services each week, of which
more than 90 percent are already smoke-free.</P>
      <P>The exceptions are non-stop flights originating or terminating in
Japan. From Feb. 1, 1998, these flights will also be non-smoking
services, SIA said.</P>
      <P>It said the daily Singapore-Tokyo-Los Angeles service went
smoke-free in October 1994, by which time SIA had already phased out
smoking on all services except those to Japan. At the beginning of
last month, SIA's Singapore-Taipei-Tokyo and Singapore-Taipei-Osaka
services followed suit, it added.</P>
      <P>SIA first introduced smoke-free travel on shuttle flights between
Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in April 1988, and in December 1993 SIA
became the world's first airline to offer a smoke-free service

    <HEADLINE>MULTINATIONALS MAINTAIN FAITH IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,   Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most US and European multinational
companies with sales or factories in Asia have shrugged off the
recent currency turmoil and are committed to the region and their
investment goals, according to reports from the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday.</P>
      <P>A survey by Renaissance Technomic, the US management consultants,
of the regional managing directors of 35 large multinationals found
that, while one-third considered the region to be less attractive
since the currency crisis, 79 percent were not planning to change
their strategy, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The findings are in contrast to a survey in 1994 of large
companies exposed to Mexico in the wake of the peso's devaluation.
Steven Ganster, managing director of Renaissance's Asian consultancy,
was quoted as saying: "With Mexico, more companies said: `We have to
cut our overheads, sales forces and operating costs to minimize the
damage.'"</P>
      <P>The survey of companies operating in Asia, including ICI, BASF
and Hoechst from Europe, and General Motors, Tenneco and Dow Chemical
of the US, found that only around 15 percent were left significantly
worse off because of the regional crisis. This group included
companies such as Whirlpool of the US, which have no local plants and
whose only exposure to the region is as importers of their own
products manufactured elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers with local plants felt the devalued currencies
offered opportunities to integrate their operations further through
the buyout of dealers or distributors or the purchase of greater
stakes in joint venture partners. A small group felt themselves in a
stronger position post-crisis.</P>
      <P>Some 14 percent foresaw stronger sales in 1998 and the same
proportion expected increased rates of return. The beneficiaries were
mainly exporters from the region who expected that the devalued
currencies would lead to increased shipments, offsetting tighter
margins.</P>
      <P>Some 60 percent of the executives questioned believed the
currency instability would last until the end of 1998 or beyond, with
Thailand expected to undergo the longest period of instability. Most
believed it would take three to four years for the region to recover
to pre-crisis levels.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA'S SAGGING TRADE SURPLUS SAID SIGN OF ASIAN FLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's trade surplus took a tumble in
October, prompting suspicion this might be a signal of what the
financial turmoil in Asia could mean to the North American country's
economy.</P>
      <P>Government statistics released Thursday show that Canada's
exports slipped 0.6 percent to C$25.07 billion (US$17.8 billion) in
October because of a slide in the exports of resource commodities
such as forestry and energy products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Canada's imports grew by 2.7 percent to C$24.5
billion, with gains in every product sector except energy. As a
result, Canada's trade surplus slipped in October to a 4-year low at
C$581 million.</P>
      <P>The October surplus was down from C$1.37 billion in September.
And for the first 10 months of 1997, the surplus was C$19.37 billion
compared with C$35.46 billion for the same period of 1996.</P>
      <P>Statistics Canada and most economists attribute the shrunken
surplus to a healthy economy that has resumed its taste for imports.
But some economists are adding the Asian crisis to their list of
explanations.</P>
      <P>Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns, said the damage
to resource exports was an early sign of what Asia's problems could
mean to the Canadian economy.</P>
      <P>"Export prospects are hardly encouraging, given the hit to
commodity-related shipments from the Asian flu, and the fact that
Canadian manufacturers are already operating at around full capacity
(87.5 percent operating rate)," she noted.</P>
      <P>Sal Guatieri, senior economist at the Bank of Montreal, said the
Canadian dollar's appreciation against many Asian currencies had made
goods from this country expensive in those markets.</P>
      <P>Randall Powley, economist at Scotiabank, said what happened to
the resource shipments was understandable given the Asian situation.
But he was puzzled that industrial goods would fall 2.7 percent in
October after a rise of 1.1 percent in September.</P>

      <P>Four organizations under the patronage of
Indonesian Development Cadres (KPI) have urged Indonesian
conglomerates to withdraw their private accounts from overseas banks
and to restrain their US dollar purchases.</P>
      <P>The four organizations, GAKPI, WPI, GPPI and MPI, submitted their

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN REGRETS ABANDONMENT OF BAYER PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Chang Fang-min &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of Taiwan's main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said on Friday that he
felt regret and sorrow over the suspension of German-based Bayer
Group's first investment project in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
upon his arrival at Narita Airport in Tokyo. Hsu is leading a
six-member DPP delegation on a foreign mission, which has already
taken them to South Korea before arriving in Japan for a four-day
visit.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that Bayer executives in Taiwan once told him that if
the multinational chemical giant failed to obtain the land-lease in
central Taiwan for the construction of a proposed chemical plant by
Dec. 29 (Friday), Bayer would consider relocating the investment
project to the United States.</P>
      <P>Asked if Bayer's setback will be seen as being a result of an
"anti-business" complex on the part of the DPP, Hsu said that DPP
headquarters is quite concerned about the NT$49 billion investment
and will do its best to communicate with the local government on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Bayer's investment project in Taichung County, central Taiwan,
had faced strong opposition from some local residents on the grounds
that it would have produced excessive levels of pollution and would
have posed a threat to public safety. The DPP's magistrate-elect in
Taichung County, Liao Yung-lai, had insisted on imposing a referendum
on the Bayer project to decide its fate.</P>
      <P>Based on the fact that the project passed a central government
environmental impact assessment, Taiwan Provincial Government
approved a land lease earlier this week which allows the provincial
government to lease 90 hectares of land in the Taichung Harbor area
to Bayer for a period of 50 years. The Taiwan Provincial Assembly,
which had the final say on the fate of the contract, however, refused
to grant its approval.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that he hopes the dispute over the project can be
resolved through communication, adding that once he completes his
Japan visit and returns to Taiwan, he will contact Liao, as well as
Bayer Taiwan, to discuss the issue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital
in southern Taiwan announced on Friday that surgeons there in
November successfully performed Taiwan's first-ever two-lobe lung
transplant operation.</P>
      <P>The team, led by H.C. Hsu, director of the hospital's thoracic
department, spent more than nine hours transplanting a pair of
healthy lungs into Lai Lee-chih, a 34-year-old computer programmer
belonging to the Rukai aboriginal tribe.</P>
      <P>Lai, who had suffered from chronic bronchitis and asthma from his
early youth, was sent to the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital for
treatment, where it was discovered that his lungs were functioning at
only about 16 percent of the capacity of a healthy person's. Hospital
authorities began to consider a lung transplant because Lai's life
was threatened by his condition, which was deteriorating.</P>
      <P>Lai had to wait for nine months until October, when a pair of
lungs donated by the 37-year-old victim of a car accident became
available and were found to have compatible blood and cell type.</P>
      <P>One month later, Lai currently remains in stable condition,
despite having been treated for complications in the hospital's
intensive care unit. Lai has now been transferred to a normal ward
and is expected to be able to leave the hospital in one week.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital said that
although the hospital has carried out eight lung transplants, six of
which have been successful, it was the first time a twin-lobe
transplant had been performed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been relatively
unaffected by the financial woes sweeping much of the region,
President Lee Teng-hui on Friday called on his senior economics 
officials to guard against any turmoil and to ensure the smooth
development of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>After being briefed at an urgently convened economic conference
on the current economic situation, the president lauded the fact that
the country's sound economic fundamentals have shielded it from the
regional economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Given the increasing integrity of the economies in the region,
however, the president urged his economics staff to monitor closely
the unfolding of the crisis, and brace for future challenges.</P>
      <P>The conference brought together Vice President Lien Chan, Premier
Vincent Siew, Secretary General to President Huang Kun-huei,
Secretary General of National Security Council Ding Mou-shih,
Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang, Chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development P.K. Chiang, and Governor of the
Central Bank of China Sheu Yuang-dong.</P>
      <P>Those attending were told that the crisis gripping Southeast Asia
stems from the collapse of the so-called "bubble economy," deficits
in current accounts, heavy foreign debts, small foreign reserves,
over-reliance on the inflow of foreign capital and rigid foreign
exchange rates.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan's capability to withstand the crisis is
based on its steady macro-economy, surplus in its current account,
few foreign debts, a gradual process of opening up its markets to
foreign investment, and a sound financial system.</P>
      <P>The participants, from Lien Chan down, also credited the island's
smooth avoidance of economic turmoil to President Lee Teng-hui's
"avoid haste, exercise restraint, tread gingerly to attain
long-lasting stability" policy toward mainland China, which they said
should remain the island's guiding principle in dealing with the
mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday called on
the German-based Bayer Group to have second thoughts on its decision
to suspend its proposed multi-billion dollar investment project in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed the hope that the international chemical and
pharmaceutical giant will go ahead with its investment project in
Taichung County, adding that Bayer should not make any crucial
decision until the screening of a land lease by the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly.</P>
      <P>Based on the fact that the project passed a central government
environmental impact assessment, The Taiwan Provincial Government
earlier this week approved a land lease which allows the provincial
government to lease 90 hectares of land in the Taichung Harbor area
to Bayer for a period of 50 years.</P>
      <P>However, the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, which has the final say
on the fate of the land lease, refused to review the contract in its
current session which ended on Friday, saying that a task force
formed in the assembly needs more time to gain a better understanding
of public opinion of the project.</P>
      <P>Siew said that he has already ordered P.K. Chiang, chairman of
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) to contact
Bayer and try to persuade the multinational not to give up the
project. Chiang will also urge the Taiwan Provincial Assembly to
complete and make public the report on the project in due course,
Siew added.</P>
      <P>While calling on the people of Taiwan to treasure their
hard-earned economic achievement, Siew noted that if Taiwan wants to
maintain its high economic growth rate next year amid the financial
turmoil in the rest of Asia, it must strengthen its investment
incentives to attract more local and foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that the protection of the environment and the
development of industries are equally important for a country and
that the two things should not necessarily conflict with each other.
Taiwan won't develop its economy at the expense of the environment,
he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMF SEES LOWEST ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR NIE'S IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee &amp; Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's newly industrialized economies
(NIEs) will see average economic growth decline to a 14-year low of
3.6 percent in 1998 as a result of the ongoing financial turmoil that
has embroiled many of the nations in the region, according to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).</P>
      <P>In a response to CNA queries, a spokesman for the IMF's economic
research department said that the 1997 average growth for NIEs --
Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong -- will reach 6.2
percent, 0.3 percentage points higher than an earlier IMF forecast,
due to better-than-expected performances from Taiwan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's economy is expected to grow 6.7 percent
this year, next only to Vietnam (9 percent), the Chinese mainland
(8.8 percent), and Malaysia (7 percent).</P>
      <P>With the impact of the financial crisis looming, the IMF has made
a downward adjustment of the 1997 economic growth forecast for Hong
Kong and Singapore, to 5.3 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively,
while raising that of South Korea, which didn't suffer until recently,
to 6.2 percent, due to its strong exports.</P>
      <P>For 1998, the spokesman said, the growth rates for Hong Kong and
South Korea will decline to 4.1 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>He said that the 2.5 percent growth forecast for South Korea may
be "too optimistic" as Seoul has accepted the IMF's bailout packages
to undertake structural economic reforms, which is expected to
largely reduce domestic demand, making it impossible for South Korea
to maintain high economic growth.</P>
      <P>According to IMF estimates, the Asian financial crisis will pull
down average world economic growth by 0.8 percentage points. In terms
of grouping, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries
will suffer most, with economic growth trimmed by 3.7 percentage
points, followed by the NIEs, by 2.4 percentage points and
industrialized countries, by 2 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also denied allegations by many economists that
mainland China's renminbi is under great pressure for devaluation in
the wake of the currency crises in its neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>He said that it's true that mainland China may lose some of its
export markets to other countries that have had their currencies
devalued, but it would not be so difficult as has been speculated for
mainland authorities to defend the renminbi, since mainland China
maintains both strong economic growth and a huge current account
surplus of up to 3 percent of its gross domestic product.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US YET TO ACCEPT TAIWAN PROPOSAL ON AUTO EXPORTS IN WTO TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has yet to accept a
proposal by the Republic of China on cutting the tariffs on auto
exports to Taiwan, US officials said on Friday following the 16th
round of bilateral negotiations on Taiwan's terms for entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) which ended here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the US will communicate with its auto
manufacturers before giving the ROC an answer on the issue.</P>
      <P>During the latest talks, Taiwan made a new proposal on auto
imports, offering that cars below 2000cc will continue to have a
tariff of 25 percent.</P>
      <P>Tariffs for cars larger than 2000cc will be cut in two stages.
The rate will be cut to 35 percent in the first five years of
Taiwan's WTO membership, and further reduced to 30 percent beginning
in the sixth year.</P>
      <P>US officials denied that the new proposal has been accepted,
saying that they will continue to communicate with Chrysler, Ford and
General Motors, in the hope that the problem can be resolved before
the end of next January.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also offered to lift differential tariffs on compact cars
beyond a certain quota nine years after WTO entry, imposing instead a
single 20 percent tariff.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation, headed by Chen Ruey-long, director general of
the Board of Foreign Trade, is still visiting various industrial
groups in the US to solicit support for Taiwan's WTO bid. It is
scheduled to fly back to Taiwan on Friday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang will head the ROC
delegation to the next round of WTO talks with the US, slated to be
held in Washington in February.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian universities are attracting
more foreign students from Asia and elsewhere, defying predictions of
a backlash triggered by Independent Member of Parliament Pauline
Hanson, the racist, bigoted former fish-and-chip seller who is a
champion of anti-Asian immigration.</P>
      <P>IDP Education Australia, which is responsible for selling
Australian universities abroad, reported that the number of foreign
students from Asia and elsewhere has increased 22 percent in the past
12 months.</P>
      <P>Despite this positive result, IDP Education on Friday warned that
the recent Asian financial crisis could threaten enrollments for next
year.</P>
      <P>A recent survey by IDP Education shows the number of foreign
students jumped to 75,500 in August this year from 61,800 for the
same period last year.</P>
      <P>More than 50 percent of the total number came from Malaysia,
Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, with the rest coming from Taiwan,
mainland China and other countries.</P>
      <P>Australia's education exports are worth A$3 billion a year and
the race debate sparked by Hanson's anti-Asian remarks in September,
1996 posed a serious threat.</P>
      <P>However, reassurances by senior Australian politicians from
across the political spectrum, who branded her as an
unrepresentative, jingoistic moron, have minimized Hanson's damage to
Australia's educational industry.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Melbourne-based Crown Casino, the
biggest gambling den in the Southern Hemisphere, has lost A$40
million in the past five months because high-rollers from Asia have
enjoyed an unprecedented winning streak in the past six weeks,
company chairman Lloyd Williams said.</P>
      <P>The massive losses have forced the casino to make rights issue of
A$146 million through its banks to give it much-needed cash and
reduce its gearing.</P>
      <P>But the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Stock
Exchange have launched investigations into Crown's operations and its
worsening financial situation.</P>
      <P>The news sparked a plunge of 21 Australian cents in the Crown
share price to a record low of 63 Australian cents, on a Friday
turnover of 11.6 million shares.</P>
      <P>The losses are largely the result of massive payouts to high
rollers from Asia. The cost of operating its premium player market
has also forced the company to make the rights issue.</P>
      <P>Crown chairman Williams said the casino has lost A$55 million in
the past six weeks alone to high-rollers from Asia.</P>
      <P>"They (Crown Casino) are bleeding," one shocked institutional
investor told reporters.</P>
      <P>Consolidated Press Holdings, owned by Australia's richest man,
Kerry Packer, has agreed to take up any shortfall, which is expected
to boost Packer's stake in the casino to 22 percent from the current
seven percent.</P>
      <P>Crown Casino has set up offices in Taipei, Hong Kong, Bangkok,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta to attract high-rollers from
these places.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
keeping tabs on the movement in the United States of 53 Taiwan
residents from 12 families who are allegedly involved with a
religious cult.</P>
      <P>Shen Lu-hsiun, director of MOFA's Department of North American
Affairs, made the remarks following reports that the cult members had
left Taiwan for Dallas, Texas, where they are said to be planning to
commit mass suicide so that their bodies can be picked up by space
ships in March next year.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilor Chin Hui-chu said she received several
requests for help from family members of the 53 residents who feared
for their safety after hearing of the cult's involvement with a
so-called "God Saves the Earth Flying Saucer Foundation."</P>
      <P>Chin called on the MOFA on Saturday to ask for the ministry's
assistance in ensuring the cult members' safety.</P>
      <P>Shen said that local police in Texas and related US government
agencies are also closely watching the situation.</P>
      <P>Shen said the ministry is fully aware of the activities of the 53
Taiwan residents, adding that the ROC representative office in Dallas
had also contacted them by telephone and was informed that "there is
no intention to commit mass suicide."</P>
      <P>He said that the cult has so far engaged in no criminal
activities, and that US authorities can only monitor developments
closely at the present time.</P>
      <P>But Shen said that if the cult members are found to have been
forced to remain in the United States against their will, US law
enforcement officials will intervene.</P>
      <P>Local news reports said that the "Truth Cult" is led by Chen
Heng-ming, 43, who quit his teaching job at a college in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, last February, in order to pursue advanced studies
in the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen registered the organization with the Ministry of the
Interior two years ago under the name "ROC Soul Research
Association," claiming to have 80 followers.</P>
      <P>According to the families of the followers, the cult members
believe that Jesus Christ will return to Earth in July 1999. The cult
reportedly practices the traditional Chinese healing art of "chi
gong" to treat illnesses, and the followers have apparently donated
large sums of cash as well as automobiles to the cult.</P>
      <P>The ROC Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether any laws
were broken by the cult in soliciting money or in the conduct of
other operations.</P>

November last year, with exports and imports increasing by 10.5
percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, the Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB) announced on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The total value of November's trade amounted to S$32,829 million,

million, it said.</P>
      <P>In real terms (at 1990 prices), the total value of trade in
November amounted to S$37,982 million, indicating a growth of 10.2
percent over the same month last year.</P>
      <P>Exports totaled S$19,259 million, while imports stood at S$18,723
million, according to figures compiled by the TDB.</P>
      <P>Non-oil domestic exports expanded by 11.9 percent, while

      <P>Domestic oil exports, however, continued to decline by 10 percent
in November.</P>
      <P>Re-exports grew by 11.8 percent in November, due mainly to

      <P>A group of Taiwan trade promoters and

      <P>Economic Minister Wang Chih-kang said Saturday that the mission

Council, the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the
Economic Affair Ministry, and the Industrial Development Bureau of

of those countries, so as to help Taiwan investors adjust
themselves to the new situations.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that some Taiwan investors in mainland China are
considering moving their investments to Southeast Asia for fear of
a sudden devaluation of the renminbi and other kind of risks.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Business Managers' Association also reported recently
that many Taiwan investors in mainland China have asked the
association for help, because they want to move their investments to
somewhere else.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said the renminbi is not going to depreciate in
the near future, because government control of foreign exchange in
mainland China is tight, but it is hard to predict what will happen to
the currency in the long term. The later it devalues, the greater
risk it will bring, he added.

    <HEADLINE>LEE TENG-HUI SAYS HE WILL RETIRE AFTER TENURE EXPIRES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said on Friday that he will retire after his current tenure expires
two and a half years from now.</P>
      <P>"I would be glad and feel lucky if history regards me as a person
who contributed greatly to promoting Taiwan's democratization and who
loves Taiwan and Chinese people," he said in an interview with the
Tokyo-based Sankai Shimbun newspaper.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he has designated an heir apparent, Lee said it is
up to the people of the nation to decide his successor, as the ROC is
now a fully democratic nation.</P>
      <P>He said that during his one and a half years in office, he has
realized most of his campaign promises, as Taiwan's economy has
become healthier, party politics have taken root and national
security has been safeguarded.</P>
      <P>Lee won a resounding victory in Taiwan's first direct
presidential election last March.</P>
      <P>During the three-hour interview with visiting Japanese reporters,
Lee answered a series of questions covering a wide range of
political, economic and national security issues.</P>
      <P>He said that Taipei is willing to resume suspended bilateral
cross-strait negotiations with mainland China, as long as no
preconditions are set.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that Taipei insists on the unification
of China under the principles of freedom, democracy and equal
distribution of wealth and that it will be very difficult to achieve
the goal of national unification until mainland China can adopt a
multi-party democratic system.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's live missile tests in the waters of the Taiwan
Strait carried out to intimidate the people of Taiwan in the runup to
the country's first presidential election, Lee said the provocation
by Beijing caused grave concern among neighboring countries and the
incident ended only after the United States sent two aircraft carrier
battle groups to the area, fully illustrating Beijing's tendency to
"bully the weak and fear the strong."</P>
      <P>As to the "intended ambiguity" in the revised US-Japan defense
guidelines which don't clearly define Taiwan in the area subject to
joint US-Japan military action in case of contingencies, Lee said
that the ambiguity is understandable and shows that the US attaches
importance to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>He noted that the improved US relations with mainland China have
had no direct negative impact on its ties with Taiwan so far, but he
said Beijing is very likely to press US President Bill Clinton to
limit US support for Taiwan when he visits the mainland next year.</P>
      <P>Lee also pledged to promote substantial relations with friendly
countries, especially with the US and Japan, and said he hopes the
Japanese government will reciprocate by allowing higher-ranking
officials, to at least the vice minister level, to visit Taipei.</P>
      <P>The president also clarified remarks he made recently during two
separate interviews with the US media that "Taiwan is a sovereign,
independent country," saying the remarks don't signify any change in
the government's stance on the issue. They simply referred to the
reality that the ROC, now on Taiwan, has always been an independent
state, ever since its establishment in 1912.</P>

on Saturday offered his "deepest sympathies" to the families of
passengers on board the ill-fated SilkAir aircraft which crashed near
Palembang, Indonesia on Friday evening and said that the Singapore

      <P>He said in a statement at noon that he was "dismayed" when
Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan informed him that a SilkAir
aircraft returning from Jakarta to Singapore had gone missing.</P>
      <P>"We feared the worst but hoped for the best," he said.</P>
      <P>"I am greatly distressed that our fears have been confirmed --
the aircraft had crashed.</P>

tragic accident.</P>
      <P>"I offer my deepest sympathies to the affected families. This is
a difficult time for them and I wish them strength and fortitude," he
said.</P>
      <P>Goh said the Singapore government has joined the Indonesian
authorities in mounting a full search and rescue operation. "We are
grateful to the Indonesian authorities for their prompt response and
continuing efforts," he added.</P>
      <P>Mah said at a hastily called press conference that the government

cause of the crash -- the first ever accident for Singapore Airlines

      <P>All 104 passengers and crew on board SilkAir's newest B737-300
aircraft are believed to have been killed in the crash.</P>
      <P>Reports from Indonesia said that by noon Saturday, some 38 bodies
had been identified and two heavy pieces of the body of the crashed
aircraft had been recovered, although the "black box" flight data

    <TEXT>
      <P>The family of a South African diplomat
which was suddenly cast into the national spotlight after being taken
hostage by Taiwan's most wanted fugitive last month, was given a warm
farewell party at an elementary school here Saturday.</P>
      <P>McGill Alexander, military attache of South African embassy to
the ROC, said that he would like to return to Taiwan if given the
opportunity. He expressed his appreciation for all the support given
to the family after the hostage incident.</P>
      <P>The Alexanders are due to return to South Africa early next year
after Taipei and Pretoria sever diplomatic ties after Dec. 31, 1997.</P>
      <P>The farewell party, sponsored by local King Car Education
Foundation, was held at the Chienan Elementary School.</P>
      <P>The family arrived at the school to a song of welcome. After an
exchange of gifts, the family donned traditional Chinese attire
presented by the foundation.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-lan, president of Chienan school, also presented an
honorary student certificate to Christine, the diplomat's 12-year-old
daughter whose courage in the hostage crisis captured the hearts of
Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>Alexander, speaking to about 1,000 students and faculty members,
said that the family will never forget the warmth and support they
received during and after the hostage incident.</P>
      <P>Although he, his wife and two daughters experienced a family's
worst nightmare, Alexander said, words could not convey their
appreciation for the many letters, phone calls and fax messages of
support from total strangers received after the ordeal.</P>
      <P>The South African diplomat also said among all the "fair and good
memories, the warmth and hospitality of Taiwan people are the most
difficult to forget."</P>
      <P>He also expressed his confidence about the future of the ROC,
saying that the people here are diligent and hard working, seemly
never in need of sleep.</P>
      <P>The 90-minute farewell party closed with the Alexanders singing a
farewell song with about 1,000 students and faculty members of the
Chienan elementary school.</P>
      <P>Alexander, his wife and two daughters were held at gunpoint in
their home on Nov. 18 by fugitive Chen Chin-hsing, wanted for the
brutal kidnap and murder of the daughter of local TV celebrity Pai
Ping-ping and other notorious cases. Alexander and his elder daughter
Melanie were shot and wounded during the 24-hour standoff, while his
wife and younger daughter Christine were eventually released
unharmed. The family became familiar to Taiwan residents after local
TV stations provided live coverage of the entire incident.</P>

rest of the world in 1999, and that Garland is a land blessed by God.</P>
      <P>Chin also urged Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian to help resolve the
matter, as many of the cult members are Taipei residents. Since
Taipei is a sister city of Dallas, Chen should find channels through
that relationship to help the government bring the followers back to
Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>Y.C. Luo, deputy director-general of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Houston, on Saturday visited about 50 cult members
in Garland on behalf of the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>Luo said those believers from Taiwan now lead a very peaceful and
normal life in Garland and that their activities there should be
respected, as all of them entered the United States legally.</P>
      <P>Some of cult members complained about reports by the Taiwan press
that they plan to commit mass suicide so their bodies can be
transported to heaven by flying saucers.</P>
      <P>They said they came to the United States with Chen voluntarily to
escape the "millennium catastrophe" and that they are not controlled
by anybody and do not intend to kill themselves en masse. Such
reports appearing in the Taiwan media are "ridiculous" and "absurd,"
they added.</P>
      <P>They also expressed the desire to stay in the United States to
wait for the arrival of God and flying saucers to take them to heaven
on March 31 and said they will return to Taiwan if God does not
appear by then.</P>

      <P>There is ample room for mainland China
and Taiwan to develop relations on the basis of mutual respect,
equality, and goodwill, Chang King-Yuh, chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan, said here Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who arrived here Friday for a two-day visit, told a group

two sides of the Taiwan Strait have improved considerably in the
past decade, and that Taiwan has been trying to promote various
kinds of exchanges with the mainland for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>But, he said, Beijing's efforts to isolate Taiwan in
the world community, and its reluctance to abandon the option of
using force against Taiwan and to recognize the existence of the
Republic of China, have hindered the development of the relations.</P>
      <P>He said that only on the basis of mutual respect, equality, and

    <HEADLINE>EARLY TARIFF CUTS ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS STILL UNDECIDED: WANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Sunday that Taiwan has not decided whether to make concessions on a
timetable for the reduction of tariffs on agricultural products as
part of its efforts to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported in its Sunday edition that in
order to push through early admission to the world trade regulatory
body by next May, Taiwan will agree to a US demand to lower tariff
rates on agricultural products ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Wang did not confirm or deny the report, saying only that no
decision has been made by his ministry regarding an accelerated
timetable for tariff cuts on agricultural products. His ministry will
consult the Council of Agriculture on the sensitive issue to ensure
that the interests of local farmers will not be ignored, Wang
stressed.</P>
      <P>The report said that Taiwan had previously insisted that the
tariff cuts be completed within three years after Taiwan's WTO
admission. But in an attempt to conclude trade talks with the United
States on terms for Taiwan's early membership in the trade watchdog
body, authorities here plan to implement tariff reductions on some
agricultural products prior to its WTO accession, and that reductions
on some agricultural products will be finalized by 2000 instead of
2002, as originally proposed.</P>
      <P>Tariffs on agricultural products remain the greatest obstacle in
the Taiwan-US trade talks. The US officials had demanded that
across-the-board tariff cuts on agricultural and industrial products
be completed by 2002, while Taiwan suggested that the timetable for
cuts on some 160 agricultural goods, including beef, pork and fish
products, be pushed back to 2004. US negotiators rejected the
proposal and further demanded that tariff reductions on 60
agricultural items be finalized by 2000.</P>
      <P>The local news report said that to avoid bringing any negative
impact upon the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in local elections to be held
in January, the Economic Ministry has decided to delay the next round
of trade talks with the United States on agricultural products and
policy-related issues from January to February.</P>
      <P>The United States is one of three WTO members that have not
concluded negotiations with Taiwan on terms for its entry to the WTO.
The other two are the 15-member European Union and Switzerland.</P>

      <P>An interministerial-level meeting on the
South China Sea is scheduled to be held on Tuesday with an aim to
work out pragmatic measures to stress the Republic of China's
sovereignty over the disputed waters.</P>
      <P>According to the Interior Ministry, in addition to reviewing the
results of the first South China Sea meeting held in Taipei in 1993,
officials from several government agencies will discuss a consensus
reached earlier in a nonpartisan negotiation that the ROC government
will temporarily put aside its "sovereignty over the special
historical waters," and find practical means of reinforcing the ROC's
sovereignty over the disputed waters claimed by a number of countries
in the region.</P>
      <P>The Interior Ministry said that to temporarily put aside the
ROC's sovereignty claims to the territorial waters does not mean
not to claim the sovereignty forever. Rather, it hopes to resolve
the highly sensitive and complex dispute with practical measures.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Interior Ministry said the government's
decision to adopt a pragmatic approach toward the issue is expected
to help it gain a seat in future international conferences on the
South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The Tuesday meeting on the South China Sea will be chaired by
Interior Minister Yeh Ching-feng and attended by officials from the
ministries of foreign affairs, national defense and economic affairs,
as well as the Mainland Affairs Council, the Council of Agriculture

(WTO) by sacrificing the interests of local farmers.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said
they cannot support concessions on a timetable for the reduction of
tariffs on agricultural products as part of efforts to conclude trade
talks with the United States on terms for Taiwan's entry into the

      <P>The United Daily News reported in its Sunday edition that in
order to remove the greatest obstacle in the Taiwan-US trade talks --
differences on the timetable for tariff cuts on agricultural

tariff rates on some agricultural products prior to its WTO
accession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had previously insisted that the across-the-board tariff
cuts on agricultural products be completed within three years after

      <P>COA officials said that the opening of the rice market to all
foreign competition after its WTO admission will have the greatest
impact on Taiwan's agricultural sector. The government should not
make any further concessions on the rice import policy or on tariff
reductions on other agricultural products, they added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has agreed to a rice import policy modeled after Japan's,
under which Taiwan will allow the import of rice amounting to 4
percent of its national rice consumption in the first year after its
WTO admission. The import quota will increase annually by 0.8 percent
in the subsequent five-year period, whereupon the import quota would
represent 8 percent of its total rice consumption.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and US trade officials, however, still have differences
over the allocation of the rice quota and access of imported rice to

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fang Lizhi, one of the most prominent
mainland Chinese dissidents living in the United States, said on
Saturday that Taiwan and mainland China should keep their channels of
dialogue open for bilateral communication, according to a report by
the China Times Express on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fang, who was visiting Taiwan to attend an astronomical workshop
sponsored by Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest research institute,
made the remarks in an interview with the mass-circulation evening
newspaper.</P>
      <P>Fang, who was exiled from mainland China for advocating democracy
there, said the most important thing for Taiwan at present is to
strengthen itself, as Chinese communists only believe in force.</P>
      <P>Fang suggested the Taiwan authorities acquire sufficient
knowledge and understanding of the Chinese communists in order to
improve their policy toward mainland China, since "the Chinese
Communist Party has hardly changed in the past few decades."</P>
      <P>Fang proposed Taiwan adopt a flexible mainland policy and
maintain communication channels with mainland China in order to
forestall any emergency cases.</P>
      <P>"Unification will not take place soon and cross-strait
communication channels must be kept open, " Fang said, adding that
the missile crisis over the Taiwan Strait in March 1996 was caused by
lack of such channels.</P>
      <P>"If the two sides maintain positive exchanges, the chances of
war are slim," he noted.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing's "one China, two systems" unification scheme is
theoretically feasible, Fang said, it is hard to put it into practice
on the long-term if the systems of the two sides are different."</P>
      <P>Citing Hong Kong as example, he said signs have indicated that
"the Hong Kong media have begun to exercise self restraints by not
criticizing the decisions made by Beijing."</P>
      <P>Regarding the recent election defeat of the ruling Kuomintang at
the hands of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, Fang said
"there is noting to worry about, as it is natural in a democratic

    <HEADLINE>`NO HASTE, BE PATIENT' POLICY PAYS OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist Chinese statistics released over
the weekend show that Taiwan's "no haste, be patient" policy on
investment in mainland China has paid off, as investment across the
Taiwan Strait saw a significant drop in the first three quarters of
this year.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by mainland China's Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MFTEC), Taiwan's business
people committed themselves to pouring US$2.01 billion into the
mainland for investing in 2,181 projects between January and
September of this year.</P>
      <P>The amount marked a 54 percent year-on-year decline, while the
number of projects receiving investment from Taiwan fell 9.1 percent
from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>The tallies also show that the average amount invested in each
investment project was about US$920,000, down nearly 50 percent from
an average of US$1.83 million recorded for the same period of 1996.</P>
      <P>Wang Hui, deputy director of the MFTEC's Department of Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, said the decrease can be partly
attributed to Taiwan's "no haste, be patient" policy, which bans
Taiwan companies from investing in mainland China's infrastructure
construction projects, such as power plants, airports and highways.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the dwindling Taiwan investment was
adjustments in mainland China's taxation policy, which have cut tax
privileges to foreign investors, including those from Taiwan, Wang
noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to implement the "no haste, be patient" policy on
cross-strait investment in 1996 as mainland China continued its
efforts to block Taiwan's presence in the international community and
declined to resume institutionalized cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>According to official mainland statistics, Taiwan companies to
date have committed to investing a total of US$37.37 billion in the
mainland for 37,652 projects as of the end of September. Of the
committed amount, US$17.57 billion has actually been remitted, making
Taiwan the third largest foreign capital supplier to mainland China
after Hong Kong and Japan.</P>
      <P>In terms of investment commitment, Taiwan ranked sixth, trailing
Hong Kong, the Virgin Islands, the United States, Singapore and
Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIRLINES TO CASH IN ON FIVE-DAY WORK SCHEME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's airline industry is gearing up to
cash in on the five-day work scheme expected to be partially
implemented at the beginning of next year, adjusting their fleets and
flight destinations in order to draw potential customers, business
sources have said.</P>
      <P>As the new work schedule is expected to create an additional one
million potential weekend holidaymakers, flights to neighboring
countries such as Japan and Southeast Asian countries will become
more popular, the sources said, adding that about 30 destinations
will be added next year to the current flight service network of
major domestic carriers serving international routes.</P>
      <P>Destinations in countries and areas such as Guam, Indonesia,
Macao, Palau and Saipan, which offer visa-free or landing-visa
privileges to tourists from Taiwan, will become more competitive in
their drive to draw Taiwan visitors, the sources forecast.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest carrier,
said CAL's fleet will be expanded to 57 airplanes from the current 50
units and the number of flights to Japan and Indonesia will be
increased.</P>
      <P>Starting on Jan. 1, 1998, CAL will increase its five weekly
Taipei-Bali flights to seven, while Taiwan-Okinawa flights will be
increased from 12 to 14 each week, and Taipei-Nagoya flights will be
increased by 40 percent, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The spokesman predicted that the number of Japan-bound Taiwan
tourists will continue to rise following the implementation of the
five-day work week early next year and revealed that CAL will
increase its charter services to Kagoshima, Nagasaki, Hiroshima and
Sapporo in Japan, while flights to Penang and Ipo in Malaysia and
those to Chiang Mai in northern Thailand will also be increased.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways Corp. (EVA AIR), CAL's major rival, said the new work
schedule has prompted it to plan the launch of a number of three-day
package tours to Japan and Southeast Asia for individual travelers.</P>
      <P>According to EVA AIR, the company will significantly increase its
flight services to cities on the northern Japanese island of
Hokkaido, while it will also increase its international flights
departing from Kaohsiung, to better serve residents in southern
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TALKS ON POLITICAL AGENDA ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT SAID PREMATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   22   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although people here have great
expectations for the resumption of cross-Taiwan Strait talks, an
official of the ROC's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said over the
weekend that he does not believe the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
can reach agreement on a political agenda at present.</P>
      <P>During a seminar which took place on Sunday on cross-strait
relations and Taiwan's future, SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho said
that talks on a political agenda at the moment would be premature
because of the current lack of mutual trust between both sides.</P>
      <P>Chiao blamed Beijing for the stalled cross-strait relations,
adding that Taiwan has become very pragmatic in its mainland policy
since its initial opposition to contact with the mainland. He cited
as an example the fact that mainland China now receives nearly 2
million visits by people from Taiwan every year.</P>
      <P>In contrast, he noted, mainland China lacks sincerity in handling
cross-strait relations, and refuses to forego the "one China"
principle, which sees Taiwan as a part of the People's Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing's insistence that the Republic of China met
its demise in 1949, when the communists took over the mainland, has
hampered the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chiao stressed that although nobody wants a war across the Taiwan
Strait, an ingratiating attitude toward Beijing will not help promote
cross-trait ties.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC sees "separate rule" on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait as a fact now, and that the ultimate goal is to pursue
a unified China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRUG TRAFFICKING RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Law-enforcement officers busted a drug
trafficking ring in the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung on Sunday,
arresting three key suspects and confiscating 78 kilograms of
amphetamine with a street value of some NT$56 million (US$1.72
million).</P>
      <P>The Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice (MJIB)
said on Monday that the drugs had been smuggled from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The three detained suspects were identified as Hsin Chen-sheng,
48; Hsu Chung-hsing, 25; and Yang Chin-po, 49. All three are ROC
nationals.</P>
      <P>The trio were caught red-handed in a busy hypermarket parking lot
in Kaohsiung's bustling business district at around 6:00 p.m. Sunday,
while Hsin and Hsu were striking a deal with Yang.</P>
      <P>Law-enforcement officers uncovered the 78 kg of amphetamine in a
van parked nearby.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the ring had often conducted
trade deals in crowded business districts, using the presence of
shoppers or pedestrians to distract attention.</P>
      <P>Just two weeks ago, the ring allegedly pulled off an amphetamine
sale to local drug dealers at another retail market in downtown
Kaohsiung. To date, an estimated 300 kg of amphetamine, worth more
than NT$400 million at street prices, is believed to have flowed into
the underground drug market through this channel.</P>
      <P>Investigators said they will trace the source of the drugs and
probe whether there are additional accomplices involved.</P>
      <P>A task force made up of MJIB branches in Kaohsiung, Pingtung and
Changhua, as well as relevant police offices and the coast guard
intelligence department had been shadowing the ringleaders for more
than a year prior to the arrests.</P>
      <P>The task force found that Hsin had set up an amphetamine
processing plant in mainland China and has successfully smuggled a
large quantity of the drug to Taiwan via fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Acting on information that the ring had stored a large quantity
of amphetamines in the Talo hypermarket parking lot, law-enforcement
officers raided the site on Sunday evening.</P>
      <P>MJIB Director Wang Rong-jou traveled to Kaohsiung on Monday to
preside over a ceremony during which MJIB agents involved in Sunday's
operations were cited.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Wang said 75 percent of contraband
drugs seized in Taiwan originated in mainland China, usually entering
Taiwan via fishing boats or arriving by air via Burma and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Wang said mainland Chinese authorities should cooperate with
Taiwan in cracking down on the trafficking in illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>"In future cross-strait talks, anti-drug trafficking should be a
priority topic," Wang said, adding that he is convinced mainland
China would be willing to cooperate with Taiwan in wiping out the
illegal drug trade. "Mainland China will be the victim if it fails to
take immediate action to eradicate such business."</P>
      <P>Wang said drug dealers or traffickers continue to refine and
improve their trading methods, and now often either conduct deals in
bustling marketplaces or store drugs in safety deposit boxes at
department stores. "Law-enforcement officers must hammer out suitable
strategies to cope with the new challenges," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S ECONOMY AFFECTED BY ASIAN FINANCIAL TURMOIL: ZHU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji
remarked at an economic conference held in mid-December that mainland
China's exports and foreign investment will decrease and its economic
growth rate will fall below 8 percent as a result of Asia's monetary
crisis, according to Japan's mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun
newspaper on Sunday.</P>
      <P>If the mainland's 1998 economic growth rate scores less than 8
percent, it will be the lowest growth since 1991, which will affect
the mainland's average growth rate target of 8 percent for the ninth
five-year economic plan (1996-2000), the newspaper noted.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, the main topics discussed by Zhu at the
meeting were:</P>
      <P>-- Although most Asian countries have been swept by the latest
currency crisis, Beijing won't let its renminbi depreciate, while the
value of Hong Kong's currency will be pegged to the US dollar in
order to ensure Hong Kong's survival.</P>
      <P>-- Both mainland export and foreign investment in 1998 will
decrease; the influence of foreign investment on the mainland's
economy will be weakened and the growth rate will be reduced
accordingly.</P>
      <P>The mainland's economy in the latter half of 1997 regressed
slightly, revealed the Yomiuri, describing this as a result of long
term tight monetary policy and price cutting on consumer goods,
causing increases in bankruptcies among enterprises and leading to
higher unemployment.</P>
      <P>The paper disclosed that price cutting on retail prices lasted
for two consecutive months last October and November, while
unemployment rose to 5,000,000, according to official mainland
statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, foreign investment in the first 10 months of this year
amounted to US$39.9 billion, a decrease of 35 percent compared with
the same period of last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EVA PILOTS' DEATH LINKED TO CARBON MONOXIDE POISON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An initial autopsy carried out Monday on the
bodies of two Venezuelan pilots working for EVA Airlines who were
found dead on Saturday showed that the two might have died of carbon
monoxide poisoning.
 Cesar Alberto Reuda and Marco Tulio Cegarra, were found dead on
the 13th floor of the EVA Airlines dormitory building in Luchu
Village, in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>EVA officials began to suspect something amiss when captain Reuda
failed to report to the EVA office at CKS airport on Saturday morning
when he was due to pilot an EVA BR-67 plane to London.</P>
      <P>Airline officials went with police to the dormitory, where they
found the bodies of the two men in their apartment. Reuda was lying
in bed with bubbles around the corners of his mouth, while
Cegarra was lying on the sofa in the living room.</P>
      <P>There were no signs of forcible entry and the gas stove was off,
although the windows were shut tight and the air conditioners were
on. There were no signs of a scuffle and neither man had sustained
any noticeable wounds. Their personal property was also intact.</P>
      <P>Police found half-consumed instant noodles and several bottles of
pills for treating respiratory illness in the apartment.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan Prosecutor's Office said the coroner's initial finding
was death from excessive inhalation of carbon monoxide, but added
that further tests will be needed to fully establish the cause of
death.</P>
      <P>Reuda's brother, who was the only family member present at the
autopsy, was reported as being extremely distressed, and declined to
comment. Other family members of the two will arrive soon.</P>
      <P>EVA officials said that Rueda, 43, had a record of 4,714 flying
hours. Cegarra, 47, had 11,005 flying hours. Both men had received a
clean bill of health during their most recent physical examinations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tourist arrivals from Taiwan in Fukuoka on
the southern Japanese island of Kyushu has declined rapidly over the
past few months as a result of stricter screening by the Japanese
Transport Ministry of applications for temporary flights by
Taiwan-based carriers, Japan's economic daily Nihon Kaizei Shimbun
reported in its Monday edition.</P>
      <P>The measure has resulted in a drop in Taiwan tourist arrivals in
Fukuoka in September and October, the newspaper reported.</P>
      <P>Taiwan tourist arrivals in Fukuoka dropped by 1 percent in
September compared to the same month of last year, while the figure
for October decreased by 3 percent on an annual basis, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>Foreign visitor arrivals by air or sea in Kyushu have been
recorded at around 363,000 since the beginning of 1996 until
recently, 30 percent of which have been tourists from Taiwan, it
noted.</P>
      <P>It added that the decline in tourist arrivals from Taiwan has
caused grave concern among local tourism businesses in that it may
have a negative impact on the local tourism industry, especially with
the approaching Chinese New Year holiday, a high season for Taiwan
tourists visiting Japan.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Japanese Transport Ministry pointed out that
the ministry decided to impose stricter approval for temporary
flights by Taiwan-based airlines because they questioned the need for
Taiwan carriers to operate temporary flights all year round when
their regular flights are not always fully-loaded.</P>
      <P>China Airlines and EVA Airways Corp., Taiwan's two largest
carriers, were each approved to run 20 provisional flights to Fukuoka
on a monthly basis from January to October, but the number declined
to just one and two in September and October, respectively, although
it rose to five and 10 for November and December.</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with the Taiwan airline industry said Taiwan
tourists prefer to depart for Fukuoka in the morning, which is why
the Taiwan carriers use provisional charter flights. Most regular
flights leave Taipei in the evening, they noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing plans to boost imports next year to
narrow its mounting trade surplus and deflect trade friction,
according to reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Mainland China will continue to try to expand exports next year,
although it will also seek to reduce its excessively large surplus by
encouraging imports, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China posted a trade surplus of US$40.23 billion in the
first 11 months of this year compared with a surplus of US$13.93
billion in the same period of 1996.</P>
      <P>The surplus for November alone was US$4.65 billion.</P>
      <P>Some foreign and local economists have said export growth will
slow next year due to competition from Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Mainland officials have in the past said they are concerned over
the rapid rise in the surplus and that measures will be taken to
encourage more balanced trade.</P>
      <P>The mainland will further adjust its imports and encourage
imports of high-technology products next year, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>It gave no details, but the report said Beijing is preparing to
restore waivers of duties on imports of high technology equipment.</P>
      <P>Mainland China on October 1 cut import tariffs on a range of
products to pave the way for entry into the WTO.</P>
      <P>The report also said Beijing will encourage domestic banks to
provide mortgage loans to individual home buyers next year to reduce
the amount of unsold housing on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>The report also repeated previous policy statements that Beijing
will maintain what it calls its "appropriately tight" monetary policy
in 1998, while speeding up reforms in the struggling state sector and
taking measures to reduce unemployment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following a series of large-scale
crackdowns by Taiwan's law-enforcement authorities, a high-profile
international sex ring has terminated its illicit operations here, a
Taipei prosecutor said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipei District Prosecutor Liu Cheng-wu said the Taipei County
Police Headquarters recently received the passports of many detained
foreign prostitutes belonging to the "Lily" sex ring.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the passports were mailed to the police bureau
by operators of the Lily-associated human smuggling ring as an
acknowledgment of the crackdown," Liu said.</P>
      <P>By so doing, Liu said, the ring might be making a gesture to
inform law-enforcement authorities of its disbanding and to appeal
for a halt of further police investigations or raids.</P>
      <P>Liu said this was the first time that a large criminal ring has
disbanded itself following crackdowns by law-enforcement authorities.</P>
      <P>Liu, who is reputed for his integrity and devotion to fighting
corruption and the sex trade, said he will continue to direct
officers to investigate the case and bring to justice all those
involved in the illicit human smuggling and sex peddling operations.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taipei County police have been tipped off that the Lily
group and the human smuggling operatives connected with the ring had
sent back to their home countries a number of foreign prostitutes who
have not yet been taken into custody.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that the recent crackdown on hostels,
restaurants, individual sex brokers or underground brothel operators
who colluded with the Lily sex ring have paid off, and that the
ringleaders realize their illicit activities are finished," Liu
explained.</P>
      <P>After Lily operators threatened to kill Liu's family members, Liu
vowed to topple the ring within four months. Otherwise, he said he
would resign from his post. "I'm very happy to learn that our
anti-sex trade operations have brought about good results," the
widely respected prosecutor said.</P>
      <P>Police investigations show that the Lily ring had recruited
foreign women to work as prostitutes through an underworld syndicate
which ran an efficient human smuggling operation from Southeast Asia.
The human smuggling ring forced those women to serve as prostitutes
by confiscating their passports upon their arrival in Taiwan. Police
estimated that more than 120 women from Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong had been forced into
the sex trade by the syndicate.</P>
      <P>The foreign prostitutes entered Taiwan on tourist visas, or on
the basis of fallacious marriages with local men.</P>
      <P>In separate raids, law-enforcement officers had managed to arrest
nearly 200 people involved in the Lily operation, including
prostitutes, brothel operators, sex brokers, drivers and bodyguards.</P>
      <P>Liu said law-enforcement authorities began to investigate the
criminal activities three months ago. In the process, he said, Thai
police have offered much assistance, while cooperation from mainland
and Hong Kong authorities was not significant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VALUE OF NOVEMBER FOREIGN ORDERS TOPS US$10 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Orders placed by foreign companies with
Taiwan businesses and manufacturers in November were worth US$10.3
billion, the ninth consecutive month the US$10 billion mark was
broken, the Ministry of Economics Affairs (MOEA) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the MOEA's Statistics
Department, said orders from the United States hit US$3.2 billion in
November, up 14.3 percent, or US$400 million, from the same month of
1996.</P>
      <P>Affected by the breakout of foot and mouth disease at local hog
farms in March and by a stronger Taiwan dollar against the Japanese
yen in recent months, the value of Japanese orders placed with local
companies in November dropped by an annual rate of 24 percent to
US$980 million, the first monthly drop below the US$1 billion level
since 1995.</P>
      <P>Due to a sluggish information industry in Japan, Japanese orders
for Taiwan-made information industry and telecommunications products
fell by US$70 million in value, while orders for local plant and
animal products declined by US$150 million, a noticeable fall of 79
percent from the same month of 1996, Chang elaborated.</P>
      <P>In addition, orders from Hong Kong slid by 3.6 percent, or US$70
million, on an annual basis in November, mainly because of a
lackluster demand for textile products in the mainland Chinese
market, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AND TIBET SEEN CONTINUING FRICTION IN AUSSIE-CHINESE TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia and mainland China are
celebrating their 25th anniversary of formal relations this month and
yet Taiwan, Tibet and human rights issues are expected to remain the
focus of friction between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In its Friday editorial headlined "Building on 25 years of China
links," mass circulation newspaper The Australian says: "Today, there
is no dispute that the relationship with China is of fundamental
importance to Australia. As a trade partner in Asia, China ranks
behind only Japan and South Korea. It is a growing source of
investment, migrants, students and tourists for Australia and there
can be no doubt of its strategic weight and cultural influence."</P>
      <P>But the editorial warns: "That is not to say everything is rosy
in Australia-China ties. Taiwan, Tibet, human rights issues and the
treatment of Australian citizens who fall foul of the Chinese
authorities will ensure that some friction remains.</P>
      <P>"We should not step back from this. Australia has clearly
accepted the principle of 'one China' and does not formally recognize
Taiwan. But that does not and should not stop Australia from seeking
to maximize its commercial ties with Taiwan," the editorial says.</P>
      <P>"Likewise, Australian citizens are used to expressing their
opinions freely about what they perceive are injustices in other
countries. Freedom of speech on issues such as Tibet or China's
treatment of dissidents is part of Australian democracy," it adds.</P>
      <P>In another article on Friday headlined "Fear, greed teach us to
live with exotic giant" the daily's foreign editor Greg Sheridan says
that throughout Australia's history, mainland China has loomed as
"the other -- mysterious, exotic, sometimes threatening, sometimes
enticing."</P>
      <P>"Fear and opportunity have been the two contending, indeed
oscillating, motifs in Australia's view of China," he says.</P>
      <P>He points out that in the 1990s, there have been periodic
disagreements over Hong Kong and mainland China's human rights
practices. And Sheridan believes the future of ties between Beijing
and Canberra is "unclear."</P>
      <P>"There is an influential American view that the Chinese have
embarked on a long-term strategy to rid the region of the American
military. If that is so, it will ultimately bring China into
diplomatic conflict with Australia, as Australia is one of the chief
forces anchoring the United States in the region," he adds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US EXPERT PREDICTS 'BIG BUST' FOR MAINLAND ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Dec.   22   (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While Japan is struggling over
implementing its "big bang" following the recent economic crisis in
Asia, a leading US economics expert has predicted that the next
country to experience a bust will be mainland China.</P>
      <P>The prediction is made by Prof. Christopher Lingle of the
Weatherhead School of Management of Case Western Reserve University
in Cleveland, who is currently a visiting scholar in Australia.</P>
      <P>In an article published by the Australian Financial Review on
Monday, Lingle predicted "China's bubble will blow up in the face of
over one billion people."</P>
      <P>"While Japan continues to struggle over implementing its 'big
bang,' look out for the shock effects of China's 'big bust,'" he
warned.</P>
      <P>He said the weakest link in the mainland's ability to maintain
continued economic progress is the lack of transparency within its
financial institutions.</P>
      <P>"Avoiding the openness demanded by private investors in bond
markets, banks can be obliged to grant loans to meet political ends
and so neglect appropriate risk assessment in their lending
decisions. These funds may be for subsidies to support industry
policy or to reward political cronies," he said.</P>
      <P>"Additionally, the Bank of China suffers from a complete lack of
independence, and it has never carried out the oversight role of a
modern central bank," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said of the nearly 300,000 state-owned enterprises in the
Chinese mainland, roughly 75 percent are effectively bankrupt and are
kept afloat only by loans from state banks.</P>
      <P>"With or without dramatic reform, China's banking sector faces
severe problems in dealing with a ratio of 20 percent to 30 percent
of bad loans to assets. However, this figure may mushroom
dramatically once property prices and rentals begin to fall in
response to the overbuilding in many of China's largest cities," he
predicted.</P>
      <P>"There is no easy way to sort out the impending financial
crisis," Lingle added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE RESOURCES FIRMS FACING BLEAKEST YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hit by falling prices globally and the
recent economic crisis in Asia, Australian resources companies are
facing their bleakest Christmas since early 1980s and are now
starting to issue warnings that 1998 could even be worse.</P>
      <P>The warning was issued by John Prescott, chief executive of
Broken Hill Proprietary, Ltd., Australia's largest conglomerate, who
revealed that the Asian crisis had cost the company A$17 million in
the second quarter of fiscal 1997-98.</P>
      <P>He said most of the lost revenue came mainly from reduced steel
sales to Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Southeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>Copper, aluminum, nickel and zinc prices have plunged to new lows
as the world commodity crisis deepens.</P>
      <P>The falling prices have affected many Australian producers and
exporters as their profits plunged sharply, according to resource
analysts.</P>
      <P>To make the matter worse, Australian gold producers are suffering
because of the gold market crash while coal producers are sharing the
same fate because they have to reduce prices to compete with major
rivals from South Africa, the United States and Canada, the analysts
said.</P>
      <P>They said the impact would continue in 1998 because they believed
the economic crisis in Asia will not be over and that it will take
years to recover from such financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>The International Monetary Fund has already scaled down its
forecast of world economic growth in 1998 to 3.5 percent from its
earlier forecast of 4.1 percent, mainly due to the economic crisis in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Analysts predicted the falling prices of commodities -- which are
the backbone of Australia's exports -- will have a considerable
impact upon the nation's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello has already predicted that
Australia's gross domestic product will grow at about 3.25 percent in
fiscal 1998-99, compared to an estimated 3.75 percent in 1997-98.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said here Monday that
Beijing should resume dialogue with Taiwan without preconditions.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an annual meeting of the Association for the
Promotion of National Unification and Development, Lee said the
Republic of China government has been promoting civilian exchanges
with mainland China in accordance with the "Guidelines for National
Unification," hoping to turn cross-strait relations into a new page
of peaceful competition.</P>
      <P>However, in spite of this, Beijing continued its efforts to
isolate Taiwan in the international community and even unilaterally
closed down the channel of consultation with Taiwan, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lee said, in order to break the bottleneck of cross-strait
relations, Beijing has to recognize that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait are now under separate rule, abandon its unrealistic
ideological warfare against Taiwan, and reopen the channel of
consultation with Taiwan without any preconditions.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Republic of China government will continue to
promote democratization and economic development, strengthen
national security, and improve its foreign relations.

    <HEADLINE>CHIAYI COUNTY BECKONING BAYER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiayi County in southern Taiwan will
welcome Bayer's investment project with open arms after the German
chemical giant announced that it will suspend the project to locate
in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee Ya-ching, Chiayi County magistrate, said that if the Central
Government's environmental assessment of Bayer is up to international
standards, he will welcome Bayer wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>Lee said that for the welfare of the people of Chiayi County, he
would welcome Bayer to invest in Chiayi. He said the best site for
the plant would be at the Auku Industrial Zone, which he said has
already cleared 347 hectares out of a proposed 1,031 hectares.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bayer Taiwan said that it has taken the initiative by
contacting Lee to learn more about his ideas.</P>
      <P>Chen Chia-chung, a Bayer Taiwan spokesman, said that any decision
on whether to construct the NT$50 billion plant in Chiayi will be up
to Bayer headquarters in Germany, but added that the idea may not be
feasible.</P>
      <P>Chen said that while Bayer Taiwan has suspended all its efforts
on the project, it appreciates Lee's offer, and will convey the
message to Bayer headquarters for a final decision.</P>
      <P>Bayer suspended its two-year investment project after hitting
snags over residents' and environmentalists' opposition, a public
referendum suggested by Taichung magistrate Liao Yung-lai and
problems over land-lease approval in the Taiwan Provincial Assembly.</P>
      <P>The land-lease agreement would give Bayer a lease period of 50
years on the provincial government-owned land in the vicinity of
Taichung Harbor.</P>
      <P>However, Bayer officials said the company has not completely
given up its plan to set up its plant in Taiwan, saying that it chose
Taiwan as the best site for the toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) plant
because of the lucrative Asian market.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since the plant will target exports to Asian
countries, it has to be located at a harbor, and as no suitable land
is available for lease around Keelung and Kaohsiung, the island's
other two deep-water ports, Taichung was the only alternative.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said that if Chiayi can meet
Bayer's conditions, the government will throw its support behind
Lee's offer.</P>
      <P>Lee said the only impediment for Bayer to develop the project in
Chiayi would be the lack of a deep-water harbor, because that was not
included in the planning of the industrial zone in the first place.</P>
      <P>In addition, the industrial zone is required to establish a
246-hectare wild bird sanctuary, which was an original condition for
permission to turn the original farmland into an industrial zone.</P>
      <P>Bayer announced late last week that it was suspending the
investment project at Taichung harbor after the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly decided to ask a task force to learn more about public
opinion in the county and the reliability of Bayer's environmental
protection facilities in its review of the land-lease agreement.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chiao, spokesman for the Taiwan Provincial Government,
said that Bayer has put a lot of time and effort into its investment
project in Taichung Harbor, and it is questionable whether the
company will be prepared to change the site of the project at such
short notice.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and New Zealand have formally signed
an agreement to take joint measures in stemming trade practices which
are seen as unhealthy to fair competition.</P>
      <P>The pact was endorsed last Thursday by the Republic of China's
Fair Trade Commission (FTC) and New Zealand's Commercial Council in
the New Zealand capital of Wellington.</P>
      <P>FTC Chairman Chao Yang-ching told local press here on Monday that
the cooperative efforts envisioned under the agreement will not only
provide for joint monitoring of market openness and fair trade, but
will also will help to strengthen Taipei-Wellington trade and
economic ties.</P>
      <P>Chao added that the accord also reflects Taiwan's efforts in
promoting trade liberalization, which he said is clearly the global
trend as most of the world's economies are currently in a process of
removing tariff barriers.</P>
      <P>Citing the examples of the World Trade Organization, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Chao pointed out that most
major international economic groups are devoting their energies to
working out sound competition policies and devising relevant laws to
construct a fair and equitable global trade environment.</P>
      <P>New Zealand is currently Taiwan's sixth largest trade partner and
has agreed to support Taipei's bid for membership in the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>Chao said that Taiwan and New Zealand are highly complementary in
trade and economic structure. Taiwan imports dairy products, frozen
beef and lumber from that South Pacific country, while exporting
information products, television sets and sports equipment.</P>
      <P>Close trade and economic exchanges between the two countries are
beneficial to their continued economic development, the FTC leader
said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said on
Monday that the Republic of China will seek to join the System for
Integration of Central America (SICA), but hopes its membership
status will be similar to that of the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister Francisco Ou said at a meeting of the
Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Legislative
Yuan that his ministry has exchanged views with the SICA Secretariat
on the procedure and timing for the ROC's entry into the regional
body.</P>
      <P>Answering questions by members of the committee, which is
reviewing a joint communique signed in September by President Lee
Teng-hui and leaders of six Central American countries during Lee's
four-nation Latin American visit, Ou asserted that joining the SICA
is of both political and economic significance for the ROC.</P>
      <P>Ou said that during Lee's trip, the ROC had expressed keen
interest in joining SICA, a regional organization comprising Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Belize which
aims to promote a common market and integrated community.</P>
      <P>That desire was reiterated in a joint communique adopted upon the
conclusion of the unprecedented summit between President Lee and
leaders of six Central American allies, who lauded the ROC intention

      <P>Ou said that the ultimate goal of SICA, which seeks to form a
regional trade and political grouping modeled upon the European
Union, is to connect itself with the market created by the North
American Free Trade Agreement. At a time when the ROC faces
difficulties in being admitted to international organizations,
membership in SICA will serve the nation's political as well as
economic interests, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PERSONNEL SHORTAGE CASTS SHADOW OVER LOCAL INFORMATION INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite ranking third in the world with a
total output estimated to reach US$60 billion by 2000, Taiwan's
information industry is facing a growth bottleneck because of a
shortage of high-level personnel, an analyst said here Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-pang, director for business information at the nonprofit
Institute for Information Industry (III), told a symposium that
Taiwan's information technology sector, with an output of US$35.7
billion in 1997, tops the list of domestic industries and ranks third
in the world after the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is touted as an "information kingdom" in terms of
computer manufacturing, Lin pointed out that the island lags far
behind other advanced countries in computer applications, a situation
which blunts the competitive edge of the local information industry
and holds back its ability to catch up with the two front-runners.</P>
      <P>A shortage of mid-level and senior managerial personnel, the
inability to globalize markets and difficulties in obtaining
sufficient financing, all loom large as obstacles to the information
industry's further development, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He warned that without adequately addressing those problems,
Taiwan could be overtaken by South Korea and Singapore in the next
few years, with little hope of ever catching up to the United States
and Japan.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's information industry is expected to post an
output of US$60.1 billion by the year 2000, but even that figure will
not match the estimated output of the two global leaders at the turn
of the century.</P>
      <P>According to Lin's analysis, Asia will dominate the global
telecommunications market jointly with North America and Europe by
2000, despite the current financial crisis which has plagued most of
Southeast Asia and bodes a slowdown of capital inflow to this
continent.</P>

and Indonesian Minister of Mining and Energy I.B. Sudjana, opened
here Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang said at the opening ceremony that he hopes the meeting will
be upgraded to a ministerial-level conference encompassing all
aspects of economic activity between the two countries, which he said
would also help to enhance substantive Taipei-Jakarta relations in
other areas.</P>
      <P>Three major topics -- electric power and coal, natural gas and
recycled resources -- are to be discussed by representatives from
relevant government agencies and economic institutes, as well as
executives of petroleum and power companies from Taiwan and
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>During the annual meeting, the state-funded Taiwan Power Company
is also planning to sign with its Indonesian counterpart a letter of
intent on technical cooperation in power resources development, as
well as memoranda on personnel and information exchange and the
opening of workshops involving the two sides' power-generating
departments.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that in order to conform with international trends,
issues related to the liberalization and privatization of the energy
industry will also be included in the yearly conference, which has
played an important role in promoting exchanges of power-related
resources between Taiwan and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that liberalization and privatization had been
listed as priority tasks for 1998 in expanding fair trade practices
among contracting members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum at the grouping's recently concluded ministerial meeting
in Vancouver, Canada.</P>
      <P>The ROC economics minister said both Taiwan and Indonesia have
been committed to energy liberalization and that the two sides are
expected to "fully and profitably" exchange their experiences in that
effort during the meeting.</P>
      <P>Indonesia has for many years been a major supplier of energy
resources to the ROC. Taiwan imports of crude oil from that Southeast
Asian country amounted to more than 7.57 million barrels last year,
accounting for 3.3 percent of Taiwan's total crude oil imports, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that between January and September this year,
ROC crude imports from Indonesia surged to more than 8.76 million
barrels. This represents a jump of 48 percent over the 5.91 million
barrels imported during the same period of last year, Wang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SUPPORTS STATUS QUO FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Chang Fang-min &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Declaring that Taiwan is already a sovereign
state, the visiting head of Taiwan's opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, Hsu Hsin-liang, asserted here Monday that his
party supports the status quo for the island.</P>
      <P>In a bid to allay international concerns over his party's
advocacy of Taiwan independence, Hsu said that maintaining the
island's status quo -- even if it is not easy in light of the current
international political situation -- means nothing less than keeping
its independence.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who arrived at the head of a six-member DPP delegation,
repeated at a press conference a statement made earlier in the United
States that his party is no less concerned than any other political
party on Taiwan about the island's security. He said the DPP would
never jeopardize Taiwan by irresponsible political adventures,
referring to an official declaration of Taiwan's independence from
mainland China which would be certain to infuriate Beijing.</P>
      <P>Admitting that it is not the view of the DPP establishment, Hsu
reiterated his personal advocacy of direct trade, transportation and
postal links between Taiwan and mainland China. He said the
establishment of such links would benefit both sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities are holding out against implementing the
so-called "three links" as leverage to press Beijing into renouncing
the use of force against the island.</P>
      <P>There have recently been private contacts between DPP legislators
and Beijing officials, but no formal meeting has ever taken place,
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has emerged relatively unscathed from the
current financial crisis sweeping across Southeast Asia, Hsu urged
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to seriously considered
Taiwan's bid for membership. He said this will allow the island to
actively contribute its resources to the IMF rescue package.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan might be limited in its political stature on the
international stage, Hsu said, it is a giant in terms of economic
strength, and economic approaches could be vital campaign issues for
various Taiwan political parties in the future.</P>
      <P>In a gentle jab at Taiwan authorities' insistence upon setting up
a regional crisis-management mechanism separate from the IMF, Hsu
said it will only drive a wedge between the Western nations and Asia.</P>
      <P>He regretted that the multinational chemical giant Bayer has
withdrawn a multi-billion dollar investment plan from Taiwan because
of the opposition of conservationists and a DPP magistrate, saying it
cast a shadow on Taiwan's economic prospects and heightens a false
perception that the DPP is anti-industry.</P>
      <P>The leader of Taiwan's major opposition party held out hope that
a balance between economic development and environmental protection
will be achieved through full public discussion.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the DPP's overwhelming victory in November's local
elections raised the possibility that the ruling Kuomintang will lose
its majority in the Legislature in general elections next year, and
that a coalition government is more likely than ever to emerge
because no party will be able to command a legislative majority.</P>
      <P>Hsu and his delegation flew in on Friday from Seoul after
observing South Korea's presidential elections. He did not disclose
when he will return to Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIMETABLE FOR UNIFICATION NOT BENEFICIAL: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   23  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Chia-an, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said on Monday that
setting up a timetable for China's unification is not beneficial for
future development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while answering questions at the Legislative
Yuan about a Hong Kong media report that Zhang Wannian, vice chairman
of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) called for setting the year of 2020 as the deadline to resolve
the "Taiwan question" in a recent party meeting.</P>
      <P>Wu said he was not surprised at the report, as Liu Huaqing, who
served in the same post two years ago, also raised an identical
proposal.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said that the issue remains a matter of dispute
within the CCP and pointed out that, according to his knowledge,
mainland authorities remain basically opposed to setting a timetable
for eventual unification with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s, former mainland Chinese paramount leader Deng
Xiaoping also claimed that he would achieve China's unification
before the end of the decade, but his dream remained unfulfilled at
the time of his death in February 1997, Wu added.</P>
      <P>A fixed timetable will not necessarily help bring about
unification, Wu said, claiming that it could serve to create tensions
within the CCP and between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the best way to ease tensions across the
Taiwan Strait is to resume regular bilateral talks, adding that
Taiwan and the mainland are likely to reopen such talks in May or
June if the two sides can first reach a consensus on which topics to
discuss.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAS NEVER VIOLATED NUCLEAR AGREEMENT: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has never
violated the provisions of an agreement with the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the application of
nuclear energy, an ROC official stationed here said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"Although the ROC is not an IAEA member, it has consistently
abided by the provisions of the ROC-IAEA-USA Agreement for the
Application of Safeguards signed in the early 1970s," said Chou
Jen-chang, head of the science division of the ROC representative
office in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Chou, a former director of the nuclear energy research institute
under the ROC's military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology (CIST), made the remarks after an article carried in the
current issue of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists urged Taiwan to
make public details of its past nuclear bomb development programs.</P>
      <P>The article, co-authored by David Albright, president of the
private US-based Institute for Science and International Security,
and an associate, Corey Gay, said Taiwan seemed to have dropped
active bomb-building efforts after a top official in charge of the
program defected to the United States in 1988.</P>
      <P>Col. Chang Hsien-yi, then deputy director of the CIST's nuclear
energy research institute, stole vital documentation, evidence with
which Washington forced Taipei to scrap its atomic bomb development
plan.</P>
      <P>Chou was Chang's superior when he left Taiwan and took refuge in
the United States in the late 1980s. For years, Chou, a retired naval
captain, has kept silent on the incident.</P>
      <P>As Albright's article again called public attention to the
incident, Chou broke silence for the first time and stepped forward
to defend the ROC's position and image.</P>
      <P>Chou said the IAEA has never found in its regular inspections
that the ROC has ever violated international requirements or broken
its promises on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.</P>
      <P>Chou, however, declined to make any comments on the Chang
Hsien-yi incident.</P>
      <P>According to a recent report in the New York Times, Chang was
recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1960s, when he
was a military cadet. In the 1970s, as he rose through the ranks of
Taiwan's secret weapons hierarchy, Chang was cultivated as a spy for
the United States, the Times quoted US intelligence sources as
saying.</P>
      <P>Chang helped the Washington obtain information that could not be
detected through electronic eavesdropping or spy satellites, the
paper said. After taking refuge in the United States, Chang
effectively disappeared, and the CIA refuses to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>Since Chang's defection, the paper said, Taipei's official
position has been that it will not use its scientific expertise and
technical abilities to build a nuclear weapon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MULLING CLOSURE OF MISSION IN LIBYA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
considering the closure of its representative office in Libya, as the
north African country has been unfriendly to ROC personnel stationed
there, an official with the MOFA said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Timothy C.T. Yang, director of the African Affairs Department
under the MOFA, made the remarks at a public hearing held in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the Libyan government in Tripoli, yielding to
pressure from Beijing, has frequently boycotted activities of the ROC
representative office there and that the existence of the mission
there contributes a great burden to the ROC government.</P>
      <P>As mainland China is the only country which supports Libya amid
worldwide sanctions against it, it is hard for Tripoli to resist
pressure from Beijing, Yang pointed out.</P>
      <P>In addition to voicing opposition to the ROC's membership in the
United Nations and demanding the ROC representative office refrain
from using the nation's official name in local trade exhibitions, the
Libyan government has also suspended the office's rights to issue
visas. Tripoli has threatened to close the office and no longer grant
residence permits to ROC officials, he added.</P>
      <P>It is a humiliation for the ROC government that its overseas
mission was threatened by the host country, which Yang said has
prompted the MOFA to consider closing the office in Libya after a
thorough review of its operations, functions and the financial and
personnel burden incurred by the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Y. F. Chu, deputy director of the Economic and Trade Affairs
Department under the MOFA, said that shutting down the office is a
painful decision, but that it is unable to operate as it should.
 Taiwan business interests are important, but the personal safety
and property holdings of Taiwan citizens are much more important, she
stressed, pointing out that annual bilateral trade between the two
countries remains at a modest level of US$27 million.</P>

(By Wu Shean-shen &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's Vice Premier Zhu Rongji
recently told an economic conference that the merit of a shareholding
system implemented as part of the reform of state-owned enterprises
is overstated, stressing that 10 million laid-off workers in the
mainland will be supported for three years, Hong Kong's Singtao
Jihpao reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Zhu, also deputy head of the Central Financial and Economic
Leading Group of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), warned that the
most important task facing the mainland economy is to reform the
system of state-owned enterprises, emphasizing that failure to do so
will lead to disaster.</P>
      <P>However, Zhu complained about assertions by some that a
shareholding system is the only remedy for the difficulties
confronted by the state-owned enterprises. In fact, Zhu remarked,
such a system is by no means the sole solution, and it alone cannot
resolve the current problems.</P>
      <P>According to one of the officials attending the meeting, Zhu was
quoted as sternly warning: "Don't take it for granted that the 15th
CCP National Congress is a venue for the mobilization of a
shareholding system."</P>
      <P>The target of resolving problems confronting the state-owned
businesses is to make 500 of the country's large and medium-sized
enterprises profitable, Zhu stressed. In addition, 10 million
laid-off workers will be supported for at least three years by the
government, private enterprises and local communities, with each of
these sectors providing one-third of their living allowances.</P>

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Monday reaffirmed
friendly relations between the Republic of China and Honduras when
meeting with Honduran Vice President Walter Lopez Reyes.</P>
      <P>Lee thanked Lopez for the warm welcome the people and government
of Honduras extended to him during his visit to that country in
September. He also asked Lopez to convey his personal regards to
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina.</P>
      <P>The ROC president told his visitor that a task force has been
formed by the government to study measures aimed at facilitating the
implementation of the conclusions reached at a summit between Lee and
the leaders of six Central American countries during Lee's Latin
American visit in September. The six nations were Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Belize.</P>
      <P>Lopez expressed gratitude for the long-term assistance the ROC
government has provided to his country, adding that he hopes the ROC
and Honduras will further strengthen their relations based on the
already-close cooperative and friendly ties.</P>
      <P>At noon, Vice President Lien Chan hosted a lunch in honor of
Lopez with Foreign Minister Jason Hu, Deputy Secretary-General to the
President Su Chi and Honduran Ambassador Daniel Edgardo Milla taking
part.</P>
      <P>Lien said that relations between the ROC and Honduras have been
growing closer, as evidenced by the increasing exchange of visits by
high-ranking officials, including Honduran President Reina's visit to
the ROC last July and Lee's trip to Tegucigalpa in September.</P>
      <P>Lien also praised Lopez for the contribution he has made to his
country since assuming the vice presidency. Lien said that Lopez has
made significant achievements in upgrading cultural and educational
development in his country and that the housing policy promoted by
Lopez has greatly improved the welfare of the Honduran people.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lopez presided over the opening of the
Honduras Golf Charity Invitational, a fund-raising activity aimed at
helping poor and handicapped children in the Central American
country.</P>
      <P>At the tournament, jointly sponsored by the ROC-Honduras
Cultural, Economic and Trade Association and the ROC Golf
Association, Lopez thanked all the participants for helping make the
charity event a success.</P>
      <P>The golf tournament will help to further cement long-term
friendly relations between the two countries, Lopez said, adding that
the proceeds raised at the event will be donated to a social welfare
foundation run by the wife of Honduran President Reina.</P>
      <P>Lopez arrived in Taipei on Dec. 20 for a six-day visit. He is

    <HEADLINE>NO EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL FAILURE FOR SILKAIR CRASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no evidence that mechanical
failure caused the crash of SilkAir flight MI-185, as suggested by
Indonesian officials on Sunday, SilkAir said Monday.</P>
      <P>"There is little evidence to suggest that because it was very
well maintained with no known defects," SilkAir spokesman Rick
Clements said at a briefing.</P>
      <P>"We have to see what evidence we can get from the black box and
the wreckage," he added.</P>
      <P>He also said that the airline had received no bomb threat and
nobody had claimed responsibility for blowing up the plane.</P>
      <P>However, the airline had not ruled out these possibilities.</P>
      <P>"Nothing has been ruled out. We have to remain open-minded
because we have so little information to work with," Clements said.</P>
      <P>The aircraft was not carrying any hazardous cargo, he said.</P>
      <P>As for sabotage, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) said at the briefing that the standard of security
was very high at Changi Airport, where the ill-fated flight
originated.</P>
      <P>"Airports all over the world have to comply with international
standards and I'm sure this was so for the Indonesian airport too,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Clements said there was no information that the aircraft had
changed its flight path, contrary to some earlier press reports.</P>
      <P>Refuting rumors that the plane had been delayed in its takeoff
from Jakarta on Friday, the CAAS spokesman said the plane had
actually taken off at 3:23 p.m., Jakarta time, some seven minutes
earlier than scheduled.</P>
      <P>SilkAir flight MI-185, a 10-month-old Boeing 737-300, crashed at
the mouth of Musi River, some 35 miles north of Palembang, south
Sumatra, Indonesia, last Friday afternoon en route from Jakarta back
to Singapore.</P>
      <P>All the 104 passengers and crew onboard the aircraft were
believed killed in the crash, the first-ever accident for the
world-renowned Singapore Airlines and its subsidiary, SilkAir.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the contingency of hundreds of rescuers widened their
search efforts at the crash site by using sophisticated sonar
equipment to search for the plane's black box.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan, who flew to
inspect the crash site Monday, told a press conference that workers
had found some aircraft parts that came from near the section of the
Boeing 737-300 where the flight data and voice recorders are normally
located, said reports from Palembang.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that they are slightly closer to locating the

      <P>He added that search operations would also be widened to include
a land search and other parts of the Musi River where the plane
crashed.</P>
      <P>Rescuers, meanwhile, looking desperately for survivors, saw only
body parts floating in various parts of the four-kilometer-wide
river.</P>
      <P>Brig. Gen. Ryamizard, the chief-of-staff of the South Sumatran
Military Command, who is overseeing the search operations, said that
villagers found some decomposed body parts near the river bank early
Monday.</P>
      <P>A C-130 Singapore Air Force plane brought two refrigerated
containers to preserve the body parts found at the crash site.</P>
      <P>Singapore Airlines chairman S. Dhanabalan, who was also present
at the crash site Monday, told the press conference that none of the
body parts found so far could not be identified.</P>
      <P>He said the present phase of the operation would focus on the
recovery of bodies because many relatives of the victims wanted to
take their remains back home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. GOLD MINING FIRM BIDS TO BUY AUSSIE COUNTERPART</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The California-based Homestake Mining Co.
has made an A$1 billion offer to buy Plutonic Resources of Western
Australia, which has been hit hard by falling bullion prices in the
world market because of the sales of reserves gold by the Reserve
Bank earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The bid follows a major sell-off of gold shares owned by Plutonic
and other Australian gold mining firms, sparked by the sharp falls in
world bullion prices, which now hover below US$290 per ounce.</P>
      <P>Homestake, which has a long presence in Australia, said Monday it
would offer 34 of its shares for every 100 Plutonic shares, valuing
Australia's third largest gold miner at A$5.19 a share or A$970
million.</P>
      <P>The offer represents an 86 percent premium to Plutonic's share
price before it was suspended on Monday, but is below its 1997 high
of A$5.96.</P>
      <P>The Homestake-Plutonic group would emerge as North America's
third largest gold producer -- and Australia's second largest after
Normandy Mining Corp., metal analysts said.</P>
      <P>Other Australian gold mining firms, including Newcrest Mining and
Australian Resources, are likely to be prime targets for foreign
companies because they are having hard times from the recent fall in
gold prices, they added.</P>
      <P>The Plutonic deal is believed to have been driven by its major
shareholder, Malaysian Mining Corporation (MMC), which owns 32
percent of the Australian company.</P>
      <P>MMC, like other Asian firms, has been hit hard by the Asian
economic crisis, and has no choice but to seal the deal with
Homestake, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Australia is the world's third largest gold producer and exporter
with its output totaling about 290 tons in 1996-97.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN DOLLAR CONTINUES SLIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian dollar continued its downward
spiral Monday, shedding 0.17 US cents to close at 69.71 US cents.</P>
      <P>It slipped as low as 69.66 US cents as Bank of Canada rushed in
to buy Canadian dollars to stop its slide.</P>
      <P>The loonie (Canadian dollar) reached its record low on Feb. 4,
1986, trading at 69.17 US cents per loonie.</P>
      <P>Observers said the Canadian dollar will likely remain stuck below
70 US cents until the new year.</P>
      <P>Investors are divided on whether the Bank of Canada will move
this week to push up interest rates to protect the currency.</P>
      <P>Some analysts expected a hike in the bank rate -- perhaps more
than one-third of a percentage point -- this week, while others said
the central bank will opt to let the dollar drop even further.</P>
      <P>One senior bank economist said: "It seems to have found a trading
range here. (But) there's nothing sacred about 70 cents. We may
establish an all-time low sometime this winter before the Canadian
dollar starts to rebound."</P>
      <P>The concern for consumers is that further weakness in the dollar
could force the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates, leading the
big banks to hike the cost of borrowing for mortgages and consumer,
corporate and car loans.</P>
      <P>Jeff Rubin, chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (CIBC), warned a 0.33 percent increase in the central bank
rate could kill 100,000 jobs next year.</P>
      <P>A rate hike would also dampen domestic spending and economic
growth, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Still, the fallout from another rate increase probably wouldn't
cripple the Canadian economy because interest rates remain close to
30-year lows and the economy is much stronger today than it was three
years ago.</P>
      <P>Speculators started "testing" the loonie Friday after the latest
inflation figures showed prices rose only 0.9 percent in November --
the lowest inflation rate since January 1995.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem for Canada is that the ongoing currency
crisis in Southeast Asia has led to slack demand for Canadian
exports, particularly for commodities such as coal, lumber and gold.</P>
      <P>It is a widely held perception that Canada's economy remains
rather dependent on exports from its mines, mills and forests.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, seventy percent of the goods Canada exports
are manufacturing-based and 30 percent are commodity-based.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE MANUFACTURING INVESTMENTS TO EXCEED 1996 RECORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Manufacturing investments in Singapore
this year are set to exceed the record S$8.1 billion registered last
year, Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan said
Monday night.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the first anniversary dinner of the Singapore
Confederation of Industries (SCI), Lee disclosed that manufacturing
investment commitments in the first 11 months of this year already
total S$8.1 billion, the same amount as that recorded for the whole
of last year.</P>
      <P>He stressed that "manufacturing and services will remain our twin
engines of growth."</P>
      <P>In 1996, manufacturing contributed 24 percent of Singapore's
gross domestic product (GDP) and 23 percent of employment, making it
the largest sector in Singapore's economy.</P>
      <P>"Our aim is to maintain manufacturing's share of GDP at about 25
percent and its share of employment at about 20 percent," Lee told
the nation's industrial leaders who attended the dinner.</P>
      <P>This is comparable to advanced economies such as Japan, Britain
and Switzerland which are placing increased emphasis on strengthening
their manufacturing sectors, he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to the currency turmoil sweeping through Asia, Lee said
recent events were throwing up new threats as well as opportunities.</P>
      <P>"Our strong economic fundamentals are helping us to weather the
storm and we are in a position to build on our strength," he said.</P>
      <P>However, Singapore could not avoid being affected by events in
neighboring countries which were among its main trading partners as
well as competitors in certain fields.</P>
      <P>Lee said he remained optimistic that Singapore would emerge
stronger after the crisis and that the region would continue to grow
more rapidly compared to other regions.</P>
      <P>He said the government on its part was committed to support
industries by helping to build world-class capabilities, enhancing
competitiveness, providing tax and other incentives to industries for
upgrading, and by helping companies to capitalize on the competitive
advantages of regional countries for mutual benefit.</P>
      <P>As Singapore moves up the value chain towards a knowledge-based</P>
      <P>economy, it will need to build up capabilities in marketing,
design, research and development and software development, he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the private sector has a critical role to
play in Singapore's next phase of development.</P>
      <P>"The SCI can contribute to this by acting as a two-way bridge
between industry and government and by helping members to enhance
their competitiveness," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE SCIENTISTS DISCOVER COWS ABLE TO JOIN SHARKS IN WAR ON CANCER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian scientists have discovered
cattle cartilage containing substances similar to those with
cancer-fighting properties in shark cartilage.</P>
      <P>The scientists now working for the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) hope that an anti-cancer
extract from cattle cartilage will provide a significant financial
boost to the depressed cattle industry in Australia and relieve the
heavy pressure on the shark population.</P>
      <P>The Australian daily on Tuesday quoted team leader Greg Harper as
saying that the work began with the interest of Brisbane-based
companies in commercializing shark cartilage.</P>
      <P>"Sharks are in short supply. Our concern is that it is not a
sustainable resource with the number of sharks being taken, and the
sheer magnitude of this market in the United States. It is already
big in Asia. We are looking to take advantage of cattle cartilage,
which is already there in large amounts, and to try and commercialize
that," Harper said.</P>
      <P>He said there was "enough evidence in the United States, China
and Europe of the efficacy of cartilage" in combating cancer.</P>
      <P>Cartilage, which is found on the tips of ribs and the sternum, in
joints and the ears and nose, has neither nerves, blood vessels or a
lymphatic system. It inhibits the growth of blood vessels.</P>
      <P>"It stops the supply of nutrients through to a tumor and inhibits
migration of that tumor back out," Harper said.</P>
      <P>He said overseas research had demonstrated that certain extracts
of shark cartilage, injected into tumors, caused them to regress.</P>
      <P>"It appears from international research that those activities
exist in bovine cartilage but they need to be extracted and
enriched," he said.</P>
      <P>Harper and a Chinese colleague are working to find the active
components, the glycosaminoglycans or GAGs, "to identify what the
best bovine sources are, and what process we need to go through to
enrich but not destroy the activity."</P>
      <P>He said the discovery will benefit Australia because the market
for shark cartilage in the United States alone is worth more than A$1
billion a year. The shark cartilage sells for up to A$500 per
kilogram in the United States.</P>
      <P>He said in Australia, cattle cartilage is virtually thrown away,
used in the manufacture of blood-and-bone fertilizer.</P>
      <P>CSIRO Tropical Agriculture chief Elizabeth Heij said the research
has the potential to turn a common, low-value product into a "very
high-value product. The human benefits are quite large."</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australians have voted overwhelmingly to
break traditional ties with the British monarchy when it comes to
choosing representatives to the Constitutional Convention in February
1998.</P>
      <P>The Australian Electoral Commission on Monday released final
results of a poll which showed 47 of the 76 elected delegates to the
Constitutional Convention would urge the government to break the
traditional ties with the British monarchy and opt for a republic for
the country.</P>
      <P>The Australian Republican Movement (ARM) is confident that
Australia will become a republic and the problem is now one of good
timing for the country to break its ties with the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>ARM chairman Malcolm Turnbull, a convention delegate, said: "I
think the major focus must be to reach consensus. I think the
Australian people will be very unsympathetic with delegates who go to
the convention in a very doctrinaire, narrow-minded way.</P>
      <P>"We would like to see the convention, before it talks about mode
of election, actually talk about what it wants its head of state to
do. If your answer is you want someone impartial and above party
politics, then it becomes harder to justify direct election," he
added.</P>
      <P>The 76 elected delegates will join 40 politicians from the
federal, state and territorial parliaments and 35 appointed by the
federal Parliament to take part in the 10-day convention in February.</P>
      <P>If the convention reaches consensus on the preferred model for a
republic, a referendum will be held on this model by the end of the
year 2000. If not, Australians will vote on constitutional options
through a plebiscite.</P>
      <P>Australia, one of the Commonwealth member countries, currently
recognizes the British monarch has as its titular head of state.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and South
Africa have reached agreement on the framework for new relations
after Jan. 1, 1998, according to a statement of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>The statement, issued by the ROC Embassy in Pretoria late Monday
afternoon, said that as from Jan. 1, 1998, an office known as the
Taipei Liaison Office in the Republic of South Africa will be
established in Pretoria.</P>
      <P>There will also be established in Johannesburg, Cape Town and
Durban offices known as the Taipei Liaison Office, it said.</P>
      <P>The ROC has also agreed to the establishment of a Liaison Office
of South Africa in Taipei as from Jan. 1 next year.</P>
      <P>The statement said both sides agreed that the new offices should
be given necessary functions for the continuation of economic, trade,
educational, cultural, scientific, technical, financial and other
exchanges and cooperation, in order to maintain substantive relations
on a mutually beneficial basis.</P>
      <P>Their personnel should also be given the necessary conveniences,
enabling them to perform their duties on an equal and reciprocal
footing, it said.</P>
      <P>Since the South African government announced on Nov. 27, 1996,
that it would end diplomatic relations with the Republic of China,
the two sides have held three high-level talks and 11 working-level
sessions.</P>
      <P>In the course of the negotiations, the statement said, the ROC
government has maintained a frank and realistic attitude, seeking to
achieve the best possible arrangement on the basis of equality and
reciprocity.</P>
      <P>The statement said that, with a view toward the future, the ROC
government hopes the South African government will, mindful of the
long historical ties and mutual respect between the two countries,
continue to develop constructive relations in conformity with the
interests of both countries and their peoples.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The planned suspension of diplomatic
relations between the Republic of China and South Africa by year's
end is not expected to affect the existing economic ties between the
two countries, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>But how to protect Taiwan business interests there remains a
pressing question, as the two countries have yet to sign a bilateral
investment guarantee agreement, the MOEA noted, adding that pushing
for the inking of the accord will be its top priority after the two
countries sever diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>There are currently more than 300 Taiwan businesses and 30,000
Taiwan citizens based in South Africa, but the numbers are declining
as the change in bilateral ties approaches, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-kuo, chairman of the semi-official China External Trade
Development Council, said the two economies are complementary and
mutually-beneficial and that both sides should continue their
economic exchanges despite the cutting of formal ties.</P>
      <P>Bilateral economic relations have traditionally been close, with
two-way trade reaching more than US$180 million in 1995, and Taiwan
investment in South Africa amounting to over US$1 billion, he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Tourism Bureau said the number of Taiwan
tourists visiting South Africa in the first ten months of the year
posted a decline of 90 percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Only 1,387 Taiwan tourists visited South Africa in the
January-October period, a far cry from 13,899 recorded in the same

    <TEXT>
      <P>The resounding win by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the Nov. 29 mayoral and county
chief elections was overwhelmingly voted the top domestic news event
of 1997 in an opinion poll of local media professionals.</P>
      <P>The pro-Taiwan independence DPP won 12 top local government posts
in the nationwide elections, while the ruling Kuomintang won in only
eight constituencies and the remaining three seats went to
independents.</P>
      <P>Editors-in-chief and news department heads of major news
organizations in the Taiwan area as well as CNA editors jointly
selected the top 10 domestic news stories of 1997.</P>
      <P>Other events comprising the top 10 list in descending order are:</P>
      <P>-- An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at hog ranches around
the island in mid-March. The epidemic cost Taiwan an estimated NT$160
billion (US$4.92 billion) in economic losses.</P>
      <P>-- The passage of a package of constitutional amendments by the
National Assembly, which provided for suspension of provincial-level
elections, redefinition of relations between central and local
governments and establishment of a dual-leadership system at the
central government.</P>
      <P>-- The suicides of Lin Chun-sheng and Kao Tien-ming, two key
suspects in the Pai Hsiao-yen kidnap-murder case, following two
separate shootouts with police, and the surrender of Chen Chin-hsing,
a third mastermind in the Pai case, after a 24-hour standoff with
police. The standoff began with Chen taking hostage South African
military attache Col. McGill Alexander and his family of four.</P>
      <P>-- The kidnap-murder of Pai Hsiao-yen, the teenage daughter of
popular entertainer Pai Ping-ping, in April. The crime shocked local
society and sparked a public outcry over the government's inability
to curb the crime rate. Tens of thousands of ordinary citizens took
to the streets to vent their discontent at worsening social order.</P>
      <P>-- Typhoon Winnie which pounded Taiwan with strong winds and
heavy rains and left 40 dead and 81 injured. The most serious was
the collapse of the Lincoln Vila in Hsichi, Taipei County, in which
28 people were killed and 47 others injured.</P>
      <P>-- The announcement by the Ministry of Civil Service under the
Examination Yuan of the enforcement of a five-day work week scheme in
two stages for government employees. Starting on Jan. 1, 1998, all
public agencies will implement a five-day work week every other week,
which will be expanded to every week from Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>-- President Lee Teng-hui's four-country Latin American tour

Paraguay. During his two-week visit, Lee attended the World Congress
on the Panama Canal and a summit meeting of top leaders from six
Central American countries.</P>
      <P>-- The depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar against the US
dollar after the Central Bank of China stopped intervention in
market operations. The NT dollar has fallen below the NT$30 vs. US$1
level to a 10-year low of NT$33 for the greenback.</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan Governor James Soong's announcement that he was to
resign to express his opposition to the government's proposal to
suspend provincial-level elections. Soong later decided to stay in
his post until his tenure expires in late 1998.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said here
on Tuesday that Taiwan has mapped out suitable measures for dealing
with Japan's planned suspension of preferential taxation on imports
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang confirmed that Japan has decided to cease its policy of
favorable duty on Taiwan imports by 2000, a decision which he said is
bound to enlarge Taiwan's already huge trade deficit with Japan.</P>
      <P>In order to minimize the expected impact of the Japanese move,
and to reduce the island's reliance on the Japanese market, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has formulated new strategies to
further promote trade with other countries and to enhance the
competitiveness of Taiwan products, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The minister expanded on this statement, saying such plans
include the semi-official China External Trade Development Council's
(CETRA) series of "market-offensives," which are aimed at opening
more trade markets in countries such as Japan, Turkey, Poland and
India.</P>
      <P>The so-called "market-offensives" refers to a plan under which
CETRA will help local businesses make direct contact with foreign
buyers through the opening of trade fairs and workshops in the
targeted countries.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said that the Japanese government last Friday reviewed
its favorable duty system, and concluded that some countries and
areas, including Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, should
be taken off Japan's favorable status list because the gross national
products (GNPs) of all four countries have reached over US$9,000.</P>
      <P>Japan will gradually implement its decision from April, 1998,
with the objective of suspending all preferential treatment for the
countries and areas on the list by April 2000, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA statistics, Taiwan's exports to Japan which
enjoyed favorable duty hit 253.6 billion Japanese yen (US$1.9
billion) in the period from April 1996 to March 1997. Most of these
exports were industrial and mineral products.</P>
      <P>Other Taiwan products which will feel the impact of the new
measures include chemical goods, agricultural products and synthetic
fibers.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Board of Foreign Trade estimated that the new tariffs
will cost Taiwan at least an additional 2 billion yen (US$15 million)
every year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO ZERO-SUM GAME IN US RELATIONS WITH TAIPEI, BEIJING: ROTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Clinton Administration
official said on Monday that he sees no "zero-sum" game in US
relations with Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said at a year-end press conference that the US
consistently believes it can simultaneously promote relations with
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"If you look, ever since 1979 the better US-PRC relations have
been, the better US-Taiwan relations -- unofficial though they may be
-- have been, and the better that Taiwan-PRC relations have been,"
Roth said in his first news briefing for Asian media since he assumed
office more than five months ago.</P>
      <P>Roth claimed that the three sets of bilateral relationships --
Washington-Taipei, Washington-Beijing and Taipei-Beijing -- can
advance simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Noting that a summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the White House in late
October had contributed much to the improvement in overall
Washington-Beijing relations, Roth stressed that nothing happened at
the summit to in any way diminish or otherwise change the nature of
the unofficial US-Taiwan relationship.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the United States remains optimistic that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will in fact work out their
differences and get their dialogue restarted. "We've seen indications
and statements on both sides that they would like to see this happen,
and it is not for the United States to try to propose a fix. I think
it is up to the parties themselves."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S TRADE DEFICIT WITH JAPAN TO HIT NEW HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan is
likely to break the US$20 billion mark next year as Japan is
scheduled to cancel preferential tariff rates on one-fifth of Taiwan
products from April 1998, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to ministry statistics, Taiwan already incurred a
trade deficit of US$15.57 billion in the first 11 months of this
year. The amount already exceeded the US$13.83 trade deficit recorded
for entire last year.</P>
      <P>As continued depreciation of the Japanese yen against the US
dollar has made Japanese products even more competitive, MOEA
officials worry that Taiwan's trade imbalance with Japan would soar
further in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the MOEA's statistics
department, predicted that this year's trade deficit with Japan would
break the previous high of US$17.11 billion set in 1995.</P>
      <P>If Japan really suspends its preferential tariff rates for
Taiwan's steel, petrochemical, synthetic fibers and other related
products from next April, Chang said the island's trade gap with
Japan would widen further. The new tariff rates for those products
will nearly double the current figures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has relied heavily on Japan's supply of electronics parts
and components. With the world demand for Taiwan's
information-technology products increasing, its imports of Japanese
parts and components would continue to rise.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan has found it hard to expand its sales
to the recession-hit Japan. Since an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease at local hog ranches in mid-March, Taiwan has been forced to
suspended port exports to Japan. The ban has cut Taiwan exports to
that country by an estimated NT$48 billion (US$1.48 billion).</P>
      <P>Against this background, the semi-official China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) has decided to step up promotional
efforts to help local companies tap the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>CETRA has so far organized three trade promotion missions to
visit Japan, with regional hypermarkets in western and southern
Japan as their priority targets.</P>
      <P>CETRA said it will john forces with government agencies and its
offices in Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka to conduct 80 promotional
programs in the first half of next year. The planned programs are
expected to bring about US$800 million in additional Taiwan exports
to Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CETRA will continue to lobby major Japanese
conglomerates to set up key components and parts production
facilities in Taiwan and to increase purchases from Taiwan. Under
CETRA's efforts, large Japanese enterprises, including Hitachi,
Fujitsu, Itochu, Mitsubishi, Sharp and Kyoto Ceramics, have struck
more than US$100 million worth of purchase deals with local companies
over the past year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI ANNOUNCES SEVERANCE OF TIES WITH PRETORIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Foreign Affairs
Ministry announced on Tuesday afternoon the severance of diplomatic
relations with South Africa from Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>"Substantial Taipei-Pretoria relations, however, will continue
under a new framework agreed upon by the two sides," said Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Roy Y.Y. Wu and Timothy C.T. Yang, director of the
ministry's African Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Under the framework, the ROC will operate Taipei Liaison Offices
in Pretoria, Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, while a Liaison
Office of South Africa will be established in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The new arrangement, worked out in three rounds of high-level
negotiations and 12 rounds of working-level talks, "is acceptable to
the Foreign Affairs Ministry, although it's not totally
satisfactory," Yang said.</P>
      <P>South African President Nelson Mandela announced on Nov. 27 last
year that Pretoria will shift its diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing from the beginning of next year. Since then, both sides
have been negotiating grounds for maintaining substantial ties
between them.</P>
      <P>He said that the title "Taipei Liaison Office" was decided upon
by the ROC itself after South Africa rejected an earlier ROC
suggestion that its national name continue to be used following the
suspension of formal ties.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's property holdings in South Africa will
remain secured, since "South Africa has never questioned or
challenged us on this issue."</P>
      <P>Refusing to say whether ROC personnel stationed in South Africa
will be able to enjoy diplomatic immunity, Yang said only that they
will be given due treatment and conveniences to perform their duties.</P>
      <P>Saying Beijing has never ceased its attempts to blockade Taiwan's
international presence or downgrade its stature, Yang also called on
Pretoria not to do anything that might undermine Taiwan's interests
once it establishes official ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Affairs Minister Qian
Qichen will arrive in Pretoria on Dec. 28 to sign a communique to
formally open bilateral diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, Beijing has even tried
to press Pretoria into cutting ties with Taipei earlier than
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Yang said that his ministry has yet to name the new
representative and other officials to South Africa.</P>

      <P>A 220-strong mainland Chinese delegation
will attend a technology fair to be held in Taiwan under the
framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum,
marking a significant exchange of technology between Taiwan and the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The 2nd APEC Technomart will be held on Jan. 19-24 at Taipei's
World Trade Center, with over 1,000 representatives from 18 APEC
economies taking part. A number of booths will be set up at the
venue, exhibiting a variety of advanced high-technology items.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said on Tuesday at a coordinating
meeting in connection with the technology fair that the APEC
Technomart will present the latest developments of high-tech
industries in the Asia-Pacific area. In addition, the fair will be
conductive to the further exchange of technology between APEC
members, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>The vice premier said that Taiwan welcomes the opportunity to
host the 2nd APEC Technomart, the first of which was held in South
Korea in 1995, and will make every effort to ensure its success. At a

      <P>After finding Taiwan's shortest woman, the
Taiwan Museum of the Guinness World of Records on Tuesday located the
shortest man on the island.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-chih, 26, a resident of Taipei County, is just 67.5
centimeters tall.</P>
      <P>Lin, who suffers from brittle bones, is confined to a
electrically powered wheelchair, but doctors have attributed his
small stature to gene mutation caused by inbreeding between his
parents, who are cousins. However, Lin's older brother and younger
sister have not been affected.</P>
      <P>Although short in stature, Lin has been very agile and strong
since childhood, and Lin's mother said he attended an ordinary school
until fifth-grade, when his family moved out of the school district.</P>
      <P>His life changed dramatically seven years ago when he got his
electric wheelchair, which gave him the mobility to visit friends and
go out on his own.</P>
      <P>As a clerk and a computer operator in his father's company, Lin
is able to live on his own and enjoys the music of Beethoven, drawing
comics and striking up friendships on the Internet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF HEAD CALLS FOR RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), on Tuesday called again on Beijing to
resume unconditional dialogue with Taipei on an equal footing and
said he looked forward to an exchange of visits between SEF directors
and their mainland counterparts when the time is ripe.</P>
      <P>At a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the SEF,
which was set up by the government in 1992 to handle relations with
mainland China in the absence of official ties, Taiwan's point-man in
dealing with mainland China recounted with regret Beijing's
unilateral termination of cross-strait contact in 1995.</P>
      <P>Institutionalized contacts between the SEF and its mainland
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), were established during a meeting between Koo and ARATS
Chairman Wang Daohan in 1993, but were suspended indefinitely by
Beijing in 1995 in retaliation for ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
landmark US trip, which Beijing claimed was an attempt to promote
Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing's move not only breached the accord between
Wang and himself but also undermined the fragile trust between the
two sides of Taiwan Strait, Koo called on Beijing to reopen the
regular channel of contact without preconditions.</P>
      <P>Many bilateral issues, such as the fight against crime and the
protection of intellectual property rights, require cross-strait
cooperation in order to be resolved, said Koo, urging Beijing to
respond to these problems in a responsible way.</P>
      <P>Referring to an exchange of visits between SEF and ARATS
directors which was proposed by the SEF in June, Koo said the plan
hit snags because ARATS demanded that the SEF delegation, to be
headed by SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho, should take part in an
ARATS-sponsored seminar in Xiamen in November to promote cross-strait
trade, as a precondition to any exchange visits.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rejected this conditional invitation on the grounds that
Taipei's current policy is actually to cool down cross-strait trade,
saying that any visit should be carried out exclusively for the
exchange of views between the SEF and ARATS.</P>
      <P>Instead, the SEF suggested postponement of the exchange visit to
December or later, when Koo himself will head an SEF delegation to
mainland China. This proposal has so far gone unanswered, according
to Koo.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, he said he still hopes the exchange of visits
between the SEF and ARATS can be realized someday when the time is
ripe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCIAL TURMOIL IN SOUTHEAST ASIA SAID TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON TAIWAN EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The financial turmoil in Southeast Asia has
had little impact on Taiwan exports to that region, officials from
the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on Wednesday, adding that in
fact Taiwan's exports to Northeast Asian countries have suffered
more.</P>
      <P>They said that from January to November this year, Taiwan's
exports to five nations in Southeast Asia accounted for 12.34 of the
nation's total exports, up 0.08 percent from the same period of last
year, an indication that Taiwan's exports have not been affected by
the financial crisis in the region.</P>
      <P>The officials said that with the exception of textiles, Taiwan's
levels of expertise and technology, especially in the fields of
electronics and information products, are generally much more
advanced than those of most Southeast Asian nations.</P>
      <P>They also said that Southeast Asian nations rely heavily on
Taiwan machinery equipment, pointing out that Taiwan businesses in
the region have often imported equipment from Taiwan to make products
to export overseas.</P>
      <P>They noted that in contrast, exports to Northeast Asia have not
been so optimistic, citing as examples the fact that Taiwan exports
to Japan between January and November accounted for 9.74
percent of its total exports, down nearly 2 percentage points from
the same period of last year. At the same time, exports to South
Korea were down nearly 0.3 percentage points, setting a new high for
trade deficits in Japan's and South Korea's favor.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the Korean won
have registered an increase of 35 percent since the beginning of the
year, prompting Japan purchase from South Korea rather than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The additional impact of March's outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease in Taiwan and the opening of the market to compact cars from
Japan are estimated to increase Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan to
US$17 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Because South Korean products tend to overlap those of Taiwan,
causing a lot of South Korean products to flow into the domestic
market, it is estimated that Taiwan's trade deficit with South Korea
will reach US$2.6 billion this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S FOREIGN TRADE HITS NEW RECORD, TRADE SURPLUS DECLINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade will hit a new high
this year, but its trade surplus will fall below the 1996 record, the
Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to customs tallies, two-way trade had reached US$230.54
billion as of Dec. 20, up 8.6 percent from the same period of last
year, a trend which finance officials said would see this year's
foreign trade surpassing the 1996 level to set a new record.</P>
      <P>Customs statistics show that Taiwan exported US$119.12
billion worth of goods between Jan. 1 and Dec. 20, marking a 5
percent year-on-year increase, while imports advanced more than 10
percent to reach US$111.42 billion.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$7.7 billion
during the Jan. 1-Dec. 20 period, down nearly 40 percent from a year
ago.</P>
      <P>Trade officials attributed this plunge in trade surplus mainly to
dwindling exports to Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$13.57 billion in 1996,
the highest since 1989, when the trade surplus topped US$14 billion.</P>
      <P>The officials said although Taiwan has so far managed to avoid
the brunt of the recent economic turmoil in Asia, its exports to
Japan and South Korea have been seriously affected by the financial
woes of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Government tallies show that Taiwan shipments to Japan declined
13.6 percent in the first 11 months of this year, while imports from
that country rose 4.6 percent. Against this backdrop, Taiwan's trade
deficit with Japan surged 22.5 percent to US$15.57 billion for the
11-month period. The suspension of pork exports and a
more-than-20-percent drop in machinery sales were major reasons
behind Taiwan's shrinking shipments to Japan, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's exports to South Korea also slid 9.2 percent
during the January-November period, but imports of Korean products
jumped 20.8 percent during the same period. As a result, Taiwan's
trade deficit with South Korea soared 74 percent to reach US$2.39
billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has seen negative growth in its shipments to South Korea
since April, when the South Korean currency began to depreciate
substantially against the US greenback, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>In November alone, Taiwan's exports to South Korea plunged 14.9
percent, while imports from that country climbed 16.5 percent. The
two countries compete fiercely in many industries, but the
depreciation of the Korean won has hindered the entry of Taiwan
products into the South Korean market. As South Korea's financial
crisis has continued to worsen, the officials said Taiwan-South Korea
trade is not expected to return to normal in the near future.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 29,860 vessels, with a total
weight of more than 500 billion tons, used Kaohsiung Harbor in
southern Taiwan as a transshipment center in the first 11 months of
this year, according to statistics released on Tuesday by the
Kaohsiung Harbor Administration.</P>
      <P>The figures represent an increase of 11 percent and 8 percent on
terms of vessel number and cargo volume, respectively, from the same
period of 1996, the administration said, attributing the growth to
Taiwan's opening of cross-strait offshore transshipment services in
Kaohsiung Harbor in connection with Xiamen and Fuzhou ports in
mainland China's Fujian province in April.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor handled a record-high level of more than 5.18
million containers of transshipment cargo in the January-November
period, up 126,500 containers from a year ago, 107,700 units of which
were handled by the cross-strait offshore transshipment center, the
administration said.</P>
      <P>The shipping sector on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have
repeatedly called for Taiwan to permit the island's Taichung and
Keelung harbors, and for the mainland to allow Guanzhou, Dalian,
Shanghai, Tianjin and Qingdao ports, to be opened to cross-strait
shipping.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was reported that an office under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA)'s Export Processing Zone Administration
(EPZA) will become operational on Friday. The office has been charged
with promoting the Chengkung-Hsiaokang area in Kaohsiung, a
government-run special warehousing zone which is currently in the
planning stage.</P>
      <P>In line with the government's plan to build Taiwan into an
Asia-Pacific manufacturing center, the EPZA is also studying the
feasibility of setting up special warehousing zones in central
Taichung Harbor and in Keelung Harbor and Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in northern Taiwan, in order to introduce
high-tech and high value-added industries into those areas.</P>
      <P>According to the EPZA, construction of the Chengkung-Hsiaokang
special warehousing zone will be completed in 2006. The zone is
expected to create 100,000 job opportunities and will have an annual
output worth more than US$100 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN COMPLETES DRAFT ACT FOR SPECIAL ECONOMIC AND TRADE ZONE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has drafted a legal framework for
the management of proposed special economic and trade operation
zones, ruling that such areas can be opened for direct cargo
transshipment, maritime transportation and other trade and economic
activities between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>A task force formed by the Executive Yuan for the establishment
of this type of zone completed the draft on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The task force, led by P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), is made up of high-ranking
officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, and the Mainland Affairs Council,
as well as several ministers without portfolio.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the draft sets out several concrete directions for
the formation of special zones for the free flow of capital, cargo
and personnel, which includes devising special laws to remove
investment barriers and to allow the gradual opening of economic and
trade activities between Taiwan and mainland China based on the
development of cross-strait relations and national security.</P>
      <P>The draft also includes provisions for setting up an
administrative unit capable of providing efficient executive
management and services, and building an investment environment for
the free flow of cargo, along with the construction of special trade
areas complete with the most up-to-date infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The CEPD chief said the new draft represents the government's
determination to promote trade liberalization, adding that the
planned special economic and trade zones will also provide the
so-called "single window" services, which means that the proposed
administrative unit will take charge of every operation in each zone.</P>
      <P>The government will also encourage investors to take part in the
zone's public construction works, the minister noted, adding that
although the free flow of cargo will be permitted and encouraged,
cargo entering other Taiwan regions will still have to be considered
as foreign imports.</P>

exact time, the top official in chart of the nation's mainland policy
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),

France and Belgium.</P>
      <P>During his visit to the four European countries from Dec. 11-22,
he had extensive discussions and exchanges of views on the
development of cross-strait relations with local scholars,
think-tanks, overseas Chinese and media.</P>

Clinton to mainland China next spring following the October US visit
of mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, and the reshuffle of
Beijing's State Council during the 9th National People's Congress
next March, scholars have assessed that cross-strait talks could be
resumed next spring.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), remarked on Tuesday that if Beijing has
not responded by early 1998 regarding the resumption of cross-strait
negotiations, he does not rule out the possibility of inviting Wang
Daohan, his mainland counterpart, to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The SEF is the quasi-official body set up to handle contact with
mainland China in the absence of official ties; its counterpart is
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) with Wang Daohan as its chairman and Tang Shubei as its
deputy director.</P>
      <P>The SEF is ready to resume talks at any time, Koo stressed at the
annual SEF joint meeting of directors and supervisors. He called for
Beijing to resume unconditional dialogue with Taipei on an equal
footing and said he looks forward to an exchange of visits between
the directors of the SEF and ARATS when the time is ripe.</P>
      <P>In order to resolve the differences and misunderstandings between
the two sides, Koo noted, Beijing and Taipei should resume dialogue
on matters of protocol, including the protection of Taiwan
businessmen's interests and rights, the fight against crime and the
protection of intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Institutionalized contacts between the SEF and ARATS were
established during a meeting between Koo and Wang in Singapore in
1993, but were suspended unilaterally by Beijing on June 16, 1995 in
retaliation for ROC President Lee Teng-hui's US trip.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE SPENDING TO INCREASE DUE TO CURRENCY DEPRECIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense spending will increase by about
NT$6 billion (US$184.62 million) during the current fiscal year
because of a significant drop in the New Taiwan dollar's value, the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's National Defense
Committee, Vice Defense Minister Wang Wen-hsien said the ministry
will incur an estimated shortfall of NT$5.95 billion in foreign
exchange for weaponry purchases in fiscal 1998, which ends on June
30, 1998, because of the NT dollar's 15 percent depreciation against
the US dollar so far this year.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ministry will use its surplus from other programs
to cover the shortfall, but added that if this still cannot balance
the books, the ministry will seek the assistance of the Executive
Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said the country's overall military spending for next fiscal
year will increase by some NT$11 billion to reach NT$285.86 billion
(US$8.8 billion).</P>
      <P>The increased budget is to cover pay raises for military
personnel, repair and maintenance of the nation's new generation of
warplanes and warships, compensation for civilians accidentally
killed or injured as a result of military maneuvers over past years,
and other related items, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The MND-proposed preliminary budget bill also sets aside NT$84.8
billion, or 29.68 percent of total military budget for the coming
fiscal year, for classified defense projects. The amount marks a 2
percent decline from the current fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling
voiced the Defense Ministry's strong opposition to plans to open
Tungsha Island in the South China Sea to tourism.</P>
      <P>"Anybody who has visited Tungsha Island understands that the
islet doesn't have any tourism value," Chiang claimed, adding that
the tiny islet in the strategic Pratas archipelago has no fresh water
and that living conditions there are primitive.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China currently stations troops on the island,
and Chiang claimed that the opening of the island to sightseeing will
affect national defense and security.</P>
      <P>For similar reasons, Chiang said the Defense Ministry also
objects to opening Kueishan Island off Taiwan's northeastern coast
for sightseeing as has been advocated by some tourism promoters and
county government officials.</P>

      <P>The Canadian dollar closed on Tuesday at
69.57 US cents, down 0.14 US cents from Monday's close.</P>
      <P>It opened 0.06 US cents lower, at 69.65 US cents, and continued
to drift ever-closer to the historic low of 69.17 cents set in
February 1986.</P>
      <P>But despite falling through the psychologically significant
70-cent barrier and threatening to challenge the low, commodity
traders and economists weren't too jittery.</P>
      <P>The concern for Canadians is that further weakness in their
dollar could force the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates, leading
the big banks to raise the cost of borrowing for mortgages and
consumer, corporate and car loans.</P>
      <P>Most analysts said it's unlikely the central bank -- which has
raised rates a total of 1.25 percentage points since June -- will
make another such move before the new year.</P>
      <P>The dollar isn't likely to level off until the interest rate gap
between Canada and the US is closed off, a banker said.</P>
      <P>In spite of recent hikes, the Canadian prime rate, now standing
at 6 percent, is still 2.5 percent lower than its US counterpart.</P>

Irian Jaya who are suffering from the effects of a drought.</P>
      <P>A press release from the US Embassy, made available to Antara

US$250,000 to World Vision to distribute seeds to the people of
Jayawijaya District.</P>
      <P>The statement said that the delay in the onset of this year's
rainy season meant that many people were unable to plant enough sweet
potatoes, their dietary staple, to ensure a steady food supply for
1998.</P>
      <P>It said World Vision and Indonesian experts will provide rapidly
maturing seeds to help alleviate the suffering.</P>
      <P>This program will provide more than 16l,000 families with seeds
for foods already familiar to the area: corn, beans, carrots and
cabbage, foods that will be ready to harvest before the next crop of

Chinese ones.</P>
      <P>The crackdown angered some merchants and community leaders,
according to the Gazette. They feel Chinatown will lose its charm and
any changes will bring bad luck.</P>
      <P>Merchants say their downtown area should be given tourist status
so they can keep their predominantly Chinese signs.</P>
      <P>"In the Chinese culture, people don't like to change signs
because it is bad luck," said one restaurateur who didn't want his
name used. "To pull down a sign, it's like you went bankrupt. That

      <P>The language law is the same for Chinese signs as it is for

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN DAILY SEES RISING TENSIONS AS DPP GAINS CLOUT IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A major Canadian newspaper sees "an
escalation in regional tensions" across the Taiwan Strait in the
coming years as politicians of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) battle over voter
support.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail said on Tuesday that anyone who makes a living
at predicting the world's potential hot-spots puts Taiwan high on the
list, according to an editorial entitled "Taiwan becomes democratic
China."</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of December, Taiwan has been adjusting to a
new political reality, in which there are more elected municipal
leaders from the DPP, which favors independence, than from the
veteran Nationalists, or KMT, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>The shift in voter preferences is made all the more significant
by the lead-up to a parliamentary election in 1998, the article said.</P>
      <P>The local results may not signal an irreversible trend toward
endorsement of Taiwan independence, but they reveal far more
political boldness than the Taiwan electorate has ever manifested.
Moreover, where there are wayward glances in Taiwan, there's
mainland-Chinese anger and muscle-flexing. And where there's Chinese
muscle-flexing, there's agitation in the United States' pro-Taiwan
resolve, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>Since 1949, both Taiwan and mainland China have called for a
reunified China, the KMT on their model of evolving democratic
capitalism, the communists on Beijing's current one-party,
state-capitalism terms, it said.</P>
      <P>As both have spoken of peaceful reunification, they have armed
themselves heavily and prepared for war, it pointed out. The US has
weighed in periodically, by facilitating weapons sales and showing
force on Taiwan's behalf, it noted.</P>
      <P>Against this tense and competitive backdrop, Taiwan has prospered
mightily, and mainland China, too, has been reforming and rising
economically in recent years. But the two political visions of how to
govern Chinese people -- democratically or by authoritarianism --
couldn't be more different.</P>
      <P>Of late, it's perhaps this disparity that has led Beijing to
contemplate Taiwan-mainland cohabitation. Indeed, Beijing officials
have recently proposed Taiwan quasi-autonomy, under which the island
of 21 million would have its own army, economic policies and
political appointments to Beijing. At the end of the day, though, the
unity of China from Tibet to Taiwan, is an essential pillar of the
Chinese world view, it said.</P>
      <P>The Mail said the KMT has stayed engaged in decades-old talk of
eventual reunification, possibly because its members still harbor
hope of retaking the mantle of power in Beijing. The problem is that
back at home, the Taiwan-firsters in the opposition DPP are gaining
clout, and they're far more interested in their island than in one
China, it said.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of Taiwan's residents are islanders, not
mainland Chinese emigres like the ones who dominate the KMT
government, said the Mail. Reflecting demographics, the DPP party
chairman says Taiwan will "never" reunite with mainland China, and
the party's top thinkers advocate less dependency on the possibly
unreliable Yankees and more reliance on national defense and a
nuclear bomb, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>Ironically, an inward-looking Taiwan led by the nativist DPP
might well be less of a threat to mainland China than would be a
strong KMT with mainland ambitions -- especially if the DPP
soft-pedals its agenda, as it is learning to do, the editorial said.</P>
      <P>But that's not how the KMT or Beijing are thinking, the article
stated. It added that the DPP has the ruling party worrying about
losing power. It's no surprise that the local election campaigns saw
lots of pro-independence commentary from the KMT, and even some
sovereigntist remarks by Taiwan-born President Lee Teng-hui, it
commented.</P>
      <P>The remarks, of course, prompted Beijing to repeat its old threat
of using force against Taiwan, it noted.</P>
      <P>Add to the KMT talk the rise of the DPP, and the result is
agitation, not only for Beijing but also for the ambivalent United
States, it said.</P>
      <P>The Mail said that despite last year's possibly aberrant show of
force in the Taiwan Strait by the US Navy, the State Department
doesn't like it when Taiwan gets strident on independence. Senior US
officials quietly lecture them to play the agenda down, it added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government has set up
an inter-ministerial contingency task force to cope with possible
fallout from the recent Asian financial turmoil, Minister of Finance
Paul Chiu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Chiu
said the special panel will hammer out concrete measures to address
the possible adverse impact on Taiwan of the financial woes
afflicting several Southeast Asian countries and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The minister, however, would not elaborate on the contingency
group's members or working procedures. He said only that all relevant
financial and economic units can meet whenever necessary to discuss
problems facing the country.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the panel is closely monitoring the financial market
trends in mainland China and Hong Kong. He declined to predict
whether the mainland currency and the Hong Kong dollar would
depreciate in the near future. He instead quoted mainland President
Jiang Zemin as saying recently that the yuan would not be devalued
for the time being.</P>
      <P>Chiu went on to say that local industries have not yet been
seriously affected by the recent nose-dive in the South Korean
currency's value. He urged local entrepreneurs to learn a lesson from
their South Korean counterparts' current woes and take precautionary
steps.</P>
      <P>The minister further said the Finance Ministry will adopt
anti-dumping measures to curb unfair trade practices if evidence
surfaces that South Korea has sold goods to Taiwan at prices below
fair market value.</P>
      <P>Chiu said Taiwan's electronics and information-technology
industries are not expected to be weakened by the tumble of the
Korean won because they are highly competitive. Nevertheless, he
admitted that local textile, steel and petrochemcial industries are
likely to be affected.</P>
      <P>Chiu also said optimistically that Taiwan is unlikely to incur a
Korean-style financial crisis because of the combination of brisk
sales of high-tech products, large foreign exchange reserves, low
debts, a healthy trade surplus and relatively low bad-debt ratios at
local banks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE'S  CHEMICAL  INDUSTRY  WILL  RECORD  12  PERCENT  GROWTH IN 1997</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's chemical industry will grow
by about 12 percent to an output of S$27 billion this year, due
mainly to strong growth in petrochemicals and specialty chemicals,
according to the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB).</P>
      <P>Growth is also expected to remain stronger over the next few
years, it predicted.</P>
      <P>The chemical industry -- the second largest manufacturing sector
in Singapore after electronics -- comprises more than 300 foreign and
local companies engaged in petroleum; petrochemicals; specialty
chemicals; and pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and healthcare
products. Of these, the first three account for about 80 percent of
the chemical industry's output.</P>
      <P>The EDB said on Tuesday that following a 5.4 percent contraction
last year, petrochemicals output this year is expected to grow by 6.4
percent, despite softer prices of its products worldwide during the
past year.</P>
      <P>The strong growth was due mainly to the successful start-up of
the S$3.4 billion second petrochemical complex on Jurong Island which
includes the Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore's second cracker
and related downstream projects.</P>
      <P>The EDB said investments in these projects have enhanced the
integration of the local petrochemical industry and Singapore's
development as the leading petrochemical hub in the region.</P>
      <P>Specialty chemicals are also estimated to have grown at a
double-digit rate. The 12 percent projected growth this year will be
backed by strong growth in paints and coatings, industrial gases and
chemicals, flavors and fragrances, and water treatment chemicals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, single-digit growth rates are expected for both the
petroleum and pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and healthcare products
industries -- at 5.5 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The EDB said the investment outlook for the industry was
"encouraging," with growth expected from new projects in the
petrochemical, specialty chemical and pharmaceutical industries due
to come on stream in the next two years.</P>
      <P>The chemical industry contributed 18 percent to the manufacturing
sector's output last year, and the figure could rise to about 35
percent by 2003, the EDB said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Crown Casino in Melbourne, the biggest
casino in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the largest in the
world, has consulted feng shui experts in a bid to attract
high-rollers from Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, mainland
China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Crown's chairman Lloyd Williams believed feng shui experts could
provide good advice on the design and layout of his gambling empire
and its hotel tower while it was under construction.</P>
      <P>Many of the casino's cars also bear the number eight -- on their
number plates.</P>
      <P>The purpose is to attract Asian high-rollers to the casino,
analysts said.</P>
      <P>Crown flies in high-rolling gamblers from Asia in its own Lear
jet, promoting the exclusive use of its own private golf course in
Melbourne's bayside suburbs as an added incentive.</P>
      <P>In late 1995 -- about 18 months before the casino opened at its
new A$1.6 billion permanent site near the Yarra River, Williams
revealed that Asian high-rollers contributed about A$50 million
towards the company's first-year earnings.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, while still at its temporary home, the casino
was flying in about 30 Asian gambling kings each week with an
estimated A$7.5 billion in bets changing hands in 18 months.</P>
      <P>In fiscal 1995-96, high rollers contributed A$160 million of the
casino's total gaming revenue of A$490 million.</P>
      <P>Williams predicted that visiting high-rollers would account for
about A$360 million in gaming revenue at the casino, but the figure
was estimated before the Asian economic crisis, the analysts said.</P>
      <P>They believe the figure could be lower than the estimated one.</P>
      <P>In the past six weeks, Crown has lost about A$55 million to Asian
high-rollers, resulting in total business losses of A$40 million in
the past five months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMAND  IN  ASIA  FOR  AUSTRALIAN  PRAWNS SEEN FALLING</HEADLINE>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan are expected
to reduce imports of Australian prawns because of the recent Asian
economic meltdown, according to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture
and Resource Economics (ABARE).</P>
      <P>An ABARE spokesman said he believes the Asian crisis will force
major importers of Australian prawns to reduce their purchases.</P>
      <P>Nick Ruello, a Sydney-based independent seafood marketing
consultant, has also predicted "a weakening in demand for Australian
prawns as a result of the Asian economic crisis."</P>
      <P>"This is good news for Australian consumers, as it should result
in cheaper prawns at home," he said.</P>
      <P>Australian seafood exporters believe export prices of Australian
prawns will weaken as a result of the Asian crisis.</P>
      <P>Prawn prices in recent years have continued to rise dramatically
in the domestic market because of rising demand for the seafood from
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan, they said.</P>
      <P>But the economic crisis is expected to cause a fall or at least
slow the rise in domestic prices, they added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
increased US$215 million to US$83.135 billion in November from
October, marking the first rise since June, according to the Central
Bank of China.</P>
      <P>The impact of the Southeast Asian financial crises forced the ROC
government to spend some of its foreign exchange reserves to preserve
the New Taiwan dollar's value.</P>
      <P>As a result, the total amount of reserves has plunged from June's
registered US$90.025 billion, the bank said.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial statistics, the new figure ranked fourth
in the world, following Japan's US$228.15 billion, mainland China's
US$120.9 billion, and Hong Kong's US$96.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although the recent financial storm is still expanding
and has devastated the economies of South Korea and several Southeast
Asian countries, Taiwan's foreign trade still grew.</P>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) revealed that the amount of
Taiwan exports totaled US$111.57 billion during the period from
January to November, up 5.6 percent from the year-earlier level.
Imports hit US$103.84 billion, representing a 11.5 percent rise.</P>
      <P>The BOFT forecast that in the coming year, Taiwan will still
enjoy growing development in foreign trade due to stable foreign
orders and Taiwan's unstoppable efforts to promote large public
construction projects and remove investment barriers to stimulate
domestic demand.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The next Pearl Harbor-style sneak attack
may well be aimed at the United States' economic and information
infrastructure rather than a fleet of ships, The Journal of Commerce
reported on Tuesday, citing security experts.</P>
      <P>Because of that threat, the US Navy has begun conducting war-game
exercises on Wall Street to prepare for possible "cyber sabotage," or
physical attacks on such major financial venues as the World Trade
Center or the New York Stock Exchange, the journal said.</P>
      <P>"The worlds of international politics, national security and
financial markets are tightly linked," Rear Adm. James Stark,
president of the US National War College in Newport, R.I., was quoted
as saying.</P>
      <P>War games have been used by the military for more than 100 years,
but this is the first time the Naval War College has included an
economic security component.</P>
      <P>Six months ago, Stark came to Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street
brokerage firm that has become one of the world's leading electronic
marketplaces, to discuss possible threats to the integrity of the
global economy.</P>
      <P>Last week, the War College and Cantor Fitzgerald led a meeting of
government and private-sector officials to evaluate results of an
economic-security planning exercise.</P>
      <P>The exercise was structured around two related scenarios in
February and March of 2000 in the midst of the US presidential
primary season.</P>
      <P>The first scenario involved an escalating crisis in which US
access to Persian Gulf oil supplies were threatened.</P>
      <P>In the second, information warfare attacks were launched against
critical infrastructures related to the US business and financial
community.</P>
      <P>Both scenarios dealt with the potential vulnerability of the US
to asymmetric warfare, what one participant called the "David
effect," when "a little guy with the right technology can confront
the big giant in a devastating way."</P>
      <P>The exercise showed that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would
drop about 25 percent in reaction to the conflict and would not fully
rebound to the pre-crash level.</P>
      <P>That scenario would place the sell-off as one of the worst in
history, approximating that of 1929 and greater than the crash in
1987.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO SEND OFFICIALS TO HK TO STUDY 'BIRD FLU'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will send
officials to Hong Kong next week to look into the spread of the
deadly H5N1A influenza strain, also dubbed "bird flu," which is
believed to have claimed four lives there and has sparked a ban on
all chicken imports from mainland China.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said although there is still no definite sign of
human-to-human transmission of the virus, there are already 10
confirmed cases of "bird flu" in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"We must learn more about how the virus is transmitted and how
Hong Kong authorities are coping with the situation," said an
official with the National Quarantine Service under the DOH.</P>
      <P>Preventive medicine experts said the H5N1A is carried by migrant
birds and can spread directly to birds, poultry or swine, and that
there is still no evidence that the virus can directly spread to
humans. It takes six months or more time to determine the
possibility of human-to-human spread of the virus, they noted.</P>
      <P>DOH officials further said as migrant birds seen in Taiwan travel
in a different direction from those seen in Hong Kong, local people
do not need to worry too much about the new influenza strain.</P>
      <P>Still, they advised local people not to make unnecessary visits
to Hong Kong in short term to avoid contracting the virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a high-powered mission of Hong Kong travel executives
arrived in Taipei on Wednesday to attract Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong travel service executives said Hong Kong has banned
chicken imports from mainland China and has sterilized all chicken
ranches in the territory. No chicken in Hong Kong has infected the
virus so far, they asserted.</P>
      <P>According to Hong Kong tallies, tourist arrivals from Taiwan and
Southeast Asian countries have declined substantially since July 1.</P>
      <P>Local tour agents said the bird flu is not a main reason behind
the delcine in the number of Taiwan tour groups to Hong Kong. The
key reason is the appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar against the
New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the greenback against which
the NT dollar has depreciated about 15 percent in recent
months. As a result, the NT dollar has also depreciated against the
Hong Kong currency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASEAN ANTI-HAZE ACTION PLAN SET IN MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   Dec.   24  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ASEAN environment ministers and
officials vowed Tuesday to put in place by next June an action plan
to prevent, monitor and fight forest fires, in the hope of sparing
the region another episode of the haze which has choked large areas
of Southeast Asia this year.</P>
      <P>The action plan was endorsed by the ASEAN environment ministers
at the end of a two-day meeting in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia will take the lead in
implementing the strategies.</P>
      <P>A technical assistance package -- expected to be worth over
US$1.2 million -- from the Asian Development Bank will supplement
funds from each individual ASEAN member to finance the plan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the end of the ministerial meeting, Singapore's
Environment Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said: "We must send a clear
signal to the outside world that we are serious about preventing a
recurrence of the haze problem.</P>
      <P>"Our clear endorsement of a concrete regional haze action plan,
and prompt implementation of the measures spelled out in the plan,
will be a clear demonstration of our firm commitment to this end."</P>
      <P>The action plan calls for specific measures to:</P>
      <P>-- Prevent land and forest fires through better land management
policies and enforcement, and intensified public education programs.
Malaysia will spearhead activities in this area.</P>
      <P>-- Establish operational mechanisms to monitor land and foreign
fires. This will be coordinated by Singapore.</P>
      <P>-- Strengthen regional land and forest fire-fighting
capabilities. Indonesia is in charge of this.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous regional cooperation efforts to battle the haze,
this action plan spells out concrete steps which have to be taken by
specific deadlines, which stretch from February to June next year.</P>
      <P>For example, by March, computer links should be set up between
meteorological stations in ASEAN member-countries to share satellite
images, wind charts, visibility and air quality data.</P>
      <P>By then, an inventory of regional fire-fighting capabilities
should be drawn up and, if need be, outside help should be formally
enlisted, for fire-fighting equipment, aircraft and experts.</P>
      <P>The tight deadlines are the biggest challenge faced in
implementing the plan, said Yeo. "We expect the three lead countries
to do their utmost to ensure that the tight time-frames specified in
the plan are being complied with... We are allowing only a few months
for all this work to be done."</P>
      <P>For Indonesia, State Minister for the Environment, Sarwono
Kusumasstmadja, said the challenge would be in bringing about a
change in perception and behavior.</P>
      <P>He said the Indonesian government will mount an intensive public
awareness campaign, with the private sector as a main target, as
their land-clearing practices triggered the disaster this year.</P>
      <P>Asked if sanctions would be imposed on ASEAN members if the
plan's deadlines are not met, Yeo said: "The ASEAN tradition is one
where we assist each other as quietly as possible, and not try to get
brownie points for helping each other. It is one of quiet assistance
and discussion to enable the problem to be solved effectively.</P>
      <P>"We do not believe that sanctions are the answer to the problem.
We believe that cooperation and mutual assistance are the answer."</P>

not believe the country's economy will recover next year, despite
announcements earlier this month of a two trillion-yen tax cut and a
ten trillion-yen bond issue to stabilize the financial system,
according to a Kyodo News Service survey released here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The nationwide survey, conducted by telephone over the weekend,
covers 1,000 eligible voters -- 485 men and 515 women. Only eight
percent of those polled expect an economic recovery in 1998, while as

      <P>Results of the poll indicate that an overwhelming majority claim
plans for the tax cut and bond issue are not sufficient to boost the
economy.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced the two-trillion tax
reduction plan on Dec. 17 in a bid to boost consumer sentiment and
revive the stalled economy.</P>

      <P>Mainland Chinese paramount leader Deng
Xiaoping's death in February at the age of 93 was listed as the top
mainland-related news story for 1997 by Taiwan mass media.</P>
      <P>The top 10 mainland-related news items for this year, as chosen
by chief editors and senior writers of Taiwan-based media
organizations, including the CNA, are as follows:</P>
      <P>1. Deng Xiaoping died in Beijing from pneumonia caused by
Parkinson's disease.</P>
      <P>2. Work on the mammoth Three Gorges Dam project began after
workers diverted the main flow of the Yangtze River.</P>
      <P>3. The Chinese Communist Party held its 15th National Congress in
September.</P>
      <P>4. Hong Kong was handed over to Beijing's sovereignty after 156
years of British colonial rule.</P>
      <P>5. The mainland-owned, Panama-registered cargo ship Lian Feng
arrived in Kaohsiung on March 2 from Xiamen, mainland China, via Hong
Kong. It was the first mainland ship to call at a Taiwan harbor in
five decades.</P>
      <P>6. Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United
States, vowing to strike a "constructive strategic alliance" with
Washington.</P>
      <P>7. Renowned mainland dissident Wei Jingsheng was exiled to the
United States after being released by Beijing authorities on medical
parole.</P>
      <P>8. During a visit to mainland China with US Vice President Al
Gore, House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich warned that the
United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a military attack
from Beijing.</P>
      <P>9. A mainland-registered cargo ship, "Sheng Da," called at
Kaohsiung Harbor on April 19 after sailing from Xiamen, south China.
The voyage marked the opening of cross-strait transshipment services.</P>
      <P>10. Liu Shan-chung, a hijacker who commandeered a Taiwan domestic
airliner to Xiamen on the mainland earlier in the year, was

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD QUESTIONS 'ONE NATION, TWO SYSTEMS' IN HK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top mainland affairs official on
Wednesday questioned the long-term feasibility of the "one nation,
two systems" formula in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council said
that six months after its reversion to Beijing's rule, Hong Kong has
generally maintained its own social and economic systems.</P>
      <P>However, he said it is questionable whether Hong Kong will be
able to maintain its status quo in the longer term, adding that it
may take three to five years to have an answer.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that many Hong Kong columnists have stopped writing
articles in Hong Kong papers, and that several of them have even
emigrated abroad. He said this is an indication that even veteran
observers of Hong Kong affairs have no confidence in Beijing's
administrative formula.</P>
      <P>The scheduled legislative polls in Hong Kong next year will be
another indicator of the effectiveness of that system, Chang said,
adding that the confidence of the general populace will plummet if
Beijing seeks to intervene in the election process.</P>
      <P>He also warned that Beijing's continued blockade of Taipei's
international presence will only create unnecessary barriers to the
resumption of cross-strait negotiations, which were suspended by
Beijing following ROC President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United
States in June 1995.</P>
      <P>Chang was commenting on remarks made recently by MAC officials at
the Legislative Yuan that negotiations between Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the mainland's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), may be reopened in May or
June.</P>
      <P>The officials made the comments on the presumption that Beijing
will be able to devote more attention to Taiwan affairs at that time,
after concluding a series of political events, including a visit by
US President Bill Clinton, the convening of a new National People's
Congress and an expected reshuffle of the State Council, or Cabinet.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's semiconductor sector has grown
rapidly in the past six years, and now accounts for half of the
island's electronics products, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said that what is even more noteworthy is that the
semiconductor exports as a percentage of the nation's total exports
has increased to 8.1 percent in the first 10 months of this year, up
from 3 percent in 1992.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing
sector has been affected by the financial crisis sweeping Southeast
and Northeast Asia, but pointed out that at least two Taiwan
semiconductor giants believe the industry can weather the storm.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and United Micro
Electronics said that South Korea is no longer capable of investment,
and that Taiwan's semiconductor sector should seize this chance for
business opportunities.</P>
      <P>Although the semiconductor sector has developed rapidly, the
officials said that the balanced development of industry could pose a
potential problem, adding that the government should also develop new
industries such as sophisticated machinery, biochemical and
telecommunications, as well as aviation industries, to create
balanced industrial development.</P>
      <P>They noted that since November, the five largest export products
were machinery and engineering equipment, textiles, basic metal
products, rubber and plastic products, and transportation equipment.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China will help fund an
animal contagious diseases research laboratory in Bangkok, Thailand,
to study foot-and-mouth disease and other animal ailments prevailing
in Asia, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-chi, director of the COA's Animal Industry Department,
said Asian member states of the Paris-based International Office of
Epizootics, also known by its French acronym OIE, have long planned
to establish an animal contagious diseases research institution in
Bangkok. As many Southeast Asian countries are facing a host of
financial woes, they have sought financial assistance from other
nations, including the ROC.</P>
      <P>Japan, the United States, Switzerland have agreed to contribute
funds to the proposed laboratory, Chen said, adding that the ROC will
also offer financial aid for the program.</P>
      <P>Chen, who represented the ROC at an OIE-sponsored meeting on
Asian animal diseases in India earlier this month, said India,
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore have strongly advocated the
establishment of a regional research laboratory to help eradicate
several infectious animal diseases in the region.</P>
      <P>Chen said participants at the just-concluded OIE meeting agreed
that the new research laboratory should given top priority to studies
on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and poultry influenza, which have
afflicted many Asian countries. The FMD, for example, has swept hog
farms in all Asian countries except Japan and South Korea, and the
deadly H5N1A influenza strain, which is spread by migratory birds,
has been found in Hong Kong recently.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, Chen said, the new research facility may be
inaugurated next year.</P>
      <P>Chen said the OIE, an affiliate of the United Nations, is one of

    <HEADLINE>1997 AN UNHAPPY YEAR FOR MOST OF TAIWAN RESIDENTS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People in Taiwan feel that 1997 was not a
joyous year, with concerns over deteriorating social order being the
top source of unhappiness, a recent opinion poll shows.</P>
      <P>As the year 1997 will be wrapping up in a few days, the telephone
poll, conducted by The China Times daily newspaper, found that most
Taiwan residents have been dissatisfied with Taiwan's international
status, economic development, public order, and government
performance during the last year.</P>
      <P>Residents were found to be only somewhat satisfied with the
course of the island's democratic development and of relations across
the Taiwan Strait, which received an approval rating of 42 percent
and 28.6 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted on Dec. 24 and 25 among more than 700 adults
islandwide, found that people are most dissatisfied with public order
conditions, with 86 percent of the respondents saying the law and
order situation has deteriorated, while only 3.2 percent feel social
order has improved.</P>
      <P>A high of 45.8 percent of the respondents said Taiwan's
international status has taken a turn for the worse, while 22.3
percent saw the situation as unchanged, and only 11.6 percent said
the island's international status has improved.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, 59 percent of the respondents said Taiwan's overall
economic development has faltered, while 16.9 percent said the
economy has improved and 14.6 percent saw no change.</P>
      <P>About 43 percent of Taiwanese say they are dissatisfied with the
government's administrative performance, as compared with 21.2
percent who feel it has improved over the past year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, 57.4 percent of residents believe the island's
living environment has taken a turn for the worse, while 17.3 percent
see a turn for the better, and 16.6 percent perceive no difference.</P>
      <P>On the issue of cross-strait relations, 28.6 percent of the
survey respondents cited "no change," while 25.5 percent said the
situation has "become more worrisome," and 19.9 percent said mainland
ties have "improved."</P>
      <P>Regarding Taiwan's democratic development, a high of 42.1 percent
said the democratization process has advanced during the past year,
while 27.8 percent said it has regressed.</P>
      <P>Finally, 33.6 percent of the respondents said they have been
satisfied with their personal quality of life during the past year,
as compared with 30.8 percent who are "dissatisfied," and 32.4
percent who see their lives as "more or less unchanged."</P>
      <P>The China Times conducted the poll on Dec. 24 and 25 and received
741 valid responses, with approximately equal numbers of men and
women. The daily noted the survey has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.7 percentage points.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Panamanian-registered Li Ning cargo
ship anchored at the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung Friday
morning, delivering 22,000 metric tons of gravel from mainland
China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The Li Ning delivery marked the first shipment of such cargo ever
allowed from mainland China by Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government allowed the mainland gravel to
be imported into Taiwan amid outcries from the domestic construction
sector over the chronic and increasing shortage of gravel and other
related materials.</P>
      <P>Due to an impasse over the establishment of direct transport
links between Taiwan and mainland China, the Li Ning cargo was
transshipped from Fujian to Kaohsiung via Hong Kong, according to
sources from the Kaohsiung Harbor Administration.</P>
      <P>To accommodate the 17,300-ton vessel, the Kaohsiung Harbor needed
weeks of preparation since the international port has no facilities

    <HEADLINE>MIDI HOTEL GIVEN 1ST PRIVATE HELIPORT OPERATING LICENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Le Midi Hotel in the central Taiwan
mountain resort of Chitou was granted an operating license for its
new heliport on Friday.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) has issued an operating permit for a privately owned heliport
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Tsai Tuei said after presenting the license
to a senior Midi executive that he hopes more private enterprises or
local governments will build heliports at places where regular
airport services are unavailable.</P>
      <P>Midi Hotel spent more than NT$30 million (US$923,077) building a
three-story heliport in its vicinity. The second and third floors of
the terminal accommodate waiting lounges, a passenger service center,
restaurants and shops, while the roof will be used as a chopper
apron.</P>
      <P>Midi Hotel has decided to cooperate with Daily Air Corp. in
offering chartered flight services from major domestic airports to
the hotel starting next month. Scheduled flight services between
Taichung's Shuinan Airport and Midi Hotel will begin in February.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Tourist Association will introduce the new chopper
services at the 1998 Europe Trade Fair to let foreign travel agencies
know that Taiwan's travel market is undergoing significant changes.</P>
      <P>Daily Air, which currently operates flight services between
Taipei and the offshore frontline island of Matsu, said it will use
eight-seat Bell-430 and 13-seat Bell-412 helicopters to operate
flights between major domestic airport and Midi Hotel.</P>
      <P>Starting in January, the airline will operate chartered flights
to the hotel from Taipei's Sungshan Airport, Taoyuan's Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, Taichung's Shuinan Airport, eastern
Taiwan's Hualien Airport and Kaohsiung's Hsiaokang International
Airport.</P>
      <P>The carrier will also offer three daily flights between Shuinan
Airport and Midi Hotel starting in February. The ticket price for
each flight is NT$2,000 (US$61.54) per person.</P>
      <P>Midi and Daily executives said they hope the five-day workweek
scheme will help attract more holidaymakers to the scenic Chitou
forestry resort. Starting on Jan. 1, all government agencies and
educational institutions will implement a five-day workweek on
alternating weeks. Midi will offer special tour packages at discount
prices between January and March to promote the newly opened chopper
services.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Share prices closed 0.7 percent higher on
the local stock market on Friday as purchases of low-price
technology, plastic and chemical stocks continued where they left off
on Wednesday following a one-day holiday, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The brokers forecasted, however, that the positive trading
pattern might see a reversal in the near future due to lower market
turnovers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TAIEX) weighted price index increased
57.45 points to close at 8,132.5, while the bourse opened at
8,135.45.</P>
      <P>The TAIEX index reached a high of 8,205.7 on the day, and saw a
low of 8,113.23.</P>
      <P>Advancing issues overwhelmed falling stocks 347 to 71, with 57
shares unchanged.</P>
      <P>A total of 2.01 billion shares changed hands on a market turnover
of NT$97.43 billion (US$3.05 billion).</P>
      <P>Seven of the eight major stocks categories enjoyed gains.</P>
      <P>Textile shares rose the most at 2.3 percent, followed by plastic
and chemical stocks at 2.1 percent, cement issues at 1.4 percent,
foodstuff and construction shares at 1.2 percent each and
paper-making and financial stocks at 0.8 percent each.</P>
      <P>Electrical engineering issues dropped 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The 10 companies with the largest turnovers were: Picvue
Electronics, Pacific Electronic Wire, China Development, Far East
Textile, Taiwan Styrene Monomer, Ever Fortune, Mosel Vitelic, AGV
Products, Mitac International, and Union Petrochemical.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as a result of active and steady stock trading, which
has been cited as a contributing factor for Taiwan's continued
economic vitality despite a slump in other Asian nations, the
island's bad-check ratio dropped to 53 percent over the period from
January to November 1997 in comparison with the year-earlier level,
according to the Central Bank of China (CBC).</P>
      <P>CBC officials assessed that the figure might be the lowest since
1992.</P>
      <P>CBC statistics showed the amount of returned checks accounted for
0.5 percent of the total in November, down from the 0.52 percent
recorded in October.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DAILY AIR TO OPEN MATSU-OFFSHORE ISLETS CHOPPER SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Daily Air Corp., which currently operates
flight services between Taipei and the frontline island of Matsu,
said on Friday it will start to offer chopper services between Matsu
and its nearby islets from February next year.</P>
      <P>The government has spent millions of dollars building heliports
on the three isles off Matsu's coast -- Tungyin, Tungchu and Hsichu.
The three heliports are scheduled to be completed before the Chinese
New Year holiday which falls in late January.</P>
      <P>Daily Air said it is confident in the market potential of the new
chopper services between Matsu, which lies just off the mainland
Chinese coast, and adjacent islets. In addition to an anticipated
increase in holidaymakers following the implementation of a five-day
workweek scheme next year, the carrier said military servicemen
stationed on the islets were also potential customers.</P>
      <P>The ticket price for each flight from Matsu's Peikan airfield to
the three new heliports will be about NT$2,000 (US$61.54). The
current price for a single Taipei-Matsu flight is NT$4,800. Thus, a
Taipei-Matsu-Tungyin round trip will cost more than NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>Daily Air has reached an agreement with Le Midi Hotel in the
central Taiwan mountain resort of Chitou to operate chartered chopper
services between major domestic airports and the hotel from January.</P>
      <P>Starting in February, the airline will also offer three daily
flights between Taichung's Shuinan Airport and Midi Hotel. The hotel
is the first local private enterprise to build a heliport on its
own. The Civil Aeronautics Administration issued a heliport operating
license to Midi Hotel on Friday. The heliport costs more than NT$30
million (US$923,077).</P>
      <P>The carrier said it will open chopper services to other major

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI RESIDENTS LIVE LONGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei residents live nearly four years
longer on average than inhabitants of other cities and counties, the
Ministry of the Interior reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said that residents in cities with a high
level of urbanization tend to have longer life spans. The average
life span of residents in Taipei was 78.41 years last year, compared
with 74.49 in Kaohsiung, and 74.14 in Taiwan Province.</P>
      <P>The average life span of men in Taipei was also higher at 76.37
compared with 71.48 in Taiwan Province. The average life span of
women in Taipei was 81.14 compared with 77.42 in Taiwan Province.
Taipei and Kaohsiung are two special areas that do not fall under the
administration of the Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>Residents of the five major cities within Taiwan Province --
Keelung, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi and Tainan -- also recorded higher
life expectancies than inhabitants of the 16 counties in the
province.</P>
      <P>The average life span for males in those five cities was 73.17
years last year, and 77.86 among females, higher by 1.69 and 0.44
years respectively than for men and women in the 16 counties.</P>
      <P>The striking gap between city and county dwellers underscores an
urgent need for Taiwan to attain a more evenly balanced development,
a more equitable distribution of medical resources, and upgraded
health standards in remote regions.</P>
      <P>Average life expectancies also showed differences in terms of
geographic regions. Residents in northern Taiwan live an average of
75.71 years, topping the 74.31 average life span found in central
Taiwan, 73.65 in southern Taiwan and 69.59 in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan residents in general live 1.25 years longer than
they did a decade ago in 1987, with the average increase among
females outpacing the increased life expectancy for males.</P>
      <P>Compared with neighboring counties, the average life span of
74.55 in Taiwan is higher than in the Philippines (65) and South
Korea (72), but lower than in Japan (80) and Singapore (76).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overall figure was also lower than that for United
States (76), Canada (78), Britain (77), France (78) and Germany (76).</P>

    <HEADLINE>US OFFICIALS URGE RESTRAIN ON TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,   Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior officials from the US State
Department urged Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of Taiwan's main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, to show restraint on the issue of
"Taiwan independence" during closed-door talks earlier this month, a
major Japanese newspaper said here Friday.</P>
      <P>The Sankei Shimbun reported from Washington, DC, that it is "odd"
for senior State Department officials to have contact with the DDP,
as occurred in the wake of the DPP's stunning victory in local
elections held across Taiwan in late November.</P>
      <P>The DPP won 12 seats of the 23 seats being contested, while the
ruling Kuomintang managed only eight. The remaining three seats went
to independents.</P>
      <P>The talks with Hsu might have been prompted by worries on the US
side that friction between mainland China and Taiwan could be
heightened after the win by the DPP, which has in the past
advocated the severance of Taiwan's ties to the mainland.</P>
      <P>The reports said that during a meeting on Dec. 8, Hsu asked
whether the US government had changed its policy toward Taiwan after
the visit of mainland President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>The US officials replied that the policy has not changed, adding
that the US will continue to adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act and
to three communiques governing the Taiwan issue signed between the
United States and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that advocacy of "Taiwan independence" is incorporated
into the DPP platform, and that the party has no intention of
changing that historical document, the reports said.</P>
      <P>The US officials reportedly said the US guidelines have been
beneficial to Taiwan, and the US policy will continue to be that the
leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should not take any
"provocative action."</P>
      <P>The US also reiterated its stance that it would not support
Taiwan independence or the Republic of China's bid to join the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>The reports said that the meeting with Hsu was arranged after the
DPP's election victory last month amid alarm in Washington that the
DPP might step up its independence campaign.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CREDIT CRISIS HAS BECOME BIGGEST RISK TO REFORM IN M'LAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Wang Hsin-chung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the huge debt accumulated by
state-owned enterprises in mainland China's banking system, the
credit crisis has become the biggest risk to the reform now underway
in the Chinese mainland, a Beijing economic expert remarked on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, since there is little left in the mainland
banking system to allow people to buy consumer goods on credit, this
in turn forms an impediment to economic growth.</P>
      <P>Speculators with financial privileges use national credit for
personal profit by engaging in stock and real estate speculation, he
said.</P>
      <P>Whenever there is a deficit, it is transferred to the bank, the
expert stressed, adding that whenever there is a profit, the money
goes into the pocket of the speculator. Stories of enormous bad loans
are common. In addition, he said, many financial activities --
including those involving futures, securities, insurance and joint
ventures -- are rife with serious fraud, mainly aimed at using public
funds and the deposits of ordinary people for personal gain.</P>
      <P>The expert was further quoted as saying that a basic law of
market economies is "pay back the money you borrow." If this rule is
breached, a credit crisis will arise, which will in turn affect
normal economic activities and the lives of people in society as a
whole.</P>
      <P>This situation is unfortunately the biggest risk now confronting
the reform process underway in the Chinese mainland, the expert
complained.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has
crafted a package of measures to eradicate the food-and-mouth disease
(FMD) in two stages.</P>
      <P>The council invited health officials, academics and hog industry
representatives to review its draft anti-FMD package on Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the package, the COA expects to completely stem
recurrence of any FMD infection within a year.</P>
      <P>The COA is also scheduled to finalize marking of all healthy
pigs with ear-tags before the end of May next year.</P>
      <P>COA officials said all pigs raised at ranches around the island
must be vaccinated against the deadly disease and marked with
ear-tags before next May.</P>
      <P>The officials said the COA will join forces with local
infectious disease control units and hog farmers associations to
form joint inspection panels.</P>
      <P>Such joint task forces will intensify spot checks at hog
ranches, pork wholesale markets and meat processing facilities to
ensure that local pig farmers properly and regularly vaccinate their
swine in order to fend off the recurrence of an FMD epidemic on the
island. The COA will aslo establish a national pig industry databank
to facilitate monitoring of hog ranches.</P>
      <P>The COA will compensate pig farmers who have had their swine
vaccinated regularly but their pigs are still infected the virus
again. According to government regulations, all FMD-infected pigs
must be slaughtered.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's hog ranches were hit by an FMD epidemic in mid-March,
the first time in nearly five decades. Since them, all local swine
have been vaccinated, but several FMD cases were reported againt
early this month. COA officials said a large-scale FMD epidemic is
unlikely to outbreak here again. It will take at least a year to
prevent recurrence of sporadic FMD cases, and it will need three to
four years for Taiwan to be drop from the list of FMD-stricken
areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOMETHING ROTTEN IN THE STATE OF ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Canadian journalist witnessing the
Asian debt crisis firsthand last week found that while each country's
problems are different, they share a common cause: "Their political
and business establishments have grown corrupt and must be
overthrown."</P>
      <P>Peter Newman, a columnist for Maclean's magazine, pointed out,
"Revolution is in the air." He made the observation in an article in
the weekly's yearend double issue.</P>
      <P>The "Pacific Century," hailed only last month by Canada's Prime
Minister Jean Chretien at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit in Vancouver, has turned to mush, as country leaders plead for
more funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he said. At
least South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia will soon be forced to
declare a debt moratorium as several Latin American countries did in
1982, he noted.</P>
      <P>Newman stressed that the crisis flows out of cronyism that
pervades these and other nearby countries. "Patronage inevitably
trumps patriotism. Heads of governments use their national treasuries
as personal kitties, with scarce resources allocated to retainers and
relatives," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The family of Indonesia's President Suharto has created a mess of
overdue bank loans in the region of more than US$300 billion, with
little chance of payback, according to Newman. He added that the
toughest job for the IMF is to "drastically alter the area's fiscal
culture."</P>
      <P>"The monopolies must be broken up, corruption eliminated," he
emphasized.</P>
      <P>The situation in Indonesia is so fragile, resentment against the
Suharto family so intense, "there is bound to be violence in any
takeover" when the 76-year-old dictator drops out of sight, Newman
said in the article titled "Something rotten in the state of Asia."</P>
      <P>Least touched by the meltdown have been "Hong Kong, Singapore and
Taiwan," the columnist said. While they are far from enlightened
democracies, these islands of fiscal sanity have moved far beyond
their neighbors, which are run as personal money machines for their
rulers, he noted.</P>
      <P>What happens now, not just to the stricken regional economies,
but to the world at large, will depend on the short- and long-term
stability of Japan and mainland China, "Asia's twin anchors of
relative fiscal stability," he predicted.</P>
      <P>So far, mainland China has been protected because its yuan is not
convertible and its stocks are not subject to foreign speculation, he
opined. The mainland's business potential is so huge that nothing

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA DOUBLES PENALTY ON SPEEDING, DRUNK DRIVING DURING HOLIDAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  25  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is imposing severe penalties
and fines for speeding and drunk driving after 29 people were killed
and several others injured in the past week and more police are sent
to major cities and roads to crack down on offenders.</P>
      <P>A federal police spokesman told reporters that people found
driving in excess of over 30 kilometers above the speed limit will
lose their driving licenses and even face jail terms if they cause
serious accidents.</P>
      <P>Regularly drivers found guilty of driving in excess of more than
10 kilometers above the speed limit will lose three points as a
demerit and face a fine of between A$130 and A$170. But now they will
face a double penalty if they are caught in either speeding or drunk
driving, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The purpose is to alert motorists to drive carefully so that the
number of accidents will drop.</P>
      <P>Even before the Christmas holiday began Thursday, the death toll
resulting from car accidents over the past week had already reached
29, the spokesman said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States and Japan signed an
agreement to phase out disparities in Japan's tax rates between
Japanese and imported distilled spirits earlier than planned,
according to reports of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Tokyo will raise taxes on Japanese "shochu"
spirits in May 1998 and October 2000, instead of October 1998 and
2001 as planned earlier.</P>
      <P>Japan will raise taxes on "ko" shochu and cut those on whiskeys
in May next year, and will then increase the taxes on "otsu" shochu
in October 2000.</P>
      <P>There are two basic varieties of shochu -- the otsu type
characterized by a strong flavor and the ko type which is clear and
has no smell.</P>
      <P>Japan will also reduce tariffs on bourbon and whiskeys and
eventually abolish them in April 2002.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government earlier decided to raise taxes on shochu
by maximum 140 percent while cutting the levy on whiskeys by 58
percent by October 2001 through three stages.</P>
      <P>But Tokyo and Washington have been negotiating Japan's plan since
the WTO issued a ruling in February upholding US insistence that
Japan must narrow the gaps in taxes by Feb. 1, 1998.</P>
      <P>The ruling came after Japan earlier lost a WTO dispute settlement
case filed by the United States and European Union against Japan's
discriminatory tax system on imported spirits, the WTO report said.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said Friday that
mainland China will continue to undergo peaceful evolution because of
the democratization of Taiwan, the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on national affairs, Lee said in his

      <P>"What Communist China fears most is the democratization of
Taiwan," he told the 160 KMT youths participating in the seminar.</P>
      <P>The Beijing regime is also very sensitive about his foreign
trips, Lee said, because "Communist China feels threatened by the
democratization on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He said the government will simultaneously promote formal
diplomacy and pragmatic diplomacy. "We must broaden our international

      <P>Lee also said Beijing's rhetoric that "The People's Republic of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hit by the communist-controlled system,
mainland Chinese engineers are now seeking advice from Australian
counterparts so that they can remove barriers to their free movement
and keep pace with international standards.</P>
      <P>The Institution of Engineers, Australia (IEA) reported that the
Beijing government is keen for mainland engineers to become better
integrated with the global scene.</P>
      <P>IEA President Barry Grear told mass circulation newspaper The
Australian this week that his institution had recently held a series
of seminars in Beijing, Guangzhou and Xian on better global standards
and participation.</P>
      <P>He said the mainland engineers are "aware Western countries are
developing agreements that work toward removing barriers to the free
movement and practice of professional engineers between countries."</P>
      <P>"They are trying to work out ways in which they can have more
peer review of standards. At the moment, there are many standards
that are set by government-related organizations. But they are
wanting to change so that instead of having different standards for
every city, they want to open it up for much greater mobility within
China and between China and other countries," he said.</P>
      <P>He said: "Australia has been recognized as a leader in the area
of global recognition of engineering standards and professional
experience within the world market."</P>
      <P>He said the organizer of the seminars -- the China Association

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices on Friday
interpreted the eighth article of the Military Service Law as
unconstitutional, saying that the statute violates the people's
freedom of movement enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Referring to the 10th Article of the Constitution, the grand
justices said the people are entitled to freedom of abode, movement
and emigration.</P>
      <P>The grand justices said that therefore regulations restricting a
portion of the island's male population from going abroad should be
removed once and for all.</P>
      <P>The new interpretation made by the Council of Grand Justices is
tantamount to liberalized exit regulations for the island's young
men, said Chen Ting-chung, director of the Department of Conscription
of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>Until this decision, young men were banned from leaving the
country as soon as they reached 18 because they could be conscripted
at any time. The ban remained in force until they completed their
required military service, which lasts two to three years.</P>
      <P>These youths could go abroad only if invited to attend academic
activities or competitions, or to attend relatives' funeral services
and other special occasions, and only then with written guarantees
from their parents or legal guardians.</P>
      <P>In response to the grand justices' announcement, the MOI said on
Friday that it will see to it that related regulations are revised in
line with the decision.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense, meanwhile, will revise its own

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Up to 64.5 percent of the people of Taiwan
are opposed to unification with mainland China under Beijing's "one
country, two systems" formula, while only 13.4 percent said they
could accept this framework, according to the results of a public
opinion survey released on Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey, made public by Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Daniel
K.Y. Han at the Legislative Yuan, shows that 68.2 percent of the
respondents said that they do not believe in Beijing's "one country,
two systems" policy, nor in its promise that "Hong Kong people rule
Hong Kong." Only 9.3 percent said they have confidence in Beijing's
promise.</P>
      <P>The survey reveals that 70.3 percent of those polled said that
they fully or partially understand Beijing's "one country, two
systems" formula, while 29.4 percent said that they don't understand
it at all or understand it only a little.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions on Hong Kong's overall situation and its
future after its return to Beijing's rule in July 1997, 44.7 percent
opined that Hong Kong will remain unchanged, in contrast to 4.9
percent who said it will be better off, while 16.1 percent said they
think the situation there will worsen in the long run.</P>
      <P>Asked about the impression they have of Hong Kong and mainland
China, 44.5 percent and 13.5 percent of the respondents gave a
positive appraisal of Hong Kong and mainland China, respectively,
while 25.1 percent and 64.3 percent, respectively, said they have a
negative impression of the former British colony and the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>The poll also indicates that the people of Taiwan are most
concerned about the government's policy toward public order, economic
development, improvement in education and democracy, upgrading of
national defense and environmental protection, as well as civic and
social education and promotion of artistic activities.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll, carried out by Shihhsin University on Dec.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth is losing steam
against the background of Southeast Asia's financial crisis and the
sharp devaluation of the South Korean won, which, if not halted soon,
will cast a shadow on Taiwan's economic prospects for the first
quarter of next year, a local economic institute reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, a non-profit civil
think-tank, said in an analysis that Taiwan, with its sound financial
system and ample foreign reserves, has ridden the economic crisis
sweeping its Asian neighbors almost unscathed.</P>
      <P>However, the institute said that the bankruptcies of many
Japanese and South Korean business conglomerates have cast
uncertainty on global economic prospects.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to Japan, South Korea and Thailand shrank in
November, while textile orders from Hong Kong also posted a decline,
a fact reflecting the fizzling out of Taiwan's economic momentum,
said the analysis.</P>
      <P>It predicted a slack business season for the island's economic
backbone -- the electronic industry -- in light of the sharp
devaluation of South Korea's currency, which has lost half of its
value against the US dollar, coupled with the poor performance of the
Hong Kong and Japan bourses.</P>
      <P>Unless the Asian financial crisis is halted soon, Taiwan's
economy is unlikely to post excellent growth next year.</P>
      <P>In view of the Central Bank of China's pledges to maintain a
sufficient supply of money during the year end, and the markdown of
interest rates by local banks, the institute ruled out a tight
financial market during the Chinese Lunar New Year, which will in
turn help stabilize the value of the New Taiwan dollar, currently
standing at about 32 against the greenback.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Jin said on Friday
that the removal of restrictions that ban young men who haven't
completed military service from going abroad will greatly help the
plans his ministry is advocating aimed at encouraging university
students to study abroad.</P>
      <P>Wu said that his ministry has been pushing for a system of
academic exchange and cooperation programs between local and foreign
universities, under which university students will study abroad for
one semester or one school year.</P>
      <P>According to a "sandwich system" proposed by Wu on Wednesday,
students would study locally for their first year, pursue their
studies in foreign countries in their second year, and come back to
Taiwan to continue their studies in their third year.</P>
      <P>Many universities in Taiwan already allow their students to study
abroad for a short period of time, usually in the field of foreign
language study. However, male university students do not have the
chance to go abroad because of the restrictions imposed on them by
regulations governing the exit of young men.</P>
      <P>The article promulgated by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
bans young males who haven't completed their military service from
going abroad lest they fail to return to Taiwan to meet their
obligation stipulated in the constitution. All ROC males are obliged
to serve for two or three years in the military when they reach the
age of 18. If they are still at school at that age, they can delay
their military service until they finish their studies.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices on Friday ruled the article
unconstitutional on the grounds that the statute runs counter to the
constitutional guarantee of the right to freedom of movement, and was
not enacted in line with the required legislative process.</P>
      <P>The grand justices ruled that the unconstitutional article should
become invalid within six months.</P>
      <P>The ruling, however, doesn't necessarily mean that young men can
go abroad freely when the article becomes invalid, since the MOI said
it will seek to legislate a new law governing the exit of young men.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian on Friday for
the first time said that he will think seriously about running for
the head of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chen said that whether he will be a candidate in the election for
DPP chairman to be held in May is not a personal matter, so he will
consider the opinions of DPP grassroots members, DPP heavyweights and
other social leaders before making a decision.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held in Tokyo, Chen told Japanese reporters
that the idea of running for DPP chairman didn't occur to him until
his arrival in Japan, explaining that his arrival in a foreign
country allowed him to cool down and think about the question.</P>
      <P>Chen is regarded as a potential powerful challenger for the top
DPP position, but he had so far refrained from showing any interest
in the post, saying that he hasn't even thought of the possibility.</P>
      <P>Asked if the DPP will win the 2000 presidential election, Chen
said that the DPP's victory is certain, as it corresponds with
current trends. The recent victory of South Korean opposition leader
Kim Dae-jung in the presidential election in that country has
inspired his party a lot, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>However, the popular mayor refused to confirm whether or not he
will run for the next presidential election, saying that he cannot
predict what will happen in the next two years. The most important
thing at present is to be a good mayor, Chen told the reporters.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the DPP is a democratic and united party, Chen
said that in spite of the factions in the party, DPP members always
reach consensus at the critical moment. The DPP will not and cannot
afford to split, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Tokyo on Thursday to attend the opening ceremony
of the "Taiwan Film Exhibition." He is scheduled to return to Taipei

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new taxation scheme slated to take effect
on Jan. 1, 1998 will benefit both small and large businesses and the
general public, Finance Minister Paul Chiu said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Ministry of Finance, Chiu
said the new taxation system will reduce the tax burden by as much as
0.35 percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product and will help stir up
economic growth of 0.25-0.35 percent.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks after the Legislative Yuan passed the third
reading of the two-in-one new taxation bill, which incorporates
business income tax and individual consolidated income tax, thus
putting an end to the unfair system of double taxation which exists
under the current regulations.</P>
      <P>The measure, Chiu said, is expected to bring about immediate
benefits of a lower tax burden to a total of 480,000 self-employed
and joint-venture businesses.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, a company can deduct its business
income tax from the personal consolidated income tax of its
shareholders, while the maximum integrated tax rate will be slashed
from the present 55 percent to 40 percent.</P>
      <P>These measures will help to increase the public's actual
disposable income and will create stronger purchasing power, which
will stimulate the nation's economic growth, according to Chiu.</P>
      <P>A low-tax environment will greatly improve Taiwan's investment
climate and help sharpen Taiwan industries' competitive edge in the
international community, he added.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Surprised by Taiwan's ability to remain
nearly unscathed in the current financial crisis, two of the world's
most renowned business journals hailed Taiwan's marvelous economic
performance this week.</P>
      <P>Quoting a foreign investor who called Taiwan "the Switzerland of
the Orient," the London-based Financial Times attributed the island's
relative immunity to the financial firestorm that has blitzed many of
its neighbors to the fact that its economic fundamentals are stronger
than those of many of its neighbors.</P>
      <P>In an article published on Wednesday, the newspaper said Taiwan's
economy reached its nadir in 1996 and is at a different phase of its
economic cycle than other countries. It is also more closely tied to
the "China triangle" -- Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China -- than
to the rest of the region.</P>
      <P>The island's burgeoning democracy has also played a role,
according to the Financial Times, because the close watch on the
government and banks by the opposition parties and the media have
kept the cronyism rampant in financial circles to a minimum.</P>
      <P>However, the article, submitted by the Financial Times'
correspondent in Taipei, Laura Tyson, warned that markets are not
always rational, and financial crisis may still strike, no matter how
well-run Taiwan's economy might be.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-based Asian Wall Street Journal put
Taiwan's resistance to the financial turmoil to the responsiveness
and adaptability to market fluctuations of its many small- and
medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>In a story by Dow Jones Newswires Taipei chief Russell Flannery,
which was published on Tuesday, the newspaper also held out bright
prospects for the island's economy by predicting that the island's
competitors will usurp Korea Inc.'s place in the global marketplace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAX CONSOLIDATION TO AID ECONOMIC GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The taxation reform passed Friday by the
Legislature is expected to contribute the national economic growth by
more than 0.25 percent in the first year after its implement, said
the Finance Minister Paul Chiu Friday.</P>
      <P>In a press conference called after the enactment of the new
rules, Chiu said that the new system, which makes business income
deductible from personal income to avoid double taxation, will
improve both the fairness and efficiency of taxation.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, income from business operation will taxed
only once as part of personal income at a rate between 10 percent to
40 percent, rather than the zero to 55 percent under the current
system.</P>
      <P>It will cost the government NT28 billion in lost revenue,
according to Chiu. Of that windfall, Chiu said, about NT$8 billion to
NT$9 billion will go to the individual business operators and their
partners, the other NT$19 billion to NT$20 billion will be enjoyed by
enterprises of various size.</P>
      <P>The two-in-one tax reform, to some extent, is a tax reduction
similar in impact to that of the tax reduction package unveiled by
Japan two weeks ago with the purpose to reinvigorate its economy. The
increase in personal disposable income resulted from the new system
will stimulate consumption which in turn will increase the domestic
demand and promote the economic expansion.</P>
      <P>The NT$28 billion lost tax income, accounting for 0.355 percent
of gross national production, is expected to fuel the economic growth
by an extra 0.25-0.35 percent and increase national income by 1.5-2
percent, said Chiu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chinese National Federation of Industries Chairman
Kao Ching-yen said Friday night that the federation as well as the
two other national business groups, the Chinese National Association
of Industry &amp; Commerce and the General Chamber of Commerce of the
Republic of China, all support the new tax scheme.</P>

Taipei-based EVA Airways Corporation (EVA AIR) announced here on
Friday that it will open three weekly all-cargo services between
Taipei and Chicago beginning on Jan. 8, 1998.</P>
      <P>Coupled with its current all-cargo flights to other cities in the
United States, the opening of the new route will help the company
provide a more comprehensive service network between Asia and North
America and help it expand its transshipment services to Columbus,
Detroit, Dallas, Miami, Atlanta and Minneapolis, EVA AIR said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's second-largest carrier said that it will use two brand
new MD-11 aircraft to serve the Taipei-Chicago route and that the
addition of the two planes will expand its all-cargo fleet to five
units.</P>
      <P>In addition to six weekly all-cargo flights between Taipei and
Los Angeles, EVA AIR currently also operates two weekly all-cargo
flights to New York and one weekly flight to San Francisco. The
airline also operates all-cargo flights to Amsterdam, Brussels,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Manila.</P>
      <P>EVA AIR said its revenues in its all-cargo operation reached
NT$10.9 billion (about US$330 million) in 1996 and that the figure is
expected to increase by 20 percent for 1997, accounting for about
one-third of its total annual turnover.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABSCONDING ALIEN WORKERS STILL A COMMON PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One-quarter of Taiwan employers who have
hired workers from abroad have encountered the problem of their
running away, according to a recent poll conducted by the
cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>Although the number of runaways decreased slightly in 1997
compared with 1996, the percentage of absconding alien workers,
mostly from Southeast Asian countries, remains high, CLA officials
said.</P>
      <P>The poll of 3,702 local companies found that 24.36 percent of the
respondents hired foreign workers last year who later ran away,
compared with 30.1 percent recorded in 1996.</P>
      <P>Local employers attributed the high rate of absconding to peer
pressure among the workers, and the expiry of their work contracts,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 73.8 percent of local employers impose
compulsory saving plans on their foreign workers to try to prevent
them fleeing, whereby workers are forced to deposit part of their
monthly salaries in time savings accounts which cannot be drawn upon
within a certain period of time. The money plus interest is paid when
the workers legally finish their contracts.</P>
      <P>According to CLA tallies, as of the end of November this year,
the government had approved the entry to Taiwan of 334,082 foreign
laborers from overseas. Of this total, 254,261 have actually entered
the country for employment, mostly in the manufacturing and
construction sectors, which absorbed 212,339, while household helpers
accounted for most of the remainder.</P>
      <P>These 254,261 foreign workers constitute about 2.78 percent of
Taiwan's overall workforce, CLA officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE DEFICIT WITH EUROPE SKYROCKETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan incurred a trade deficit of US$2.62
billion with Europe in the first 11 months of this year, marking a 23
percent year-on-year rise, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported
on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and the Old Continent topped
US$36.02 billion during the 11-month period. Of this amount, Taiwan
exports accounted for US$16.7 billion, up 8.6 percent from the
year-earlier level, while imports from countries in the region as a
whole posted an even more impressive gain of 10.4 percent, to reach
US$19.32 billion.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union
(EU) were the main sources of Taiwan's trade deficit with the region.</P>
      <P>Among EU countries, Taiwan registered a trade deficit of US$2.6
billion with France alone for the January-November period, mainly
because of its purchases of French-made weaponry systems and military
equipment.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Taiwan incurred a deficit of US$720
million in its trade with Switzerland, an EFTA member state. The
amount represented a substantial 27 percent decline from the
year-earlier level, partly because of drops in Taiwan's imports of
Swiss gold bullion, wristwatches and cigarettes.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has imported large quantities of raw materials,
including steel, iron ore, aluminum, nickel and cotton from Russia
and other former Soviet republics, its trade deficit with the CIS as
a whole reached US$1.29 billion during the January-November period,
up 25.7 percent from a year ago.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said the board will join forces with other local
trade promoting agencies, including the semi-official China External
Trade Development Council, to help local entrepreneurs expand their
sales to Europe in order to narrow the widening trade gap.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui is a very learned
man with an insatiable thirst for knowledge, particularly in the
fields of molecular medicine, molecular genetics, and neurology, said
the president's chief medical advisor on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Lien Wen-pin, a leading cardiologist with the National Taiwan
University Hospital and head of the presidential medical team, said
President Lee is a model patient who is very medically perceptive.</P>
      <P>An insatiable reader, the president shows a keen interest,
particularly in books and reports related to the working of the
brain, the sympathetic nervous system, hormones, molecular medicine
and molecular genetics, Lien noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, Lee has a photographic memory. The
president memorizes every line and chapter he reads about medical
instruments and biological materials. In his mind, he has a clear
picture of Taiwan's medical service development and its problems,
Lien added.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a ceremony marking the establishment
of a turn-of-the-century medicare promotion foundation, to which
President Lee was the first fund donor.</P>
      <P>Lien himself gave his entire retirement pension to the foundation
to help finance its establishment, aiming at raising medicare
standards and improving medical research in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien, who has lectured at the National Taiwan University School
of Medicine for 43 years, retired this summer to work on the
foundation's establishment.</P>
      <P>His cause has received enthusiastic response, with cash donors
ranging from the president to business entrepreneurs. In September
alone, NT$10 million (US$312,000) was raised.</P>
      <P>The main function of the foundation is to provide financial
support for young medical talent engaged in medical research, and to
establish chair professorships which will allow veteran medical
professors, both local and overseas, to give lectures to young
students and professionals in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To begin the professorship program, the foundation has decided to
invite two leading cardiological specialists in Japan -- Prof.
Yuichiro Goto from Tokai University and Prof. Motokazu Hori from
Tsukuba University -- to give lectures at Taiwan's medical schools on
a five-year academic contract.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TAX INCREASE NEXT YEAR: FINANCE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu said on Saturday
that his ministry will not increase taxes next year to make up for
losses from a new taxation scheme which was passed by the legislature
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks in a year-end conference during which he
also unveiled white papers on national tariffs, securities and
futures, customs services, insurance, national property and banking.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Friday passed the third reading of the
new two-in-one taxation bill, which incorporates business income tax
and individual consolidated income tax, thus putting an end to the
unfair system of double taxation which exists under the current
regulations. The new scheme is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1,
1998.</P>
      <P>The new scheme is expected to cost the government an estimated
NT$31.5 billion (US$969.23 million) in lost revenue, and Chiu was
asked if the government plans to increase taxes to make up for the
shortfall, which he denied.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, income from business operations will be
taxed only once, as part of personal income, at a rate between 10
percent to 40 percent, rather than the zero to 55 percent under the
current system.</P>
      <P>The new system will help lessen the tax burden on the individual,
help promote stable employment and stimulate consumption after making
business income deductible from personal income.</P>
      <P>Most legislators are in favor of scrapping the present tax-free
status for military personnel and schoolteachers, but Chiu said these
issues need further consultation and that his ministry will submit a
report on the issue before June next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although personal willingness and
credentials are vital in selecting the party's candidates for the
mayoral races in Taipei and Kaohsiung, the candidates' chances of
winning come first, said John Chang, the ruling Kuomintang's
secretary-general, on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions on the sidelines of a symposium for young
KMT leaders, Chang said it is not yet appropriate to discuss publicly
the probable KMT candidates for the two municipalities' elections
next year, noting that the party will thoroughly consult with its
potential standard bearers before drafting them.</P>
      <P>As a well-organized political group with many excellent members,
the KMT has an established procedure for choosing its candidates,
Chang said, adding that this procedure has not yet been launched in
the case of the next municipal elections.</P>
      <P>While the KMT has not yet revealed its candidates for the two
cities' top spots, the major opposition group, the Democratic
Progressive Party, is set to field two political heavyweights.</P>
      <P>The mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung are the Republic of China's
most important elected officials after the president.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Governor James Soong, former State Minister Ma Ying-jeou
and Foreign Minister Jason Hu, among others, are reported as the
favorites for the KMT nomination in Taipei, while Justice Minister
Liao Cheng-hao and incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih are tapped as
possible party candidates in Kaohsiung. All of the figures, however,
have dodged questions about their possible runs.</P>
      <P>Jason Hu, at the same symposium, denied that he had ever been
consulted about running in Taipei, but said he would abide by the
party's order if called.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, James Soong, encountering reporters at an inspection
of the Taipei Railroad Station on Saturday, brushed off questions by
repeating what has become his typical response: "As governor of
Taiwan Province, I would rather devote my full energy to serving my

      <P>Among all the Asian "tiger" economies,
Taiwan and South Korea, the two most remarkable democracies in the
region, will take the political strain best in 1998, a Canadian
magazine forecast in its latest issue.</P>
      <P>The special report made in conjunction with the Economist
publications forecast that the once-powerful Asian tiger economies
will cure their wounds in "the intensive care unit" in 1998, and that
those who can swallow the bitter medicine will be released from
hospital earliest.</P>
      <P>The report said that the financial morass which occurred in
Southeast Asia in August will last until next year, and that the
crisis will put to test the ability of the "wounded tigers" to put
their troubled financial systems in order.</P>
      <P>The report by Paul Markillie, an editor for the Economist
magazine's Asian edition, said Southeast Asian countries, such as
Malaysia, will push for expanded trade and investment activities
among ASEAN countries to fend off the economic invasion by mainland
China and India.</P>
      <P>Although the economic growth of Asian nations will slow down next
year, Markillie said the figures will still be higher than those
estimated for developed countries. He said optimistically that the
1997 financial crisis will cause the Asian tiger economies to change
"in the right direction," but that they are expected to take two
years to rise again.</P>

      <P>Loh I-cheng, the outgoing ROC ambassador to
South Africa, said on Thursday that he is optimistic about the future
of relations between the ROC and South Africa after the two countries
sever their diplomatic ties on Dec. 31, 1997.
 Speaking in an interview with the Japanese daily Mainichi Shimbun
at Johannesburg international airport, Loh said he regrets having to
leave South Africa and that he is planning to retire from politics
after returning to Taipei. He also expressed sorrow for the isolation
that Taiwan has encountered in the international community, but
voiced confidence in Taiwan's continued economic development.</P>
      <P>Loh criticized mainland China's investment in South Africa as
being aimed solely at seeking profits for Beijing, pointing out that
the ROC's past assistance to South Africa has been for the purpose of
helping the host country.</P>
      <P>According to Loh, there are currently about 30,000 Chinese
people residing in South Africa, 15,000 of whom are immigrants who
arrived from Taiwan in the 1980s. He expressed optimism that the

      <P>The delegation, to be composed of officials from the economics,

industry associations and business groups, will visit Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, the countries which have

      <P>Thomas Yeh, director of the CEPD's Economic Research Department,

      <P>Although South Korea is also being plagued by a financial crisis,
it has not been included in Chiang's list of destinations. "This is

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the recent Asian financial
turmoil, Taiwan's economy continued to flash a safe "green light" in
November, indicating that the domestic economy remains on the track
of steady growth, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>It was the 13th straight month that the country's overall
economic performance has received a "green" rating on the
CEPD-designed five-color scale for stable growth.</P>
      <P>Much to some observers' surprise, the composite index of overall
economic performance received a score of 28 points in November, up
two points from the September. The observers originally expected the
score to drop because of fallout from the regional financial fiasco.</P>
      <P>Thomas Yeh, director of the CEPD's Economic Research Department,
attributed November's better-than-expected performance mainly to
significant gains in new orders and export value as a result of the
New Taiwan dollar's depreciation against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses a five-color rating system to measure the
country's monthly economic performance. A red light means the
economy is overheated; a yellow-red light indicates the economy is
heating up; a green light reflects steady growth; a yellow-blue
rating signals an economic slowdown; and a blue light represents an
economic recession.</P>
      <P>Ratings are determined according to nine major economic
indicators: export value, new export orders, industrial production,
manufacturing inventories, total employment outside the agricultural
sector, money supply, stock prices, the check default rate and bank
lending to the private sector. The minumum score for a healthy
"green" rating is 23 points.</P>
      <P>During the month of November, the nine indicators showed mixed
performances. Three indicators -- new orders, export value and bank
lending to the private sector showed marked improvement, driving up
the overall performance score. The ratings for industrial output,
stock prices and the check default rate declined, while the
remaining three indicators remained at the same levels as the
previous month.</P>
      <P>Yeh said bank lending to the private sector has continued to
increase for nearly six months, indicating that local enterprises'
demand for capital has risen and herals a rebound in investment
willingness.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's economic prospects for the coming year, Yeh
expressed cautious optimism, saying the economic performance for the
first quarter of next year will at least receive a "green" rating.</P>
      <P>Noting that next year's global trade will grow at a slower pace
because of the recent Southeast Asian financial crisis and South
Korea's economic woes, Yeh said Taiwan will rely on increases in
public and private investment to bolster its economic gorwth in
1998. As long as the private investment can grow 14 percent as
projected, he said, Taiwan will be able to maintain a 6.7 percent
economic growth next year.</P>
      <P>The results of a monthly survey of local manufacturers, conducted
by the CEPD in October, echoed Yeh's optimistic forecast of Taiwan's
economic outlook. A majority 84 percent of those surveyed predicted
that the economy will either improve or remains at the current
level for the next three months, while only 16 percent siad they
expects the business climate to get worse in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Yeh cautioned that Taiwan must devote more energy to expand
exports to such emerging markets as East Europe and Latin
America in order to sustain its economic growth.</P>
      <P>Yeh pointed out that the recent Asian financial crisis is
expected to cut demand in the Asian market and that South Korea
would certainly lower its prices to promote exports and maintain its
niches in the world market. As Asia accounts for more than 50 percent
of Taiwan's total exports, Yeh said, the above-mentioned two factors

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA TO REFRAIN FROM BULLYING TAIWAN IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is discovering the pleasures
of a better reputation, having behaved well over Hong Kong and pulled
back from bullyboy tactics over Taiwan, a Canadian magazine said.</P>
      <P>The Report on Business monthly, in its joint annual edition on
global trends with The Economist Publications, predicted that
Beijing, acutely aware of how it is viewed by the rest of the world,
"will not throw that prize away in 1998."</P>
      <P>The magazine pointed out that although preserving Hong Kong's
stability will continue to be a high priority for mainland China,
pursuing economic reform on the mainland itself "will be even more
pressing" in the coming year.</P>
      <P>That means mainland China has to tackle the real economic issue
of reforming its state-run enterprises, the biggest shake-up of the
state-owned industrial sector since the communist takeover in 1949.</P>
      <P>As long as President Jiang Zemin can maintain an economic
balance, "his position is likely to remain secure," according to the
report.</P>
      <P>In a profile of Jiang as one of the newsmakers in the spotlight,
the Report on Business predicted Jiang's actions will differ greatly
from those of his predecessors Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.</P>
      <P>To make his reforms stick, the report pointed out, Jiang
desperately needs to attract more Western capital.</P>
      <P>As mainland China is no longer needed as a counterweight to the
now-defunct Soviet Union, Jiang will face "increasingly blatant
Western demands for concessions" on issues of human rights and the
sale of nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan in exchange for
favorable trading status, said the magazine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA DEVELOPS NEW DRUG TO FIGHT `BIRD FLU' IN HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian scientists have developed a
new drug capable of fighting the "bird flu" that has so far killed
four people in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Dr. Peter Colman, director of the Biomolecular Research Institute
and a former scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organization (CSIRO), said the new drug -- Zanamavir --
attacks different strains of the flu virus, including the new strain
known as H5N1 which is currently plaguing Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"The new drug will hit the central region of the virus, stopping
the spread of the virus," he told reporters on Wednesday. "We are
cautiously optimistic (because) the drug has cleared major clinical
hurdles and should be available towards the end of next year," he
said.</P>
      <P>Colman, who led the 12-member CSIRO team which had been working
on the project for more than a decade, said conclusive clinical
trials were being carried out in North America and Europe.</P>
      <P>He said new pandemics of flu arise from major changes or
mutations to which our immune system has little or no resistance.</P>
      <P>The new influenza drug was developed by the CSIRO in
collaboration with the Melbourne-based pharmaceutical company Biota,
he said.</P>
      <P>Mass-circulation newspaper The Australian on Friday quoted Biota
chairman Dr. Hugh Niall as saying: "This is a major advance in the
treatment of one of the world's important diseases. It will have
great potential in the pharmaceutical market."</P>
      <P>Reports said 13 people are known or suspected to have contracted
"bird flu" in Hong Kong. Apart from the four who have died, two
remain in critical condition, five are satisfactory and two have made
a full recovery.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong health authorities have suspended all imports of
chickens from mainland China -- thought to be the source of the flu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singaporeans will hold a mass memorial
service Dec. 30 to mourn as a nation for the 104 people who died in
the SilkAir plane crash on Dec. 19.</P>
      <P>The public condolence service, which will start at 6 p.m. at the
Singapore Indoor Stadium, is being organized by a committee headed by
former Singapore President Wee Kim Wee and made up of community
leaders, the Inter-Religious Organization, SilkAir, Singapore
Airlines and the media.</P>
      <P>The move to hold the service was first announced Thursday by
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong after he toured the crisis
management center in Changi Airport.</P>
      <P>Friday marked exactly one week since the 10-month-old Boeing
737-300 crashed into the Musi River near Palembang, South Sumatra,
Indonesia, less than an hour after taking off from Jakarta for
Singapore.</P>
      <P>All 104 people on board the ill-fated MI-185 flight, including 97
passengers, one of them from Taiwan, and seven crew members, died
instantly in the mysterious crash. Only small body parts of the
victims have so far been recovered, SilkAir confirmed.</P>
      <P>Recovery operations are still continuing and Vice Admiral Rosihan
Arsyad, commander of the Indonesian naval western fleet, who has been
overseeing Indonesia's rescue operations, told reporters on Friday
that naval divers had found parts of the black box's casing.</P>
      <P>This gave hope that the flight data recorder and cabin voice
recorder, which would give vital clues on the cause of the crash,
might not have been swept away by the fast water-flow. "The black box
is still out there and we would not stop our operations until we find
it," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The recovery mission also discovered a crater measuring 60
meters by 25 meters at the bottom of the river, believed to have
been caused by the impact of the crash, reports from Palembang said.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, rescuers will dredge the big hole with a giant
clamshell excavator, weighing more than 40 tons and with 35-meter
cables, reports said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE ECONOMIC GROWTH FORECAST FOR 1998 CUT TO 4.4 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many economists and analysts in
Singapore have reduced their forecast of Singapore's economic growth
for 1998 down to an average of 4.4 percent -- well below the official
forecast of 5 to 7 percent, which the Singapore government is
reviewing.</P>
      <P>The latest 1998 consensus forecast is down from 5.3 percent in a
previous survey just a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Ten of those polled now think that the Singapore economy will
grow at less than the government's forecast. Of these, the most
bullish was J.P. Morgan with 4.7 percent, while Vickers Ballas was
the most pessimistic with 1.8 percent, according to The Straits
Times.</P>
      <P>Seven others said they were in the process of revising their
numbers downwards, implying that the average growth forecast for next
year could dip further in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Most economists and analysts here were becoming more bearish. Key
factors for their sentiments were the longer than expected saga of
the regional financial turmoil, concerns over the scope and depth of
the global electronics industry's recovery, the slowdown in the local
financial sector and rising interest rates in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Other dampening factors were the probable slowdown in the world's
major economies, by as much as one percentage point, due to the Asian
financial crisis; cutbacks in domestic spending arising from the
plunge in asset prices; and reduced tourist arrivals, which will
aggravate the already sluggish retail and real estate sectors here.</P>
      <P>Analysts also said that weak overseas demand for goods from
Singapore would affect its manufacturing output. They noted that
Singapore's exports could also become less price competitive relative
to other Asian countries whose currencies had depreciated more
against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>Singapore's official 1998 economic growth forecast is currently 5
to 7 percent. But Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan said
recently that the government was reviewing its forecast to take into
account the financial crisis in South Korea.</P>
      <P>He had noted then that the ongoing regional financial crisis was
bound to have some impact on the Singapore economy, although it was
difficult to say how big the impact would be.</P>
      <P>Despite a less rosy outlook for Singapore's economy next year,
however, sentiment among economists and analysts here remains upbeat
for this year, with their recent growth forecasts averaging around
7.1 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The question of allowing Taiwan banks to
open branches in mainland China should be dealt with carefully,
Finance Minister Paul Chiu said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end press conference, Chiu said Taiwan
investors are bringing more money to the mainland for investment
than they send back to Taiwan. This phenomenon deserves special care,
he said, adding that the question of whether allowing Taiwan banks to
set up branches on the mainland should therefore be dealt with
carefully.</P>
      <P>This question is related to the development of cross-strait
relations and the implementation of the Guidelines for National
Unification, and therefore should be dealt with flexibly, he added.</P>
      <P>In an answer to a question about the establishment of offshore
banking units (OBU), Chiu said the question of whether Taiwan banks
can set up more than two OBUs in Taiwan is now under consideration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu Ying-tung, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission of the Ministry of Finance, said the ceiling of foreign
investment in Taiwan's stock market will be raised from 25 to 30
percent next month. He did not elaborate.

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singaporeans and foreigners must not
lose confidence in Singapore's economy and government, because once
it is shaken, it takes a very long time to recover, Singapore's
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Sunday night.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a grassroots function, he warned, "The most important
thing for us is to maintain this confidence which takes years to
build up, but if shaken, can be destroyed in a few days.</P>
      <P>"All it will take are a few reckless policies, a few foolish
speeches, a few riots and demonstrations, and it will take a long
time to recover, even with International Monetary Fund help."</P>
      <P>Lee, who will take over concurrently as chairman of the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) from Thursday, singled out Indonesia as
one country facing a loss of confidence.</P>
      <P>"If they don't like it, then in one day the rupiah can fall by as
much as 15 percent," he said.</P>
      <P>And that, he added, was just the start of the problem. The
investors might take the money out of the country, convert it into US
dollars or yen and the exchange rate would suffer even more, he
warned.</P>
      <P>"And it is a contagious problem. As the situation gets worse,
even those who had confidence in the country initially will follow
those moving out of the economy, to protect themselves," he said.</P>
      <P>"And it is not just foreigners who make these calculations, but
also the local companies and the citizens.</P>
      <P>"If they lose confidence, then it is very hard to restore it,
even with the help of the IMF."</P>
      <P>He stressed that any loss of confidence would lead to a whole
host of other economic problems.</P>
      <P>Initially, inflation would set in and the people's purchasing
power would be eroded. Then, if the government borrowed heavily to
defend the exchange rate, the interest rate would be pushed up.</P>
      <P>Companies which had borrowed heavily from the banks, might then
be unable to repay their loans, forcing banks into financial
difficulty, and then the country would be "really in a deep hole," he
said.</P>
      <P>Singapore, however, had been spared the worse -- partly because
it was lucky and partly because it had followed sound economic
policies which had not shaken investors' confidence, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that when the ongoing economic turmoil began, foreign
newspapers had written many articles about the region's problems, but
"Singapore did not appear on their map of troubled nations."</P>
      <P>Instead, now there were articles about how Singapore had done the
right thing, how it had avoided the brunt of the economic turmoil and
how it stood to gain when the region eventually recovered.</P>
      <P>Complementing the government for having adopted the right
economic policies, he said that economic growth would be affected by
the regional currency crisis, but not severely, and continued sound
policies would help retain confidence.</P>

economy, while unable to entirely escape the assault, is relatively
unscathed, much like Switzerland during and after World War Two.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) on Sunday reasoned that Taiwan's healthy economic fundamentals
and a well-established monetary structure have put up a solid front
in fending off the financial onslaught against Asian economies.</P>
      <P>Citing a pair of articles appearing in the mass-circulation
Financial Times of London and the Asian Wall Street Journal, the
officials noted that Taiwan has been described as the "Switzerland of
the Orient." This is due to its emergence as one of the world's most
insulated economies now that East Asia has lost its reputation as a
"crisis-free haven" for global investors after financial storm clouds
gathered over in Thailand in July.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said Taiwan's economic development remains on a stable
track, adding that it has outpaced other Asian competitors after
efficiently solving financial problems arising from the depreciation
of the New Taiwan dollar and a declining stock market.</P>
      <P>As of Christmas Day, the New Taiwan dollar had depreciated 14
percent against the US currency since the end of June.</P>
      <P>However, according to CEPD statistics, that figure pales in
comparison with the registered 57.7 percent drop of the Indonesian
rupiah, 51.6 percent devaluation of the South Korean won, 45 percent
loss of the Thailand baht, the 34 percent fall of the Malaysian
dollar and the 34 percent depreciation of the Philippine peso over
the same six-month period.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the reasons for Taiwan's ability to weather the
regional financial storm, the CEPD officials said that in addition to
sound economic fundamentals, including abundant foreign exchange
reserves and surpluses in current account balance, the government's
earlier financial reforms also played an important role in helping
the country survive the crisis.</P>
      <P>Those reforms, which encouraged unhealthy local financial
institutions to merge with larger banking conglomerates and
introduced an insurance system for banks to strengthen the nation's
financial infrastructure, were undertaken in 1996 after mainland
China launched a series of provocative military threats against
Taiwan that caused a severe economic recession on the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the fact that small and medium enterprises play a
leading role in guiding Taiwan's economic development also provides
the nation maneuverability in dealing with financial fluctuations,
the CEPD analysts said.</P>
      <P>They added that Taiwan's efforts in promoting liberalization and
democratization also proved beneficial in managing the financial and
economic challenges, saying that political openness in the society
had helped ease problems between the government and banks arising
from overextended loans, which are considered a major culprit in
sparking the recent financial crises in other countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HSU HAS NO INTENTION TO SEEK RE-ELECTION AS DPP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), announced on Sunday that he will not seek
re-election to the party's top position.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who returned from a trip to South Korea and Japan on
Saturday morning, also made it clear in a press conference that he
will not be a candidate in the legislative elections slated for late
next year.</P>
      <P>Hsu stressed his decision not to seek re-election has nothing to
do with the possibility that Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian might seek
the DPP chairmanship. He said the decision had been made prior to the
local elections for city mayors and country magistrates held on Nov.
29.</P>
      <P>Being a party leader means heavy responsibilities, be not
necessarily power, Hsu said, adding that if Chen can succeed him in
leading the DPP, it would be advantageous for the popular Taipei
mayor as well as for the party.</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that the DPP's overwhelming victory in November's
local elections has successfully put an end to one-party rule by the
Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan. As the DPP's power has developed onto a
par with that of the KMT, Hsu claimed that his first-stage
"historical mission" has been achieved.</P>
      <P>Hsu went on to say that his decision not to seek re-election as
DPP chairman or to run for public office does not imply that he will
retreat from the political arena. Instead, he asserted that his
second-stage mission is to lead Taiwan to face the challenges of the
21st century.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that Taiwan can expect numerous challenges in the coming
century, including the question of its relations with mainland China,
and that he will make his own contributions in leading the island to
play a crucial role in the international community.</P>
      <P>Hsu, however, refused to confirm whether he will contest the
presidential election in the year 2000, saying only that he will not
give up his idealism easily. In the 1996 election, Hsu failed to win
his party's nomination to run for office as Taiwan's first popularly
elected president.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that during the remainder of his tenure as DPP chairman,
he will continue his efforts to transform the party, adding that he
would promote further discussions to determine the DPP's stance on
various policy matters.</P>
      <P>Hsu also thanked the public for its support of the DPP. He said
the landslide victory in the elections for city mayors and county
chiefs meant a great deal to him personally, as he had resigned from
the DPP top position four years ago to take responsibility for a
setback suffered by the party in local elections at that time.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian on Sunday said
he will seriously consider a bid to become the head of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chen, who returned from a three-day trip to Japan on Saturday
night, said that he will weigh the opinions of grassroots DPP
members, party heavyweights and other civic leaders before making any
decision.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, also stressed his intention to seek re-election as
Taipei mayor, saying that he is determined to achieve that goal.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment upon reports that DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang
will not seek re-election to his post, Chen said he believes Hsu's
decision was made after careful consideration and should be
respected.</P>
      <P>Chen said that whether he will seek to become the next DPP
chairman will not be influenced by Hsu's decision.</P>
      <P>Chen is regarded as a powerful potential challenger for the top
DPP position, but he has previously refrained from showing any
interest in the post, saying that he hasn't even entertained the
possibility.</P>
      <P>During his just-concluded visit to Japan, Chen for the first time
hinted at his interest in the DPP chairmanship and said that he will
consider his options.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture of the
Executive Yuan will continue to carry out its plan to grow more trees
and take better care of trees in Taiwan to comply with the Kyoto
Protocol for the reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, an
official of the council said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>The council is implementing the 1992 Taiwan Forestry Program,
which encourages the planting of trees wherever possible by the
general public, and limits the cutting of natural forests and the
production of lumber, he said.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, 60.24 percent of the slopeland on Taiwan will be
covered by trees by the year 2001, compared with the current 58.53
percent. Taiwan has 2,100,000 hectares of forests now. By the end of
2000 the program will increase 61,000 hectares of forests, he added.
The new forests will be able to reduce 8,270,000 tons of carbon
dioxide per year, he added.

    <HEADLINE>1997 'PEOPLE IN THE NEWS' SELECTED BY VARSITY STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Television hostess and entertainer Pai
Ping-ping topped the list of the People in the News in the World
Chinese Communities in 1997, chosen by college and university
students in Taiwan, which was published Sunday.</P>
      <P>Pai Ping-ping received the largest number of ballots cast by the
varsity students in a poll for her cheerful role on the TV screen and
her bravery as a mother in the wake of a heart-rending tragedy
involving the kidnap and murder of her 17-year-old daughter, Pai
Hsiao-yen.</P>
      <P>The kidnap/murder of Pai Hsiao-yen, one of the most high-profile
crimes in Taiwan in 1997, developed into an islandwide episode from
April to November because of the cunning and trickery of Pai's
kidnappers.</P>
      <P>Steven Chu, a Chinese-American physicist who won this year's
Nobel Prize in Physics together with two other scientists, was
selected the No. 2 figure in the People in the News list for his
outstanding achievement in his research field, and his being a source
of pride for all Chinese in the world.</P>
      <P>Following was Taiwan Governor James Soong, who has attracted high
attention during the past year as a "very special" politician who is
the first popularly elected Taiwan governor as well as the last such
administrator because of the island's changing political map.</P>
      <P>Despite Soong being the last governor of Taiwan, his popularity
has continued to soar islandwide, according to the China Cultural
Congress, which conducted the poll.</P>
      <P>Number four on the list of 1997 newsmakers was President Lee
Teng-hui, the first popularly elected president of the Republic of
China, who is described as a statesman that is both highly popular
and highly controversial.</P>
      <P>Hou You-yi, Taipei's chief criminal police, grabbed the fifth
place in the poll by demonstrating commendable courage during a
hostage crisis masterminded by Pai Hsiao-yen's kidnapper Chen
Chin-hsing. Chen took the entire family of South Africa's military
attache in Taiwan as hostage during a 24-hour standoff with police.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, former justice minister who left the political
spotlight for two years, took sixth place. Ma, who has a clean image
and is particularly popular among women voters and professional and
white-collar workers, is considered the ruling Kuomintang's only
trump card capable of overcoming the Democratic Progressive Party's
powerful influence in next year's Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Following Ma to round out the top 10 list of 1997 People in the
News were Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, Premier Vincent Siew, Lawyer
Hsieh Chang-ting and former Taipei City Information Director Lo
Wen-chia, in that order.</P>
      <P>Communist Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Hong Kong's first
administrator after the July 1 turnover Tung Chee-hwa, leading
mainland Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, ROC Education Minister Wu
Jin and Ang Lee, renowned Taiwanese-American movie director, also
made the 1997 popularity list, ranking between 11th and 20th places.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IDF COMPLETES AIR-TO-GROUND COMBAT PREPAREDNESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The locally built indigenous defense
fighters (IDFs) have completed air-to-ground combat preparedness and
will replace aging F-5E jetfighters as the mainstay of the Republic
of China's air defense fleet, military sources said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"The completion of IDF airborne interception and air-to-ground
combat preparedness has contributed much to fortifying our air
defenses," said an official with the Air Force General Headquarters.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the IDFs
had also undergone anti-ship combat training. As the Chungshan
Institute for Science and Technology-developed air-launched
Hsiungfeng II missiles were originally intended for use by AT-3
trainers, they were not fully compatible with the demands of the
IDFs.</P>
      <P>"The Air Force has asked the institute to extend the length of
the Hsiungfeng II missiles in order to increase their shooting range
and meet IDF requirements," the official said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that F5-E fighters had succeeded in
shooting down IDFs on many occasions during simulated war games, the
official said this was partly caused by inexperience on the part of
pilots in operating IDFs, which remain relatively new to Air Force
pilots.</P>
      <P>The Air Force has organized a hypothetical enemy squadron to
assist IDFs in airborne combat training, the official said, adding
that Air Force pilots are seeking to determine the most suitable
"airspace" for the new aircraft in order to enhance survivability
during engagement.</P>
      <P>The official further said the Air Force has formed several F-16
and Mirage 2000-5 squadrons, but they are still undergoing intensive
training and cannot perform airborne interception or combat missions.</P>
      <P>As part of its second-generation arsenal buildup plan, the ROC
has ordered 60 French-made Mirage 2000-5s and 150 American-made F-16
jetfighters. Some of those planes have already been shipped to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Tang Yao-ming said over
the weekend that the Army will phase out all of its aging
250-kilogram jeeps over the next six years in order to ensure traffic
safety for officers and enlisted men.</P>
      <P>Tang said relevant Army units are working on a new jeep purchase
plan. "We have yet to decide on the model we'll use in the future."</P>
      <P>He further said the Army will also gradually replace its aging
medium- and heavy-duty trucks with locally produced models in the
coming years.</P>
      <P>The military began to implement a four-year troop reduction plan
in July, under which the Republic of China will cut the number of
armed forces personnel from 453,000 to 400,000 by the year 2001.</P>
      <P>The government said 400,000 troops are sufficient because the
country's military policy now gives top priority to safeguarding the
security of Taiwan instead of seeking to reconquer mainland China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing will reduce its tariffs again in
1998, with high-technology products and advanced equipment at the
core of its rate cuts, a prestigious mainland Chinese magazine has
indicated.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has lowered its tariff rates seven times since
1992, with an accumulated reduction up to 60 percent, involving
almost 5,000 items. The average tariff rate has been lowered from
43.2 percent before 1992 to the current 17 percent, the latest issue
of Beijing-based Outlook magazine revealed, adding that the average
tariff rate is anticipated to drop to 10 percent by the year 2005.</P>
      <P>Mainland business circles by and large welcome the tariff-cutting
moves, believing they will spark consumer demand and in turn will
provide a lively injection to the recessed economy, the magazine
pointed out.</P>
      <P>But on the other hand, Outlook stressed, the cost advantage
enjoyed by mainland products will be weakened due to price-cutting on
imports. Therefore, the mainland's state-owned enterprises, which are
already under considerable pressure, will suffer more as a result of
reduced tariffs, the magazine commented.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) on Monday ordered health authorities to closely monitor all
chicken farms in Taiwan in order to prevent the outbreak of bird flu
on this island.</P>
      <P>The COA issued the order in a special meeting in the morning
after the Hong Kong government on Sunday ordered the slaughter of up

in an effort to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, which has
killed four people since its outbreak in early December.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan said that the provincial-level
Taiwan Research Institute for Animal Health has been examining serum
collected from islandwide chicken farms and that no virus has been
found to date, adding that any chickens found infected with the virus
will be immediately wiped out by health authorities.</P>
      <P>Lee said the COA has prepared a manual with which trained health
officials will use in promoting their mission to combat bird flu at
farms islandwide within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA also has dispatched officials to Hong Kong
to gain a first-hand understanding of the Hong Kong government's
measures to stop the bug, Lee noted. He added that a Japanese expert
had arrived in Taiwan earlier in the day at the invitation of the COA
to help local health officials examine chicken serum and virus.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan maintains close exchanges with Hong Kong, Lee said the
bird flu, which is caused by the H5N1 virus, could easily be passed

    <HEADLINE>MND PLANNING TO INCREASE NUMBER OF GI JANES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the number of men in uniform is being
gradually reduced under a policy of developing elite fighting units,
the number of female officers and GIs will be increased, a spokesman
for the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>In a report at the Legislative Yuan Committee on National
Defense, Chen Chin-sheng, an MND vice minister in charge of personnel
affairs, said the MND has recently revised the military recruitment
policy in an effort to raise the number of women to between 5 percent
and 8 percent of the entire ROC armed forces.</P>
      <P>The armed forces began to receive women in officers' and
soldiers' training camps in 1991, and opened the doors of military
academies to female students in 1994, said Chen.</P>
      <P>However, those initiatives were insufficient to recruit enough
females into the military, Chen noted, adding that by the end of this
year, the number of female officers and enlisted women totals only
about 6,000, constituting only a small percentage of the overall ROC
armed forces.</P>
      <P>The MND is also considering recruiting women into combat units on
the provision that the GI Janes are equal to their male counterparts
in physical capacity and military skills.</P>
      <P>Another major factor prompting the MND to consider opening combat
units to women is that most women in uniform, about 85 percent, are
reluctant to be transferred or shifted to other positions, which has
caused an overconcentration of female personnel in certain job areas,
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said that under the newly revised military
recruitment policy, there will be female generals in the ROC armed
forces before long, although currently there is no woman whose
academic background and military record are sufficient enough to
qualify her to become a general.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the revised regulations have also removed age
restrictions on servicewomen, allowing them to serve as long as their
male counterparts, Chen added. In the past, servicewomen were asked
to retire when they reached the age of 45.</P>
      <P>During the report at the Legislative Yuan, two female officers --
Navy Lt. Huang Yi-fang and Air Force pilot Mi Shu-chen -- were also
present for the legislators' interpellation. Both of them testified
that they have no problems in coping with military careers as women,
and that they enjoy the same opportunities as do men.</P>

      <P>Outgoing South African Military Attache
Col. McGill Alexander paid a visit to Hou You-yi, director of the
Taipei City Police Headquarters' criminal investigation department,
on Monday to express his gratitude for Hou's assistance to his
family.</P>
      <P>Alexander praised Hou for his bravery in rescuing him and his
family members, who were held hostage by Taiwan's most-wanted
fugitive, Chen Chin-hsing, on Nov. 19. Chen was one of the three
masterminds in the kidnap-murder of Pai Hsiao-yen, the 17-year-old

      <P>It was Hou who entered Alexander's home to escort out the
diplomat and his 22-year-old daughter after they were accidentally
shot by Chen during the standoff. Alexander sustained a wound to his
right leg, while his daughter was struck in the wrist and hip.
Alexander's wife and youngest daughter as well as a baby boy in the
family's care were released unhurt before Chen surrendered to police.</P>
      <P>Alexander credited the peaceful settlement of the incident to
Hou's calm, wit and courage. "Hou's performance was beyond the
public's expectations of a bureaucrat or civil servant," the South
African diplomat said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hou said rescuing hostages was part of his duty. "I
just did what I was obliged to do. You and your family do not need to
care too much about my role in resolving the crisis," Hou told
Alexander.</P>
      <P>Hou also lauded Alexander and his family for their calm and
rationality in facing the ordeal. "You and your family have set a
model for crisis response by crime victims," he said, adding that
their business-as-usual performance had helped police accurately
assess Chen's situation and his frame of mind.</P>
      <P>Alexander and his family will leave for home on Wednesday as
South Africa will switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Hou said that although formal diplomatic ties between the
Republic of China and South Africa will soon be terminated,
substantive relations can still be strengthened for mutual benefit.
"I hope you'll help reinforce friendship and civilian exchanges
between our two countries in years ahead," he added.</P>
      <P>Alexander presented a plaque to Hou to express his appreciation,
while Hou gave a necktie to Alexander as a souvenir.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE DEALERS WANT LEGAL PRESCRIPTION RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 10,000 owners and operators of
traditional Chinese medicine stores around the island took it to the
streets on Monday to demand legitimate prescription rights and the
establishment of a national university of traditional Chinese
medicine.</P>
      <P>The protesters, who marched from Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to
the Legislative Yuan, argued that although the government rules that
medical prescription is a profession requiring certification and
approval by a national examination, there is no department of
traditional Chinese medicine in any university in Taiwan, and no
national university of traditional Chinese medicine to provide
professional training for potential traditional Chinese medicine
pharmacists.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, the government has ceased related
national examinations for traditional Chinese medicine dealers since
1970, depriving them of rights and relevant privileges, including the
right to prescribe.</P>
      <P>Currently, only doctors of traditional Chinese medicine or stores
selling traditional Chinese medicines which have at least one
pharmacist on their payrolls are legally allowed to prescribe.</P>
      <P>At the Legislative Yuan, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator
Chiu Chuei-chen suggested that the government revise the
Pharmaceuticals Law to enable owners and operators of traditional
Chinese medicine stores who have engaged in the trade during the last
five years to receive a certain period of pharmaceutical-related
training to allow them the right of prescription.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chan Chi-hsien, director general of the cabinet-level
Department of Health, asserted that medical prescription requires
professional expertise and education and that he does not think the
rash awarding of prescription rights to traditional Chinese medicine
dealers is beneficial to the long-term interests of consumers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE HOPES 1998 WILL BE BETTER FOR SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  29  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong hopes 1998 will be better than 1997 for Singapore,
despite the economic problems in the region which will spill over
into the new year.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters after a scholarship awards ceremony on
Sunday, he said, the Chinese always say next year will be better.</P>
      <P>"We certainly hope so, but the regional problems are not going to
go away in a hurry. That is not necessarily a bad thing because it
will remind Singaporeans of what sort of environment we live in.</P>
      <P>"It will help us pull together and have the right instincts, not
just cruise, but to fly straight and level for some time to come."</P>
      <P>Lee also hoped that the events of 1997 had taught Singaporeans
some important lessons.</P>
      <P>"It has been a very eventful year. Many things have happened --
events which I think we will remember for a very long time," he said.</P>
      <P>One of these events was the impact on Singapore-Malaysia
relations after Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew made his comments on
Johor being "notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings."</P>
      <P>The remarks sparked an onslaught of condemnations in Malaysia
against Singapore, which continued even after Lee apologized publicly
for what he had said in a court document.</P>
      <P>The episode showed how delicate relations with neighbors could
be.</P>
      <P>The deputy prime minister also cited the haze from uncontrollable
wildfires as an event that was "not just a one-off problem but shows
how interrelated the regional communities are."</P>
      <P>He singled out the regional currency crisis as bearing the most
important lessons for Singapore, even though Singaporeans did not
feel the impact directly.</P>
      <P>The currency meltdown, he said, showed once again "how vulnerable
we are, and how fragile prosperity is."</P>
      <P>"People think that prosperity is solid and lasts forever, but
actually things can go wrong really quickly. And even when it goes
wrong elsewhere it can also affect us," he said.</P>
      <P>He also cited the crash of SilkAir flight MI-185 as one of this
year's sobering events.</P>
      <P>Singaporeans would remember these events for a long time, he
said.

    <HEADLINE>LATIN AMERICA ENDING 1997 IN GOOD HEALTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The economies of Latin American and
Caribbean countries are ending 1997 with their best results in 30
years, with growth near 5.5 percent and 11 percent inflation,
according to reports of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Though turbulence in Asia will almost certainly lower growth by
several percentage points next year, the region as a whole is now
much better equipped to deal with external shocks.</P>
      <P>"Latin America went up a steep learning curve in the 1980s; in
the 1990s its policymakers have shown they can react quickly and
effectively. No one was sitting around watching as the impact of the
Asian situation rolled toward them," Gert Rosenthal, executive
secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (ECLAC), was quoted by the WTO report as saying.</P>
      <P>The most evident effect of market turbulence would be a drop in
the flow of foreign capital to Latin America and deteriorating terms
of trade.</P>
      <P>This year, the region sucked in US$73.5 billion in foreign
investment, accumulating reserves of US$13 billion. But unlike the
early 1990s, most was in direct investment, bonds and medium-term
bank loans. Foreign direct investment was an unprecedented US$44
billion; Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic each
attracted record sums.</P>
      <P>The regional current account deteriorated sharply. For 1997, the
deficit was US$60 billion, an average 3 percent of gross domestic
product, up from US$35 billion last year.</P>
      <P>The main factor, the WTO report noted, was the return to the
usual pattern of trade, with imports growing faster at 18 percent,
than exports, up 11 percent.</P>
      <P>Export growth was well above the 7 percent growth forecast for
world trade. But Latin America's overall trade deficit soared from
US$8 billion last year to US$28 billion for 1997, with "spectacular"
increases in the deficits of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.</P>
      <P>Brazil was the only one of the three with a deficit in the
current account above 4 percent, but seven other countries, including
Chile and Peru, were also running deficits in that region.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major companies in Australia are facing
the prospects of higher funding costs in 1998 as they gear up to
refinance A$12 billion in corporate debt because of the exodus of
Japanese lenders from the country, according to a survey by the
Australian Financial Review released on Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey, compiled by respected Hong Kong-based debt markets
newsletter Basis Point, shows banks are predicting that loan margins
on syndicated debt facilities will rise for the first time in four
years because of the impact of the exodus of Japanese lenders from
the Australian market.</P>
      <P>The Japanese lenders, which have traditionally bailed out
Australian companies, are pulling out from Australia due to their own
financial problems at home.</P>
      <P>The prospect of higher funding costs will create a double bind
for Australian companies already bracing for slower economic growth
as a result of the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>For some Australian companies, the recent depreciation of the
Australian dollar against the US currency will cause additional
difficulties, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar has now dropped to less than 66 US cents
from 75 US cents in the past few months.</P>
      <P>The Australian corporate borrowers are preparing to refinance
about A$12 billion of debt next year, much of it denominated in the
US dollar, according to the survey.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Big corporations from Taiwan are expected
to compete with those from Europe and the United States in bargain
hunting for distressed Asian firms in the wake of the regional
economic crisis, according to the Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Taipei, Bruce Cheesman reported that European
and US investors face tough competition from Taiwan in the hunt for
bargains in Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea in the wake of the
currency meltdown.</P>
      <P>"Asia's sale of the century is perfect timing for a government
seeking to boost its regional investment. Taiwan's 'go south' policy,
aimed at forcing local companies to break their growing dependence on
China, is a key economic goal for 1998 following fears in Taipei of a
devaluation in China's currency," Australia's leading financial daily
reported.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Taiwan firms have a head start in
Southeast Asia over US and European companies and potential rivals
from Singapore and Hong Kong because Taiwan is already the second
biggest investor in Association of Southeast Asian Nations member
countries, behind Japan, with a total investment of about US$28
billion.</P>
      <P>In another article, the daily reported US and European companies
are queuing in a buying spree for distressed firms in Japan, Korea,
and Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Australian companies are not joining the rush
because it would be very costly for them to buy these distressed
companies after the Australian currency depreciated sharply against
the US dollar.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEVERAL THEORIES ON WHAT CAUSED SILKAIR MI-185 CRASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten days after the SilkAir flight MI-185
crash near Palembang, Indonesia, the cause is still a mystery.</P>
      <P>There have been conflicting reports which have given rise to
several theories on what happened moments before the crash on the
afternoon of Dec. 19.</P>
      <P>Here are a few:</P>
      <P>-- The plane was heading back towards Palembang before it
crashed.</P>
      <P>Indonesian officials said eyewitnesses on the ground saw it
turning back. They also believed that a change in course had been
picked up by radar. But no evidence was found to support this.</P>
      <P>SilkAir said the plane was on course when it disappeared from the
radar screens.</P>
      <P>-- A catastrophic mechanical problem or engine failure:</P>
      <P>Chief Indonesian investigator Prof. Oetarjo Diran said the
evidence showed this could have been the cause.</P>
      <P>But SilkAir officials said nothing, even sabotage, could be ruled
out.</P>
      <P>Brig. Gen. Ryamizard, the chief-of-staff of the South Sumatra
Military Command, who is overseeing search operations, believes the
pilot sensed something was wrong and decided to turn back to land in
Palembang.</P>
      <P>Interviews with villagers who witnessed the crash backed this up,
he said.</P>
      <P>But last week, Singapore Airlines (SIA) Chairman S. Dhanabalan
said the Indonesian authorities had denied that there was any
evidence to conclude there was mechanical failure.</P>
      <P>-- An explosion or explosions:</P>
      <P>None of the officials has ruled out this possibility, because of
the state of the mangled aircraft pieces found, and the fact that not
only has no intact body been found, but most body parts picked up
were little more than fragments.</P>
      <P>A source quoted a Singapore team member as saying, "It looked
like it had rained flesh and debris."</P>
      <P>Villagers near the crash site also said they had heard
explosions.</P>
      <P>And the three senior pilots interviewed said that a bomb, rather
than engine problems, would be a more likely cause of such
explosions. They believe sabotage is involved although Indonesian
officials have ruled out this possibility.</P>
      <P>The pilots pointed out that, even if one jet engine explodes or
drops off, an aircraft can still fly on the other engine and land.</P>
      <P>And if a whole wing drops off or if the plane is ripped into two,
the aircraft goes down fast but, even then, a pilot can still send
out a distress signal.</P>
      <P>-- A hijacking:</P>
      <P>A hijacker could also have prevented a distress signal being sent
out, according to some official reports.</P>
      <P>In the midst of the speculation, SIA senior public affairs
manager Rick Clements said that nothing could be ascertained until
the investigation into the crash was completed.</P>
      <P>This could take weeks, and possibly months, he said.</P>
      <P>Technically, the 10-month-old Boeing 737-300 jet was in top
condition. It had passed a thorough check only 10 days earlier,
SilkAir said.</P>
      <P>Its after-flight reports by pilots showed it had an enviable
record, with no blemishes.</P>
      <P>The Singapore authorities have also described the crash as
puzzling -- as there was no distress signal, no bad weather or
mountainous terrain.</P>
      <P>There is also another discrepancy between reports from Indonesia
and Singapore.</P>
      <P>At least one report has said that at 5:13 p.m., just before
flight MI-185 lost radio contact, it had asked Jakarta for permission
to switch to Singapore air traffic control.</P>
      <P>But Singapore authorities said the aircraft was still under
Indonesian air traffic control when it disappeared from their radar.</P>
      <P>The key could lie in the black boxes. But only the flight data
recorder, which tracks such things as altitude, speed and direction,
has been found.</P>
      <P>Still missing is the other box, the cockpit voice recorder which
records radio transmissions and sounds in the cockpit, such as
pilots' voices and engine noises.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS SAY MAINLAND CHINA WILL BE AFFECTED BY ASIAN FINANCIAL STORM</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will eventually be affected
by the financial turmoil that is sweeping East
Asia, and the country's exports will suffer most, a recent survey
has disclosed.</P>
      <P>The survey sponsored by the China Information Press and conducted
in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and some other major cities
in mainland China, showed that up to 55 percent of the 100 stock
market commentators questioned believe the mainland will eventually
be affected by the East Asian monetary crisis -- 10 percent more than
those who think the country will remain unaffected.</P>
      <P>The main points of the survey are as follows:</P>
      <P>* Fifty-four percent of the interviewees believe the mainland's
economic condition in 1998 will be somewhat the same as this year; 34
percent think it will improve, while 12 percent think it will be
worse.</P>
      <P>* Fifty-five percent believe the monetary circulation in 1998
will be similar to that of this year, with 42 percent holding that it
will be looser and 3 percent predicting it will be tighter.</P>
      <P>* Fifty-nine percent forecast the mainland's stock markets in
1998 will be slow and bullish; 19 percent think it will be slow and
bearish; while 5 percent and 1 percent, respectively, think it will
be a fast bear or bull market.</P>
      <P>* The majority of the respondents said they think business
performance will be the same this year, with a slightly smaller
number forecasting better performance and only a few predicting it
will be worse.</P>
      <P>* Seventy percent speculated that the difference in performance
levels of mainland enterprises with securities on the stock markets
will be wider than in 1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MULLING MEASURES TO COPE WITH CHANGES IN SOUTH KOREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew called a closed-door
high-level meeting on Monday to discuss measures to cope with the
changing political and economic climate in South Korea.</P>
      <P>It was the first time senior government officials had met to mull
the future of relations between the Republic of China and South Korea
since veteran opposition leader Kim Dae-jung was elected the next
South Korean president on Dec. 19.</P>
      <P>Taipei-Seoul relations have remained at a low ebb since the two
countries cut diplomatic ties in August 1992. Kim is the first
opposition leader to win a South Korean presidential election in more
than 40 years, and South Korea is being plagued by a financial
crisis, prompting Siew to direct relevant government agencies to
forecast possible developments in future Taipei-Seoul relations and
to hammer out effective measures to protect Taiwan from being hit by
fallout from South Korea's current financial and economic woes.</P>
      <P>Monday's meeting was attended by Ding Mou-shih, secretary general
of the National Security Council, who once served as the ROC
ambassador to South Korea; Ying Chung-wen, director of the National
Security Bureau; Minister of Foreign Affairs Jason Hu; Minister of
Transportation and Communications Tsay Jaw-yang; Peng Tsoy-kuei,
chairman of the Council of Agriculture; Hu Chin-piao, chairman of the
Atomic Energy Council; and finance and economics officials.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the participants exchanged views on a range
of issues, including bilateral governmental and trade ties, as well
as air links, a Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) plan to ship low-grade
nuclear waste to North Korea for permanent disposal, and other
related topics.</P>
      <P>Finance and economics officials are worried that the drastic
depreciation of the Korean won will further widen Taiwan's trade
deficit with South Korea, which reached US$2.39 billion in the first
11 months of this year. The officials fret that the current trade
imbalance between the two countries may worsen to become structural
or permanent, in much the same way as the Taiwan-Japan trade deficit
has become over the years.</P>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade and the semi-official China External
Trade Development Council have drafted comprehensive plans to help
local business people promote sales to South Korea. But trade
promoters say these measures may not be enough to bring about
favorable results, as the new South Korean president will not assume
office until next February, and many Korean people will be reluctant
to enter into new business contracts until the new government has
been sworn in.</P>
      <P>The ROC cut direct air links with South Korea shortly after Seoul
switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in August,
1992. South Korea has repeatedly called for the resumption of such
links, but the ROC government has made it clear that direct air links
will be resumed only on an equal and reciprocal basis. "South Korea
must respect our national dignity and sovereignty," a Foreign
Ministry official stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, observers have said the prospects for Taipower
shipping its low-grade nuclear waste to North Korea for permanent
disposal have become gloomier following Kim Dae-jung's election. Kim
is known to have strongly opposed the Taipower-Pyongyang deal.
Another hurdle is that cash-hungry North Korea cannot afford to build
a special dump to accommodate the radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew has ordered the Atomic Energy Council and
state-owned Taipower to strictly abide by international regulations
in handling the issue. Before Taipower confirms that North Korea has
built the specialized nuclear dump, the council is unlikely to begin
screening the cross-border nuclear waste shipment application.</P>

      <P>Efforts by the Taipei City government to
protect teenagers have been effective, as can be seen from statistics
released by the Taipei City Police Headquarters which show that the
number of teenage criminals prosecuted for violent crimes fell to 520
in the February-November period of this year, down 153 from the same

      <P>The tallies show that the number of teenagers prosecuted for

year ago, while the number of prosecutions for drug use remained at
485, the same level as the ten-month period of last year.</P>
      <P>The 14 police precincts in Taipei launched a collective campaign
in February to persuade teenagers to stay away from late-night
attractions such as pubs, tea houses, bowling allies and pool halls,
conducting late-night raids and detaining youths at police stations.</P>
      <P>In the ten-month period, a total of 22,405 youths were detained
by police authorities in this manner, 14,828 of whom were found to be
innocent, 7,493 of whom were recorded as being delinquents and 84 of
whom were fined or sent to local district youth courts for violating
the Statute for the Maintenance of Social Order.</P>
      <P>In addition, a total of 584 business owners were prosecuted or
investigated for running unlicensed businesses or providing illegal
services targeted towards youths, while an additional 67 shops were
punished by having their water and electricity supplies cut in the
10-month campaign, the tallies indicate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIG RAISES FUND TO INVEST IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American International Group (AIG), the
largest US insurer, has raised US$1.53 billion for an infrastructure
fund to invest in Asia, according to reports of the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization (WTO) Monday.</P>
      <P>The announcement follows increased efforts by AIG, which has
extensive international operations, to sustain its activities in
Malaysia, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is resisting demands
by trade negotiators that foreign insurers be allowed to keep all
their investments in the country.</P>
      <P>The announcement appears to signal that the company, based in New
York but with its roots in mainland China, wants to emphasize its
support for Asian economies.</P>
      <P>AIG is sponsoring the fund, while GIC Infrastructure, an
investment affiliate of the government of Singapore, will be the
principal investor. It will be managed by a Bermuda partnership owned
by subsidiaries of AIG and GIC.</P>
      <P>AIG said a total of 17 institutional investors had made
commitments to the fund. "There is continuing appreciation that the
future growth of the Asian economies will depend to a significant
degree on infrastructure development," Hank Greenberg, chairman of
AIG, was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>He added that the "substantial" commitment reaffirmed the
confidence of AIG and other institutional investors in Asia's
long-term growth prospects, the WTO report added.</P>
      <P>The fund will be put into equity and convertible debt
infrastructure investments, with more than half of the fund invested
in mainland China and India. The balance will go to some of the
countries that have been worst hit by the recent currency turmoil,
including Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>AIG launched a similar Asian infrastructure fund three years ago
that raised US$1.1 billion and is now nearly fully invested. Many of
the investors in the first fund are repeating their commitment in the
new venture.</P>
      <P>The Emerging Markets Partnership, an asset manager based in
Washington, will be the main investment adviser. It is chaired by
Moeen Qureshi, a former prime minister of Pakistan, while the
managing partner is Donald Roth, a former treasurer of the World Bank
and chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A three-in-one card that will combine the
functions of the national identification card, driver's license and
health insurance card will replace the three separate items by 1999.</P>
      <P>The Task Force on Information Development under the Executive
Yuan has assigned the responsibility for convening the meetings on
the design and functions of the cards, which will feature a tiny
integrated circuit, to the Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission.</P>
      <P>Present at the meetings will be representatives from the Ministry
of the Interior, Department of Health, National Health Insurance
Bureau and Institute for Information Industry.</P>
      <P>The task force also said in its report to the Executive Yuan that
the card's functions might be expanded so it could be used for cash
withdrawals.</P>
      <P>The first IC cards are scheduled to make their debut next year
for a trial period of six months to one year. If they work well, the
multi-function cards should be prevalent around the island by 1999.</P>
      <P>The task force said the reason for switching to IC cards is to
take advantage of new information and communications technology and
that the new cards will also help the establishment of computerized
government services, thus promoting efficiency.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui met here on Monday
with Gunther Winkler, the first president of the Vienna-based
Institute of Chinese Culture, extending a warm welcome to the
Austrian visitor.</P>
      <P>Lee said during the meeting that Winkler is one of the Republic
of China's best friends, noting that the professor has been helping
promote Taipei-Vienna relations for more than a decade.</P>
      <P>The expert in Chinese affair has made frequent visits to Taiwan
since the 1980s. Winkler said he is very impressed with the ROC's
development in many fields such as politics and the economy.</P>
      <P>Winkler said that since the ROC has always been able to settle
the problems that it -- like every other nation in the world -- has
been beset with, there's every reason to believe that the island will
be able to cope with the challenges it will encounter in the coming
century.</P>
      <P>Lee told the Austrian scholar that the ROC's existence and
development in the international community are at all times his
primary concerns as a leader of state.</P>
      <P>"The ROC is a sovereign country, a fact that should not be
neglected by the international community," Lee said, adding that, as
a part of this community, "the ROC is also willing to contribute its
experiences in development."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's Secretary-General
John Chang dodged an opposition leader's request Monday to stand by a
bipartisan agreement to discontinue elections for the heads of
Taiwan's townships.</P>
      <P>In a courtesy call at the headquarters of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), the newly-appointed KMT secretary-general
told DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang that the KMT will "respect public
opinion and act in accordance with legal due process."</P>
      <P>Hsu had asked Chang to reconfirm the KMT's commitment to carry
out a bipartisan decision at the National Development Conference to
reduce the number of elections by having the heads of townships --
which exist below the county level -- appointed rather than elected.</P>
      <P>The KMT, after being trounced by the DPP in the mayoral and
county magistrate elections in November, has hinted it would
backpedal on freezing the low-level elections, which it has
traditionally dominated.</P>
      <P>Arguing that ending those local elections is not necessarily to
the KMT's disadvantage, Hsu urged the ruling party to "stick to the
commitment and carry it out."</P>
      <P>Chang said the proposed freeze is a controversial matter among
local politicians and the public at large and that the KMT will
respect public opinion and act in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>The two, however, agreed to cooperate to revise the existing
rules with the purpose of upgrading the legal status of county

      <P>The government is making more moves to urge
the chemical giant Bayer AG not to abandon its planned large
investment project in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), said Monday that Premier Vincent Siew is sending
a personal appeal to Bayer headquarters in Germany, expressing his
warm welcome to the toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) plant Bayer had
planned to establish in central Taiwan's Taichung County before
suspending the project due to opposition from area residents and
environmentalists.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks in a press conference here, noting that
CEPD Vice Chairman Y.S. Liu plans to visit Taichung Magistrate Liao
Yung-lai, hoping that the county government will send a delegation to
Germany to learn of Bayer's environmental protection record.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that according to figures from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs the Bayer plant would be the fourth largest
investment project on the island, and that it would be not only a
capital-concentrated investment but also one that would transfer a
variety of advanced technologies and expertise in the chemical
industry to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bayer is one of only five companies in the world capable of
producing TDI. The chemical giant had planned to invest NT$50 billion
(US$1.5 billion) to build a TDI plant in the vicinity of Taichung
Harbor as a part of its effort to make inroads into Asian markets.</P>
      <P>The CEPD leader told the press that the premier has in his letter
expressed his regret over Bayer's decision to suspend its Taiwan
investment and the government's determination that the plan will be
realized on the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1998 ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR TAIWAN SHOULD BE ADJUSTED DOWNWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government agency and private sector
projections for Taiwan's 1998 economic growth are too optimistic, two
university professors said in a seminar on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chengchi University Professor Yin Nai-ping and Taiwan University
Professor Liu Yi-lu said that influenced by the worldwide financial
shakeup, Taiwan's economic growth in 1998 will be one or two
percentage points lower than government projections.</P>
      <P>At the seminar, titled "Prospects for the Taiwan Economy Amid
Asian Financial Turmoil" and sponsored by the Chung-Hua Institution
for Economic Research, Yin said that the government's Council for
Economic Planning and Development predicted that the Taiwan economy
will grow by 6.72 percent next year, while the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research predicted 6.46 percent growth and the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research predicted 6.37 percent growth.</P>
      <P>Forecasts for Taiwan's economy made by foreign organizations,
however, are not as optimistic, he said, citing that the United
Nations predicted 5.25 percent growth and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development predicted 5.6 percent growth.</P>
      <P>Yin said that with its sound fundamentals, Taiwan has the ability
to weather the regional financial storm. However, Taiwan's exports,
which account for 80 percent of its Gross National Product, will be
buffeted by the worldwide economic slowdown. Yin gave this as the
reason for his evaluation that economic growth predictions for Taiwan
should be adjusted one or two percentage points downward for next
year.</P>
      <P>Liu said that most international economic research organizations
have adjusted downward their economic growth forecasts for countries
around the world. As Taiwan's economy cannot survive the global
economic sluggishness undamaged, the island will post at best a 5
percent economic growth for next year, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Tuesday
that the Republic of China government will not use the resumption of
aviation exchanges as a bargaining chip with South Korea in future
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Hu said the basic stance of the ROC government toward the issue
is to protect national interests and that it is hard to assess the
matter at present, as the two countries have not yet even started
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications will
cooperate closely with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issue.</P>
      <P>The ROC suspended a bilateral aviation agreement with South Korea
on Sept. 15, 1992, banning South Korean airlines from landing in or
flying over Taiwan after that country decided to switch diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT), said on Monday that the BOFT is planning to
organize a trade promotion delegation to visit South Korea in a bid
to boost bilateral trade and commerce ties and help Taiwan businesses
to explore the South Korean market.</P>
      <P>The current financial crisis plaguing South Korea, Chen said, has
also had a serious impact on Taiwan export and import traders. The
sharp depreciation of the South Korean won has caused a shortage of
foreign currencies among South Korean companies, imposing greater
business risks for Taiwan enterprises, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen also revealed that he may lead a high-ranking trade
delegation to visit South Korea shortly after newly elected President
Kim Dae Jung's inauguration, slated for late February, to discuss a
new framework on future bilateral economic relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES LAUNCH NEW ANTI-CRIME CRACKDOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities launched a new
nationwide crackdown on crime on Tuesday as part of the government's
efforts to stem the crime rate and improve social order in the run-up
to the Jan. 24 elections for township chiefs and city and county
councilors.</P>
      <P>It was the ninth round of the ongoing anti-crime campaign since
mid-1996 aimed at creating a safe, crime-free living environment.
This was also the first large-scale crackdown since the nation's
courts reclaimed the right to detain criminal suspects.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Liao Cheng-hao said he hopes local judges
will prudently handle applications by prosecutors to detain criminal
suspects so as not to impede the anti-crime operations.</P>
      <P>Liao said although returning the right of detention to the courts
may present increased difficulties for anti-crime operations, Liao
encouraged prosecutors and police officers not to be daunted by such
hurdles.</P>
      <P>The minister said the latest crackdown indicates that the
anti-crime drive is comprehensive and incessant. "There is no
deadline, no bottom line and no ceiling for our anti-crime campaign,"
Liao said, adding that as long as law enforcement officers have
collected sufficient evidence, they can take actions in accordance
with the law.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday noon, three gang leaders targeted for arrest under
"Operation Chihping" and nine others targeted by "Operation Lightning
Speed" had been arrested.</P>
      <P>Liao said he is convinced that relevant judges will make the
right decision on whether any of them should be kept in custody or
even sent to the offshore Green Island jail for detention.</P>
      <P>The minister said Tuesday's crackdown is also aimed at deterring
gangsters from trying to use money or violence to influence the Jan.
24 grassroots elections.</P>
      <P>Liao said the last islandwide crackdown on Nov. 14 had helped
make the Nov. 29 mayoral and county magistrate elections the least
violent balloting in the past decade.</P>
      <P>Liao further said the government is determined to eradicate
organized crime and wipe out illegal firearms. Any person who turns
in his or her illegal firearms before Feb. 25 will be exempted from
any penalties under an amnesty.</P>
      <P>Under the newly revised firearms control law, people who
illegally possess guns, knives or ammunition will receive far harsher
sentences than before. Liao urged those who illegally possess
firearms to voluntarily turn in their weapons to law enforcement
authorities before the deadline. "Firearms are a priority target of
the current anti-crime campaign," he added.</P>
      <P>Liao further said the Ministry of Justice is likely to direct law
enforcement units to launch another nationwide crackdown on violent
or organized crime and illegal firearms before the Lunar New Year
holiday in late January.</P>
      <P>Among the arrested gangsters were Cheng Jen-kun, head of the
Shihwufen Gang; Chen Chung-hsien, head of the Ta-An Club under the
Providence Gang; and Lai Tze-tung, head of the Wenlin Gang. All were
accused of having engaged in firearms trafficking, extortion,
intimidation and other criminal activities.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,000 police officers, 400 military police officers
and 100 Bureau of Investigation agents joined Tuesday's anti-crime
campaign.</P>

      <P>Beijing's "big nation" maneuvering is

Affairs Council (MAC), on Monday.</P>
      <P>Sheu added that Taipei is evaluating the potential effect of this
situation upon future talks across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As witnessed by the impending establishment of formal diplomatic
relations between mainland China and South Africa, set for Jan. 1,
1998, Beijing is using its strategic advantages to mount an offensive
against Taiwan, including attempts to constrict Taipei's presence in
the international community and forcing Taipei to accept the "one
China" principle, Sheu remarked.</P>
      <P>Sheu also noted that this situation is worthy of close attention,
and that Taipei will assess its effect upon political negotiations
between the two sides when such talks get under way.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taipei recognizes the Beijing government has
been a political entity since 1949, Sheu expressed hope that mainland
officials will treat Taiwan pragmatically and understand that
Taipei's actions in the international community do not arise out of

      <P>An investment newsletter said in its latest
issue that while almost all Asian tigers are in turmoil, one is still
kicking.</P>
      <P>That is Taiwan, whose economy remains bullish, Strategic
Investment said in its December 1997 issue. In fact, it noted,
prospects in Taiwan look so good that the government has had to
revise its GDP growth forecasts for 1997 upward for the third time
last month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan said its growth will reach 6.72 percent for this year, and
slow only slightly to 6.4 percent in 1998, the monthly newsletter
added.</P>
      <P>Continued domestic consumer demand, coupled with growing
industrial output and wise management of the economy means that "this
Asian Tiger isn't just a paper one," Strategic Investment said.</P>
      <P>In another report, the monthly pointed out that the most
uncorrupt and economically free countries are the ones least affected
by the regional crisis, with Singapore being the best model, followed
by Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is most likely to move toward the Singapore model and
flourish, Dr. Jack Wheeler said in a "Behind the Lines" report for
the newsletter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, The Globe and Mail reported Monday that Taiwan's index
of leading economic indicators posted its biggest gain this year in
November, suggesting the economy will keep chugging along even as
other Asian nations teeter on the edge of recession.</P>

(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US economists are split on how the
current Asian financial crisis will affect the US economy in 1998,
according to The Wall Street Journal on Monday.</P>
      <P>Optimists, who prevail among mainstream economists, argue that
Asia's problems are a well-timed piece of bad news, a much needed
brake-tapping to America's economic juggernaut. By cooling demand for
US exports, they say, the Asian turmoil reduces the odds of a new
burst of inflation or a recession induced by a Federal Reserve
interest-rate boost. Much like the 1987 stock market crash, it could
turn out to be a pause that refreshes.</P>
      <P>But, the Journal said in a frontpage story, a growing minority of
economists -- and, privately, some US government officials -- are
beginning to worry that the rosy forecasts rely too heavily on old
equations that miss new realities of the global marketplace. The
economy is acting in ways never before seen by economists trained in
postwar America.</P>
      <P>The very fact that inflation is falling despite an unemployment
rate below 5 percent suggests that the old models are old hat. So
does the fact that the bursting of a real estate bubble in Bangkok,
Thailand, was able to trigger a chain reaction that temporarily shook
the US stock market.</P>
      <P>The upbeat consensus forecast certainly has its logic, the
Journal said. Despite the rhetoric about globalization, the US still
has a highly insular economy. Just 11 percent of gross domestic
product comes from exports, and less than 10 percent of exports go to
the most troubled Asian nations.</P>
      <P>While overseas business is bound to slip a bit as Asian growth
slows, demand at home -- from both consumer spending and corporate
investment -- remains surprisingly strong. The consensus:
Inflation-adjusted GDP growth next year will be a healthy 2.5
percent, even though held down about half a percentage point, mostly
by lost export sales.</P>
      <P>Absent the Asian crisis, these forecasters contend, the Federal
Reserve would have raised interest rates and probably caused the same
slowing of the economy anyway.</P>
      <P>But the pessimists note that even in normal times, forecasters
are lousy at predicting economic turning points and are likely to do
even worse when the old rules are in flux. Moreover, forecasting
models tend to be built on assumptions that people behave rationally,
but actual events are often driven by waves of irrationality. And
such waves worry the pessimists.</P>
      <P>Still-unknown pieces of the story: how long the crisis will last
and how far it will spread among developing countries. It raced from
Thailand to Indonesia to South Korea. And nervous speculation has, in
recent weeks, circled Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Russia, Ukraine and
Brazil.</P>
      <P>A year ago, the Journal said, investors in the United States and
elsewhere viewed "emerging" markets as a hot place to invest. Now,
many are getting out, causing currencies to fall and interest rates
to rise in those markets.</P>
      <P>Another shock, such as a Korean default, could cause more
currency drops and rate increases, pushing up capital costs and
slowing growth in much of the developing world. The US economy would
be much more powerfully affected because developing countries
together absorb about one-fourth of American exports.</P>
      <P>Worsening matters still more could be a turn toward protectionism
and isolationism in the United States and economists predict that a
flood of cheaper Asian imports will widen the US trade deficit by
more than a third over the next couple of years to as much as US$300
billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDY OF ENDANGERED SOCOTRA CORMORANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Riyadh,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Yang I-feng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A team of bird experts from the National
Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development of Saudi Arabia
(NCWCE) and animal research groups are currently undertaking a field
study of the bird species Socotra cormorant which are threatened with
extinction.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the commission said the study group, which also
includes experts from the Taif-based National Wildlife Research
Center and the Jubail Wildlife Sanctuary , will try to find out more
about the current state of the rare birds and evolve a mechanism for
protecting them.</P>
      <P>The team will collect information about the reproduction habits
of the birds and identify factors that pose a threat to them.</P>
      <P>He said the Socotra cormorants, which were quite common in the
Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea and the Arabian Gulf, in recent years
became very rare, and only nine pairs were registered in the world.
He said as a result of their sudden disappearance, the birds were put
on the red list of endangered species.</P>
      <P>The spokesman recalled that the commission, in collaboration with
other national organizations and European wildlife protection groups,
did much to save this type of bird from the dangers of Gulf oil
pollution in the past. The birds were rehabilitated and were
released. On these occasions, about 120 pairs of the birds were
counted on Kreen Island in the northern Arabian Gulf.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THAI PROSTITUTE TESTED HIV POSITIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prostitute from Thailand who was arrested
in Yungho, Taipei County, earlier this month, has been tested HIV
positive, police reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Samphoa Anchacee, 26, arrived in Taipei on Oct. 7 with a tourist
visa for the stated purpose of visiting relatives in Taiwan, police
said, adding that Anchacee began to engage in prostitution on Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>She provided sexual services to more than 60 local men before she
was nabbed at a hostel in Yungho on Dec. 13, police said.</P>
      <P>Anchacee, who managed to acquire her visa through a fallacious
marriage with a local man, told police that she received five to six
clients a day at two hostels in Yungho.</P>
      <P>Police urged local men who had solicited sexual services in the
Yungho area in recent weeks to undergo blood tests in order to
determine whether they have contracted HIV, the virus that causes the
deadly AIDS. Police suspect that the Thai prostitute had been
infected with HIV before she came to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Anchacee will be repatriated early next month together with 14
other foreign prostitutes arrested in late November and early
December in the greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>The 14 prostitutes were all connected with the now disbanded Lily
sex ring. Police confirmed on Monday that one of those prostitutes
has also been tested HIV positive.</P>
      <P>The Lily sex ring collapsed after two large-scale crackdowns by
law enforcement authorities. Scores of people involved in the Lily
operations, including hostel operators, taxi drivers, bodyguards,
restaurant owners and other sex brokers, have been arrested.</P>
      <P>Police said the recently busted Yungho sex joint was not part of
the Lily ring. They said further investigations will be made so that
all accomplices may be brought to justice.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday
presided over the opening of the Taipei Sexual Assault Prevention
Center in the Chung-Hsing Hospital.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the center will offer around-the-clock emergency
aid, medical treatment, legal advice and accommodations to those who
are victims of sexual attacks.</P>
      <P>The mayor expressed the hope that women who suffer sexual
assaults will make use of the center.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Taipei City Police Headquarters show
that a total of 219 rape cases were reported in 1996 and that 247
such cases were resolved during the same period, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that since many of the women who suffer sexual
assaults choose not to report the attacks, the real number of rapes
in Taipei might reach 2,500 per year. The city government and related
agencies will make more efforts to reduce the incidence of rape, he
asserted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST ENTERPRISES SHOW LITTLE FAITH IN APROC PROJECT: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most local and foreign enterprises have
little faith in the government's project to build Taiwan into an
Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Center (APROC), the Strategic
Advancement Alliance said on Tuesday, citing the results of a recent
survey.</P>
      <P>The Strategic Advancement Alliance said that it sent 1,000
questionnaires to enterprises in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park, the air cargo carriers and shipping companies in Taipei, the
Taiwan offices of foreign banks and the members of the Council for
Industrial and Commercial Development between Sept. 15 and Oct. 30 to
learn their opinions on the government's ambitious project. A total
of 384 answered copies were mailed back, it said.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents, 40 percent are manufacturers, while air
cargo carriers account for 30 percent of the total. Shipping
companies make up 18.8 percent of the total respondents, and
financial organizations account for 12.5 percent.</P>
      <P>More than 66 percent of the respondents said they don't have any
faith in the government's APROC project. As high as 84 percent of
those polled expressed dissatisfaction with the overall efficiency of
the government, while 65.4 percent said that they were not satisfied
with the pace the government has taken in revising or updating
regulations to facilitate the project.</P>
      <P>In addition, half of the respondents felt that the overall
investment climate of Taiwan is not good enough to attract foreign
investors. For the respondents, the island's geographical position,
technological level and workforce quality are the only advantages it
has, while the tax and tariff systems, social order, quality of the
living environment, traffic and telecommunications, and
infrastructure in Taiwan were rated "poor" for wooing foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>The Economics Ministry is the only government agency that won
over a 50 percent approval rating from the respondents in its efforts
to help the APROC project. The Council for Economic Planning and
Development, Transportation and Telecommunications Ministry, Finance
Ministry, Government Information Office and Central Bank of China all
received less than 50 percent approval ratings for their roles in
pushing the project.</P>

(By Wang Hsin-chung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The stalemate between the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) should not be allowed
to continue, a Beijing official concerned with Taiwan affairs
remarked Monday.</P>
      <P>Beijing authorities "have made many efforts" and "are still
making efforts with good will" to promote the resumption of talks
between the two sides, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official, wishing to remain anonymous, declined to disclose
when and how will ARATS will again approach the goal.</P>
      <P>The atmosphere between Taipei and Beijing will almost inevitably
worsen in the short term since South Africa is set to transfer its
formal diplomatic relations from the former to the latter on Jan. 1.
Thus Beijing's initiatives are not likely to occur until after the
Pretoria factor gets diluted.</P>
      <P>A more auspicious time for talks between the two side to resume
would be around the Chinese lunar New Year, which in 1998 falls on
Jan. 28.</P>
      <P>Beijing's brain trust on Taiwan affairs is not ducking the
problems confronting political negotiations for the termination of
hostilities across the Taiwan Strait, the official said, stressing
the official line that such talks will be approached step by step.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan chicken farmers are preparing to
break into the potentially lucrative Hong Kong market, following an
announcement by the Hong Kong government that it will exterminate up
to 1.3 million chickens throughout the territory to stop the spread
of the "bird flu" which has killed four people there.</P>
      <P>Share prices related to the chicken raising industry surged on
the local stock market on Monday at the prospect that Taiwan's
chicken exports to Hong Kong will increase significantly as a result
of the Hong Kong government move.</P>
      <P>Charoen Pok Phand Enterprises (Taiwan), Taiwan's largest chicken
raiser and Asia's largest chicken processor, announced on Monday that
it will start exports of frozen chicken to Hong Kong within one week,
hoping to use Hong Kong as the base for a worldwide sales network.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Chicken Raising Industry Association also said that it
is planning to encourage local raisers to export frozen and processed
chicken to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>A report by the cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) shows
that there are currently about 120 million chickens in Taiwan, while
around 350 million are killed each year to meet domestic demand, an
average annual per-capita consumption of 16 chickens.</P>
      <P>According to the COA, chicken and hog raising are the two major
sectors of Taiwan's animal husbandry industry. However, the hog
raising industry has been hard-hit by an epidemic of foot-and-mouth
disease which swept the island in March, underscoring the importance
of the chicken raising industry, it noted.</P>
      <P>The COA report indicates that the annual output of the chicken
raising industry totals around NT$41.3 billion (about US$1.3
billion), accounting for 13 percent of the overall production value
of the animal husbandry sector, second only to the 28 percent
attributable to hog raising.</P>
      <P>The COA said it has already taken measures to prevent the spread
of any type of bird flu which might break out in Taiwan, in order to
avert another disaster in the local animal husbandry sector.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Consumers Foundation on Tuesday
selected the epidemic of foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease at local hog
ranches and a series of food poisoning cases reported around the
island as the top domestic consumer news events of 1997.</P>
      <P>The foundation said 1997 saw many natural calamities, as well as
disasters caused by human error or negligence. As a result, it said,
consumer confidence has often been jittery over the past year.</P>
      <P>During the year, the foundation said, consumer confidence in food
hygiene has been challenged many times. The outbreak of an FMD
epidemic in mid-March, the recent recurrence of FMD cases in some
counties, the discovery of contaminated Dreyer's ice cream products
and the repeated occurrence of mass food poisoning cases have exposed
the shortcomings in the government's animal disease control and food
administration systems.</P>
      <P>Other major consumer news events rounding out the top 10 list
selected by the foundation's directors and supervisors include:</P>
      <P>-- The collapse of Lincoln Villas in Hsichi, Taipei County in
August amid heavy rains and strong winds brought by Typhoon Winnie. A
total of 80 houses in the complex were either completely or partially
destroyed and 28 people were killed in the incident. The tragedy also
toppled local consumer confidence in houses built on hillsides.</P>
      <P>-- Problems related to illegal remodeling inside residential
houses. The safety of those residences, the legality of such
structures and the legitimate rights of house owners have attracted
much attention and caused heated debate.</P>
      <P>-- Frequent squabbling and disputes among cable television
operators, which have seriously affected consumer's rights.</P>
      <P>-- Repeated air accidents, raising concern about flight safety.</P>
      <P>-- Disputes over a children's life insurance program marketed by
the Hung Fu Life Insurance Co., which unilaterally asked all of its
policy buyers to cancel their purchase contracts.</P>
      <P>-- The explosion of gas pipelines in Kaohsiung and the lax safety
inspection procedures for liquefied petroleum gas cylinders.</P>
      <P>-- Large amounts of pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables
sold for human consumption.</P>
      <P>-- A sharp increase in the number of cases of legionnaires

      <P>The ROC Umbilical Cord Blood Bank, the

serve as a salvation to blood disease patients and anemia sufferers,
enabling them to get blood more quickly and cheaply.</P>
      <P>The umbilical cord blood bank, organized by the non-profit

maternity wards in Taipei's leading general hospitals so as to
collect fresh umbilical cord blood, which is rich in the "stem cells"

researcher from the foundation.</P>
      <P>Once umbilical cords are collected, their blood will be
individually tested in the blood bank so as to sort the product
according to its type of human lymphocyte antigen and ready it for
service, said the researcher.</P>
      <P>The specialized blood bank will eventually cultivate its own stem
cells, using a system that will grow them from original stem cells
collected from fresh umbilical cord blood.</P>
      <P>The birth cords to be used for umbilical cord blood collection
will all be obtained from mothers, who will be asked to sign a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Asian students studying in Auckland from
Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and other countries are
paying fees to retired police officers from Hong Kong and New Zealand
for round-the-clock protection from triads.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Auckland, the Australian Associated Press
(AAP) reported the trouble-shooting scheme run by Campus Services is
based on a Canadian university scheme designed to stop unaccompanied
or overseas students from being preyed on by organized crime,
particularly the Hong Kong-based 14K triad.</P>
      <P>For a payment of NZ$58 (US$34) a week, the service provides
regular visits and 24-hour contact for students throughout New
Zealand, according to the AAP.</P>
      <P>One founding member, identified as Yuet Heung Che, who served
with the former Royal Hong Kong Police for more than 10 years, said
the service helps in such areas as disputes, assaults and
victimization.</P>
      <P>Che said recent incidents that resulted in some students being
sent back to Asia for gang-related misconduct had prompted the
establishment of the service.</P>
      <P>He said the service has just been launched and advertised in
Auckland, the biggest city in New Zealand, a popular destination for
people emigrating from Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said his company will launch marketing promotions in Taiwan
and Hong Kong to attract business.</P>
      <P>Another founding member, a New Zealander who did not want to be
named, said the service would act as a "go-between" troubleshooter.</P>
      <P>"The service starts by picking students up at the airport and
helping them settle down. Whenever trouble occurs, we will be on the
scene," the AAP quoted him as saying.</P>
      <P>"If required, regular written reports will be provided for
parents residing in other countries," he added.</P>
      <P>Overseas students will be encouraged to take part in outdoor
activities such as fishing rather than hanging around in karaoke
bars, the New Zealand police officer said.</P>
      <P>The AAP reported thousands of secondary and tertiary students
come to New Zealand each year without their parents to study, and
that hundreds of the children of immigrants are left at home when
their parents travel overseas for business.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government will soon
introduce tough laws to prevent the burgeoning sex slave trade
between Asia and the Down Under, the Department of Justice said.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said there were between 200 and
300 sex slaves brought into Australia from Asian countries.</P>
      <P>She said Australia's proximity to Southeast Asia has made it a
key destination for young women procured to work in the sex industry.</P>
      <P>She said the new laws are necessary because the current
legislation in place deals with people who have been kidnapped and
forced into the sex industry but does not cover those who come to
Australia voluntarily and turn to prostitution.</P>
      <P>The new laws will be submitted to parliament in the next few
months, Vanstone said.</P>
      <P>"Girls as young as 13 and teenagers are being brought to
Australia under the ruse of paying off a family debt and getting

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTRY PROBING JAPANESE RAMMING OF TAIWAN FISHING BOAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
is looking into allegations that a Taiwan fishing boat was cornered
and rammed by a Japanese patrol boat while it was operating in waters
near the Tiaoyutai Islands on Sunday night.</P>
      <P>The Suao-based fishing vessel, the Yungsheng No. 106, was
reportedly rammed by a 500-ton Japanese patrol boat and had its radar
and lighting systems damaged while it was fishing in waters near the
Chihwei Islet, one of the Tiaoyutai archipelago group in the East
China Sea. None of the boat's crew were injured.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said if the allegations are found to be
true, the ROC government will register a stern protest with the
Japanese authorities for severely infringing the ROC's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MOFA immediately contacted its liaison offices in
Japan and the Ryukyu islands upon hearing the report on Monday
morning, to try to gain a better understanding of the incident, but
added that as of Tuesday evening, the MOFA had still not heard from
the Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he reiterated Taipei's sovereignty claim over the
Tiaoyutai islands, and the ROC government's determination to
safeguard the interests of Taiwan's fishermen.</P>
      <P>Wu called for Japan to exercise restraint over fishing in waters
near the Tiaoyutais, since Taiwan and Japan are currently engaged in
talks aimed at a peaceful resolution to fishing disputes in the
region.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkakus in Japan, are located
roughly halfway between Taiwan and the Japanese island of Okinawa,
and are the subject of conflicting territorial claims by Taiwan,
Japan and mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BECOMES WORLD'S 4TH LARGEST SPONSOR FOR POOR CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has emerged as the
world's fourth largest sponsor for poor children through the
promotion of the World Vision of Taiwan (WVT), Minister of Foreign
Affairs Jason Hu said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan only trails the United States, Canada and Australia in
adopting or sponsoring poor children around the world, Hu said at a
year-end tea party sponsored by the World Vision of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said the World Vision's global poor children adoption and
sponsorship program has helped the international community
understand that Taiwan is willing to share care and love with needy
families.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, WVT President Rev. Chow Lien-hwa
said the WVT is a worldwide humanitarian organization. Its Thirty
Hour Famine and Love Loaf fund-raising campaigns have become
well-known in the international community.</P>
      <P>Rev. Chow said the WVT originally gave its top priority to
helping needy children and has now expanded its concern to the
well-being of a whole community. To help boost community
development, the WVT has organized a W.V. Youth Ambassadors Program
to promote peace and love as well as to prevent conflicts.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping overseas needy children and families, the
WVT has also devoted much energy and financial resources to help
local children and indigenous people, including educational, medical
and vocational counseling.</P>
      <P>Rev. Chow expressed his gratitude for donations given by local
enterprises or ordinary citizens over past years. "Without their
contributions, the WVT couldn't have undertaken so many relief or
humanitarian programs," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA OFFERS INCENTIVES TO MIGRANTS NOT TO GO TO BIG CITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government will give
incentives to wealthy migrants by allowing them in with less than the
A$300,000 (US$196,000) normally required to qualify for a business
visa if they agree not to live in large cities like Sydney, Melbourne
or Brisbane.</P>
      <P>Under a revamped plan to push migrants into regional areas,
Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said the government was reviewing
the cut-off point for net assets but said it would not fall below
half the present amount.</P>
      <P>"There is an intense degree of interest in furthering business
migration to regional areas and lots of support from state
governments to facilitate this," he told reporters Monday.</P>
      <P>"But the federal government is conscious that these people must
have the financial capacity to succeed; that they must be able to
afford adequate accommodation and have the funds to get a business up
off the ground," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition to encouraging business migrants, Australia will
continue giving priority to skilled migrants by "making adjustments
elsewhere because ... business skills are the most beneficial part of
the immigration program," Ruddock said.</P>
      <P>Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory welcome
skilled migrants to choose their places for the settlement in
Australia. But most business migrants have settled in Sydney,
Brisbane, Gold Coast and Melbourne in recent years, he said.</P>
      <P>Official figures released this month by the Department of
Immigration show that on average, business migrants transfer about
A$447,000 from their country of origin to Australia one year after
their arrival. The amount doubles in the second year and rises to
A$1.1 million after three years.</P>
      <P>On average, business migrants employ at least four staff two
years after their arrival.</P>
      <P>Business skills intake grew to more than 5,800 in fiscal 1996-97
from 4,900 in 1995-96, while figures for the family reunion category
dropped to 37,240 from 48,700 during the same period, according to
the department.</P>
      <P>In 1996-97, Australia's migrant intake was set at 72,000, sharply
down from 99,000 in 1995-96.</P>

(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Toyota Motor Corp. has won CALSTART's
1997 Blue Sky Award for the market launch of its innovative, clean
and fuel-efficient Prius hybrid-electric car.</P>
      <P>The award is presented each year by CALSTART, a California-based
advanced transportation organization, to recognize outstanding
marketplace contributions to advanced, sustainable transportation
that cleans the air, improves energy efficiency and helps reduce
greenhouse emissions.</P>
      <P>Toyota was recognized in particular for its Prius model, which is
now selling in Japan. This, combined with the company's commitments
to three other clean fuel vehicles -- the Coaster hybrid electric
bus, the RAV4-EV electric vehicle and the announcement of the "e-com"
electric commuter car -- led to its selection as the top award winner
for 1997.</P>
      <P>"Toyota's actions are currently setting the trend globally in
clean, efficient vehicles," said CALSTART President Michael J. Gage.
"Their efforts, highlighted by their innovative hybrid system, are
redefining passenger transportation and efficiency, which are crucial
for both air pollution and global warming. We are proud to honor
these solid market commitments with our second annual award."</P>
      <P>"We are honored to accept this prestigious award from CALSTART
and its participants," said Dave Illingworth, senior vice president
and general manager of the Toyota Division of Toyota Sales USA. "We
have received much recognition lately for the innovation in our
vehicle, but this award recognizes their value to the environment as
well."</P>
      <P>Illingworth also said that the company will sell a hybrid-powered
vehicle in the United States before the end of the century.</P>
      <P>CALSTART also presented four 1997 Merit Awards to the Ballard
Power System of Vancouver, Canada; James Worden, founder of the
Massachusetts-based Solectria Corp.; SunLine Transit of Thousand
Palms, California; and the Regional Transit District of Sacramento,
California.</P>
      <P>The Blue Sky Award is specifically designed to recognize not just
leadership and innovation in technology for clean transportation but
also a significant commitment to its use. The award can go to
companies, organizations or individuals worldwide fitting the
criteria.</P>
      <P>Last year, CALSTART presented its first Blue Sky Award to General
Motors for the automaker's EVI electric vehicle launch in the

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Tuesday completed
the second reading of the Territorial Waters Bill, defining the
Republic of China's territorial waters as the area within a 12-mile
radius of the coast.</P>
      <P>The bill, which was submitted by the cabinet in 1992, also
stipulates that waters beyond 12 miles but within 24 miles of the
coast are designated the "adjacent area."</P>
      <P>Any person or subject (vessel) will be subject to arrest or
detention if they violate ROC territorial laws by illegally entering
ROC territorial waters or the adjacent area.</P>
      <P>A middle line will be drawn to demarcate any overlapping
territorial claims between the ROC and foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The bill, which will become law after passing a third reading,
falls short of including the "U-shaped waters" in the South China Sea
in the nation's territorial waters, because lawmakers deemed the area
to be "historically Chinese waters."</P>
      <P>But this doesn't necessarily mean that the ROC is giving up its
sovereignty claims over the Spratly islands in the South China Sea,
which are also claimed totally or in part by Malaysia, the
Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under the new bill, foreign ships will be allowed to pass through
ROC territorial waters so long as they pose no threat to aviation
safety, traffic, marine resources or the environment within the
waters.</P>

in Europe, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, along
with the Virgin Islands.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that during the period from January to
November, a total of 662 overseas investment applications with a

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Tuesday registered
a stern protest against South Africa over Pretoria's switching of
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing from Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The protests are against Pretoria's acknowledgment of Beijing's
"one China" assertion, which hegemonically claims that mainland China
is the only legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is an
inseparable part of the mainland Chinese territory -- lies that will
never be acceptable to the Republic of China on Taiwan, said the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said Taipei has given Pretoria a good
dressing-down over the diplomatic switch, a move showing Pretoria's
disregard for the long-term friendship between the ROC and South
Africa, and for the fact that Taiwan and mainland China are
different political entities under separate ruling systems.</P>
      <P>During a press conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on
Tuesday evening, Wu announced that the ROC is severing its formal
diplomatic relations with South Africa, effective at midnight on Dec.
31.</P>
      <P>Since Nov. 27, 1996, Taipei has repeatedly expressed grave
concerns over Pretoria's planned diplomatic switch before the end of
1997.</P>
      <P>The concerns, however, have fallen on deaf ears over the past
year, and Pretoria on Tuesday was going ahead with its plan to
establish formal ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The move has not only harmed the ROC's national dignity and hurt
the feelings of the people of Taiwan, it has also severely impaired
the traditional cordial relations between the two countries, for
which Taipei feels inexpressibly regretful, Wu added.</P>
      <P>He stressed that despite the severing of diplomatic ties with
South Africa, the ROC remains undaunted in seeking wider horizons in
the international community, and will continue striving to expand
substantive ties with more countries around the world.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China Embassy in South
Africa and its three consulates will lower their ROC national flags
on Wednesday evening and assume their new status as Taiwan liaison
offices.</P>
      <P>As Pretoria has decided to switch its diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing from the beginning of 1998, the ROC Embassy and its
consulates will be downgraded into liaison offices after that time,
according to an arrangement reached between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Timothy Yang, Directior of Foreign Ministry's African Affairs
Department, said here on Monday that the ROC Embassy in Pretoria and
its general consulates in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town will
lower their flags at 5:00 p.m. local time (11:00 p.m. Taipei time)
and change their name plaques after midnight (6:00 a.m. Thursday
Taipei time).</P>
      <P>The new ROC representative to South Africa is expected to be
named and to assume his post in January, while the three ROC general
consuls will remain in their positions after Wednesday, although
their job titles will change in line with their new status.</P>
      <P>Touching on the new relationship between Taipei and Beijing, Yang
said Taipei was unaware, and regretted that Pretoria had agreed to
use the word "recognizes" rather than "acknowledges" to indicate its
consent to Beijing's claim to Taiwan in its joint communique with
Beijing on setting up diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>While denying that the defection of South Africa to the mainland
China camp will cause a domino effect among the island's other allies
on the African continent, Yang nevertheless warned that Beijing's
attempts to isolate the ROC will not stop.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS WILL AFFECT REST OF WORLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With Japan in the grip of powerful
deflationary forces, and South Korea at the IMF's door, the rest of
the world can have no doubt now that the Asian crisis will affect
them, an influential European newspaper predicted on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Forecasters are suggesting that Western economies are in good
shape to weather the storm, and will suffer only a marginal reduction
in growth. This is probably true. But there are now significant
downside risks to this central forecast. If more countries fall
victim to the crisis, or if Japan mishandles the shakeout in its
financial sector, things could get a lot worse, the Financial Times
warned.</P>
      <P>Events in Asia affect the rest of the world through a number of
different channels. Probably the most important are financial market
contagion and the impact on trade.</P>
      <P>Little needs to be said about how financial market turbulence in
one country can trigger reactions around the world. It is worth
emphasizing, though, that while the most dramatic effects were seen
in Western markets, the more damaging and lasting effect has been to
scare investors away from the emerging markets at a time when many of
these countries need to raise foreign capital.</P>
      <P>On the trade side, weak growth will depress Asia's imports, and
devaluations will make them more competitive. Both will work to the
disadvantage of other exporters.</P>
      <P>However, in the developed Western economies at least, this effect
might not be too serious. European Union exports to Asia excluding
Japan are 7 percent of total EU exports, or 2 percent of gross
domestic product. US exports to the region are nearly 20 percent of
total US exports, but since exports make up a smaller proportion of
total GDP, their share in US GDP is roughly the same as in Europe.</P>
      <P>A cut in Asian imports would therefore only have a relatively
small effect, of the order of less than half a percentage point of US
and European GDP growth. Including Japan in the figures does not make
too much difference. There will also be a substitution effect:
Cheaper goods from Asia will encourage people to switch from domestic
to imported goods. But still, the impact on GDP is not huge.</P>
      <P>But don't relax just yet, the Financial Times said. Though the
most likely scenario is that developed world growth continues at a
healthy pace, there is now a significant risk attached to this
forecast. Events could turn nasty in two years.</P>
      <P>First, the Financial Times said, contagion could spread to other
countries. Brazil and Russia remain possible targets. There is also a
question of whether communist China will devalue in order to maintain
its position against its Asian competitors.</P>
      <P>Second, and more worrying, things could go wrong in Japan. The
collapse of Yamaichi and subsequent hints that public money might be
available to recapitalize some banks, signaled that at last, a
shakeout in the financial system may be underway. At the same time,
though, the economy is teetering on the brink of recession. The
situation is delicate, the Financial Times pointed out.</P>
      <P>"The damage to global confidence from such a scenario would dwarf
the effects of the Asian crisis so far. It might not only trigger the
long-awaited correction in Western equity markets, it could also
destroy confidence in developing country markets and in their
financial institutions. This would spread contagion far and wide, and
lead to very real effects in these economies as their financial
systems came under strain," the Financial Times added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WOULD HAVE TO DETER MILITARY ATTACK ALONE FOR TWO WEEKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Parris Chang of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said on Tuesday that Taiwan must
be able to deter military attacks from mainland China by itself for
at least for two weeks in order to give enough time for support from
the United States or Japan to reach the island.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in a speech on Taiwan's future at a
fund-raising dinner at a local hotel.</P>
      <P>The "three no" policies of the United States toward Taiwan that
were made public following the meeting between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in late October
have actually imposed restrictions on Taiwan's future, he said.</P>
      <P>The "three nos" are that the United States will not support
Taiwan's efforts to join the United Nations, Taiwan's independence or
"one China, one Taiwan," nor "two Chinas."</P>
      <P>But the DPP lawmaker added that the US side also responded
positively to his stance, conveyed during a recent visit to the
United States with DPP Chairman Hsu Shin-liang, that "Taiwan's future
should be decided by Taiwan people, not by mainland China or the
United States."</P>
      <P>Although the inclusion of the Taiwan Strait into the new security
agreement reached earlier this year between the United States and
Japan provides a great deal of protection to Taiwan, Chang stressed
that the island must be able by itself to counter military attacks
from mainland China for at least two weeks before the United States
or Japan can reach it with help.</P>
      <P>Chang said that to the best of his knowledge, the US government
does not intend to force Taipei to conduct negotiations with Beijing,
so that rumors that Washington hopes the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait can reopen negotiations in spring are not correct.</P>
      <P>Also present at the fund-raising activity were former DPP
Chairman Huang Hsin-chieh, Taoyuan County Magistrate Annette
Hsiu-lien Lu and officials of the American Institute in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SEVERS FORMAL TIES WITH RSA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Johannesburg,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By J.S. Chang &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China severed formal
relations with the Republic of South Africa on the last day of 1997,
officially terminating 22 years of diplomatic ties between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Relations between the two date back to 1905, when the predecessor
of the ROC government set up its first general consulate in South
Africa in Johannesburg. The office was upgraded to an embassy in
April 1976, when the two countries established formal diplomatic
relations.</P>
      <P>During the 22 years of formal ties, four ROC ambassadors served
as head of the embassy in Pretoria: Kuan Yung, Yang Hsi-kun, Steven
Wang and Loh I-cheng.</P>
      <P>Loh, who began serving as the last ROC ambassador in South Africa
in late 1990, experienced the most trying diplomatic era in the
African country, including turbulent changes in domestic politics,
black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela's release after 27 years in
prison, and Mandela's election in 1994 to be South Africa's first
black president.</P>
      <P>Loh helped make it possible for Mandela, in his former capacity
as leader of the black nationalist African National Congress, to
visit Taiwan in 1993, and for President Lee Teng-hui to attend
Mandela's inauguration in Pretoria the following year.</P>
      <P>After becoming president, Mandela often stressed that South
Africa would not establish formal ties with communist China at the
expense of the ROC's interests.</P>
      <P>His vow, however, was finally broken under the strain of internal
opposition, which, apparently envisaging a big slice of the business
in mainland China, pushed for Pretoria to switch diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>As a result, Mandela informed Taipei late last year that Pretoria
would establish formal ties with Beijing on Jan. 1, 1998.</P>
      <P>After 13 months of negotiations, Taipei and Pretoria reached a
consensus over future ties between the two states under a new
framework. The two sides agreed that except in matters such as
national names and flags, substantive relations between the ROC and
South Africa will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Pretoria's sealing of formal ties with Beijing, ROC
Consul General in Pretoria Feng Tai pointed out that the ROC
government and private sector have channeled some US$1.5 billion into
South Africa for various investment projects during the last two
decades. He doubted that mainland China will be capable of investing
an equivalent amount in that African country over the next 20 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOUTH AFRICAN DIPLOMAT AND HIS FAMILY LEAVE TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A South African diplomat and his family,
who were suddenly cast into the national spotlight after being taken
hostage by Taiwan's most wanted fugitive last month, left Taiwan for
South Africa on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>McGill Alexander, military attache of the South African embassy
to the Republic of China, said at northern Taiwan's CKS International
Airport that they will never forget the people of Taiwan and the
friends they have here and that they will return to the island
someday.</P>
      <P>The South African diplomat, his wife Anne and their 12-year-old
daughter Christine are returning to their homeland as diplomatic
relations between Taipei and Pretoria will be severed from Jan. 1,
1998, following Pretoria's move to switch diplomatic recognition to
Beijing. Another daughter, Melanie, left Taiwan earlier.</P>
      <P>Alexander said that being held hostage was an unpleasant
experience, but that the many letters and phone calls they received
after the ordeal have comforted them. They wanted to express
appreciation for the love and care the Taiwan people extended to them
following the hostage incident.</P>
      <P>Alexander said that Taiwan is a place they will never forget,
adding that he is sure they will come back to see their old friends
again, though he doesn't know when.</P>
      <P>Alexander, his wife, two daughters and a seven-month old baby in
their care were held at gunpoint in their Taipei residence on Nov. 18
by fugitive Chen Chin-hsing, wanted for a series of violent crimes,
including the kidnap and murder of a high school student. Alexander
and his elder daughter Melanie were shot and wounded during the
24-hour standoff, while his wife, Christine and the baby were
eventually released unharmed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Presidential Secretary-General Su Chih
said on Wednesday that Vice President Lien Chan's visit to Singapore
is purely private, calling on outsiders not to speculate over the
trip.</P>
      <P>Lien's trip to Singapore is aimed mainly at meeting with friends,
playing golf and seeing points of interest, Su said, adding that the
outside world should not complicate or politicize the matter, since
no political meetings or special itinerary have been included in his
trip.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife, daughter and Su, Lien is scheduled to
depart for Singapore on Thursday for a four-day vacation.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu also said on Tuesday that Lien's trip
to Singapore during the New Year holidays is purely private. He
denied that the purpose of Lien's Singapore trip is to clear the way
for the resumption of negotiations between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Regarding reports that Lien is scheduled to lead a delegation to
Honduras in late January to attend the inauguration of
President-elect Carlos Flores, Hu said a formal announcement on the

travel to other countries following his visit to Honduras.</P>
      <P>Hu also revealed that he will travel to Africa in late January to
preside over a meeting with representatives of the Republic of

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER MAPS MAJOR TASKS FOR 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With 1997 bowing out in a few hours to make
way for 1998, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu spelled out the
government's major tasks on the diplomatic front in the new year,
which include a new fence-mending approach to Southeast Asian
countries and introducing the concept of "BOT -- build, operate,
transfer -- diplomacy."</P>
      <P>In a year-end press conference, Hu said the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) intends to continue consolidating relations with its
diplomatic allies in the new year, while strengthening substantive
ties with countries which maintain no formal relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will also consolidate resources and influences from the
private sector to intensify the ROC's role in the international
community, and will bolster cross-Taiwan Strait diplomatic
communications.</P>
      <P>In the face of new situations in Southeast Asia as a result of
the region-wide financial upheaval, Taipei will launch a
fence-mending initiative to better ties with its Southeast Asian
neighbors, Hu said, adding that the initiative will be rich in
humanitarian, rather than political, color.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the ROC's severing of formal diplomatic relations
with South Africa on Wednesday, Hu said he does not think Pretoria's
defection to the mainland Chinese camp will cause a domino effect
among the island's other allies on the African continent or in other
regions of the globe.</P>
      <P>Hu pointed to the ROC's "blue chips" on the diplomatic front,
including Taiwan's solid economic prowess, a commendable democracy, a
strong national defensive buildup, and a hard-working and
high-caliber diplomatic corps.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's continuing attempts to contain and sabotage Taiwan
diplomatically, Hu stressed that the ROC people and government should
arm themselves with a higher-degree of confidence, saying that Taiwan
is by no means inferior to communist China in almost any aspect. For
example, he noted, Taiwan imported some US$20 billion-worth of
products from America in recent years, 1.6 times mainland China's
imports from the same source.</P>
      <P>With regard to Beijing's scheme to use business incentives to
lure Panama -- the ROC's long-time ally -- into its camp, Hu admitted
that his ministry has prepared psychologically for the worst while
making the best of the current situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu noted that in the coming year, private resources
and influences will be needed, adding that he hoped a concept of "BOT
diplomacy" will be introduced to allow private sector access to
diplomatic work through private moves such as procurement missions,
and international charity-oriented programs.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister also announced that he will leave on Jan. 5
for Senegal, where he will attend a regional ROC diplomats conference
in Africa. Fourteen ROC ambassadors and representatives in the region
are expected to take part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Owing to a tight schedule, Hu will not visit any other allied
countries on the African continent in his upcoming trip.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian dollar has suffered its
worst year since the currency was floated in 1983, and foreign
exchange dealers have forecast a full recovery in 1998 is not in
sight.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar plunged 18 percent against the US dollar in
1997, the biggest yearly fall against greenback on record.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar was worth 79.58 US cents at the start of
1997 and reached a high of 80 US cents in March, but it slid to 65 US
cents this month and settled at 65.48 US cents Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar was mainly hit by the recent financial
crisis in Asia.</P>
      <P>A worsening current account and depressed commodity prices also
have helped the local currency to drop quite dramatically, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>They are divided on the outlook of the currency in 1998, but few
of them are tipping a significant bounce back.</P>
      <P>"I don't think the outlook will improve that much next year," Tim
Moloney, currency strategist at Deutche Morgan Grenfell, said.</P>
      <P>"Asia will take a while to recover, commodity prices won't pick
up strongly and Japan is facing a recession. We see the Australian
dollar troughing at 64 US cents by March and peaking at around 68 US
cents," he said.</P>
      <P>Mark Tierney of Bankers Trust Australia is more optimistic,
saying the Australian dollar could hover between 70 and 75 US cents.</P>
      <P>"It will totally depend on how long this Asian thing hangs over
the market's head," he said.</P>
      <P>Other analysts are also divided, predicting the currency at
between 65 and 75 US cents in 1998.</P>
      <P>Australia relies heavily on commodity exports, and Japan is its
biggest trading partner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JIANG ZEMIN AGREES TO VISIT AUSTRALIA IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has in principle agreed to visit Australia some time in 1998,
reflecting a large improvement in bilateral relations between Beijing
and Canberra following strained ties in 1996.</P>
      <P>Jiang has accepted an invitation of Australia's Prime Minister
John Howard, but the timing of his visit has yet to be decided,
according to the mass circulation newspaper The Australian.</P>
      <P>Officials of the two sides are now actively negotiating about
both the timing and the substance of the visit, with expectations in
Canberra that it will occur in 1998.</P>
      <P>Jiang's visit would be the icing on the cake of a massive repair
job undertaken by the Howard government after Australia supported the
US naval deployment near Taiwan in 1996.</P>
      <P>This and other incidents -- including the visit of the Dalai Lama
to Australia, the renewed military ties between Washington and
Canberra, and the sending of a senior minister to Taipei -- strained
ties between mainland China and Australia.</P>
      <P>Howard went to visit Beijing in late March this year and his
senior ministers, including Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
Trade Minister Tim Fischer, followed suit.</P>
      <P>These visits paved the way for improving ties with mainland
China, and Beijing reciprocated by the visits of Li Ruihuan, who
ranked fourth in the mainland hierarchy, Vice Premier Chu Rongji and
other ministers.</P>
      <P>Another factor contributing to the improvement of the ties was
that Australia abandoned co-sponsorship of the human rights
resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission conference in Geneva
this year.</P>
      <P>Previously, Hu Yaobang visited Australia in 1985 when he was
general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhao Ziyang
also visited here earlier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILLENNIUM BUG SEEN DAMAGING COMPUTER SYSTEMS GLOBALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is on heightened alert in
preparation for the millennium bug, which will bite computer systems
precisely two years from now, and the stock exchange is standing
ready to force listed companies to reveal how they will protect
themselves from the expected damage.</P>
      <P>The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) warned Tuesday that failure
to prepare for the bug would hurt the country's economy and could
cost lives.</P>
      <P>International focus on the problem, known as Y2K for "Year 2000,"
is intensifying as the crunch date -- Dec. 31, 1999 -- draws nearer
and the implications of unreadiness sink in.</P>
      <P>The bug was born from a ploy by 1960s computer programmers to
save memory, when programs recorded only the last two digits of
years. This will freeze some computers when their internal clocks
change from "99" to read "00."</P>
      <P>The early programmers had not expected their work would still be
in use, and the problem could now strike mainframe computers as well
as small chips used in elevators, cars and factories.</P>
      <P>ASX Chairman Maurice Newman, who chairs the Australian
government's Y2K Taskforce, said he would formally discuss debugging
disclosure with the chairman of the Australian Securities Commission
Chairman Alan Cameron, early in 1998.</P>
      <P>He said the ASX is trying to persuade the world's financial
markets to close before and after Jan. 1, 2000 for the final testing
of trading technology.</P>
      <P>"The surveys I have seen are showing 30 to 40 percent of people
have heard of the problem but are not doing anything to fix it --
that is scary," Newman said.</P>
      <P>He said global financial markets should rule off their books and
close a day early before New Year's Eve 1999 and then close for
another 24 hours just a few days into 2000 to see if their computer
systems function.</P>
      <P>The proposal would cover all transactions, such as foreign
exchange and bond trading, share markets and all derivatives trading.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABLE TV VIEWERS IN TAIPEI MIGHT LOSE 28 CHANNELS AT MIDNIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's cable TV viewers might see many of
their favorite channels unavailable from midnight on Wednesday, as
negotiations have collapsed between the country's two largest cable
TV operators.</P>
      <P>Rebar Eastern TV and Koo's Group are likely to stop transmitting
channels affiliated with each other as they have failed to reach
consensus on terms for renewing their cooperation contract, which
expires on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The two groups have a contract to purchase each other's channels
for broadcast on their respective cable TV systems, but when renewing
the contract, serious disputes erupted over the channel purchase fees
and whether each side has to buy a bundle of channels in a package or
can just buy the channels they want.</P>
      <P>The dispute is almost certain to affect the interests of more
than 400,000 cable TV subscribers in the greater Taipei area, with
some 28 channels expected to be cut as the new year begins.</P>
      <P>President of the Rebar Group Wang You-theng said on Wednesday
that if the two sides cannot reach an agreement by Thursday, one more
month shall be given for them to work out the dispute. The patriarch
of the Koo group, Koo Chen-fu, pointed out that it is therefore
possible that paying cable TV subscribers in Taipei will find some
channels missing.</P>
      <P>Although he claimed that the two groups should be able to solve
the dispute by Thursday, Koo added that subscribers who find that
they have lost their favorite channels can refuse to pay the
subscription fees or switch their cable TV operator.</P>
      <P>David Lee, director general of the Government Information Office,
on Wednesday reiterated the government's determination to protect the
rights of the cable TV subscribers and to mediate in the dispute.</P>
      <P>Lee's earlier efforts to mediate at a previous round of talks on
Dec. 27. resulted in the two sides agreeing to continue their
negotiations based on three principles -- securing the rights of the
viewers, competing instead of confronting each other, and purchasing
each other's channels -- but events since that meeting seem to
suggest that his mediation has been ignored.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND INVESTMENT POLICY TO REMAIN IN PLACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
said on Wednesday that the government has no plans to change its "no
haste, be patient" policy on mainland China investment, but added
that it will review the policy if Beijing renounces the use of force
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said the government is willing to revise its policy
regulating Taiwan investment on the mainland if the overall situation
across the Taiwan Strait and in the region changes.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end news conference, Wang stressed that the
policy does not ban all Taiwan businesses from investing in mainland
China, rather it is aimed at preventing large-scale investment
projects worth more than US$50 million or high-tech and
infrastructure industries from investing there.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's economic performance has been brilliant in
1997, with all major economic indexes posting record highs, Wang
voiced caution that the local economy will encounter three big
challenges in 1998 amid a region-wide financial crisis and a delicate
international economy.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the three challenges are a slowing world
economy, pressure brought about by the recent global climate
conference in Kyoto, Japan, and the pressing issue of entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>As the World Monetary Fund has adjusted the growth rate of the
world economy from 4.3 percent to 3.5 percent for 1998, Wang said his
ministry will closely monitor any effect this might have on Taiwan's
export sector and investment willingness.</P>
      <P>In line with the agreement reached at the global climate
conference on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, Wang said the
government will step up its efforts to upgrade Taiwan's industrial
sector to reduce the percentage of heavy energy-consuming industries.</P>
      <P>The economic affairs minister said a national energy meeting will
be held in March to thoroughly overhaul the nation's current energy
policy and work out measures to encourage the development of
high-tech and high value-added industries.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the government must accelerate the pace of
its efforts to enter the WTO by fully implementing its trade
liberalization and globalization policies and taking countermeasures
to reduce any possible adverse impact on local industries.</P>
      <P>Wang went on to say that the top priority of his ministry next
year is to expand domestic demand to sustain continued economic
growth and to create an unfettered investment climate to boost
investment at home and strengthen the structure of the small business
sector.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the ROC gaining WTO entry within the next
year, Wang also said his ministry is helping relevant sectors set up
a special task force to cope with the possible impact of WTO
membership on local industries.</P>

keep the island's 1998 inflation within the predicted range.</P>
      <P>He explained that the 3.5 percent index for consumer price growth
was calculated based on a New Taiwan dollar exchange rate of 32 to
the US dollar.</P>
      <P>The governor said that the Taiwan unit should maintain a value of
between 31 and 32 against the greenback in the near future, stressing
that his bank will take steps to stem any abnormal trading of the
currency which might result in the NT dollar's over-devaluation.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh on Wednesday urged the mainland Chinese authorities to
give Taiwan formal notice of their intention to resume cross-Taiwan
Strait dialogue, if indeed they intend to do so.</P>
      <P>Chang made the call in response to a report carried in the Hong
Kong-based Wen Wei Po newspaper on Wednesday in which Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) was quoted as saying that Taiwan should respond
to mainland calls for reopening cross-strait dialogue on political,
economic and other issues can be resumed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chang said he hopes that Beijing will give Taipei formal notice
if decision-makers there indeed want the cross-strait dialogue to be
resumed, rather than expressing the desire through informal channels.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future of the cross-strait talks, Chang noted that
there should be no prerequisites for any new round of talks between
the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOH CALLS ON SINGAPOREANS TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong,
in his New Year's message on Wednesday, called on Singaporeans to
maintain their confidence in Singapore's economy and government,
which he said, is "critical to our growth and prosperity."</P>
      <P>"We have won the confidence of the international financial
community through 32 years of hardheaded economic policies, prudent
financial management and consistent rational behavior," he said.</P>
      <P>"If we lose this hard-won confidence, it will take us years to
win it back, if ever," he warned. "We must stick to rational
policies, and never weaken the sound economic fundamentals which have
served us well. This is the key lesson from the regional currency
crisis."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the most important development in 1997 has
been the continuing regional economic crisis. Thailand's economy was
the first to run into problems when the Thai baht was floated on July
2, and dropped immediately. Loss of confidence in Thailand triggered
off the financial turmoil in Asia. Regional currencies and stock
markets fell sharply.</P>
      <P>Goh said, however, that amidst these difficulties, the Singapore
economy grew by 7.6 percent in 1997, "better than we had expected."</P>
      <P>But, 1998 will be a more difficult year, he cautioned. Slower
growth in neighboring countries will affect Singapore and trade with
the region will fall. Banks will see less financial activities, and
make fewer loans to the region. Fewer tourists from regional nations
will visit Singapore, he said.</P>
      <P>"Our economies and interests are interlinked. When our partners
grow, we grow. When they catch the flu, we will feel unwell. We
cannot isolate ourselves from events in the region. But we can
minimize their impact on us by strengthening our immune system," he
added.</P>
      <P>"Our economic fundamentals are sound," Goh stressed. "The
Singapore dollar should remain strong. We have large foreign
reserves, and no foreign debt. We run substantial budget surpluses.
Our banks are strong. We have political stability."</P>
      <P>Despite the current gloom, the prime minister told the nation,
the medium- and long-term prospects of the region are promising.</P>
      <P>Provided the countries in the region undertake necessary but
painful adjustments, robust growth should resume after two to three
years, he said. The countries will then be "leaner, fitter and more
competitive," he added.</P>
      <P>He urged Singaporeans to "use the next few years to consolidate
and sharpen our competitive edge."</P>
      <P>"Let us upgrade our skills, develop our talent, and top up with
foreign talent. Let us continue to 'add value' to the economies in
the region, help them overcome their difficulties and grow.</P>
      <P>"Then we can ride the next wave and surge ahead when the region
picks up again," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'BIRD FLU' VIRUS NOT DETECTED IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "bird flu" that has killed four
people in Hong Kong has not been detected in people or poultry in
Singapore, according to the Singapore Ministry of Health and the
Primary Production Department (PPD).</P>
      <P>The official assurance was made known in the wake of the mass
slaughter of about 1.3 million chickens in Hong Kong in the past two
days to rid the former British colony of the influenza strain H5N1,
commonly known as bird flu because it had earlier been found only in
birds.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government said that all the chickens in the
territory were expected to be destroyed by midnight Tuesday,
according to reports from Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The PPD, which monitors all poultry from local farms as well as
imported poultry, said Tuesday that Singapore was free from bird flu.</P>
      <P>Singapore does not import any poultry from Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Local supplies of frozen or chilled chicken are imported from
Brazil, Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain, while live chickens are
imported mainly from Malaysia and slaughtered in local abattoirs.</P>
      <P>There are about 10 local poultry farms left. The PPD monitors all
of them, and only those with "proper infrastructure, good management
and sound poultry health and hygiene practices" can supply poultry
for consumption in Singapore, said a PPD spokesman.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the PPD has an integrated program to ensure
that poultry sold here is free from infectious diseases and is safe
for human consumption.</P>
      <P>Farms overseas wishing to export poultry to Singapore must first
be accredited by the veterinary authority of the exporting country as
well as by the PPD.</P>
      <P>Also, birds from local and overseas farms are sent routinely to
the PPD veterinary laboratory to be tested for a range of diseases,
including bird flu, he said.</P>
      <P>Live birds slaughtered at local abattoirs are also inspected and
tested for drug residues and micro-organisms that cause food
poisoning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE TENG-HUI'S NEW YEAR'S DAY MESSAGE (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of President
Lee Teng-hui's New Year's Day message:</P>
      <P>This New Year's Day marks the beginning of the eighty-seventh
year of the Republic of China; It also opens a new chapter for
national development. While the new year undoubtedly brings many new
tests, it is nevertheless filled with new hopes and opportunities. As
long as all of our compatriots work together to set goals, remain
steadfastly confident, and continuously strive forward, we can
overcome all challenges, meet our responsibilities and usher in an
even grander and more prosperous future for our country. It is our
firm belief that the eighty-seventh year of the Republic of China
shall be a year in which we see a fresh start, achieve new successes
and scale new heights in national development.</P>
      <P>During the past half century, we have labored under a poor
resource base at home and incessant challenges and threats from
abroad. Only with our people's "esprit de corps" and hard work could
we have generated a vigorous developmental momentum and established a
solid foundation for national development. In particular, during the
last ten years our compatriots have time and again relied on their
outstanding intellect and resolute determination to overcome
adversities, to surpass challenges, to open a brand-new historical
era of freedom, democracy and prosperity, and to garner the
following unprecedented glorious accomplishments:
1. A Solid and Mature Democracy</P>
      <P>In the past ten years, we have adhered strongly to the
principles of popular sovereignty and continued to pursue democratic
reforms. Last year we completed the fourth round of constitutional
revisions to further balance the functioning of the central
government system. We also downsized government organizations,
bringing the democratization process to its concluding stages, and
thereby, proudly joining the ranks of the world's modernized
countries.
2. A Stable and Prosperous Economy</P>
      <P>Over the past few decades, our forward-looking economic policy
has produced substantial results by simultaneously restructuring the
economy successfully and maintaining a high degree of economic
growth. Recently, many East Asian countries are being hit hard by a
financial crisis. Our government has been paying constant and close
attention to the situation and has dealt with it in a proper manner.
As a result, Taiwan has been relatively unscathed by the financial
crisis. We estimate our economic growth rate for this year to
continue to exceed 6 percent. This proves that our economic policies
are correct, our economic structure sound, and prospects rosy.
3. Enhanced National Security</P>
      <P>Our remarkable achievements in promoting democratization have
added new strength to the world's democratic camp. The fact that the
Republic of China exists and has flourished on Taiwan has gained
widespread recognition and respect throughout the world. As a result,
the world has gradually revised its policies toward the Republic of
China. At the same time, we have strengthened and consolidated the
combat readiness of our national defense. This has upgraded our
national security to a higher level, safeguarding the stable and
peaceful environment in which our people live and work. Furthermore,
it has allowed the Republic of China to make its own concrete
contributions to world peace. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW YEAR'S DAY MESSAGE (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It was ten years ago when the ROC government first allowed people
in Taiwan to visit their relatives on the Chinese mainland. since
then, we have taken the initiative to adopt a series of pragmatic and
flexible mainland policies and measures, changing the character of
cross-strait relations from that of total estrangement and no
contacts to the present one of frequent exchanges and close
interactions. This development not only serves to promote mutual
understanding, but also helps to maintain peace and stability across
the Taiwan Strait. As such, it holds great significance to the
well-being of the people on both sides of the strait, as well as to
long-term national development.</P>
      <P>Ladies and gentlemen: While our past accomplishments are worthy
of our pride and joy, every day is a new one and there is no end to
national development. This is especially true for what we face today.
As a thoroughly democratized polity and a new, highly prosperous
society, we must arm ourselves with fresh ideas and new methods in
order to counter new problems and create new opportunities.
Furthermore, as the interdependence between countries deepens day by
day, international competition will grow keener and the external
environment will become more severe than before. The recent financial
crisis that has engulfed countries in East Asia is a more salient
example. Although its impact on our country has not been very
significant to date, nevertheless, it is not something that should be
ignored or taken lightly. Instead, we must raise our vigilance and
prepare effective countermeasures.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as we face the new year, we have carefully weighted
and considered the new circumstances. In the hope of bringing
national development to a new height, we must strive toward five
objectives:</P>
      <P>First, we must enhance our economic competitiveness. The recent
Asian financial crisis has proved that our economic system can
withstand such a trial. It has also demonstrated the importance of
maintaining a sound economic system. In the coming year, we must
closely monitor both internal and external changes. We must
consolidate financial policies and measures, increase domestic
demand, and dedicate our efforts toward sustaining a thriving
economy. At the same time, we must plan cautiously and
comprehensively for reforming our tax system to integrate business and
personal income taxes. We must also make appropriate adjustments for
the agricultural sector after our accession to the World Trade
Organization. Only thus, can we improve our overall economic
environment and strengthen our ability to deal with future challenges
and competition.</P>
      <P>Second, we must cultivate a spirit of diligence and honesty.
Being a poorly endowed country, we have achieved our economic success
by relying mainly on the strength of the hardworking and industrious
character that our citizens possess. This character also includes a
strong determination to always try one's best, a willingness to bear
hardships, a perseverance in one's pursuit and a preference for a
simple lifestyle. However, the rise in the economic prosperity and
affluence of the people has been accompanied by a gradual
deterioration of social values. Hedonism and indolence have emerged.
Should such trends continue unabated, our economic growth would be
jeopardized, and seeds of social malaise would take root, adversely
affecting our national strength and competitiveness. Therefore, we
must embark on spiritual reformation and awaken those traditional
qualities of diligence and honesty. We must also implement
educational reform to allow our citizens to reestablish a healthy,
simple and positive outlook. Only so can our society shine with vigor
and vitality, and forge ahead toward greater progress. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW YEAR'S DAY MESSAGE (III)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Third, we must foster a law-abiding spirit. Democracy and rule of
law are two sides of the some coin. Once democracy is developed, the
strengthening of rule of law must follow. Only in this way can group
harmony coexist with respect for individual's freedom. Democracy can
then proceed smoothly and unhindered, producing all the functions and
values that come naturally with it. Therefore, we must carry out
through judicial reforms, uphold social justice, combat crime, and
remove deficiencies, so as to maintain social stability and build a
democratic, orderly and civilized society.</P>
      <P>Fourth, we must establish a responsible and efficient government.
We have entered a democratic era where sovereign power resides in the
people. We are also part of a pluralistic and rapidly changing
society. As such, the people have placed higher expectations for and
heavier responsibilities on their government. The fourth
constitutional reform completed last year will serve to balance the
functioning of the central government and streamline its structure.
This will establish a more responsible and efficient government, one
that is capable of meeting the needs and expectations of its people.
Henceforth, governments of all levels--in particular, local
governments which must deal directly with the people's livelihood and
welfare--must administer in accordance with the laws and regulations,
must take greater responsibility for their actions, must develop new
ideas and must take the initiative to implement necessary reforms.
Only in this way can the government expand its administrative
functions, increase its services, and build a democratic government
that is truly "of the people."</P>
      <P>Fifth, we must establish a society with a rich cultural content.
We must not pursue economic progress at the expense of cultural
development. Only by pursuing both will we be able to maintain a
balance between material civilization and spiritual values. Today, in
contrast with our prosperous economic life, the spiritual life for a
majority of the general populace has become somewhat barren. This has
resulted in a lack of profound cultural refinement and
broad-mindedness in our society, which in turn has caused alienation
amongst the people and a growing intensity in conflicts. Therefore,
we must enrich our cultural content, lay a solid foundation for
spiritual cultivation, and attach equal importance to humanity and
culture as we do to economic development. Both must be advanced
simultaneously in order to attain a harmonious, honest and
culture-rich society.</P>
      <P>Ladies and gentlemen: During the past half century, the Republic
of China on Taiwan has weathered many epochal storms, and yet has
managed to stand from and unwavering through it all. This is due to
the fact that at each stage of its development, the Republic of China
has been able to set up new goals and formulate new priorities based
on an existing foundation and, with the people and the government
working hand in hand, to gradually propel the nation to new heights
of success, In the coming new year, as long as the entire population
of the Republic of China continues to work in unison, greater
confidence will be rekindled and greater power amassed to open a
bright and glorious era for the Republic of China in 1998!</P>
      <P>I wish great prosperity to the Republic of China and a Happy New
Year, good health and happiness to all! Thank you!</P>

      <P>About 8,000 Singaporeans and foreigners
mourned the 104 passengers and crew on board SilkAir flight MI-185,
which crashed near Palembang, Indonesia on Dec. 19, in a solemn
condolence service Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The public condolence service, held in the Singapore Indoor
Stadium, started at 6 p.m. with a recital of the names of the 104
victims of the ill-fated SilkAir flight, 97 passengers of various

      <P>"We are gathered here today in a sad and painful moment in our
history to share in the sorrow and grief of those who have lost their
loved ones in the SilkAir crash on Dec. 19 in Palembang, Indonesia,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong stressed in his address:
"We have to be strong. Life must go on from here, however difficult
it may be. The families (of the victims) must over time step out from
the sudden darkness in their lives, SilkAir must fly again with
confidence, and the country must emerge with fortitude from this
shared grief."</P>
      <P>He called on Singaporeans to "give meaning to the lives of those
who had gone."</P>
      <P>"Our grief for them has brought us closer as a community and a
nation. They have, in our remembrance of them, given us the
collective strength to face life's challenges. Let us live tomorrow
bravely," he continued.</P>
      <P>After prayers by representatives from Singapore's nine religions,
all mourners stood up in observance of one minute of silence for the
104 SilkAir victims, concluding the 45-minute service.</P>
