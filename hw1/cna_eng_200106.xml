    <HEADLINE>BEIJING AFRAID OF COMING TO NEGOTIATING TABLE: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  May  31 (CNA)
(By Y.C. Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese leaders are "afraid" of
coming to the negotiating table to talk with their Taiwan
counterparts because of a lack of confidence, Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in Paraguay Thursday for a three-day state
visit, told the Spanish-language news agency EFE in an interview that
he has long been eager to reopen the gate to rational and productive
cross-strait dialogue but that the Communist Chinese have only paid
lip service to reopening talks, saying that their reasons for not
restarting them are only excuses.</P>
      <P>On the topic of reunification of Taiwan and mainland China, Chen
said that economic and cultural integration should come first in
order to build up mutual trust that can then serve as a basis for
peaceful political integration across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He stressed that peace, equality and the people's will are the
three key principles that must be fully observed during the process
of cross-strait integration.</P>
      <P>During a luncheon hosted by overseas Chinese representatives in
Paraguay in honor of Chen, his wife and their entourage, the ROC
president said that "giving Taiwan away to others cannot be a way for
bringing cross-strait stability."</P>
      <P>Chen emphasized that cross-strait stability cannot come about
simply by Taiwan raising the white flag and surrendering itself to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Speaking in his mother tongue of Taiwanese, which many of the
overseas Chinese living or working in Paraguay are familiar with,
Chen discounted Beijing's "one country, two systems" overture, saying
that if Taiwan accepted it, the Republic of China would disappear
from the map.</P>
      <P>The "one country, two systems" overture is not acceptable to the
23 million people of Taiwan, Chen stressed, adding that "we have a
responsibility to Taiwan's future generations."</P>
      <P>Paraguay is the fourth leg of Chen's current five-state
diplomatic journey to Latin America, which will also take him to
Honduras. Chen and his entourage concluded their visit to Panama
Wednesday. Before proceeding to Panama, the ROC president visited El
Salvador and Guatemala.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC LOOKING AT WORLD OIL PRICES, NT DOLLAR VALUE IN CONSIDERING HIKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will look at
world oil prices and the value of the new Taiwan dollar in
considering whether to hike domestic petroleum prices, CPC Chairman
C. W. Chen said Friday.</P>
      <P>But Chen did not mention when a hike might occur or how big it
would be, only saying that if there is a hike, it will be modest.</P>
      <P>With the recent depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar, the cost
of importing crude has risen, putting pressure on the CPC and the
other domestic petroleum distributor Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) to
raise their prices for petroleum products.</P>
      <P>Although the CPC's marketing department has assessed the
situation and says the company should hike prices, CPC executives
said they would not be rash in doing so based on considerations of
market competitiveness and the impact on consumer prices.</P>
      <P>Tai Wen-yen, a CPC marketing official, said the new Taiwan
dollar's sharp depreciation Monday of 1.005 against the U.S. dollar
had a great impact on the cost of imported crude.</P>
      <P>Although the value of the new Taiwan dollar has rebounded
modestly since Monday, Tai said the CPC will have to monitor the
situation for a few days before making a decision.</P>
      <P>He said the CPC will try to absorb the impact of the depreciation
in the new Taiwan dollar by making up the company's losses in other
areas, such as by lowering management costs and expanding its
business.</P>
      <P>Tai pointed out that for every new Taiwan dollar depreciation,
the CPC will incur annual losses of between NT$500 million and NT$600
million. In contrast, the FPG, which currently has a 17 percent
market share in Taiwan, will not suffer as much because of the rising
cost of imported crude.</P>
      <P>The CPC last raised its petroleum prices in April, using as its
basis the price at the time of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude --
US$27.24 per barrel -- and the value of the new Taiwan dollar --
NT$32.9 against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>At the present, the price of WTI is hovering at around US$28.5
per barrel, and the new Taiwan dollar is valued at about 33.9 to the
greenback, putting greater pressure on both the CPC and the FPG to
hike their petroleum prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA REITERATES THAT SOLID TAIWAN-PANAMA TIES UNCHANGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) reiterated Friday that formal diplomatic relations
between the ROC and Panama remain solid and firm and that this will
not change.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue noted the solid and cordial
nature of ROC-Panama ties was revealed by the highest possible level
of treatment that the Panamanian government accorded to President
Chen Shui-bian and his entourage during their three-day state visit
to Panama May 28-30.</P>
      <P>The closeness of their bilateral relationship was also
demonstrated by the signing of a joint communique by Chen and his
Panamanian counterpart Mireya Moscoso May 29 reaffirming their
commitment to further strengthening the "historically friendly"
relationship between the ROC and Panama, Chang said.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks in response to questions raised by local
reporters regarding comments made by Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Aleman to foreign news agencies right after Chen departed
Panama that were not favorable to bilateral relations between Taiwan
and Panama.</P>
      <P>According to the foreign news reports, Aleman said that Panama
would welcome diplomatic relations with Beijing, but "with no
conditions attached." He also said that "Panama will not break its
relations with Taiwan." Beijing refuses to establish diplomatic ties
with countries that formally recognize the ROC.</P>
      <P>Discounting the foreign news reports, Chang said the MOFA would
rather believe the joint communique and all the public remarks made
by President Moscoso and Foreign Minister Aleman about relations
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"The relationship has been fortified," Moscoso said as she saw
Chen off at Panama City's international airport May 30.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said the MOFA is currently going through proper
channels to contact Aleman in order to verify his recent remarks
concerning ROC-Panama bilateral relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FIRST LADY DONATES CASH TO PARAGUAYAN FOUNDATION, CHINESE SCHOOL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  May  31 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China First Lady Wu Shu-chen
donated US$20,000 in cash to the Paraguayan First Lady Welfare
Foundation Thursday on behalf of the ROC government and people.</P>
      <P>Wu made the donation during a visit to Paraguayan President Luis
Angel Gonzalez Macchi's official residence, where she received a
warm welcome from her Paraguayan counterpart.</P>
      <P>Wu said she feels honored to visit the Paraguayan president's
official residence, which is also used as an office.</P>
      <P>Wu further said she admires the Paraguayan first lady's
dedication to promoting charitable and social welfare services for
underprivileged groups and low-income families.</P>
      <P>Wu, who herself has been confined to a wheelchair since being
paralyzed in a car accident 16 years ago, said she is hopeful that
the ROC donation can help finance the Paraguayan foundation's
charitable and social welfare programs.</P>
      <P>"The donation conveys our people's concern for their Paraguayan
counterparts and also symbolizes close ties between the two
countries," Wu said.</P>
      <P>For her part, Paraguayan First Lady Susana Galli de Gonzalez
Macchi expressed her gratitude for the ROC donation to help needy
Paraguayan people.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Gonzalez also said she hopes the two countries can
strengthen exchanges of experience in carrying out various social
welfare programs.</P>
      <P>In the company of Mrs. Gonzalez, Wu later visited a district
hospital in Lambare, a city on the outskirts of Asuncion. A team of
medical professionals from Taiwan was offering free medical services
at the Lambare district hospital.</P>
      <P>The medical team was organized by the Taiwan Root Medical Peace
Corps (TRMPC), a Taipei-based organization dedicated to providing
free medical services to residents in remote regions in Taiwan and
other countries.</P>
      <P>The team left Taipei May 19 for Bolivia where it offered
free services in several mountain villages. And the group arrived in
Paraguay May 27.</P>
      <P>TRMPC founder Liu Chi-chuan said the team was offering medical
services at the Lambare hospital under the arrangement of the
Paraguayan First Lady Welfare Foundation.</P>
      <P>Wu lauded the group for its efforts to help improve medical
services for needy people in developing countries. "Through such
efforts, you have helped our country forge friendship with many
people around the world," an emotional Wu said.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Wu also visited a Chinese school founded in 1986
with the assistance from the ROC government and overseas Chinese
community in Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed her admiration for all school faculty members as
their concerted efforts have made the school one of the top-notch
educational institutions in Paraguay. The school now accepts both
overseas Chinese and Paraguayan children.</P>
      <P>Wu also donated US$30,000 in cash to underscore the ROC
government's support for the school.</P>
      <P>Wu accompanied President Chen Shui-bian to Paraguay
Wednesday for a three-day state visit. This is the first time that Wu
has taken part in an overseas trip in her capacity as ROC first lady.
The ROC first couple have already visited El Salvador, Guatemala and
Panama, and their current five-nation Latin American diplomatic
journey will also take them to Honduras.</P>

China and has handled exchanges with Hong Kong and Macau since the
two former colonies reverted to Beijing rule in 1997 and 1999,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Although the expiry of the five-year Taiwan-Hong Kong air pact is
drawing dear, Hong Kong authorities have so far not informed Taiwan
of their plans for negotiations on a new version of the bilateral
aviation agreement, as Beijing's attitude toward the issue remains
unclear.</P>
      <P>Lin said that as this will be the first time that Taiwan and Hong
Kong will have held aviation rights talks since Hong Kong's reversion
to Beijing rule and the ROC's implementation of a statute on
relations with Hong Kong and Macau, the two sides need time to
prepare for negotiations on a new accord.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we do not rule out the possibility of extending the
existing pact for a suitable period of time after its expiry so that
the two sides can have enough time to negotiate a new pact to meet
the changing market trends," Lin said, adding that the extension can
also help maintain normal operations of flight services between the
two places.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ROC looks forward to reaching a new aviation
agreement with Hong Kong on a reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>The current Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation pact was signed in 1996 and
the two sides originally agreed to review the accord once every five
years.</P>
      <P>Any possible delay in negotiations for a new version of the pact
would be bad news for Taiwan's EVA Airways and Hong Kong's Dragon
Air, both of which are eager to see revisions to the existing pact to
allow them to increase the number of their flights.</P>
      <P>Despite the current cross-strait political stalemate, bilateral
trade and economic exchanges have continued to grow. The demand for
flight services between Taiwan and Hong Kong -- a major transit stop
for cross-Taiwan Strait air traffic -- has been skyrocketing.</P>
      <P>Under the present pact, Taiwan and Hong Kong can both allow their
carriers to operate a total of 121 weekly flights between the two
places.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's China Airlines can operate 105 flights per
week, while EVA can only operate 16 weekly flights. Meanwhile, Hong
Kong assigns 100 flights to its Cathay Pacific Airways and 21 flights
to Dragon Air.</P>
      <P>With more and more Taiwan investors and managers relocating to
mainland China, the Taiwan-Hong Kong route has become one of the
hottest and both EVA and Dragon Air have long desired to increase
their flights on the route, airline sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ISSUES STAMPS TO COMMEMORATE PIONEERING DOCTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Directorate General of
Posts (DGP) issued a set of memorial stamps Friday in commemoration
of Canadian missionary doctor George Leslie Mackay, who died in
Taiwan 100 years ago.</P>
      <P>The stamps were debuted at a ceremony jointly witnessed by DGP
Director-General Cheng Wen-cheng, Lee Fu-chuan, head of the
Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, and Huang Chun-hsiung, president of
Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was particularly blessed with the participation of
John Ross Mackay, grandson of the man who is hailed by the people of
Taiwan as one of the foreign pioneers who brought Western medicine
and other accoutrements of modern civilization, including
photography, to rural Taiwan more than a century ago.</P>
      <P>John Mackay, now in his 70s, offered his greetings to guests at
the ceremony with a short phrase in Taiwanese dialect, saying
"Jiahuahsi (so pleased)" to be here.</P>
      <P>Mackay, who was born in Taiwan, said it has been too long since
he left Taiwan and that he can hardly remember any other Taiwanese
dialect.</P>
      <P>A geology professor at Columbia University in the United States
who enjoys an international reputation in the field of North Pole
studies, Mackay said his memory of his grandfather was slight, as he
was born after his grandfather had died.</P>
      <P>The Mackay memorial stamp set is the fourth to be printed by a
Chinese government as a token to commemorate a foreigner since 1878
-- the fourth year of the Kuanghsu Empire of the Ching Dynasty --
according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Mackay came to Taiwan in 1872 at the age of 28 as a missionary
for the Canadian Presbyterian Church. He preached, educated and
provided medical services to the people of Taiwan throughout his 29
years in Taiwan until he passed away in 1901 in Tamshui. His grave is
located at Oxford College in Tamshui, where his son William is also
buried.</P>
      <P>Mackay married a Taiwan woman with whom he had three children and
their offspring now live in Canada, the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tamkang High School, Mackay Memorial Hospital and other
establishments related to Mackay in Taiwan are currently sponsoring
various activities in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of his
death, which falls on June 2, a Mackay hospital spokeswoman said.</P>

      <P>China Motor Corp. (CMC) will become Taiwan's
first carmaker to introduce its products to the subcontinent after
entering a joint venture with an Indian carmaker, a local source said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The source said that CMC will enter a technical cooperation
agreement with India's Premier Automobiles Ltd. (PAL) to produce
CMC's Varica -- a popular economy van -- to the Indian market.</P>
      <P>The Indian production line is expected to begin mass production
in October and the sales volume will be set at 10,000 units annually
in the initial stage, he said.</P>
      <P>CMC, which was Taiwan's No. 1 car exporter last year, has already
successfully expanded to mainland China, Southeast Asian and Middle
Eastern markets.</P>
      <P>The source pointed out that CMC, with its eyes on India's one 
billion population, entered a technical cooperation agreement with
PAL in 1997, the same year it introduced the Varica to the Indian
market on a trial basis that proved successful.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial statistics, India will be one of the most
populous countries in the world by 2005 and will need 800,000 new
cars per year. This makes it very important for Taiwan carmakers
looking for a market other than mainland China, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK, MACAU WELCOME TO OPEN OFFICES IN TAIWAN: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong and Macau are welcome to open
representative offices in Taiwan to forge new mechanisms for mutual
exchanges, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China and
handles exchanges with Hong Kong and Macau, said in a press
release that Taiwan-Hong Kong and Taiwan-Macau ties are litmus to
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China's current Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)-led government has endeavored to promote
exchanges and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macau, the MAC said it
is hopeful that the Beijing leadership can adopt a pragmatic and
forward-looking attitude toward Taiwan's engagements with Hong Kong
and Macau to facilitate the establishment of institutionalized
mechanisms for their normal contacts and consultations.</P>
      <P>The MAC said it is convinced that if Hong Kong and Macau manage
to open liaison offices in Taiwan, the moves will be able to foster
a scenario beneficial to all of the four Chinese societies --
Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Since the ROC government allowed its people to visit their
mainland relatives and make indirect investments on the mainland in
the late 1980s, the MAC went on, the intermediary roles of Hong Kong
and Macau have become increasingly important in cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>And this upward trend has not been affected by Hong Kong's and
Macau's reversions to Beijing's rule in 1997 and 1999, respectively,
the MAC stressed.</P>
      <P>On the trading front, the MAC said, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade
registered a 19.3 percent annual growth to reach US$33 billion last
year, and Taiwan-Macau trade also posted a 13.19 percent gain to hit
US$360 million.</P>
      <P>In terms of personnel exchanges, Taiwan residents made more than
2.8 million visits to Hong Kong and Macau last year, making Taiwan
Hong Kong's second largest source of tourist arrivals and Macau's No.
3 source of tourist arrivals. During the same period, Hong Kong and
Macau residents made more than 295,000 visits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan opens its door to mainland Chinese tourists in the
near future, the MAC said, the intermediary roles of Hong Kong and
Macau in cross-strait exchanges will become even more important.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MAC said the ROC government has consistently
promoted academic exchanges with Hong Kong and Macau and assisted
private cultural and arts groups to increase exchanges with their
Hong Kong and Macau counterparts.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the MAC said governmental exchanges between Taiwan
and the two areas have not grown as fast as their commercial, social
and cultural interchanges since the two formal colonies reverted to
Beijing's rule.</P>
      <P>Under the restrictions set forth in mainland China's seven
principles for handling Taiwan-Hong Kong relations, the MAC said,
Taiwan-Hong Kong interaction has even lagged behind cross-strait
engagements.</P>
      <P>The MAC said it looks forward to seeing the Hong Kong government
take more active steps to improve bilateral engagements and resolve
practical problems arising from mutual exchanges.</P>
      <P>For its part, the MAC said, the ROC government will take a
series of goodwill measures to boost bilateral relations,
including beefing up the functions of the ROC
representative office in Hong Kong, cultivating extensive connections
with various Hong Kong social quarters and simplifying visa
applications by prospective Hong Kong and Macau visitors to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT TO HELP PARAGUAY IN SOCIAL, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian agreed Friday to help Paraguay implement its economic and
social development strategy and speed up the handover of four
helicopters to the South American nation.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with Paraguay President
Luis Angel Gonzalez Macchi.</P>
      <P>Gonzalez welcomed Chen's visit and expressed appreciation for the
assistance over the years given by the ROC to Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Gonzalez noted that he was appointed by the nation's Supreme
Court of Justice to serve as the president two years ago and had no
chance to explain his administration ideals and only recently
unveiled his social and economic development strategy in a bid to
stimulate Paraguay's industrial development.</P>
      <P>Gonzalez said that he hopes to lure more foreign investment into
the nation's processing industry of agricultural products, and its
lumber, fruit and agricultural product exports.</P>
      <P>He also described his ultimate goals as annihilating poverty and
promoting development. He suggested that the two nations set up
supra-government agency cooperation committees so that high-level
officials from both countries could discuss matters of cooperation.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the ROC will provide assistance
to the infrastructure construction of his nation, such as
road-building, and will deliver the remaining four of six UH-1H
helicopters that the ROC promised to donate to Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the slow pace of the helicopter donation is due to
the fact that the ROC must wait for approval from the United States,
as the helicopters were purchased from that country.</P>
      <P>The president also said that he understands the hardship Gonzalez
suffered in the initial stage of his administration, but added that
hardship is a "necessary process" for a nation going from a
authoritarian to a democratic government.</P>
      <P>Chen also noted that Paraguay is a faithful strategic ally of the
ROC, as well as a springboard for Taiwan businessmen making inroads
into Mercosur (Southern Common Market). He added that the ROC will
continue to honor its commitments with regard to previously
agreed-upon donations and loans.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that since Taiwan was hit by a devastating
earthquake Sept. 21, 1999, its reconstruction work has been heavy and
expensive. In addition, he went on, Taiwan's economy has been
impacted by the world economic slump, but he said the ROC will
continue to assist Paraguay within its financial limits.</P>
      <P>As Paraguay's economic and social development strategy will
involve many government agencies, Chen also agreed to set up a
supra-government agency committee so that the two countries can
handle related matters.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen, June 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The de facto U.S. ambassador to the Republic
of China said here Friday he is pleased to see the opening of direct
"mini three links" between the ROC's frontline islands of Kinmen and
Matsu and mainland China's ports of Xiamen and Mawei.</P>
      <P>Raymond Burghardt, director of the Taipei office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), made the remarks before wrapping up a
two-day visit to Kinmen. The quasi-official AIT handles ROC-U.S.
exchanges in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Burghardt arrived in Kinmen Thursday to see for himself the
operations of the Taiwan-initiated "mini three links" program. It was
his first visit to the island since the Jan. 1 opening of direct
trade, mail and shipping links between the ROC's two offshore islands
and the two mainland Chinese port cities in Fujian Province, which
faces Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>With a view to avoiding any possible speculation that might
adversely affect cross-strait relations, Burghardt kept a low profile
on his Kinmen visit.</P>
      <P>At the end of his visit, Burghardt said he was impressed by the
"mini three links" program. He further said that many foreign
countries, including the United States, take great interest in the
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>As the "mini three links" program is part of cross-strait
relations, Burghardt said he traveled to Kinmen to take a look at the
program's actual operations.</P>
      <P>In his view, Burghardt said, the "mini three links" program will
contribute to the development of cross-strait relations. The United
States would be very glad to see peaceful engagements between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, he added.</P>
      <P>This was Burghardt's second visit to Kinmen since he assumed his
current post. He last visited the ROC's defense outpost 18 months ago
in the company of National Security Bureau Director Ting Yu-chou.
During that unpublicized visit, the U.S. envoy focused his itinerary
on visiting military installations and defense facilities.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) will
begin a new telephone visa information service from June 8 to handle
requests for visa information, according to a Friday press release.</P>
      <P>The press release said the new service is expected to virtually
eliminate the busy signals and unanswered calls that have frustrated
many callers seeking information about visas.</P>
      <P>It will also provide more detailed and comprehensive answers to
the most commonly asked questions in a format that will allow callers
to choose which information they want to hear, it said.</P>
      <P>The telephone number for the new visa information line is
0204-58858 and the recorded service will be available 24 hours a day
in English and Mandarin, with a fax-on-demand number of 0204-58958
available for forms and information sheets.</P>
      <P>The new telephone service has become necessary because of the
increasing volume of visa inquiry calls. AIT currently receives about
15,000 telephone inquiries a month and consular officials processed
over 300,000 applications last year for immigrant and non-immigrant
visas.</P>
      <P>The new visa information service is superior to the existing
telephone information system in several ways, according to the press
release:</P>
      <P>-- It can handles more simultaneous calls, which should eliminate
busy signals;</P>
      <P>-- The information available is broader in scope and detail;</P>
      <P>-- Callers no longer have to listen to the entire recorded
message to find the information they need but can instead choose from
a menu of choices to select the information they want to hear;</P>
      <P>-- Callers must use a touch-tone phone that has IDD access
(Cellular phones and public telephones will also work); and</P>
      <P>-- The new service is expected to free up the AIT switchboard so
that people who have other business will be able to get through more
easily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT RECEIVES HONORARY DOCTORATE IN PARAGUAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
received an honorary doctorate Friday from National Asuncion
University and called for enhanced two-way academic exchanges.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the National Asuncion University authorities
following the ceremony, Chen thanked Paraguay's top university for
the honor and said it was the most precious moment of his three-day
state visit to the ROC's sole diplomatic ally in South America.</P>
      <P>Paraphrasing a poem by U.S. poet Walt Whitman, Chen said he was
very touched when looking out at the young, enthusiastic and smiling
students of the university. "What I see is not only singing and
youth, but the hope and bright future of this country," he said.</P>
      <P>The ROC president compared National Asuncion University to his
own alma mater -- National Taiwan University -- for its long history
and regional academic status. He hailed the university as the cradle
of Paraguay's talent and elite and voiced his belief that the leading
Paraguayan university will play a pivotal role in the country's
future.</P>
      <P>"As a faithful ally of Paraguay, I truly believe that the ROC
should further boost its academic exchanges with National Asuncion
University and help it cultivate more talent to help accelerate
Paraguay's development," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the ROC's economic and political progress over
the past 50 years to the country's successful education, particularly
its higher education. With the country's sole resource -- high
quality manpower -- Taiwan has managed to achieve outstanding
progress with "locally trained political and economic experts," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC and Paraguay are "genuine partners on the
path toward progress," the ROC president wished Paraguay luck in
overcoming all its difficulties under the capable leadership of
President Luis Angel Gonzalez Macchi and also in achieving its own
political and economic miracle.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao has met with Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski
in Skopje, the Balkan state's capital, to discuss matters of mutual
concern, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tien cut short his Latin American diplomatic tour to fly to
Macedonia Thursday in a last-ditch effort to rescue the
ROC's diplomatic ties with its war-torn European ally.</P>
      <P>Chang told a routine press conference in Taipei that Tien
managed to meet Georgievski shortly after his arrival in Skopje
Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>"Their meeting proceeded in a candid, friendly atmosphere,"
Chang said, adding that as the current Macedonian coalition
government is composed of officials from seven different and
mutually competing political parties, its political situation is
very complicated and volatile.</P>
      <P>Chang said Tien has traveled to Skopje to understand the latest
situation in that country.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Foreign Minister Chiu Jong-nan also flew from Taipei to
Skopje Thursday to join Tien in shoring up the ROC's diplomatic ties
with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Chang said both Tien and Chiu will do their utmost to
communicate with Macedonian politicians and influential figures in
various Macedonian social quarters.</P>
      <P>Chang would not made any comments on reports that Macedonian
Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva had told a group of reporters that
her country is prepared to break off diplomatic ties with the ROC in
an effort to restore diplomatic relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said the proposal to set up a peace fund to help
Macedonia maintain its domestic political stability was mainly a
personal view of Loh Ping-chang, secretary-general of the ROC's
International Cooperation and Development Fund.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will make a
further evaluation of Loh's proposal. "It's still premature to say
whether the MOFA will agree to the proposal to set up a peace
fund to help Macedonia," she stressed.</P>
      <P>In fact, the ROC had donated US$1 million to Macedonia when
fighting between Macedonian forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas
erupted in April this year. Among major countries around the
world, the ROC was the first to extend a helping hand to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Macedonia switched recognition to the ROC in 1999, but now is
keen to regain mainland China's international support in dealing with
a five-month-long ethnic Albanian insurgency along its border with
Kosovo.</P>
      <P>In reality, the official ROC-Macedonian ties have never been
completely smooth. The ROC's envoy in Macedonia, Peter P.C. Cheng,
has not yet had the chance to present his credentials to the
Macedonian president.</P>

wine, while the second stage will open the market to distillers and
manufacturers of fortified wines. The third stage see the lifting of
all remaining restrictions.</P>
      <P>The MOF had originally planned to liberalize the production of
alcohol and tobacco in three years, but the decline in the local
economy in central Taiwan since the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake led
government and civic leaders to recommend earlier liberalization to
the Central government so as to help local governments revitalize
the economy.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Wang Teh-shan said that the newly adopted
alcohol and tobacco production system will not be implemented before
July 1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND CLOSELY MONITORING BEIJING MILITARY DRILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense said Friday
it is closely monitoring preparations by mainland China's People's
Liberation Army for the largest war games since President Chen
Shui-bian took office last year.</P>
      <P>Defense ministry officials said the exercises, code named
"Liberation One," are no cause for alarm in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that the exercises will take place on and
around Dongshan Island, off the southeastern coast of China, on June
4 but defense ministry officials have not confirmed the date.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that any large-scale combined forces
drills involving land, sea and air forces will have to mass troops
and complete logistic and administrative operations before starting
individual exercises for each armed force.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that "Liberation One" has yet to begin formal
drills and that the mainland has just completed massing its troops
and the individual exercises for each armed force.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry said they were not sure if the timing of the
exercises would coincide with the return of President Chen from his
five-nation Latin American trip, but they said they will inform the
public when the drills begin.</P>
      <P>Wire service reports said that Beijing's war games aim to serve
as a "military warning" to the administration of Chen. Beijing is
mistrustful of Chen because of his past stance on Taiwan independence
and his refusal to endorse mainland China's "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>The reports also said that the emphasis of the drills will be
mock attacks and occupation of an outlying Taiwanese island and an
assault on an aircraft carrier. The exercises are to demonstrate
Beijing's determination to protect its sovereign and territorial
integrity, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Defense ministry officials said that Russian-made Sukhoi SU-27
fighters, which made low-altitude bombing runs in the last military
exercises on Dongshan Island two years ago, will again take part in
the upcoming exercises, but will carry on the mission of maintaining
airborne superiority.</P>
      <P>Military generals said that judging from Beijing's military
strategy, the drills this time will be to prevent "foreign
intervention," and are not aimed at Taiwan directly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS SHOULD BE ECONOMICS-ORIENTED: JOHN CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"The concept of cross-strait relations
should be 70 percent economics and trade-oriented and 30 percent
politics," said John Chang, chairman of the Chamber of Taiwan
Businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was foreign minister (1996-1997), secretary-general of
Kuomintang's Central Committee (1997-1999), secretary-general to the
president (1999), and senior advisor to the president (1999-2000), is
now dedicating his expertise achieved from long years in the
government and the party to the promotion of economic and trade
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency, Chang said
that distrust has blocked the channel of cross-strait exchanges. In a
recent visit to mainland China, he observed that without trust, the
chance to resume cross-strait dialogue is remote.</P>
      <P>"Mutual benefits can only be achieved through mutual support
based upon understanding and trust," Chang said.</P>
      <P>While a new round of discussions between the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan and the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) of mainland China is on hold, the Taiwan
businessmen's associations in mainland China have been functioning as
intermediaries, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>There are 64 such associations in mainland China, and many of
them have established good connections. "These associations are where
the Taiwan businessmen would turn in time of need," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the associations have taken up certain functions
comparable to those of a consulate, but their capabilities to solve
problems remain limited. "After all, these associations are not
authorized with official functions," he added.</P>
      <P>There are some 50,000 Taiwan businessmen investing in mainland
China, and the number is growing.</P>
      <P>"In the past years, Taiwan businessmen have sought their
opportunities in Southeast Asia, South America, South Africa and the
United States. When domestic investment environments become adverse,
businessmen need to find trade opportunities, sometimes even chances
of survival overseas.</P>
      <P>"Branching out is an irreversible trend, and it is better to work
out plans to coordinate the efforts of Taiwan businessmen and help
them solve problems," he said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that most Taiwan businessmen in mainland China
advocate an earlier relaxation of restrictions on direct trade,
transportation and postal links. He said that the government should
be able to find out a mutually supplementary and beneficiary
solution.</P>
      <P>Referring to government assistance to Taiwan businessmen, Chang
lauded the government's decision to allow local bank's offshore
banking units to handle cross-strait monetary businesses. At present,
funding is a very complicated process for Taiwan businessmen
investing in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said that during his conversations with Taiwan businessmen,
many have raised the issue of double-taxation by authorities on both
sides of the Strait. They hope that a formula can be worked out to
ease their tax burden.</P>
      <P>The Chamber of Taiwan Businessmen in China was set up late last
year under the initiative of leading political figures and chief
negotiators in cross-strait consultations in the past years.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the chamber remained low-key in their operations
at the beginning, expecting to reinforce their organization first.
The line-up of the board is impressive, with President of the
Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng and former Democratic Progressive
Party Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang as honorary chairmen and former SEF
vice chairman and secretary-general Chiu Cheyne as vice chairman.
Executives of Taiwan businessmen associations have all joined the
chamber.</P>
      <P>During his two visits to mainland China in December and May,
Chang met with ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, Beijing's Vice Premier
Qian Qichen and Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of
the State Council.</P>
      <P>The functions of the chamber are recognized, Chang said, adding
that with coordinated efforts, the chamber will play an active role
in cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-DRUG CRUSADE IS BATTLE WITHOUT BOUNDARIES OR END: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's crusade against illegal
drugs is a battle without boundaries or end, said Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of a national anti-drug conference
organized by the Ministry of Justice, Chang said the crusade against
illegal drugs should be a continuous battle which is taken to every
corner of the country and should have no limits or end.</P>
      <P>Calling illegal drugs one of the "three malignant tumors"
undermining the law and order of the island, Chang said illegal drugs
not only hurt the people who use them, but also harm their families
and society.</P>
      <P>The premier said that he was worried about the appearance of new
kinds of narcotics and the growing number of young addicts despite
the government's persistent efforts to rid the country of the
problem.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said it was because of the increased efforts of
law enforcement units that the United States has removed Taiwan from
its list of illegal drug transshipment points this year. He urged
drug enforcement officials not to let up in their anti-drug campaign.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan complained at the
same event that the government's anti-drug campaign is so poorly
organized that it looks like "a cart drawn by two horses (in
different directions)."</P>
      <P>He said the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice
and the National Police Administration under the Ministry of the
Interior were the government's two arms in combating illegal drugs.
Instead of cooperating with each other, Chen said, the two agencies
are often in competition and thereby foil the efforts of both.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said the prosecutors' offices under the Ministry
of Justice is the only agency charged by law to rehabilitate
convicted drug addicts, while the Department of Health, which is
better equipped to deal with the situation, is not required by law to
intercede.</P>
      <P>To better organize the nation's efforts to combat illegal drugs,
Chen advocated the establishment of an anti-drug agency to coordinate
the government's operations.</P>
      <P>The national anti-drug conference, which first met in 1984, is a
forum aimed at pooling government resources to fight the use and
distribution of illegal drugs. It is called alternately each year by
the Ministry of Justice, the Department of Health and the Ministry of
Education.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMY IS GOING AGAINST WORLD SLOWDOWN: VICE PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Lai In-jaw said Friday that
Taiwan's economy is "going against the current of the global economic
recession" and that the government is prepared to take measures to
tackle the situation.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Taiwan will also face the tough issue
of a sluggish economy given the fact that worldwide forecasts have
showed that the annual global economic growth rate will not exceed 5
percent for 2001, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Should the economies of the United States, the European Union and
Japan, which account for three-fourths of the global economy, remain
stagnant, it will be hard for the remaining one-fourth to "take off,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The vice premier made the remarks in a key-note speech at the
opening of a seminar held at Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the local economy has noticeably dropped as a
result of several economic and non-economic factors.</P>
      <P>Saying that long-standing difficulties in acquiring land, workers
and loans for small businesses is hindering the economy, Lai said
political woes are the major reason behind this circle of economic
recession at home. He also said that society has paid a price for the
disputes over the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant and the bi-weekly 84
work hour scheme.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether Taiwan will follow in Japan's
footsteps -- experiencing a 10-year economic recession -- Lai was
reserved but stressed that the current government led by President
Chen Shui-bian and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung will do its best to
rejuvenate the local economy.</P>
      <P>Lai outlined four major directions set by the government in its
efforts to address the economy: First, improve the local investment
climate; second, reduce the unemployment rate; third, increase
government spending on public investment projects; and fourth,
upgrade administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>Saying that the state-run Taiwan Power Company will no longer be
the only electricity supplier, the vice premier said the government
has to provide sufficient electricity for all factories around the
island. He noted that current power supply in Taiwan is sufficient,
although demand in the north is mostly met by power sent from the
south.</P>
      <P>He said the government will encourage the private sector to set
up power plants and promote a diversified energy policy to satisfy a
growing demand for power.</P>
      <P>While helping traditional businesses to diversify, Lai said the
government is also determined to promote start-up industries in
Taiwan, such as biotechnology, in the hope of creating broader
economic horizons for the country.</P>
      <P>Mirroring the view of Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh,
Lai said Taiwan businesses will be very successful as long as they
choose the right product to develop.</P>
      <P>Lai also pointed out that a sound financial environment is
closely linked to the development of the economy of Taiwan. In
addition to continuing to encourage bank mergers, he said that the
government is expected to establish a NT$120 billion fund aimed at
helping money-losing banking institutions consolidate.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of how to lower the rising jobless rate, he
said the government's NT$810 billion economic stimulus plan will help
and that major investment plans will be handled in the future on a
case-by-case basis by government agencies in charge.</P>
      <P>In the face of these big challenges, the vice premier said that
all the people of Taiwan need to work together with the government.
Stressing that Taiwan's past economic progress was not made only by
the government, Lai said he hoped that the government and the private
sector would join forces to find ways to expand the economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT PILGRIMAGE TRIP FROM TAIWAN TO MAINLAND VIA KINMEN DELAYED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first direct religious pilgrimage from
Taiwan to Xiamen via Taiwan-controlled Kinmen, scheduled to depart
Saturday, has been postponed for six days.</P>
      <P>The "Kinmen Express" was originally scheduled to carry 370
pilgrims from Kaohsiung to Xiamen via Kinmen Saturday for a six-day
trip. The pilgrims are from the Chupaokung Temple of Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>This would be the first direct voyage for religious purposes from
Taiwan to the mainland via Kinmen after the implementation of the
"mini three links" between the offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu
and mainland China's coastal cities in early January.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the owner of the "Kinmen Express" said that the
schedule was changed because they had been notified by Xiamen
authorities that it would be "unlikely to complete the procedures in
time."</P>
      <P>After consultations, the spokesman said, the departure date has
been tentatively rescheduled for June 8.</P>
      <P>Under the new schedule, the "Kinmen Express" will reach Kinmen's
Liaolo Harbor from Kaohsiung on the morning of June 6. All passengers
are required to complete customs procedures in Kinmen before leaving
for Xiamen.</P>
      <P>After carrying pilgrims to Xiamen, the ship will return to Kinmen
and then go to Xiamen to pick up the passengers June 13.</P>

try and shore up diplomatic ties -- scrambled to call on Macedonian

moving to normalize ties with Beijing, thus severing relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tien met Thursday with Macedonian Premier Ljubco Georgievski to
exchange views on bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Georgievski presided over the opening of diplomatic ties between
the two countries in 1999 and visited the island in June of that

      <P>Macedonia's Foreign Minister, Ilinka Mitreva, told a news

Thursday that the normalization of relations with Beijing will

      <P>Taipei diplomats have predicted that war-ravaged Macedonia is in
no hurry to reestablish ties with Beijing and Taipei should be able

      <P>Skopje forged diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1999 and became

(By Chen You-chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian flew to Honduras from Paraguay Friday for a two-day
state visit aimed at further strengthening bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Honduras President Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse, accompanied by
key Cabinet ministers, greeted Chen at a military airport outside
Tegucigalpa, the nation's capital. The ROC head of state was welcomed
with a trumpet fanfare, complete with a 21-gun salute and full
military honors.</P>
      <P>Flores said in his welcoming speech that ROC-Honduras relations
are cordial and solid. "We believe President Chen's visit will
further boost bilateral cooperation in various fields," he added.
Flores also invited Chen to jointly review the Honduras military
honor guard at the welcoming ceremony.</P>
      <P>More than 100 overseas Chinese representatives also showed up at
the airport to greet Chen and his entourage.</P>
      <P>Later, ROC Ambassador Chang ching-yen briefed Chen on Honduras'
general situation. Chang told the president that as public order is
bad here, the ROC Embassy maintains close contact with Honduras
police authorities to protect the safety of ROC expatriates in the
Central American state.</P>
      <P>In the evening, Chen paid a visit to Flores at the Presidential
Office for wide-ranging talks. The two leaders exchanged decorations
to signify the close relationship between the two countries. Flores
also hosted a state banquet in honor of Chen and his entourage.</P>
      <P>Chen will sign a joint communique and hold a joint press
conference with Flores, as well as receiving an honorary doctoral
degree from a noted Honduras university before ending his goodwill
visit to Honduras Saturday.</P>
      <P>Honduras is the last leg of Chen's current five-nation diplomatic
journey to Latin America, which has already taken him to El Salvador,
Guatemala, Panama and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to make an overnight transit stop in Houston,
Texas on his way home. Rep. Thomas D. DeLay, also the Republican
Party whip in the U.S. House of Representatives, will meet Chen
during his stopover in Houston.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-BORN OFFICER TO SERVE AS U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND SPOKESWOMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-born American naval officer
will become a spokeswoman for the U.S. Pacific Command from July,
military sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Jensin W. Sommer, who was born in the southern Taiwan county of
Yunlin and moved to the United States with her family at the age of
seven, told CNA in an interview that she will be very pleased to take
her new assignment in Hawaii next month.</P>
      <P>"Hawaii is closer to Taiwan, where I still have many relatives,"
said Sommer, who is now a naval press officer at the U.S. Department
of Defense.</P>
      <P>Sommer, whose maiden name is Weng Jenhsin, graduated from the
U.S. Naval Academy 10 years ago and was promoted to lieutenant
commander Friday. She also received a master's degree in political
science from a Catholic university in Washington, D.C. earlier this
week.</P>
      <P>Sommer's father, Weng Yi-hsiung, recalled that he and his wife
often used to take their daughter to the U.S. Naval Academy in
Maryland for pleasure trips on holidays during her childhood.</P>
      <P>"Jensin was always impressed by the brilliance and smartness of
the white uniforms of the female cadets. This might be a reason
behind her decision to pursue a military career," said Weng, who
works for the public health department of the Maryland State
Government.</P>
      <P>Weng originally took part in U.S. Navy-sponsored subtropical
diseases research programs in Taiwan. In 1976, he came to the United
States for advanced study on a U.S. Navy scholarship and later
obtained U.S. residency.</P>
      <P>Sommer described herself as lucky to have been able to grow up in
the United States, adding that she chose a military career partly out
of her wish to contribute to the country. Her husband is also a Navy
Academy graduate.</P>
      <P>She further said she has fond memories of her childhood in Taiwan
and that part of her mind and heart "will be left in Taiwan" forever.</P>
      <P>Sommer said she is always very happy whenever she reads or hears
of information about Taiwan. "I also take pride in Taiwan's progress
in various fields in recent years," she added.</P>
      <P>In the future, she said she hopes she can do something to help
boost Taiwan-U.S. relations. She last visited her Taiwan relatives in
1994. During her studies at the U.S. Naval Academy, she and several
of her classmates also once visited Taiwan under the arrangement of
Taiwan's naval authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO CARRY OUT EXISTING ACCORDS WITH PARAGUAY: ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said Friday that the ROC government will continue any
agreement with Paraguay and will form an inter-ministry committee to
push for trade with the Southern Common Market.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a joint press conference with Paraguay
President Luis Angel Gonzalez Macchi.</P>
      <P>Chen said that any agreement signed during former ROC President
Lee Teng-hui's visit to Paraguay, including helping with the
construction of the second cross-Paraguay River bridge and forming an
industrial zone in Paraguay, will be carried out by his
administration.</P>
      <P>An ROC Export Processing Zone Administration (EPZA) delegation,
led by head Chou Yen, is currently in Paraguay to exchange views with
the Paraguayan government on the establishment and management of an
industrial zone there.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC should take active measures, including setting
up an inter-ministry committee, to help Paraguay develop its economy
and make it a doorway through which the ROC can gain access to the
Southern Common Market.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Gonzalez conferred a National Merit Order of Marshall
Francisco Solano Lopez in Chain Grade, Paraguay's highest civic
honor, on Chen. Before the conferring ceremony, the two heads of
state signed a joint communique stressing the strengthening of
cooperation and exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Gonzalez praised Chen for his efforts
to strengthen the friendly relations between the peoples of the two
countries, saying the notion of the "all people's government"
advocated by Chen has surpassed the ROC's boundaries and has reached
Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Gonzalez also lauded Chen for his achievements in human rights,
as well as the promotion of democracy and freedom of speech in the
ROC. He expressed confidence that the two countries will continue to
join hands to create a more prosperous future.</P>
      <P>Chen for his part noted that he last visited Paraguay five years
ago when he was the mayor of Taipei City, and added that he was much
impressed by the enthusiasm of the people as well as the abundant
natural resources of the South American country.</P>
      <P>He added that during his most recent visit, he gained a great
deal from talks with Gonzalez on matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that since Paraguay and the ROC established
diplomatic ties in 1957, the two countries have maintained a close
and friendly relationship. He said both the two countries have
proceeded with political reform, implemented constitutional democracy
and have won acclaim from the international community.</P>
      <P>Chen wound up his visit to Paraguay and flew to Honduras later
that day to continue his five-nation Latin American trip. Honduras is
the last leg of his tour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND MUM ON REPORTS OF U.S. AIRCRAFT CARRIER EN ROUTE TO TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
declined to comment Saturday on reports that the U.S. aircraft
carrier Carl Vinson is sailing toward the Taiwan Strait as mainland
China is conducting war games opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a local cable TV station, the USS Carl Vinson was
about 350 nautical miles from Taiwan as of press time, although the
vessel's official website placed it just off the coast of Southern
California and under way for the Western Pacific. The report quoted
unidentified U.S. sources as saying that the aircraft carrier is on a
routine training mission.</P>
      <P>Despite all evidence to the contrary, however, the TV station
speculated that the battleship's voyage "toward the Taiwan Strait"
might be related to mainland China's current large-scale exercises on
its offshore Dongshan Island near Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, MND officials said they have no
knowledge about the USS Carl Vinson's current activities. They
stressed only that the MND has been keeping tabs on mainland China's
military activities and will continue to monitor the situation very
closely.</P>
      <P>An MND official further said it is the ministry's established
policy to refrain from commenting on U.S. warships' activities on the
high seas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said Friday that the war
games currently being conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
opposite Taiwan are "not unusual."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An exhibition of a collection of Taiwanese
aboriginal artifacts collected by Canadian missionary doctor George
Leslie Mackay more than a century ago opened in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>The rare exhibit sheds light on the life and culture of Taiwan's
indigenous people before the entry of foreign cultures, organizers
said.</P>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui cut the ribbon to
open the show at Shunyi Taiwan Aborigines Museum at Waishuanghsi in
suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee lauded Mackay for his dedicated services to Taiwan. "He
helped sow the seeds of Western education and modern civilization in
Taiwan. His contributions won him the Taiwan people's eternal respect
and remembrance," the former president said.</P>
      <P>Lee further said he is very pleased to see the exhibition of
Mackay's collection of Taiwanese aboriginal artifacts, which offer
local people a rare glimpse into the cultural achievements of the
island's indigenous people more than a century ago.</P>
      <P>Also present at the opening ceremony were Isqaqavut Yohani,
chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Aboriginal Affairs, some of
Mackay's offspring and officials of the Canadian representative
office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>On display are 202 aboriginal artifacts, including costume
accessories, headdresses used in wedding ceremonies, badges,
utensils, belts, weapons, musical instruments, animal fossils and
other articles.</P>
      <P>Only 10 of the exhibits are provided by domestic cultural groups
and all the other 192 items are on loan from the Royal Ontario Museum
of Canada.</P>
      <P>The exhibits from the Canadian museum were brought to Canada by
Mackay in 1893 when he made a visit to his homeland, organizers said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is one of a series of activities marking the 100th
anniversary of Mackay's death in Taiwan on June 2, 1901. Mackay came
to Taiwan in 1872 at the age of 28 as a missionary for the Canadian
Presbyterian Church.</P>
      <P>Mackay preached, educated and provided medical services to the
people of Taiwan until his death at the age of 57. His grave is
located at Oxford Village in Tamsui, a scenic coastal town on the
outskirts of Taipei. Mackay married a Taiwan woman with whom he had
three children and their offspring now live in Canada, the United
States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the Republic of China's Directorate General of Post

      <P>Visiting Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the ROC government and
people appreciate Honduras' longtime support for Taiwan's bid to
upgrade its international profile.</P>
      <P>"We are grateful for your support for our national cause in the
international arena," Chen said after receiving a decoration from
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony held at the Honduran Presidential Office, Flores
decorated Chen with the Order of Francisco Morazon in the rank of
Great Cross in recognition of his contribution to promoting relations
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In return, Chen conferred the Order of Brilliant Jade with Grand
Cordon on Flores. It is the highest honor the ROC government can
present to a foreign head of state.</P>
      <P>Chen, who took office in Taiwan's first-ever democratic transfer
of power between different political parties last May, noted that
both the ROC and Honduras have transformed from authoritarian rule to
democracy.</P>
      <P>"Honduras began its political democratization 20 years and its
major political parties have since taken turns in ruling the
country," Chen noted, adding that Taiwan has something to learn from
Honduras in this regard as "party rotation" in government is still in
its early stages in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that he and Flores have many things in common,
including their age and legislative experience. Noting that Flores
enjoys an approval rating of about 80 percent, Chen said he will take
advantage of his current visit to learn from Flores' political
achievements.</P>
      <P>After the decoration ceremony, Flores hosted a state banquet in
honor of Chen and his entourage, to which were invited government

Honduras which was the last stop of his 12-day trip to Latin America.</P>
      <P>At a news conference at Tegucigalpa before his departure from
Honduras Saturday, Chen said his government is working for the best
but prepared for the worst regarding the ROC's relationship with
Macedonia. The Balkan nation is reportedly preparing to switch its
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taipei-Skopje ties have been "bumpy" from the very
beginning and "never smooth" ever since, Chen said Taipei will make a
last-ditch effort to keep its diplomatic ties with Macedonia but will
not do so if the dignity of the nation is compromised in the process.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has been kept informed of the latest developments by
Minster of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao. Tien left Chen's entourage
in Panama to fly to Skopje on May 30 to meet Macedonian leaders in an
attempt to steady ties with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>As to the island's ties with Panama, Chen said Panamanian
President Mireya Elisa Moscoso Rodriguez assured him of her country's
firm support for the ROC during their meeting on May 29 in Panama
City despite reports that Panama might be persuaded by China to
switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing.</P>

      <P>June will be a busy month for exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with Minister of Economic
Affairs Lin Hsin-yi and two other officials visiting the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin will travel to Shanghai via Hong Kong Monday for the meeting

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S MILITARY DRILLS CONTAIN GREATER POLITICAL MEANING: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's military drills on Dongshan
Island off its southeastern coast, opposite Taiwan, carry more
political meaning than military importance, local scholars said
Sunday at a seminar.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-chu, a professor of international relations at Chinese
Culture University, said mainland China usually holds military
exercises under three circumstances. First, to demonstrate its
determination to cope with a crisis; second, to show its
dissatisfaction toward a certain issue; and third, to conduct routine
military exercises.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland China's ongoing military drills on Dongshan
Island, code-named "Liberation One," are not simply regular military
drills, instead, they are more of a declaration of policy.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the "Liberation One" code-name was only used
by mainland China in the 1950s-1960s, and did not even appear during
the years when former President Lee Teng-hui was in office.</P>
      <P>Judging from the timing and scale of the drills, Chen said the
military movements represent a conclusion by Beijing toward President
Chen Shui-bian following one year of observation.</P>
      <P>When President Chen was inaugurated as the ROC's 10th president
May 20 last year and announced his "five noes" in his inaugural
address to show his goodwill to mainland China, the Beijing
leadership responded by saying that it would "listen to Chen's words
and watch his deeds" to see if Chen, a long-time supporter of the
pro-Taiwan independence movement, would be true to his words.</P>
      <P>Professor Chen further predicted that mainland China will not
make any major moves against Taiwan until the island's legislative
elections slated for December, but pointed out that Beijing will not
remain silent or do nothing. He said he is pessimistic about the
future of Taiwan-mainland ties.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chen's view, Yang Kai-huang, a professor of political
science at Soochow University, said that Beijing has set a "final
tone" toward President Chen.</P>
      <P>Yang said the timing of mainland China's "Liberation One"
military drills carry a high degree of political meaning and that
Beijing is also exaggerating the importance of the drills.</P>
      <P>In essence, Yang said the current Dongshan military drills
contain a greater political meaning than military significance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AND MAINLAND CHINA MAY COOPERATE IN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-strait cooperation may improve in
the oil and gas industry as mainland China's state-run oil companies
have asked Taiwan's state-owned oil company for technological support
for a natural gas storage station to be built in Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>According to sources from Taiwan's state-run Chinese Petroleum
Corp. (CPC), the company's vice president, Hsieh Jung-hui, is heading
for Beijing to meet with CEOs of China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC), China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) and China
Petrochemical Corp. to discuss the details of cooperation.</P>
      <P>The CNOOC is planing to cooperate with British Petroleum to
construct a natural gas storage station in Shenzhen, in mainland
China's southeastern Guangdong province, to supply the energy needs
of the Guangdong area and Shenzhen's industrial zones.</P>
      <P>Considering the CPC's rich experience in building natural gas
receiving and storage stations, the CNOOC has asked the CPC for
personnel support and technological advice.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the fact that both sides of the Strait speak the same
language would help make cooperation easier, but said that any
agreements would be subject to approval by the ROC Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Besides the natural gas sector, both sides of the Taiwan Strait
may study the possibility of further cooperation in the oil and gas
industry, including oil trading and setting up oil storage and
distribution centers in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The two sides have already tried cross-strait trade on a small
scale. The CPC attempted to sell diesel fuel to mainland China on a
trial basis via some Hong Kong trading companies, but with limited
success because of the many obstacles the CPC had to try to overcome.</P>
      <P>As mainland China urgently needs diesel fuel, especially in the
industrially advanced eastern and southern areas, the CNPC and China
Petrochemical Corp. have been trying to source oil supplies from
outside China.</P>
      <P>Considering the huge diesel fuel market in mainland China,
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan's private oil company, the Formosa
Group, are actively acting to get a piece of the oil supply
contracts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's CPC says that mainland China has shown an interest in
working with them, according to CPC sources.</P>
      <P>After recently attending an Asian petrochemical conference held
in Taiwan, the CNPC's vice president and China Petrochemical's
chairman visited the CPC and had a meeting with Pan Wen-yen, the
CPC's president.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan opened the local market to private oil companies,
diesel fuel production by the CPC and the Formosa Group has exceeded
demand in the Taiwan market. The companies have had to export some
400 million kiloliters of diesel oil annually to other countries.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the possibility of cross-strait cooperation in the
oil and gas industry, Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi said
it is natural that Taiwan oil companies would seek overseas markets
since their production is now outpacing local demand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, June 3 (CNA): Taiwan's exports to the United States
posted a 3.25 percent negative growth in the first quarter compared
with a year ago, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Board of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>During the same period, mainland China led the four "Asian little
tigers" in terms of export growth to the United States with a growth
of 12.28 percent, followed by South Korea with 6.1 percent, and
Singapore at negative 2.84 percent. But Taiwan's export performance
was better than Hong Kong which posted a 9.54 percent negative growth
rate.</P>
      <P>Officials at the BOFT said that Taiwan products accounted for
only 2.97 percent of the U.S. market during the same period, a
decrease of 0.25 percent from the previous year, compared to
mainland's share of 7.57 percent, South Korea's 3.19 percent,
Singapore's 1.41 percent and Hong Kong's 0.8 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The BOFT officials attributed the shrinking Taiwan exports to the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN'S  NEW 'FIVE NOES' NOT CREATIVE ENOUGH: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   3   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's latest
pronouncement on cross-strait relations is not creative enough to
break through the cross-strait stalemate, scholars said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The scholars made the remarks at a seminar on the effect of
Chen's new "five noes" policy on cross-strait relations. The seminar
was sponsored by the Cross-strait Cultural Exchange Association.</P>
      <P>The president announced the policy while visiting Guatemala
during his five-nation Latin American trip last week. The policy
refers to no provocation, no misjudgment, no pawn of any other
countries, no zero-sum game and no stop to efforts at improving
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Professor Kuo Chan-li of National Taiwan Ocean University said
the new "five noes" is a pragmatic and expedient pronouncement in the
new changing landscape of triangular relations among Taipei,
Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the president extended his goodwill and maintained the
dignity of the nation when he pronounced the "five noes." But Kuo
said that the idea still lacks vision and creativity.</P>
      <P>Kuo noted that the domestic economic slump, the exodus of
businesses and capital from Taiwan, the weak stock market, rising
unemployment, and diplomatic setbacks may all be related to unstable
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Assistant professor Liang Chung-ming of Fu Jen University said
that the new "five noes" are in line with the Chen administration's
policy, but that the announcement only gives it a new interpretation.</P>
      <P>Liang said the new definition from the U.S. administration of
George W. Bush that sees China as a "strategic competitor" rather
than a "strategic partner" is also a reason behind Taiwan's promotion
of its new "five noes" policy.</P>
      <P>Professor Pan Hsi-tang of Tamkang University said that Chen's
policy aims to break the cross-strait stalemate, makes clear the
new administration's stance of no provocation and solicits the
support of the international community to counter Beijing's efforts
to stifle Taiwan diplomatically.</P>
      <P>Pan noted that when the president first unveiled the "five noes"
in his inaugural speech last year, Beijing was not satisfied, but
neither could it find any excuse to use the statement against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If one year later, the president is still sticking to his stance
of "not doing anything," Pan said, it is not a creative way to
improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The original "five noes" were: no declaration of Taiwan
independence if Beijing renounced the use of force, no change of the
name of the Republic of China, no introduction of "state-to-state
relationship" theory into the Constitution, no referendum on the
issue of independence (of Taiwan) versus unification (with China),
and no abrogation of the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Pan suggested that to break the cross-strait stalemate, the
president will have to address Beijing's cherished "one China"
principle squarely even if he doesn't like it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The current Beijing leadership should allow
greater democracy in mainland China to help create a promising future
for its people and build positive relations with Taiwan, an expert on
mainland affairs said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the Kuomintang's Mainland Affairs
Department, said that the 1989 crackdown on the unarmed pro-democracy
students in Beijing's Tiananmen Square was a major factor which has
driven the Chinese communists toward a more open society.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a seminar organized by several
foundations to mark the 12th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen
crackdown.</P>
      <P>The veteran mainland China affairs expert called on the present
Beijing leadership to outperform their predecessors by "first making
some people democratic and rich." Should current Beijing leaders move
toward that direction, it would produce a very significant meaning
for mainland Chinese people and in cross-strait ties, Chang added.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Taiwan should use democracy to improve
mainland China. While Taiwan is seeking to become the standard of
democracy for the entire Chinese people, the island also needs to
make greater progress in social stability and economic development to
underline the values of democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>Since mainland Chinese leaders are proud of having achieved
noticeable economic progress in coastal provinces, they should also
be confident of promoting democracy elsewhere on the mainland, he
said, adding that mainland China is still behind Taiwan in
establishing a democratic system.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Secretary-General of the Presidential Office
Yu Shyi-kun on Sunday accused an opposition lawmaker of "inflating
his significance" by claiming to be an emissary of President Chen
Shui-bian to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Yu was referring to Legislator Elmer Fung of the New Party, who
alleged that he was asked several times by Chen Che-nan, the deputy
secretary-general of the Presidential Office, to convey the
president's goodwill to Beijing leaders.</P>
      <P>In a news conference held earlier in the day, Fung blamed
President Chen for reneging on his promises to pursue Taiwan's
eventual reunificiation with mainland China to the detriment of ties
with Beijing.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Fung played a tape he said contained
conversations between him and Chen Che-nan to support his claim that
he was asked by President Chen, through Chen Che-nan, to convey the
president's goodwill.</P>
      <P>Fung said he was asked to tell Beijing leaders that President
Chen meant "reunification" when he vowed to pursue a frame of
"political integration" in his new year message.</P>
      <P>The pro-reunification lawmaker also claimed that Chen Che-nan
told him that President Chen's administration will open direct trade
and transportation links with mainland China as soon as the
"controversy of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant is sorted out."</P>
      <P>Fung said the president pulled the rug from under his feet by
reneging on his promises after Fung relayed the messages to Beijing
as the president had asked.</P>
      <P>Fung said the president disappointed him and the Beijing leaders
afterward by telling a conference of the World Federation of
Taiwanese Associations that the "integration" is an extention of
former President Lee Teng-hui's advocacy of "a special
state-to-state" relationship between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Fung, a diehard opponent of Taiwan independence, caused an outcry
in Taiwan's political circles Friday by claiming that he was asked on
12 occasions by Chen Che-nan to convey messages to Beijing for the
president.</P>
      <P>Instead of being a secret emissary as he has been called by the
local press, Fung said Sunday that he should be called a messenger
who has done his utmost to faithfully relay messages for the
president even though the president meant only 1 percent of what he
said.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan said Fung was trying to increase the significance of
his trip to mainland China by claiming to be the president's
emissary. He did say in a statement Sunday that he had met Fung many
times in Fung's office at Fung's request.</P>
      <P>As a president's aide in charge of communicating with lawmakers,
Chen Che-nan said it is only natural for him to encourage any effort
by anyone to improve the island's ties with Beijing, but he said he
never authorized Fung on the president's behalf to talk to Beijing as
an envoy.</P>
      <P>He said he didn't know where Fung's tape came from but stopped
short of denying its authenticity.</P>
      <P>Yu, Chen Che-nan's immediate superior, supported him by saying
that Chen was set up.</P>
      <P>He blamed Fung for engineered the whole event in a futile attempt
to flout his own importance.</P>
      <P>Instead of backing down from promises to open direct trade links
with mainland China, Yu said the government is moving in this
direction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP LU FAILS TO SHOW FOR COURT APPOINTMENT REGARDING LIBEL SUIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu did not show up
Monday at a court room to which she was summoned by Taipei District
Court judges for debate with "secret witnesses" regarding the libel
suit she filed against the Journalist.</P>
      <P>Lu's attorney You Mei-nu said it was not necessary for the
Republic of China vice president to appear in person at the court on
the grounds that Lu cannot "debate" with the two "secret witnesses"
since she does not know them personally.</P>
      <P>On the other side, Wang Chien-chuang, president of the
Journalist, a weekly magazine, lodged a severe protest against the
Taipei District Court for the exposure of the two "secret witnesses."</P>
      <P>Wang said the two secret witnesses -- Tseng Chao-ming, a
secretary at the Presidential Office, and Chen Shih-ning, who
co-authored President Chen Shui-bian's book "The Son of Taiwan" --
have demonstrated the greatest possible courage by being willing to
step forward to testify against a formidable rival in the form of the
ROC vice president.</P>
      <P>Wang said the exposure of Tseng and Chen's identity is the result
of the plaintiff's -- the vice president's -- plan to undermine the
effectiveness of the witnesses' testimonies.</P>
      <P>It was learned that the Journalist became willing to allow Tseng
and Chen to testify after Vice President Lu declared in early May
that she would appear at a court debate involving her and "witnesses"
if there were any.</P>
      <P>The clash between Lu and the weekly began some six months ago
when the Journalist published in its Nov. 16 issue an article that
made the accusation that the vice president on Nov. 3 contacted "a
senior member of the media" -- later revealed to be Yang Chao -- to
spread a rumor in order to smear President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Lu argued that she never made the alleged call and sued the
magazine for libel.</P>
      <P>According to Lu's lawyers, the weekly showed "actual malice" in
printing a "libelous" cover headline and story. The team also accused
the magazine of alleging that Lu wanted to use the presidential
scandal to "finish off" the president.</P>
      <P>The Journalist claims that there is "sufficient reason" to
believe in the accuracy of its report and that the magazine "went to
great pains" to "reasonably" verify the facts before publishing the
article.</P>
      <P>Wrapping up Monday's hearing -- the seventh of its kind since
last November, without any apparent results, judges of the Taipei
District Court decided that another session be scheduled June 9.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOBACCO AND WINE BOARD SAYS IT'S PREPARING FOR COMPETITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Board (TTWB)
said Monday that it is preparing to develop market-oriented products
to face up to the steep competition expected after the liberalization
of domestic alcohol and tobacco production.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance last week announced the timetable for
liberalizing alcohol and tobacco production, with the lifting of
restrictions on local production occurring in three stages over two
years, which is one year quicker than its original plan of lifting
restrictions in four stages over three years.</P>
      <P>According to the new timetable, the first stage will see the
liberalizing of the production of rice wine, liqueur using fruits,
and brews other than beer.</P>
      <P>The second stage will see the liberalizing of the production of
cooking wine; distillers such as whisky, brandy and
vodka; and other liqueurs. The third stage will see the lifting of
all remaining restrictions.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-kai, TTWB deputy director, predicted that a lot of local
producers will pop up after the liberalization, especially in regions
that produce fruits, rice or other cereals.</P>
      <P>A lot of small breweries and distilleries will appear, but only a
few will be able to become large-scale, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Faced with the imminent competition, Chen said that he still has
confidence in the board's products, pointing out that producing high
quality alcoholic beverages is an art and a culture. He noted that
producing alcoholic beverages is easy but that producing them on a
large scale while maintaining a high level of quality is difficult.</P>
      <P>The TTWB enjoys an edge over any of the potential newcomers
because of its long history, strong capabilities, and rich
experience, he added.</P>
      <P>But Chen also admitted that the TTWB is bound to feel the impact
of the liberalization as consumers will have more varied options.</P>
      <P>Chen said the board will monitor the needs of the market in
developing new products and adjusting the flavor of its present
products in order to keep in tune with changing tastes as well as
step up its marketing and distribution networks in the face of the
expected competition.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight members of the labor union of Taiwan
Motor Transport Co. (TMTC) began a three-day hunger strike Monday in
front of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications building
in order to highlight their "cause of justice."</P>
      <P>Tsai Wan-hsiung, chairman of the TMTC labor union, and nearly one
hundred union members renewed their protests Monday against the
Transportation and Communications Ministry's policies on TMTC's
privatization, with eight of the union members deciding to begin a
hunger strike to further stress their cause.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the labor union is not at all against the
company's privatization but that it is opposed to the nature of the
policy which is resulting in many TMTC staff workers losing their
jobs. The TMTC staff workers' rights of employment and survival
should be firmly protected in the privatization process, Tsai
stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications said TMTC's privatization will by no means be altered
by any form of opposition.</P>
      <P>Kuokuang Motor Transport Co. has already been established, mainly
with former management and workers of TMTC, and the new company is
scheduled to become operational July 1, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They added that it is a pity some of those at TMTC do not
appreciate the efforts of the ministry and the goodwill of its
privatization policy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN GETS TASTE OF TEXAS ON HOUSTON TRANSIT STOP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Houston, Texas, June 3 (CNA)
(By Chen You-chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian got a taste of Texan hospitality Sunday on his
historic transit stop in Houston.</P>
      <P>Republican Tom DeLay, who represents a Houston area constituency
and is the majority whip in the House of Representatives, hosted
a lunch for Chen at Houston's Taste of Texas steak house and then
took him to a professional baseball game.</P>
      <P>After munching on a steak, Chen grinned with delight and showed a
clenched fist to hundreds of cheering supporters as he emerged from
the restaurant.</P>
      <P>Chen, wearing a cowboy hat and a western-style bolo tie, showed
off a pair of custom-made black eel-skin boots, inlaid with his
initials and crossed with the flags of the United States and Texas.
The boots were a gift from DeLay, the third-ranking Republican in the
House.</P>
      <P>Three other House members from Texas -- Republican Kevin Brady
and Democrats Gene Green and Sheila Jackson Lee also attended the
steak lunch meeting with President Chen.</P>
      <P>Later, Chen and DeLay sat behind home plate at Enron Field, home
of the Houston Astros baseball team who was playing the Los Angeles
Dodgers. Chen, wearing an Astros baseball cap, stayed for five
innings.</P>
      <P>Chen waved to hundreds of flag-waving supporters from the local
Taiwanese community who turned out to greet him and chanted "Taiwan,
Yes" during the game.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a smaller group of demonstrators, organized by the
Greater Houston Supporting One China Alliance, waved mainland Chinese
flags and chanted pro-one China slogans during the game. Police kept
the two groups apart and did not report any scuffles.</P>
      <P>In the evening, Chen hosted a dinner in honor of U.S.
congressmen, overseas Chinese community representatives and members
of his entourage.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Chen said despite mainland China's
constant efforts to isolate Taiwan from the international community,
the ROC and the 23 million people of Taiwan do not feel lonely
because of the friendship of many U.S. congressional members.</P>
      <P>For his part, DeLay said he is convinced that Chen's Houston
transit stop can help boost substantive Taiwan-U.S. relations.
Houston is Taipei' first sister city.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC is an important country and democratic model
in the Asia-Pacific region, DeLay said the common values shared by
Taiwan and the United States would contribute to further growth in
bilateral cooperation in the future.</P>
      <P>DeLay said he had informed the U.S. Department of State of his
plan to meet Chen during his Houston transit stop. The State
Department has been supportive of his plan, DeLay said, adding that
the State Department's attitude shows its support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Houston Saturday evening on his way back to
Taipei after a five-nation diplomatic journey to Latin America, which
took him to El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay and Honduras.</P>
      <P>DeLay said he does not think that Chen's Latin American tour was
provocative to mainland China. He stressed that the United States
should treat the ROC with dignity and that cross-strait issues should
be resolved by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>DeLay further said Taiwan and the United States should strengthen
military cooperation in order to maintain regional peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>On Sunday morning, Houston Mayor Lee P. Brown paid a courtesy
call on Chen at the Double Tree Hotel. Texas Deputy Secretary of
State Jeffery Cornner presented a Texas state flag and an honorary
Texas citizen certificate to Chen Saturday night on behalf of the
Texas state governor.</P>
      <P>During a 50-minute talk with four U.S. congressmen and seven
senior Taiwan business executives who are accompanying Chen on his
current visit, Chen pledged to help promote Taiwan-U.S. trade. He
also promised to push for the 2003 Joint Conference of the ROC-USA
and US-ROC Business Councils to be held in Houston.</P>
      <P>On his way to Latin America in late May, Chen also made a
two-night transit stop in New York, making him the first sitting ROC
head of state to visit the Big Apple.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage will leave Houston late Sunday for home,
ending his 16-day overseas trip, the second of its kind since Chen
took office in the ROC's first democratic transfer of power between
different political parties May 20, 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRATIZATION THE ONLY WAY TO REDRESS TIANANMEN INJUSTICE: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's democratization is the
prerequisite to the success of redressing the 1989 Tiananmen
Massacre, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma said hopes are dim for present Beijing leaders to right the
wrongs that the mainland Chinese authorities committed during the
June 4 crackdown on student-led democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square 12 years ago.</P>
      <P>A Kuomintang stalwart, Ma said Taiwan has experienced similar
political terrors such as the "Feb. 28 Incident" more than five
decades ago, but the Republic of China government in recent years has
tried to compensate the people affected by the tragedy, including
offering public apologies and cash compensation through a democratic
process.</P>
      <P>Ma said that only in a democratic nation or society, when the
government clearly makes a mistake that results in suffering of
innocent people, it is possible for the government to admit its
wrongdoing and have the affected people's names cleared through a
democratic process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former mainland Chinese student dissident Wu'er Kaixi,
who is now a citizen of the Republic of China, remembered the
Tiananmen Massacre and ridiculed some political figures in Taiwan as
clowns for their "strangely amiable sentiment" toward the Beijing
authorities.</P>
      <P>Wu'er Kaixi, who married his Taiwanese schoolmate from Dominican
University in California in 1994, said certain Taiwanese political
figures are making fools of themselves when they openly demonstrate
support for Beijing leaders on certain cross-strait issues, mainly as
a result of their unexplainable phobia of Beijing and illusions of
mainland China's huge market potential.</P>
      <P>The former student leader who fled to the United States after the
1989 military crackdown of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing,
reminded the Taiwan public to cherish their "good fortune" of being
able to live in a democratic society like Taiwan, where at least the
government would not deal with its own people with tanks and machine
guns.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD SUGGESTS SCRAPPING MINIMUM MONTHLY WAGE TO ADOPT HOURLY PAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is better to scrap the minimum monthly
wage and adopt an hourly minimum pay scale, an official of the
nation's top economic planning agency said Monday.</P>
      <P>Y. L. Liu, director of the Manpower Planning Department under the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said that the
minimum hourly wage should be set at more than NT$66 (US$1.94) per
hour in line with the shortened working hours implemented beginning
this year.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks ahead of a planned meeting to be convened by
the Council for Labor Affairs (CLA) to review basic wage issues later
this month. Major labor and management groups have been invited to
participate in the meeting.</P>
      <P>CLA sources said that the council is planning to suggest that the
minimum monthly wage be raised to NT$16,377 (US$480) from the current
NT$15,840 (US$465), or an increase of 3.39 percent. The proposal will
be presented to labor and management groups to be used as a reference
for negotiations. The minimum monthly wage of NT$15,840 has been in
effect for three years.</P>
      <P>Foreign workers in Taiwan now receive pay in line with the
minimum monthly wage. If the CLA's proposal of a 3.39 percent
increase is passed, then employers as a whole will incur an annual
wage increase of NT$2.06 billion (US$60.41 million) judging from the
estimated 320,000 foreign laborers currently in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu, who will be a member of the planned review meeting, said
that in view of the current economic slump, basic wages should not be
raised further.</P>
      <P>She noted that most other countries have adopted a minimum hourly
wage and said that Taiwan should no longer base pay on a monthly
minimum salary, but should adopt an hourly system.</P>
      <P>She calculated that laborers used to work 48 hours a week, and
that this will mean a minimum hourly wage of NT$66 if the monthly
minimum is set at NT$15,840. As employers also have to pay for
weekends, workers would get around NT$3,696 per week.</P>
      <P>If a new system is implemented and a laborer maintains 48 working
hours a week, the minimum monthly wage could be raised to NT$16,363.
But if a worker works 42 hours a week, then the minimum monthly wage
would be cut to NT$14,344.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has proposed a minimum hourly wage before, suggesting
that hourly pay should be raised to NT$74 per hour, but in light of
the current economic slowdown, it no longer advocates this amount,
but instead said it should be somewhere above NT$66 per hour.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of people in Taiwan do not
favor abolishing the death penalty, according to the results of a
public opinion poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,213 adult residents randomly chosen
from around the island, conducted by the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) from May 23-24, found
that 71.1 percent of the respondents oppose a proposal to abolish the
death penalty.</P>
      <P>Only 11.7 percent said they "strongly supported" or "somewhat
supported" ending capital punishment.</P>
      <P>About 33 percent said they thought that ending the death penalty
would help upgrade Taiwan's international image in human rights
protection, while 45 percent said they thought otherwise.</P>
      <P>Just over 51 percent of those interviewed said they would support
the abolishment of capital punishment if "life imprisonment without
the chance for parole" were to be included in the Criminal Code.
Nevertheless, 37.4 percent still gave a thumbs-down to the proposal
even under such conditions.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan said recently that the MOJ will
push for the gradual abolishment of the death penalty over the next
three years in line with President Chen Shui-bian's promise in his
May 20, 2000 inaugural speech to better protect human rights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the same survey found that 59.9 percent oppose the
proposal to legalize same-sex marriages and allow those couples to
adopt children. Only 23.2 percent gave a thumbs-up to the proposal.</P>
      <P>RDEC officials said the survey findings indicate that local
people's attitude toward same-sex marriages remains conservative.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has
drafted two versions of a human rights protection law, both of which
allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children based on a respect for
their basic human rights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Taiwan legislators accompanied a
former Taiwanese "comfort woman" to Japan Monday to push for
legislation of a special law to compensate Asian women who were
forced into prostitution during World War II.</P>
      <P>The elderly former "comfort woman," nicknamed A-Tao, has on many
occasions come forward to recount her wartime ordeal of working at a
Japanese military brothel in India. A-Tao, now in her late 70s, has
been living in solitude since her return from India after the end of
the war.</P>
      <P>A-Tao will join her counterparts from South Korea and the
Philippines in demanding that the Japanese government issue a formal
apology for this wartime atrocity, publish all relevant historical
documents and offer all surviving "comfort women" due compensation.</P>
      <P>The three lawmakers accompanying A-Tao on her Japan trip are Yang
Chun-ying, Kuo Su-chun and Hsiao Chin-lan, all of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT). Also accompanying A-Tao on the trip was Wang
Ching-feng, a lawyer who has been helping collate available data
about former Taiwanese "comfort women."</P>
      <P>Wang said they will lodge a protest with the Japanese government
over a soon-to-be-published history textbook for Japanese junior high
school students that gives a whitewashed account of Japan's wartime
role and atrocities, including its treatment of "comfort women."</P>
      <P>The group will also join forces with "comfort women" and
lawmakers from South Korea and the Philippines to lobby members of
the upper house of the Japanese Diet to support a special bill on
compensation for former "comfort women," Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the draft special bill has received the
support of 80 Japanese upper house members from the opposition camp.
"We hope to solicit support from at least 25 additional Japanese
councilors so that the bill can be eligible for screening by relevant
standing committees in the upper house," she said, adding that they
will hold a news conference at the Japanese upper house in
downtown Tokyo Tuesday afternoon to brief the Japanese press on their
appeal and stance.</P>
      <P>More than 200,000 women from South Korea, the Philippines,
Taiwan, mainland China and other Asian countries were forced to work
as sex slaves at brothels operated by the Japanese army during World
War II. Japan has set up a private fund to offer financial
compensation for surviving Asian "comfort women," but many of them
have declined to accept the money, insisting instead that the
compensation come from the Japanese government.</P>

abroad to take part in the five-day event.</P>
      <P>Leading local firms, including Acer, Twinhead, Asustek and
Giga-Byte are among the 946 domestic participants, while
international big names such as Intel and Microsoft are among the 125
foreign companies from 14 countries participating in the annual

      <P>The total number of firms taking part in this year's Taipei
computer show -- the largest-ever in its history -- is 4 percent up
over the 2000 figure.</P>
      <P>Companies from South Korea and Britain are attending for the
first time, while the United States remains the leading foreign
participating country with 26 firms displaying their products at the
show, according to the China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) and the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), the show's joint
organizers.</P>
      <P>CETRA Secretary-General C.P. Huang said this year's exhibitions
are being held in 11 special zones, with the aim of showing the world
that Taiwan's information industry has succeeded in gaining a place
on the world stage.</P>
      <P>TCA President J.F. Liu said the Taipei international computer
show is drawing increased international attention from foreign
buyers, proof of the local industry's development from its infancy to
the current booming stage.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, 2000 was a year of uncertainties for the local
industry. The United States was still the largest overseas market for
Taiwan-made products, absorbing 38 percent of the locally produced
goods. Europe and Japan came in second and third, taking 28 percent
and 12.8 percent, respectively, he noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A barge carrying two generator units for the
island's fourth nuclear power plant was surrounded Monday by 60-odd
fishing boats near Kungliao, Taipei County, location of the
controversial plant.</P>
      <P>The fishermen, who were protesting against the plant's
construction, used their vessels to try to blockade a wharf at
Kungliao to prevent the barge from unloading, but dispersed
peacefully after an official of the nuclear construction site
accepted a letter of protest from them and promised to relay it to
the authorities.</P>
      <P>The protesters claimed in the letter that the construction of the
nuclear plant has contaminated the seas far beyond the 4.4-hectare
limit around the wharf guaranteed by the nuclear power plant and
demanded compensation.</P>
      <P>Atomic Energy Council Chairman Ouyang Ming-sheng whose
council is the country's supreme nuclear power watchdog promised to
investigate the claims.</P>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), which owns the
fourth nuclear power plant, offered Kungliao fishermen a one-off
payment of NT$215 million (US$6.71 million) in March, 1999, for the
disruption to their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The two German-made generator units, designed to provide
electricity to operate the nuclear reactor, were shipped to Kungliao
from Keelung Harbor, where they had been stored for more than a year
after construction of the plant was scrapped and later restarted.</P>
      <P>With a combined weight of 83 tons, the two units were too heavy
to be transported via land and had to be shipped by boat, as will the
main generator, which weighs 600 tons, and the main reactor, which
weighs more than 1,000 tons.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the fishermen's protest, the Coast Guard
Administration dispatched about 20 patrol boats to escort the barge,
in addition to 1,000 police at the wharf itself.</P>
      <P>The shipping operation which began at 10 p.m. Sunday and was
supposed to finish by 5 a.m. Monday, was delayed by three hours
because of the protest.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Hsin-yi failed to dissuade opposition lawmakers at the Legislative
Yuan from cutting NT$3.17 billion from Taipower's budget.</P>
      <P>The money was intended to compensate the plant contractors who
suffered damages because of the government's U-turn in policy
regarding the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>The government decided Oct. 27 last year to abolish the partly
finished plant, but was forced by the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan to rescind its decision Feb. 14.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers demanded that the government officials
responsible for the flip-flop to apologize before budgeting the
NT$3.17 billion -- earmarked as compensation for the damage suffered
by contractors during this period.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was not a policy maker in the case and thereby is not
in a position to apologize, but he added that the construction of the
nuclear plant cannot resume without first settling the damage claims.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the building of the nuclear plant, Lin
urged the opposition leaders to support Taipower's budget, but his
arguments were not accepted by the opposition lawmakers.</P>

      <P>An officer in the Logistics Department of
Headquarters of Combined Service Force (CSF) attempted suicide in a

Transport (MRT) system Monday.</P>
      <P>Police said that Maj. Chen Hsin-chao was rushed to National
Taiwan University Hospital for emergency treatment after apparently
taking rat poison, although doctors later said they were awaiting
test results to ascertain exactly what kind of poison Chen took.</P>
      <P>Chen left three letters -- one to his wife, one to Legislator
Hsieh Chih-ta of the opposition New Party and one to the mass media
-- but the police and Chen's wife refused to divulge details of the
letter.</P>
      <P>However, an unconfirmed source said that Chen said in his letter
that he could no longer stand the pressure resulting from the many
CSF corruption cases he has reported to the Control Yuan. The source
quoted Chen's letter as saying that he did not want to become "a
second Capt. Yin Ching-feng" a naval officer who was found dead and
was allegedly involved in a naval arms procurement graft case.</P>
      <P>Chen became the second CSF officer to attempt suicide since a CSF

    <TEXT>
      <P>The development of Taiwan's aerospace
industry will revitalize the faltering non-technological industry
sector in Taiwan, a government official responsible for the
development of the island's aerospace industry said Monday.</P>
      <P>David Chu, office director for the Committee for Aviation and
Space Industry Development, said Taiwan's aerospace industry is
solidly based after investment of NT$350 billion over the last
decade, while it also boasts skilled workers trained by the island's
only airplane manufacturer -- Aerospace Industrial Development Corp.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that while the island began the manufacture of jet
fighters at about the same time as Japan, Israel and Sweden, only
Taiwan and Sweden are still active in this fiercely competitive
market, Chu said this is proof of the competitiveness of the island's
aerospace industry.</P>
      <P>Many world-renowned firms such as Boeing and General Electric
have transferred the manufacture of several components to Taiwan,
which has brought the output of the island's aerospace industry from
US$2.49 million in 1988 to an estimated US$4.16 billion this year,
according to Chu.</P>

Council, Chu said the average value of output is about 1.5 million
yen per ton for the automobile industry, 70 million yen per ton for
the computer industry, and 330 million yen per ton for the aerospace
industry.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, this means that the aerospace industry boasts
the highest added-value for every ton of its product. A small screw
manufactured for aircraft use could be valued at hundreds of times
the cost of a similar screw for automobile use, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the International Air Transport Association predicted
a 28 percent increase per year in Asia's air traffic load in the near
future, Chu said he sees bright prospects for Taiwan's aerospace
industry.</P>
      <P>The island's proposed lifting of a ban on visitors from mainland
China by the end of the year will bring about one million mainland
Chinese tourists to Taiwan this year, which represents at least 500
airplane flights, he went on.</P>
      <P>Direct air service links with mainland China will bring an
estimated 10 million mainland Chinese visitors per year to Taiwan,
which will offer Taiwan's aerospace industry fertile ground for
growth, said Chu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FINANCE MINISTRY TAKES STEPS TO STIMULATE STOCK MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Finance
(MOF) announced three measures Monday to try to stimulate the local
stock market, as the weighted index slipped below the psychological
level of 5,000 on the Taipei Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The three steps were described as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Ask authorized financial institutions to lower interest on
loans for stock buying that presently ranges between 9.40 percent and
9.45 percent;</P>
      <P>-- Regulate share transactions by large shareholders and board
directors and supervisors of listed companies so that their shares
cannot be sold within six months of purchase, or three months longer
than the originally fixed period; and</P>
      <P>-- Relax restrictions on listed companies' transactions regarding
their own shares.</P>
      <P>The weighted index on the Taipei stock market, the market's key
barometer, closed the day at 4,985.11, down 28.85 points over last
weekend. Only 920 million shares changed hands on a market turnover
of NT$27.17 billion, a record low since last Dec. 27.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang attributed the poor market
performance to local newspapers' "over-exaggerated" reports on
mainland China's military exercises on Dongshan Island.</P>
      <P>"To my knowledge," he told reporters, "the military exercises are
routine and there is no need for investors to care about them."</P>
      <P>The MOF also pointed out that as interest rates have been lowered
to a record low, "it is a good time for investors to invest in
blue-chip stocks."</P>
      <P>The Securities and Futures Commission also released figures to
show that foreign investors still have deep confidence in Taiwan's
stock market.</P>
      <P>The commission said that in the first five months of this year,
net inflow of foreign capital to the stock market amounted to US$6.75
billion, bringing aggregate net inflow of foreign capital as of May
31 to US$36.2 billion.</P>
      <P>The commission added that the net inflow of foreign capital on
the Taipei Stock Exchange this year is expected to reach US$12
billion-US$15 billion, and added that foreign capital will account
for 10.04 percent of the total value of the local stock market.</P>

      <P>Lin said he will also explore the possibility of the

regional trade area (RTA) among several countries in the region if a
region-wide trade bloc is not feasible in the near future.</P>
      <P>Lin would not disclose which states he will approach for the RTA
talks, but an analyst said ASEAN is pursuing a similar trade bloc
with mainland China, South Korea and Japan and that Taiwan is afraid

wise and good man holds in awe. He holds in awe the Laws of God,
persons in authority, and the words of wisdom of holy men. A fool, on
the other hand, does not know that there are Laws of God; he,
therefore, has no reverence for them; he is disrespectful to persons
in authority, and condemns the words of wisdom of holy men."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO REVITALIZE ECONOMY, UPGRADE INTERNATIONAL STATUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   5   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed to
revitalize the floundering domestic economy upon his returned from a
16-day diplomatic journey Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The feisty president said in a statement delivered at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport that he would immediately resume work
to address domestic economic woes and revive consumer confidence in
Taiwan's economic outlook.</P>
      <P>Chen said his just-concluded overseas trip, which included state
visits to five Latin American countries and high-profile transit
stops in New York and Houston, was very fruitful.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan must stand up and walk out of diplomatic
isolation imposed by mainland China, Chen said his hectic diplomatic
journey has helped increase the Republic of China's international
visibility and publicize its democratic achievements.</P>
      <P>"In the face of mainland China's diplomatic offensive against
Taiwan, my overseas visit has helped the international community
better understand the historic meaning and democratic value of the
ROC's first-ever transition of power between different political
parties last year," said Chen, the ROC's first president from the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said his visits to El Salvador, Guatemala,
Panama, Paraguay and Honduras have further reinforced the ROC's
diplomatic relations with its allies.</P>
      <P>During his five-nation Latin America visit, Chen said he gave
interviews to 11 international press organizations and that
international media published more than 800 articles on his
diplomatic tour.</P>
      <P>"Even my brief transit stops in New York and Houston have
attracted much international attention and prominent media
coverage," Chen said, adding that his overseas trip marked a
publicity coup amid Beijing's intensified diplomatic embargo
against the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to point out that democracy and economic
vitality are Taiwan's major assets for engagements with the
international society.</P>
      <P>"We must use our democratic achievements to enhance engagements
with countries around the world, use our economic vitality to
attract investment and sustain economic growth, join regional
organizations to upgrade our international competitiveness," Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>He recalled that his visit to El Salvador was climaxed with a
summit meeting with six presidents, one vice president and a prime
minister from the ROC's Central American allies.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen said, all of the ROC allies pledged
support for our bids to become a non-regional member of the System of
Central American Integration and a dialogue partner of the North
American Free Trade Area.</P>
      <P>Noting that regional alliances have gradually become a major
feature of the global economic development trends, Chen said Taiwan
must forge ties with as many regional organizations as possible to
stay competitive in the world market.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC must cash in on its ties with Paraguay to tap
the Southern Common Market, also known as Mercosur, and develop
relations with major South American countries.</P>
      <P>Touching on his historic transit stops in New York and Houston,
Chen expressed his gratitude for all the courtesies accorded to him
by U.S. authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen said the upgraded, dignified treatment he received during
his transit stay in the two American cities not only embodied
progress in the ROC-U.S. relations but also underscored U.S. respect
for the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We hope this precedent can be continued and become a model for
constructive high-level interaction between our two countries in
the future," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen made a two-night transit stop in New York en route to Latin
America and an overnight stopover in Houston on his way back to
Taipei, making him the first sitting ROC head of state to set feet
on the two major American cities in more than half a century.</P>
      <P>Without taking any rest, Chen began to perform his official
duty after return to Taipei. He held a lunching meeting with
legislators from his Democratic Progressive Party Tuesday noon
and is scheduled to meet with senior executives from state-run
and private banks in the afternoon to discuss ways to increase
lending to blue-chip companies and stimulate the sluggish
domestic economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICY IMPLEMENTATION VITAL TO ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT: KAOHSIUNG CITY ADVISOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic environment can be
improved and problems tackled only if economic and financial policies
are fully implemented, said Kenneth Lin, director of the Bureau of
Finance of the Kaohsiung City Government.</P>
      <P>As an advisor to Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who is also
chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, Lin is well acquainted
with the problems facing the economy of Taiwan. The
scholar-turned-government advisor said he believes that through a
common effort by the administration and the opposition parties,
Taiwan's economic prospects can be improved.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of an interview with Lin by Taiwan's
Central News Agency reporter Vivian Wang:</P>
      <P>Q: The new administration has taken up a series of economic
reform measures, but not much effect has been seen. Why the
stagnation?</P>
      <P>A: The Democratic Progressive Party only came to lead the central
government last year. Inexperienced as the DPP is, it failed to
identify the problems of the old government and to clarify the
possible negative repercussions of its actions before jumping into
its new role. In the process of reshuffling the government, people of
various backgrounds were trying to have a share of the limited
resources, thus complicating the existing problems.</P>
      <P>The previous administration, after 50 years of Kuomintang rule,
was like a middle-aged or even an old man with deteriorating health.
The basic infrastructure was not sufficient to support accelerated
economic growth. In the long run, problems would emerge. To cover up
its "sickness," the old administration was using "anti-biotic" and
"cosmetic" solutions. The new administration, with the inherited
liabilities, was not only unable to solve the problems but was also
unfamiliar with the structure of the work that had been done before.
The ugly face of a depressed economy was inevitably exposed to the
public.</P>
      <P>The new administration has mapped out a series of economic and
financial policies to halt the economic downturn. President Chen
Shui-bian has already made attracting investors, revitalizing the
economy and creating jobs as major tasks of the government.
Nevertheless, these policies have not been implemented.</P>
      <P>Bureaucracy and self-consciousness of those in positions to act
have delayed the implementation. A good example is the Kaohsiung
economic and trade zone project evaluation report, which was
submitted to the central government six months ago. There has still
been no response from the government. It is very likely that the
report will be sent from department to department for screening
during the next one to two years.</P>
      <P>The administrative red tape must be minimized and outdated
regulations must be lifted.</P>
      <P>Q: Is the confrontation between the administration and the
opposition responsible for the problems in the economy? Can the
proposed economic development council achieve its goal without
reconciliation?</P>
      <P>A: The self-consciousness of the administration while facing a
blockade by the opposition parties was an important factor in
economic problems not being solved in a timely fashion. In fact, the
general public agrees, as do the opposition parties, that the
economic situation must be improved.</P>
      <P>In the Kaohsiung City Council, the DPP has only seven of the 43
seats. Although it was inevitable that the opposition would block
certain moves by the DPP, many important policies were implemented
after consensus was reached through good communication.</P>
      <P>Since opposition parties share the same concern about Taiwan's
economy, the administration is obliged to consult with them to work
out a rescue package for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Q: The government has asked local banks not to reduce their
credit to traditional industries. Can these businesses, many of which
are deeply in debt, be saved?</P>
      <P>A: The government can only suggest that local banks support
traditional industries as if it was a moral obligation. However, the
banks are well aware that too many bad loans will threaten their own
existence.</P>
      <P>Since local banks, public as well as private, are sure to stay
clear of being sucked into a deepening hole of debt, the government
should have the central bank set aside a certain amount of capital to
help bail out troubled industries. If the central bank can allocate
NT$500 billion for a special credit program, the revolving capital
can help traditional industries solve their immediate problems.

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SUPPORTS TAIWAN'S WTO ENTRY BEFORE CHRISTMAS: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai, June 5 (CNA)
(By Chi Chin-ling and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States supports the Republic of
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) before
Christmas this year, ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
said in Shanghai Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after a 45-minute meeting with new U.S.
Trade Representative Robert Zoellick on the sidelines of a trade
ministers conference at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Zoellick was quoted as having told Lin that
the current U.S. government attaches great importance to
strengthening substantive relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin also quoted Zoellick as having said that the Bush
administration would like to see early WTO accession by both sides of
the Taiwan Strait as it would pave the way for cross-strait dialogue
under the WTO framework.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the U.S. supports delinking of Taiwan's WTO entry
from mainland China's, Lin said they didn't touch on this issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has finalized nearly all trade concession talks with major
WTO members, while mainland China has yet to reach agreements with
several major trading partners, including the United States, on its
WTO accession terms.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has insisted that it be admitted to the WTO
ahead of Taiwan, the ROC has so far been unable to become a full
member of the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's meeting, Lin said he also exchanged views with
Zoellick on other bilateral trade issues, such as intellectual
property rights (IPR) protection and liberalization of Taiwan's
telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Lin told Zoellick that the ROC's Legislative Yuan is screening a
draft bill on the management of optical media products in line with
WTO regulations to prevent commercial piracy.</P>
      <P>"The legislation is expected to be completed during the next
legislative session," he added.</P>
      <P>In response to U.S. concern about Taiwan's progress in
telecommunications market liberalization, Lin said the ROC's Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has been working on
several programs to realize the market-opening goal.</P>
      <P>Lin further said his talks with Zoellick proceeded in a cordial,
amicable atmosphere. Zoellick last visited Taiwan two years ago.
During that visit, he met with then-Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian who
is now the ROC president.</P>
      <P>Lin arrived in Shanghai Monday to attend the June 7-8 APEC trade
ministers meeting. APEC, a 21-member regional organization dedicated
to promoting free trade and investment, is one of the few
international bodies that admit both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On the sidelines of the APEC meeting, Lin will also hold talks
with his counterparts from mainland China, Canada, Singapore,
Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Mexico.</P>
      <P>Lin said his meeting with Shi Guangsheng, mainland China's
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, will focus on
APEC-related topics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
asked executives from 18 government and private banking institutions
Tuesday to help local enterprises overcome their current financial
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Chen, who just returned from a five-nation trip to Latin America,
made the appeal while meeting with bank executives at the
Presidential Office during a tea party.</P>
      <P>The president called on the bankers not to tighten financial
support for well-operated enterprises at a time when the economic
situation at home and abroad was turning worse.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government has been taking a more flexible
monetary policy since last December to revitalize the economy, and
added that the central bank has lowered discount rates six times.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said that the enterprises have often complained
about the difficulty of getting access to loans from the banks.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the emphasis of the government's economic policy
has been placed on promoting trade, attracting investors, stimulating
the economy and creating jobs.</P>
      <P>"As we are all in the same boat, I hope everyone of you will
support the government's policy and help these enterprises obtain
loans," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that his recent foreign trip was designed to

his attention to the economy.</P>
      <P>The bank executives invited to the tea party included Bank of
Taiwan President Ho Kuo-hua, Land Bank of Taiwan President Wei

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's special
operations forces conducted a training exercise in mountain regions
in central Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The exercise, code-named Wuhan drill, came at a time when
mainland China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is conducting a
series of large-scale combined services exercises on its offshore
Dongshan Island opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) stressed that the Wuhan
drill is part of the special operations forces' routine training
programs and has nothing to do with the PLA's ongoing war games.</P>
      <P>MND sources said the Wuhan drill was mainly designed to test the
special operations forces' combat kills, including infiltration
in forest areas and blast of mock radar stations in
mainland China's southeastern coastal regions.</P>
      <P>Since the MND began a troops reduction plan a few years
ago, the Army's No. 862 Brigade has become the ROC's only special
operations unit.</P>
      <P>A company of troops of the brigade's No. 3 Battalion took part
in Tuesday's training exercise in the Kukuan mountain region in the
central county of Taichung, MND officials said.</P>
      <P>All the participating troops had completed a 300 km
obstacles-studded march in mountain areas before reaching the
military's Liyang training field near Kukuan for the Wuhan drill
designed to practice various mountain combat skills and
tactics, MND sources said.</P>
      <P>According to military sources, the ROC's special operations
forces are good at fighting in mountain regions and also
have many special combat expertise and strategies.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's intensified military
threat against Taiwan, MND officials said the ROC armed forces
are stepping up combat training in order to safeguard national
security and maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC NOT TO ACCEPT ANY ALTERNATIVE TO FULL TIES WITH MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei will not accept any alternative to
its full diplomatic relations with Macedonia, said a spokeswoman for
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Responding to news reports that Skopje will opt to switch
diplomatic recognition to Beijing while keeping its economic ties
with Taiwan, foreign ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said Taipei
will not settle for anything less than full diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Press reports from Skopje said that the coalition government of
Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski is trying to tread a fine line of
forging ties with Beijing in exchange for Beijing's support at the
United Nations' Security Council without discouraging Taiwan from
delivering on its promise of generous aid.</P>
      <P>Georgievski's Cabinet is supposed to discuss the diplomatic shift
at a meeting Wednesday and could seal the fate of its ties with
Taipei, although any decision must be ratified by the Congress.</P>
      <P>Chang said Minister of Foreign Affairs Ting Hung-mao, who flew to
Skopje May 30 in an 11-hour effort to keep Macedonia in Taiwan's
fold, will return to Taipei Wednesday night and will be bracing for
the worst.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Balkan state has been engulfed in a fierce civil
war against ethnic Albanian rebels, Chang said some of Georgievski's
Cabinet members who are eager to enlist UN help to wipe out the
rebellion are expected to ask for a diplomatic switch at Wednesday's
meeting.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said, Georgievski's Cabinet is not united in its
approach toward Beijing, and there are conflicting indications coming
out of Skopje. The ROC foreign ministry is not rushing to judgment on
the issue; rather, it is watching developments closely.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reiterated Tuesday what
President Chen Shui-bian said in Houston on Sunday that much as his
country valued its ties with Macedonia, the ROC will not maintain
diplomatic relations at the cost of the nation's dignity.</P>
      <P>Citing President Chen's just-concluded visit to five Central
America states, the premier told the Legislative Yuan that the
country is still an active member of the international community with
or without the friendship of Macedonia, adding that the public should
not lose confidence in the country even it is spurned by Macedonia.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Overseas Chinese and foreign investments in
Taiwan approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in the
first four months of this year decreased nearly 20 percent from the
same period last year, according to MOEA statistics released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics showed that MOEA-approved overseas Chinese and
foreign investments in the January-April period totaled US$1.527
billion, a year-on-year decrease of 19.58 percent.</P>
      <P>In the first four months of this year, MOEA-approved Taiwan
investments in the areas other than mainland China amounted to
US$1.544 billion, an increase of 19.95 percent from the same period
last year, MOEA figures revealed.</P>
      <P>The figures also indicated that in the first four months of this
year, MOEA-approved Taiwan investments in mainland China stood at
US$807.864 million, a year-on-year growth of 9.98 percent.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said the main reasons for the decrease of overseas
Chinese and foreign investments in Taiwan are the high comparison
basis resulting from the major telecommunication fixed-line industry
investment cases in the first quarter of last year and the slowdown
in the growth of the global economy.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics also showed that the number of MOEA-approved
overseas Chinese and foreign investment cases in the first four
months of this year decreased 4.37 percent from the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>While MOEA-approved overseas Chinese and foreign investments in
Taiwan decreased sharply, the MOEA-approved Taiwan investments in
foreign countries and mainland China kept on growing.</P>

Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Bermuda area, the United

this month, health officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Jui-hsin, director of the Bureau of Public Health of the
Taichung city government, said Chiu Chieh-chiao, 21, is suspected of
having died from the killer disease.</P>
      <P>Chiu was rushed to the Chung Shan Medical College Hospital in
Taichung May 31 for emergency treatment and was transferred to China
Medical College (CMC) Hospital early June 1. He died three hours
later that day.</P>

      <P>Although the 21st Taipei International
Computer Show -- Computex Taipei 2001 -- has had a high-profile kick
off, the authorities have voiced concern over mainland China's
ambition to catch up with Taiwan in the exhibition industry.</P>
      <P>A historic high of 1,071 firms from home and abroad are
displaying their products at 2,183 booths during the five-day event
that opened Monday. More than 10,000 people, including 7,000 foreign
buyers, poured into the show on the opening day.</P>
      <P>An official with the semi-official China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) said, however, that they are increasingly
worried about the changing trends behind the splashy annual event,
the third-largest of its kind in the world, in the face of stiff
competition from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The CETRA official in charge of exhibition affairs said mainland
China is gearing up to promote its exhibition industry in Beijing and
Shanghai. Pointing to the first Cebit Asia show slated for August in
Shanghai, he said that more than 160 Taiwan-based computer firms,
among 500 companies across the world, will take part in the fair.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that most of the local firms planning to
participate in Cebit Asia are small- and medium-sized businesses, he
warned that the trend of Taiwanese firms taking part in trade fairs
in the mainland cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Shanghai authorities, which will
co-sponsor Cebit Asia with the Germany-based Hannover exhibition
company, have the ambition of developing the city into the most
popular exhibition site in Asia.</P>
      <P>Although the official said that Cebit Asia is not expected to
pose a threat to Computex Taipei within the next three or five years,
the official noted that the mainland will eventually become a strong
rival of Taiwan in the long run should it gain experience and fame.</P>
      <P>As many experts from mainland China have also come to Taipei to
attend this year's Computex Taipei in efforts to gain some first-hand
experience, the CETRA official noted that relevant mainland
authorities are building exhibition centers across the mainland,
including one in Pudong which is designed to be the largest
exhibition hall in Asia.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
he hoped that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party would be the
largest party in the legislature after the year-end elections so that
he can work fully for the improvement of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a lunch he offered to DPP lawmakers
after he returned home Tuesday morning from a 16-day diplomatic
journey to Latin American countries.</P>
      <P>Chen said during his Latin American tour that he will give top
priority to addressing the country's economic problems after his
return, since he had focused his efforts on national defense and
relations with mainland China and other countries in the first year
of his administration.</P>
      <P>Chen's party accounts for just one-third of the 222 seats in the
nation's legislature, and he has had a hard time working with the
opposition-dominated Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Although Chen had said that the local economic plight was partly
caused by a global slump, he also said he and the whole Cabinet
should take full responsibility to improve the country's economy.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's lunch, Chen congratulated Lin Feng-hsi, Chang
Chuan-tien, and Tsai Huang-lang, the newly elected DPP caucus
conveners in the legislature, and said he hoped all the lawmakers can
be re-elected in the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his just-concluded Latin American diplomatic
journey, Chen said the dignified treatment he received from the
countries he visited is actually their affirmation to Taiwan's
long-term democratic and economic development. He said he realized
that maintaining continued economic prosperity in Taiwan is the best
way to link friendship with diplomatic allies and to fight against
Beijing's intimidation against the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INITIATES CUT IN GLOBAL TUNA OUTPUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan initiated Tuesday an overall cut
in global tuna fish catches in an effort to reinvigorate tuna prices
that have been continually dropping since 1999, according to sources
from Taiwan's ocean-going fishing association.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, one of the leading tuna-producing countries in the world,
hosted an Asian regional meeting of the World Tunapurse Organization
in Kaohsiung, with representatives from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan
and the Philippines taking part.</P>
      <P>A consensus on reducing operations of tuna boats and an
across-the-board reduction in global tuna and skipjack output was
reached after Tuesday's one-day meeting of the representatives from
the major Asian tuna-producing countries.</P>
      <P>The reduction in ship operations and catches went into immediate
effect, said Tsai Ting-pang, director-general of the Tunapurse
Business Committee of the Taiwan Ocean-going Tuna Fishing
Association, who chaired the meeting.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the global reduction consensus will be observed by all
12 members of the World Tunapurse Organization and will remain
effective until July 14, when all member countries' representatives
meet in Kaohsiung for a world conference to discuss follow-up plans
to rev up the depressed prices.</P>
      <P>He estimated that 30,000-40,000 metric tons of tuna and skipjack,
or 20 percent of the global take, will be cut back in a month after
the reduction consensus takes effect.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the prices for tuna and ocean bonito in the
international fish market averaged about US$900 per ton more than two
years ago. The average price nose-dived to some US$260 per ton late
last year before rebounding to around US$700 recently.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, there are currently about 400 tuna and skipjack boats
with a total annual production of about 2 million tons. Of the total,
Taiwan's approximately 53 boats contribute some 250,000 tons, Tsai
noted.</P>
      <P>Hu Hsing-hua, fisheries administrator from the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture, who was also present at Tuesday's meeting,

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Wang
Chih-kang said Tuesday that the KMT affirms President Chen
Shui-bian's efforts to enhance relations with foreign countries, but
feels he should also make more effort to stabilize domestic affairs.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while commenting on Chen's return from an
official trip to five Latin American countries.</P>
      <P>"Internal affairs are the basis for engaging in diplomatic work,"
Wang claimed, adding that "diplomatic work would become easier if the
internal situation were to be stabilized."</P>
      <P>The KMT spokesman noted that Chen's foreign trip was "very hard"
and that the KMT affirmed the results of his trip, but he went on to
say that "the current diplomatic difficulties are mainly caused by
the unstable domestic situation and the slowing economy."</P>
      <P>Upon his return from Latin America, Chen stated at a news
conference that he will from now on turn his attention to the
economy.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang said that "actions speak louder than words,"
and that the government should take effective measures to stimulate
the economy immediately.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the KMT will join the "economic development
advisory committee" proposed by Chen late last month, Wang said that
his party will evaluate it after the Presidential Office works out a
concrete plan on the organization and function of such a committee.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT recently organized a series of symposia on
the island's economic problems, and added that their conclusions,
together with a "10,000-word proposal" made by KMT Chairman Lien Chan
last December, will be presented to the Presidential Office and the
Executive Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND  MINISTER PROPOSES DIRECT THREE LINKS WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Chi Chin-ling and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's Foreign Trade Minister
Shi Guangsheng proposed to his Taiwan counterpart Tuesday the opening
of "direct three links" between the two sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Shi made the proposal during bilateral talks with Republic of
China Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi on the sidelines of a
trade ministers' conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum, which is to open here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The direct three links refer to trade, postal and transportation
links.</P>
      <P>The meeting between Lin and Shi attracted much attention as it
was the second time an ROC minister had been sent to mainland China
to attend an international conference in recent years, following
former Finance Minister Shirley Kuo, who led a delegation to an Asian
Development Bank conference held in Beijing in 1989.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the two touched on the issue of which Taiwan
representative Beijing will invite to attend the APEC leaders' summit
meeting in Shanghai in October, Lin said they did not discuss the
matter.</P>
      <P>Lin said he urged the Beijing authorities to further guarantee
Taiwan's investments in mainland China in the face of increasing
numbers of local businessmen investing in the mainland, noting that
bilateral trade between the two sides of Taiwan Strait reached US$34
billion last year according to official ROC figures, while Taiwan
investments in mainland China totaled US$1 billion in the first five
months of the year, also according to official ROC tallies.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long, who was also present
at the meeting, said that in the frequent economic exchanges between
the two sides, it is natural that both sides should encounter
problems related to trade and investment. He suggested to Shi that
both sides establish a channel to further protect Taiwanese
investments and intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Chen said Shi did not respond directly, saying only that he
"realizes the importance of the matter."</P>
      <P>Chen also said their meeting focused largely on issues related to
APEC and the World Trade Organization (WTO) and that they did not
talk about the "one China" problem or WTO accession.</P>
      <P>The vice minister said most APEC member countries hope the WTO
can launch a new round of trade talks in the near future, while
developing countries also think that if the new round of trade
negotiations begins too late, it will have a negative impact on the
world economy.</P>

of China President Chen Shui-bian to attend an informal leaders'
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum this
autumn.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while answering questions at a news

mainland Chinese Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng, who were also in

democratic development over the past decade and added that he is

always an effort to try to have the leaders take part. I certainly

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAS NO STANCE ON BEIJING'S OLYMPIC BID: SPORTS OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei welcomes but has no preference for
Beijing's bid to host the 2008 Olympics, a Taiwan sports official
said Tuesday, in an apparent shift in stance away from favoring
Beijing.</P>
      <P>National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Chairman Hsu
I-hsiung said that the government has no preference for any of the
five cities vying to host the games and will support for whichever
city is chosen by the International Olympic Council (IOC) to host the
games.</P>
      <P>Hsu said IOC member Wu Ching-kuo, who recently publicly supported
Beijing's Olympic bid, does not speak on behalf of the government of
the Republic of China. Wu is the only IOC member from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Hsu's statement directly contradicts the government's
stance, which was spelled out by President Chen Shui-bian at a news
conference marking his first month in office last June 20. Chen said
at the time that he supported Beijing's bid.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing tried to prevent Taiwan officials from
attending the just-concluded East Asian Games in Osaka using pass
cards for "government officials," Hsu said there is no sign that
Beijing has eased off in its attempts to insult the island on the
international stage, despite Taipei's goodwill gestures.</P>
      <P>Indicating his full respect for Wu's contributions to
international sports, Hsu said he would prefer Wu to help the island
enhance its visibility and protect its interest in international
sports events rather that soliciting support for Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that his council granted NT$5.3 million (US$165,625) to
Wu's office this year and suggested that Wu could help him ward off
lawmakers' challenges to the fund in the Legislative Yuan by speaking
out more aggressively on behalf of the island on international stage.</P>

      <P>In addition to financial aid, the Republic

the United States helped the island some 50 years ago, an economic
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen 
Poh-chih, who had just returned from a visit to five ROC allies in
Central America along with President Chen Shui-bian, said that Taiwan
used to help its allies through financial or material aid, or through
private sector investment, which he said have limited effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan owes much of its current prosperity to the
United States for its monetary aid and its advice on economic
strategies during the 1950s, Chen said Taiwan will offer its allies
the same benefits it got from the United States by sharing with them
the island's experience in economic development.</P>
      <P>He said one of Taiwan's allies, whose name he refused to reveal,
has already agreed to take advice from Taiwan on economic policy
along with financial aid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC WOES TAKE TOLL ON HAWAII'S TOURIST INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  June  5 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's current economic slowdown
has taken its toll on the tourism industry in Hawaii, sources in the
travel industry said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu Wei-teng, president of the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce in
Hawaii, said that 20 percent of ethnic Chinese in Hawaii operate
tourism-related services.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economic woes have seriously affected their business
revenues, particularly after two major Taiwan carriers suspended
their direct Taiwan-Hawaii flight services," Lu said.</P>
      <P>With the Taiwan economy losing steam, Lu said, the number of
relatively expensive United States-bound tour groups from Taiwan has
declined steadily since the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan's EVA Airways took the lead in grounding its
direct Taiwan-Hawaii flights early this year, and another Taiwan
carrier, China Airlines (CAL), followed suit May 1.</P>
      <P>Since then, Lu said, the number of Taiwan tour groups to Hawaii
has dropped by more than 60 percent.</P>
      <P>"In the past, Taiwan tourists could be prominently seen at major
Hawaii tourist destinations. But now Taiwan tourists are a `rare
species' in Hawaii. This trend has become ever more evident since CAL
suspended its direct flight services," Lu noted.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Hawaii tour guides specializing in serving
Taiwan tourists could serve an average of four Taiwan tour groups per
month in the past. But now the number has fallen to less than two.
Meanwhile, he said, the business turnover of such peripheral services
as restaurants and gift shops has also plunged significantly</P>
      <P>"And most depressing of all is that no end to the current plight
is in sight," Lu said, adding that some Hawaii tourist services
operators have switched their focus to attracting holidaymakers from
mainland China and the U.S. mainland.</P>
      <P>Travel sources said the number of Taiwan tour groups bound for
the U.S. mainland has also dropped substantially.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan students who have registered to attend
short-term classes in the United States during summer vacation this
year has declined 60 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>A local travel agent, who preferred to remain anonymous, said he
helped arrange for 1,200 Taiwan students to attend summer classes in
the United States in 1999. "The number fell to 1,000 last year and
only 400 have registered for relevant study programs so far this
year," he added.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, he said, the depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar
against the U.S. greenback has dealt yet another severe blow to
travel agencies specializing in serving Taiwan tour groups. "We are
bracing for the coldest summer this year," he lamented.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-HK AIR PACT TO BE EXTENDED TILL YEAR'S END</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Lu Chien-hui and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The existing aviation agreement between
Taiwan and Hong Kong, which will expire June 12, will be extended to
the end of this year, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Economic
Development Bureau said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokeswoman, Taiwan and Hong Kong carriers
involving in the aviation pact have unanimously agreed to the
year-end extension.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman further said that as the arrangement is related
to commercial agreements among all relevant airline companies, she
would not make any comments on the issue.</P>
      <P>Local media reports said the extension of the current
Taiwan-Hong Kong air pact for six months would hinder Dragon Air's
plan to open Taipei-Hong Kong flight services. At present, the Hong
Kong carrier can only operate flights to the southern Taiwan
port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Under the present pact, Taiwan and Hong Kong can both allow their
carriers to operate a total of 121 weekly flights between the two
places.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's China Airlines can operate 105 flights per
week, while EVA can only operate 16 weekly flights. Meanwhile, Hong
Kong assigns 100 flights to its Cathay Pacific Airways and 21 flights
to Dragon Air.</P>
      <P>The current Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation pact was signed on June
12, 1996 and the two sides originally agreed to review the accord
once every five years.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of Taiwan's Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China and has handled exchanges with Hong Kong and Macau since the
two former colonies reverted to Beijing rule in 1997 and 1999,
respectively, said last week that Taiwan looks forward to signing a
new aviation agreement with Hong Kong on a reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin also said that as this will be the first time
that Taiwan and Hong Kong will have held aviation rights talks since
Hong Kong's reversion to Beijing rule and the ROC's implementation of
a statute on relations with Hong Kong and Macau, the two sides need
time to prepare for negotiations on a new accord. Therefore, Lin
said, the extension of the current pact is a practical way to
cope with the issue for the moment.</P>
      <P>Despite the current cross-Taiwan Strait political stalemate,
bilateral trade and economic exchanges have continued to grow. The
demand for flight services between Taiwan and Hong Kong -- a major
transit stop for cross-strait air traffic -- has been skyrocketing.</P>
      <P>With more and more Taiwan investors and managers relocating to
mainland China, the Taiwan-Hong Kong route has become one of the
hottest and both EVA and Dragon Air have long desired to increase
their flights on the route, airline sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FACTORS UNFAVORABLE TO ROC-MACEDONIA FORMAL TIES STILL EXIST: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Uncertainties still surround official
diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Macedonia despite a motion
tabled by Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva to switch formal
ties from Taipei to Beijing being vetoed Tuesday, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said that factors that are
detrimental to the Republic of China "still remain" and that the
ministry and the Taiwan liaison office in Macedonia are closely
monitoring the situation for any new developments.</P>
      <P>Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva proposed in a motion
at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday that Skopje switch its diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in an effort to secure bigger
support from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The proposal, however, was vetoed by Macedonian Prime Minister
Ljubco Georgievski on the grounds that it was against administrative
process.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet later decided that the issue be raised by President
Boris Trajkovski for discussions and that the consensus reached at
such discussions be brought to a future Cabinet meeting for further
debate and a final decision.</P>
      <P>Chang said that despite the fact that the volatile state of the
Taipei-Skopje diplomatic relationship has "temporarily been relieved"
by Georgievski's veto of Mitreva's proposal, factors unfavorable to
Taiwan still exist, including President Trajkovski's relatively more
unfriendly attitude toward the ROC and Macedonia's avid hope of
enlisting United Nations help in ending armed conflict by Albanian
rebels in Macedonia. Beijing is a member of the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao and Vice
Foreign Affairs Minister Chiu Jong-nan have done their utmost to keep
Macedonia in Taiwan's fold. Tien cut short a Latin American trip to
fly to Macedonia last week in a last-ditch effort to salvage the
formal diplomatic ties, but his counterpart, Mitreva, refused to meet
him, saying that Skopje was planning to sever formal relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister Peter P.C. Cheng, Taiwan's envoy in
Macedonia, said Wednesday that the Macedonian Cabinet's decision to
submit the proposal to sever formal ties with the ROC to President
Trajkovski was not making the thorny issue any easier, at least for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng stressed that the ROC will not accept any alternative to
full diplomatic relations with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Macedonia established formal diplomatic ties on Jan.
27, 1999. However, they have never been completely smooth since being
established, and Cheng, the ROC's ambassador to Macedonia, has not
yet been able to present his credentials to the Macedonian president.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday his
administration intends to set up a special agency to crack down on
official corruption and graft.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with Bertrand de
Speville, a former director of Hong Kong's Independent
Commission Against Corruption.</P>
      <P>Chen, who took office in the Republic of China's first-ever
democratic transfer of power between different political parties
in May 2000, said eradication of official corruption and shady
links between politics and organized crime were his major campaign
promise.</P>
      <P>"Our people have great expectations of the establishment of
clean politics," Chen said, adding that his administration has spared
no efforts to reach that goal since its inauguration.</P>
      <P>Chen said although his administration has achieved some results
in this regard, there is still much to done to wipe out graft and
corruption.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we hope to set up a Hong Kong-style independent
agency to crack down on corruption," Chen told his guest.</P>
      <P>For his part, Speville said anti-corruption agency
should be put under direct jurisdiction of the highest
executive to avoid involvement of too many political forces.</P>
      <P>Speville further said integration of various anti-corruption
units into an independent agency is necessary to upgrade
operational efficiency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MARTIAN INVASION COULD HAPPEN AS EARLY AS 2007</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, June 5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Martian invasion could take place as early
as 2007 -- but it will be Earth invading the Red planet, instead of
the other way around, Canada's national broadcaster reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said researchers at the
University of Florida are working to develop genetically altered
plants they hope to plant in Martian soil.</P>
      <P>A robotic gardener would scoop up, analyze and fertilize the red
Martian soil in miniature greenhouses. These shelters would house
germinating specimens of a common mustard plant known as the thale
cress, the CBC said.</P>
      <P>A common weed along roadsides and trails, the plant, also known
as Arabidopsis thaliana, was picked for the project because of its
short life cycle of about five weeks, its small average size of about
18 centimeters, and because its entire genetic structure has been
mapped and sequenced, the CBC said.</P>
      <P>Scientists will add marker genes from other species to make the
plants glow in response to environmental stresses like drought,
noxious soils, and extreme temperatures ranging from seven degrees
Celsius during the day to minus 112 degrees Celsius at night.</P>
      <P>If the project succeeds, the researchers said they hope it will
spark more interest in the possibility of "terraforming" Mars --
engineering the planet's ecosystems to make them more suitable for
living organisms from Earth.</P>
      <P>The researchers are trying to secure a spot for their experiment
on a NASA-sponsored Mars mission. The CBC quoted Rob Ferl at the
University of Florida as saying he has no doubt the plants will
survive on Mars.</P>
      <P>When it happens, it will show that life that evolved on Earth can
thrive on distant worlds and will set the stage for human
colonization, the CBC quoted Ferl as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA-PACIFIC SLOWDOWN MAY PROMOTE REGIONAL STABILITY: U.S. ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The emerging Asia-Pacific economic
slowdown may well promote a more stable regional security environment
and facilitate international cooperation, a senior American analyst
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Nicholas Berry of the Washington-based Center for Defense
Information wrote in the CDI Asia Forum that regional economic
downturns usually bring with them other adverse effects, such as
protectionism, unbridled trade competition, and territorial or
resource disputes, but the developing slowdown in the Asia-Pacific
region might actually promote stability.</P>
      <P>Evidence of an Asia-Pacific economic slowdown has become more
apparent as the year has progressed, he noted. The economy of the
United States, to which Asian economies send roughly an aggregate 25
percent of their exports, grew only 1 percent in the first quarter
of 2001, and imports have remained below their September 2000 peak
every month since. Overall, this has had a depressing effect on Asian
economies.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter, Taiwan's exports were down 11.3 percent,
Thailand's down 10 percent, South Korea's down 9.9 percent, and Hong
Kong's down 2.4 percent. Japan, whose economy seemed to be on the
mend in 2000, also found its exports falling, culminating in a
depressing 41.6 percent drop in April.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has been the major beneficiary as other economies
have dipped, said Berry. Its economy grew 7.5 percent in the first
quarter of this year, only a slight decline from previous quarters.
The mainland market of 1.3 billion people is the world's largest and
can increasingly absorb foreign direct investment and exports.</P>
      <P>The senior analyst said he is convinced that the combination of
an overall Asia-Pacific regional economic slowdown and the surge in
the mainland Chinese market reinforces some positive security trends.</P>
      <P>"China's increasing integration into the Asia-Pacific economy
furthers Beijing's interest in stabilizing the region's international
relations. An aggressive, assertive China seeking hegemony would
undoubtedly stimulate the formation of a large anti-China coalition
led by the United States and would therefore jeopardize China's
economic development," Berry wrote.</P>
      <P>"Exports and foreign direct investments would greatly suffer in
an uncertain, hostile environment," he added.</P>
      <P>The more economies integrate, the greater the need for
multilateral trade, investment and financial regimes to regulate that
integrated economy. As a result, the World Trade Organization and the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum can be expected to play
greater coordinating roles, he said.</P>
      <P>In the Taiwan Straits, one of the potential hot spots for
regional instability, economic integration between mainland China and
Taiwan is growing, which may lead the two sides toward finding common
interests in moderating their political relations, Berry said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he pointed out, the United States and Japan have new
administrations that are well aware that economic performance will
largely determine their life spans. Both, without provocation, are
not about to designate Communist China as an enemy or restrict trade
and investments, which would inflame security relations in the
region.</P>
      <P>"In terms of the level of military tensions in the region,
economic troubles are producing a `pacific' fallout," Berry
concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN HAS EVERY RIGHT TO TAKE PART IN APEC SUMMIT: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai, June 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
has every right and obligation to take part in the informal
leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum, said an ROC official Wednesday.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long, a member of
the Taiwan delegation to an APEC trade ministers' meeting currently
being held in Shanghai, said Taiwan, a formal member of APEC under
the designation of "Chinese Taipei," has the right as well as the
obligation to participate in all APEC activities and gatherings.</P>
      <P>President Chen expressed his intention in May of taking part in
the APEC informal leadership summit meeting scheduled to be held in
Shanghai in October -- an idea which has received support from the
United States.</P>
      <P>In order to make this happen, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chen
Ruey-long said the "Chinese Taipei" delegation is trying its utmost
during the APEC ministers meeting to gain support for the idea,
adding that although it is "doing it quietly" in the face of
opposition from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Top U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said in Shanghai
Tuesday that it would be "constructive" for ROC President Chen
Shui-bian to attend an APEC informal leaders' summit in mainland
China later this year.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan participates as an economy in a different condition,"
said Zoellick, when he was asked about President Chen's request to
attend the Shanghai summit.</P>
      <P>"In terms of the leaders, I believe there is always an effort to
try to have the leaders take part. I certainly think that would be a
constructive step," he said during a press conference on the
sidelines of the APEC trade ministers' meeting.</P>

      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang and Central
Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan are set to meet with executives
of 20 financial institutions Thursday to work out measures to help
local businesses obtain bank credit.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has called on banking institutions not
to reduce credit to businesses in times of economic recession and
upon his return Wednesday from Latin America, he invited 18 bank
executives to discuss ways of helping local businesses weather the
recession.</P>
      <P>The executives took the opportunity to ask the administration to
improve the financial environment.</P>
      <P>A major concern of the bankers remains the administrative
liability in granting credit. Under the current criminal code and
administrative regulations, bank staff may be held liable for the bad
debts of their clients, thus making them reluctant to extend loans.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Lai In-jaw said Tuesday that the Finance Ministry
will give clear guidelines to all monetary institutions regarding the
legal definitions of "proper loans" and "irregularities" within three
days.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan, who was also present at the
meeting between the president and the bank executives, said that the
liability aspect is written into a revision of the criminal law and
added that he will see to it that the revised act is approved by the
Legislative Yuan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the Bankers Association of Taipei also reached
a consensus last week not to reduce credit to businesses operating
normally and paying their interest regularly. Another condition is
that loans obtained from local banks must not be transferred to
businesses overseas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAVY MAKES PUBLIC FRIGATE DEAL CLAUSES TO FACILITATE PROBE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Navy has made public
several clauses in a 1991 deal for six French Lafayette-class
frigates to facilitate a probe into alleged fraud in the purchase,
State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Jen-fa confirmed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that he has asked Roger Hsieh, a national policy
adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, to relay the declassified
clauses to French National Assembly member M. Thierry Mariani so that
he can help raise the issue in France's National Assembly.</P>
      <P>The navy sent a message May 18 to the legal team of Thomson-CSF,
which built the frigates, to the effect that it would declassify
Article 17 on non-disclosure and Article 18 on gratuities and
commissions and that it would await a reply.</P>
      <P>Article 18 states that if the contractor breaches the provisions
as to the payment of any commission, percentage, brokerage fee or
contingent fee, the buyer shall have the right to deduct from the
contract price an amount equal to that of the commission paid.</P>
      <P>But Thomson-CSF did not express views on the declassification
within two weeks of receiving the navy's letter, so the navy went
ahead and released the two articles.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who accompanied Mariani on visits to related officials
here two weeks ago, noted that France had refused to disclose related
information on the purchase, citing the prohibitive clause in the
contract.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that after the declassification of the two clauses,
the most urgent task is to "protect Taiwan's interests."</P>
      <P>Noting that a 10-year dateline for keeping records of the account
will expire in six months, he said the navy should first raise the
reimbursement issue with international arbitrators. If such a move
fails, he went on, it could then "consider other means."</P>
      <P>The 1991 contract, which was worth 16 billion French francs, was

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An army battalion stationed at the
Chengkungling base in Taichung County was quarantined Wednesday after
one of its soldiers died from spinal meningitis Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the army base said about 580 soldiers of the 3rd
battalion under the 200th Motorized Infantry Brigade were ordered to
remain in their barracks for 10 days as a precautionary measures to
contain the contagious disease, meningococcal meningitis.</P>
      <P>Soldiers who have been given medicine for the disease, but are
otherwise free of any symptoms, will be allowed to do routine
training, but will not be allowed to leave the base, an army
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The action was taken after a soldier, Chiu Chia-chao, of the
battalion died Tuesday in a nearby hospital from spinal meningitis, a
flu-like disease that can be fatal if not properly treated.</P>
      <P>Twenty-four soldiers were admitted to the Taichung General
Military Hospital Tuesday after showing symptoms similar to those of
the soldier who died, but subsequent blood tests showed that they
were not infected. All of them except two were released from the
hospital Wednesday, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Military health officials sprayed disinfectant at the
Chengkungling base Wednesday morning, paying specific attention to
the living quarters of the deceased man. The deceased soldier's house
in Kaohsiung was also disinfected since he had just been on furlough
there three days ago.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense said it has ordered that all

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE DEMANDS DECLASSIFICATION OF FRIGATE CONTRACTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee &amp; Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Wednesday approved a
resolution demanding the declassification of contracts on the
nation's purchase of six Lafayette-class frigates from France.</P>
      <P>The resolution, jointly raised by the opposition Kuomintang, the
People First Party and the New Party, asked the Executive Yuan to
declassify part of the contracts that do not involve national defense
secrets.</P>
      <P>According to the resolution, the Legislative Yuan will also
establish a committee to facilitate the investigation, along with the
cooperation of the French parliament, into the alleged fraud in the
deal that totaled 16 billion French francs.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had originally
considered boycotting the formation of the legislative committee on
the grounds that it might infringe on the power and operations of the
special panel which is responsible for investigating the case and is
led by State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Jen-fa.</P>
      <P>However, DPP lawmakers did not vote against the bill, enabling it
to pass unanimously.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said earlier in the day that the Navy has made
public several clauses in the 1991 deal for six French
Lafayette-class frigates to facilitate a probe into alleged fraud in
the purchase.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that he has asked Roger Hsieh, a national policy
adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, to relay the declassified
clauses to French National Assembly member Thierry Mariani so that he
can help raise the issue in the assembly.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan navy sent a message May 18 to the legal team of
Thomson-CSF, which built the frigates, to the effect that it was
preparing to declassify Article 17 on non-disclosure and Article 18
on gratuities and commissions and that it would await a reply.</P>
      <P>Article 18 states that if the contractor breaches the provisions
as to the payment of any commission, percentage, brokerage fee or
contingent fee, the buyer shall have the right to deduct from the
contract price an amount equal to that of the commission paid. But
Thomson-CSF did not respond to the declassification within two weeks
of receiving the navy's letter, so the navy went ahead and released
the two articles.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who accompanied Mariani on visits to officials in Taiwan
two weeks ago, noted that France had refused to disclose related
information on the purchase, citing the prohibitive clause in the
contract.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that after the declassification of the two clauses,
the most urgent task is to "protect Taiwan's interests." Noting that
a 10-year deadline for keeping records of the account will expire in
six months, he said the navy should first raise the reimbursement
issue with international arbitrators. If such a move fails, he went
on, it could then "consider other means."</P>
      <P>The 1991 contract, was signed by the state-owned China
Shipbuilding Corp. on behalf of the navy to disguise the fact that
the frigates were being purchased by the military. Allegations about
huge commissions in the deal surfaced in Paris in 1996 after Edmond
Kwan, who claimed to have brokered the deal, brought a suit in a
Swiss court against Thomson-CSF to claim his commission, followed by
further reports in 1998 from Paris that 1 percent of the price -- or
160 million francs -- was divided among officials in Paris, Taipei
and Beijing as commissions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. DEFENSE NOMINEES SUPPORT CALL FOR TAIWAN RESTRAINT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While indicating their support for
ensuring Taiwan's adequate defense, nominees for three senior
Pentagon positions on Tuesday echoed calls for Taipei to show
restraint in order to help maintain stability across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Douglas Feith, nominated to be Undersecretary of Defense for
policy, said that the United States should "provide the support (for
Taiwan)...and help keep the situation there secure."</P>
      <P>At the same time, he told the Senate Armed Services Committee
that Washington should also "work on cooperating with them (Taiwan)
to make sure that Taiwan's own position doesn't become a
destabilizing element in the area."</P>
      <P>Another nominee, Peter Rodman, concurred. He said that the United
States "is not looking for a crisis with China over Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) reflects the American
commitment," he said, "but I think our objective is to deter a
crisis."</P>
      <P>Rodman is assistant Secretary of Defense-designate for
international security affairs and in that capacity, he will be
responsible for reviewing Taiwan's arms requests.</P>
      <P>Jack Crouch, a third nominee to testify before the Armed Services
Committee hearing, also said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
should use caution.</P>
      <P>President George W. Bush wants to "speak clearly on the subject,"
he said, so that both parties, particularly mainland China, know
about the U.S. commitment to peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>"But on the other hand," he said, "I think it would be wrong to
try to artificially solve that problem or to create stresses between
those two states." Crouch has been nominated to be assistant
Secretary of Defense for international security policy.</P>
      <P>The nominees were echoing the views expressed by Senator John
Warner (R-VA), chairman of the Armed Services Committee.</P>
      <P>When questioning the officials-to-be during their confirmation
hearing, Warner said that he strongly supports the TRA and the
engagement of U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan Strait if necessary.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he cautioned Taiwan officials against creating
"additional stresses" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the views of many members of Congress, Warner said
that implicit in the TRA is "the obligation of the Taiwanese elected
persons and others who are in official positions to restrain their
rhetoric and their action."</P>
      <P>Feith, Rodman and Crouch are all expected to be confirmed by the
Senate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG CITY COUNCILOR INDICTED FOR LIBEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Councilor Chen Chun-sheng was
indicted Wednesday for libel after an audio tape used by him two
years ago to corroborate his accusation of adultery against former
Kaohsiung City Mayor Wu Den-yih was determined to be a fake.</P>
      <P>Chen, who ran for a seat on the city council on the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) ticket in the 1998 election, used the tape to
support his accusation that Wu, who was running for reelection as
city mayor, was having a secret affair with a woman.</P>
      <P>Chen won a city council seat in the election. He said the tape
contained intimate conversations between Wu and his "anonymous
mistress." Chen said the tape was given to him by a stranger who
picked up the conversation while listening to his CB radio.</P>
      <P>Wu denied the accusation and filed a complaint at the
prosecutors' office before he lost his reelection bid to DPP
candidate Frank Hsieh by a narrow margin of 4,565 out of 770,000
votes cast.</P>
      <P>A prosecutor from the Kaohsiung Prosecutors' Office said
Wednesday that forensic experts from Taiwan's Bureau of Investigation
and a laboratory in the United States determined the voice on the
tape did not match that of Wu and that very small background noises
appeared to indicate where the tape had been edited.</P>
      <P>As a result, the prosecutor said he indicted Chen on one count of
"aggravate libel" under the Election and Recall Law for smearing a
candidate with the intent to damage his chance of being elected.</P>
      <P>Wu said Wednesday Chen was not acting alone and that prosecutors
should expose Chen's accomplice.</P>
      <P>Wu remind the prosecutor that a professor from National Taiwan
University -- identified only by her family name of Chiang -- who
called herself a voice expert and vouched for the authenticity of
Chen's tape should be investigated as a suspected accomplice.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Hualien Wednesday, Chen said he doubted the results
of the tests conducted by the foreign laboratory on the tape and
asked why it should take two years to complete such an easy job.</P>
      <P>He vowed to cleared his name during the trial.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) plans to
loosen restrictions to allow more overseas workers with skills in
information technology to work in Taiwan, council officials said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Employment and Vocational Training Administration under the
CLA has completed discussions on a draft amendment concerning the
implementation of the Employment Services Law.</P>
      <P>Under the amended statutes, the requirements for foreign workers
skilled in information technology hired by domestic enterprises will
no longer be restricted to those who hold masters' degrees and have
at least one-year working experience or those who hold bachelor
degrees and have at least two-year working experience as stipulated
in the current Employment Services Law.</P>
      <P>The amended version of the Law also states that hi-tech workers
sent to Taiwan need not apply for a work permit in advance if they
will stay in Taiwan for less than 30 days for projects dealing with
agreements on technology transfer or after-sale training or services.</P>
      <P>If they will stay in Taiwan for 31 days to 90 days, however, they
will still need to apply for a work permit in advance, according to
the amended law.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that to prevent hi-tech workers from taking
advantage of the eased restrictions and overstaying in Taiwan, the
CLA will consider setting a limit on the number of yearly entries
permissible for each worker.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will present
the government a set of suggestions on ways of boosting the faltering
economy as a gesture to support President Chen Shui-bian's call to
"fight for the economy," a KMT official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, executive director of a KMT think tank, the

list of recommendation for the government to show that the KMT is
supporting the government's effort to halt the economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The recommendations, "An Analysis and Remedy based on Taiwan's
Experience for the Current Economical Problems," will be presented to
the government on June 12.</P>
      <P>Chiang presented the paper to the party's Central Standing
Committee for review on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Among the 13 recommendations released to the media after
Wednesday's meeting, several were measures that the party had
advocated earlier.</P>
      <P>One such recommendation was that a coalition government be formed
with the head of the majority party in the legislature appointed
premier who would in turn be responsible to the legislature.</P>
      <P>Another KMT recommendation is to call the National Unification
Council into session and to reconfirm the island's understanding
reached in 1992 with Beijing on the "one China," principle -- that
there is only one China, with the definition of which being subject
to different interpretations by Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Notable among the other recommendations are breaking free from
ideological burdens and respecting career bureaucrats; and relaxing
limitations on direct transportation links with mainland China,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade posted a substantial
drop in May as a result of floundering economies at home and abroad,
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$10.17 billion worth of products and services
in May, representing a whopping 22.6 percent decrease from the same
month the previous year and marking a new low in terms of growth
since February 1998, MOF officials quoted customs statistics as
indicating.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the country's imports of products and services in May
amounted to US$8.95 billion, marking an even more alarming drop of
29.6 percent over the previous May's level and representing the
largest slide since March 1999.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus for the month of May was US$1.22 billion,
the MOF officials added.</P>
      <P>They estimated that both Taiwan's export and import trade will
register double-digit negative growth over the next few months before
possibly beginning to register "slight growth" by the end of this
year if the global economy turns for the better.</P>
      <P>The total value of Taiwan's exports for the first five months of
this year was 9.5 percent less than the figure for the same period in
2000, with exports of electronics products and information and
telecommunications products dropping 8.3 percent and 13.6 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the total value of the island's imports for the
January-May period this year was 15.2 percent less than the figure
for the corresponding period the previous year, with imports of
agricultural and industrial products and capital equipment dropping
14.9 percent and 18.8 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>MOF officials estimated that Taiwan's exports will pick up steam
next year when the world economy is expected to recover to an average
growth rate of 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Several mammoth government-initiated investment projects totaling
some NT$810 billion in value are expected to help attract capital
from abroad and contribute to stimulating the domestic economy and
investment, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, MAINLAND MARITIME RESCUE CENTERS MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite their political differences,
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have maintained close contacts and
cooperation in maritime disaster relief operations, a local emergency
rescue expert said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yin Liu-sheng, secretary-general of the Taipei-based Chinese
Search and Rescue Association (CSRA), made the remarks at a seminar
maritime search and rescue operations.</P>
      <P>Yin said maritime mishaps and disasters have often happened in
waters near Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. "Emergency rescue
units in the three areas have traditionally maintained close
contacts and cooperation in disaster relief operations based on
humanitarianism," he noted.</P>
      <P>Under current law, the Taipei Rescue Coordination Center (RCC)
under the Executive Yuan and the military's Rescue Coordination
Center cannot make direct contacts with mainland China's official
disaster relief agencies.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the private CSRA has helped mediate cross-strait
maritime emergency search and rescue operations over past years," Yin
said, adding that the CSRA has taken part in more than 100 such
cross-strait disaster relief missions and saved hundreds of lives.</P>
      <P>Yin further said that communications channels among
Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland Chinese emergency rescue units have
consistently operated smoothly and efficiently .</P>
      <P>"The three parties have traditionally cooperated closely
whenever air or maritime disasters happen in their nearby regions,"
Yin said, adding that search and rescue operations in the Taiwan
Strait have all followed humanitarian principles.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chen Yen-hung, chairman of the
navigation department of National Taiwan Ocean University, said an
average of maritime disasters occur in waters surrounding Taiwan
annually.</P>
      <P>Chen said there is still ample room for Taiwan to upgrade its
capability in handling major maritime disasters. In addition to
purchasing advance search and rescue facilities, Chen said, Taiwan
should intensify manpower training to upgrade their professional
expertise and skills.</P>
      <P>"As maritime recreational activities will become ever more
popular and yachting business may soon be further liberalized,
maritime disasters are expected to rise. We must beef up
our emergency disaster relief capabilities to cope with new
challenges," he urged.</P>
      <P>The seminar was co-sponsored by the Ministry of National Defense
and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, with the
participation of representatives from various government
and private emergency search and rescue organizations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTER PROTESTS BEIJING'S 'UNFRIENDLY' GESTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Chi Chin-ling and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Economic
Affairs Lin Hsin-yi has formally lodged a protest to Beijing because
organizers for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in
mainland China failed to call him by his honorific when they invited
him to the meeting in March.</P>
      <P>Lin said calling him "Mr. Lin" instead of "Minister Lin" was a
slight to both him and the ROC and was evidently intended to "dwarf
the international status of the ROC."</P>
      <P>Lin, who is currently in Shanghai taking part in a trade
ministers' meeting under the framework of APEC, said he handed the
protest letter to his Beijing counterpart, Shi Guangsheng, mainland
China's minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation Tuesday to
protest what Lin called an unfriendly gesture in the invitation to
the meeting that Beijing sent him in March.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is unacceptable to both him and the ROC that Beijing
addressed him only as "Mr. Lin." As a full member of APEC, Taiwan,
under its formal designation is "Chinese Taipei," is entitled to
equal treatment and protocol as all other APEC member economies, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lin said Beijing's affront was hegemonic and belligerent and runs
counter to APEC practice.</P>
      <P>Copies of the protest letter were sent to the APEC secretariat
and all other APEC member economies for reference, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Beijing, the host of this year's APEC trade
ministers meeting and the APEC leadership summit, made public in
March a list of names from APEC member economies to be invited to the
meeting scheduled to open in Shanghai June 6. Lin was not included on
that list.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, Lin received a "notification" from
Beijing official Wang Guangnan, who chaired this year's APEC senior
officials meeting, about the APEC trade ministers meeting slated for
June 6-7. Lin was addressed as "Mr. Lin."</P>
      <P>Lin and the ROC government expressed their dissatisfaction to
Beijing authorities about the matter in March. There was no response
from the mainland until mid-May when Beijing's trade minister sent
Lin a formal invitation to the meeting. The title "Minister Lin,"
however, was still missing from the invitation.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the government had considered boycotting the
June 6-7 trade ministers meeting as a protest to Beijing's
unfriendliness. The government later decided to let Lin go to
maintain the tradition of harmony at APEC meetings and to allow
Taiwan the chance to have its voice heard on the international stage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG INSPECTS OFFSHORE DEFENSE OUTPOST OF MATSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Matsu,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung made an inspection
tour of the Republic of China's frontline island of Matsu Thursday
to underscore his concern about general developments at the offshore
defense outpost.</P>
      <P>This was Chang's first trip to Matsu, which lies closer to
mainland China than to Taiwan, since he assumed the premiership last
October.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Matsu port facilities, Chang reaffirmed the
government's determination to continue promoting the direct "mini
three links" program.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to show goodwill toward mainland China,
the ROC opened its two outlying defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu
for direct trade, mail and shipping links with mainland China's
Xiamen and Mawei port cities, commonly known as the "mini three
links" program, at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Chang said although Beijing has been reluctant to throw full
support behind the Taiwan-initiated program, the ROC government will
not waver on its determination to substantiate its "open-door" policy
toward mainland China in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has so far approved direct Kinmen-Xiamen and
Matsu-Mawei shipping services only on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Chang said the current ROC government will use sincerity to
defuse decades-old cross-strait animosity and replace conflict with
dialogue.</P>
      <P>In the company of local government officials and legislators,
Chang inspected several community development projects on the
offshore island.</P>
      <P>Chang also toured Chinpi Village, which is known for its
preservation of a number of traditional southern Chinese-style
houses and artifacts. The village hosted an international seminar on
community design and development last month, which brought together
many architecture and community development experts from
Asia-Pacific countries.</P>
      <P>Chang lauded local government officials for their efforts to
preserve traditional cultural heritage and develop tourist resources
over past years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG HOPES LEGISLATURE WILL ATTEND EMERGENCY MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung Thursday morning
made a number of calls on Wang Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative
Yuan, and faction chiefs of opposition parties, to try to arrange an
emergency meeting to screen and pass bills which failed to be
approved before the legislature went into recess.</P>
      <P>The fifth session of the fourth legislature concluded at midnight
Thursday with only 42 bills passed and dozens of other still
outstanding.</P>
      <P>At the morning meeting with Wang, Chang said that several bills
-- those involving financial reforms in particular -- are vital to
the government's economic stimulus programs. He hoped that political
parties in the Legislative Yuan could reach consensus and convene an
emergency meeting during the recess to approve the bills.</P>
      <P>Chang asked the president of the Legislative Yuan, who is a
member of the majority Kuomintang (KMT), to try to get all parties to
agree on the emergency meeting.</P>
      <P>If a consensus is reached, an emergency meeting could be called
either by the Legislative Yuan or at the request of the president,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan can call an emergency meeting if one-fourth
of its 225 members sign a petition.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he favors a meeting called by the president,
although how the meeting should be convened needs to be agreed upon
by all parties.</P>
      <P>He said that the process would be more proper and reasonable if
the president called the meeting and that bills would be screened
more efficiently.</P>
      <P>Chang, accompanied by Vice Premier Lai In-jaw and
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen of the Executive Yuan, later called at
the offices of party factions of the KMT, the New Party, and the
People First Party. He also met with members of the Non-Party
Alliance and the Cross-Party Association, asking their support to
allow bills with priority to be approved at an emergency meeting.</P>
      <P>The administration is especially concerned about the bank holding
company bill, financial reconstruction fund management provisions,
and the revision of the insurance law, which are important to an
overall financial reform program.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang said that these bills are
essential in the revitalization of Taiwan's monetary system. The
early approval and implementation of the reform program is important,
said Yen, adding that the finance ministry has made reform a major
theme in promoting investment in Taiwan to those in Europe.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's rising unemployment, the
country's overall workforce is still currently some 200,000 short of
actual demand, officials from the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsung-ming, director-general of CLA's Employment and
Vocational Training Administration, urged the Taiwan public,
particularly job seekers, to readjust their values to allow them to
make the most of job opportunities that arise.</P>
      <P>Lin quoted the latest CLA survey results as indicating that
currently there are about 44,000 openings in government agencies of
all levels, while the mammoth government-initiated investment
projects totaling some NT$810 billion in value are poised to provide
some 54,000 work opportunities islandwide.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the government's emergency employment plan
will need about 10,000 personnel, while local employment service
centers as a whole have about 54,000 job vacancies available, plus
more than 70,000 work opportunities are available from private-run
human resource centers islandwide.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CLA is pondering measures to open Taiwan's
high-technology market wider to foreign nationals so as to help beef
up Taiwan's hi-tech development and ease the shortage of labor, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>CLA Vice Chairman Kuo Chi-jen said the plan -- designed to
recruit high-caliber white-collar workers from aboard -- will help
solicit foreign investments to Taiwan, consequently helping to
increase job opportunities locally. The plan, if approved, will be
applicable to all qualified individuals from abroad, including
mainland China, Kuo added.</P>

      <P>The majority of people in Taiwan look
forward to seeing Taiwan become a just, safe and orderly society 20
years from now, but many of them are not optimistic about Taiwan's
future, according to the results of an opinion poll released
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,096 randomly chosen Taiwan residents aged 18 or
over was conducted by the CommonWealth magazine from May 18-24 to
explore local people's vision of Taiwan in 2020.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 55.7 percent of the respondents expect Taiwan
to become a Singapore- or Japan-like society known for their fair,
secure and orderly living environments by 2002.</P>
      <P>About 32 percent said they hope Taiwan becomes a clean, beautiful
place like Switzerland over the next two decades; 31 percent said
they would like to see Taiwan become a competitive, high-tech
powerhouse like Silicon Valley in the United States; and 29.4 percent
said they hope Taiwan can develop into a North European-style country
with comprehensive social welfare services.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, survey results showed that many Taiwan people lack
confidence in the island's future. Only 30 percent said they think
that Taiwan would be better off over the next 20 years, while 55.4
percent said they foresee a deterioration of Taiwan's living quality.</P>
      <P>Asked about things that Taiwan must do most urgently now, survey
respondents cited upgrading national competitiveness (32.3 percent),
improving government operational efficiency (32.2 percent), raising
educational quality (31.8 percent), improving environmental quality
(30.7 percent), and narrowing the wealth gap (29.4 percent), in that
order.</P>
      <P>As for priority tasks for Taiwan in 2020, the respondents
mentioned beefing up national competitiveness (30.4 percent),
upgrading educational quality (27.2 percent), improving the living
environment (26.6 percent), and promoting friendly interaction
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait (26.2 percent), in that
order.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 65.8 percent said they look forward to seeing the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait co-exist peacefully and cooperate
reciprocally by 2020; 35.9 percent said they hope to see the two
sides conduct full-fledged engagements and allow direct "three
links"; 23.7 percent said they prefer to see the status quo remain;
15.3 percent said they would like to see the two sides unify by 2020;
and 12.4 percent said they expect to see Taiwan declare independence.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan can realize its goal of creating a just,
clean and secure living environment for sustainable development over
the next 20 years, 44.7 percent said they are optimistic about the
prospect; 35 percent said they are pessimistic; and 20 percent didn't
answer the question.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 47.2 percent of the respondents believe
that Taiwan stands a chance of becoming a model for Chinese societies
around the world if all local people make concerted efforts over the

communication.</P>
      <P>Through her dedicated efforts, the foundation has become
Asia's largest teaching service organization for
hearing-impaired children. More than 1,000 Taiwan kids have
benefited from its services.</P>
      <P>The foundation offered free instruction in the Auditory-Verbal

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, M'LAND CURATORS MEET OVER 2,500-YEAR-OLD BRONZE ARTIFACTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Museum curators from across the Taiwan
Strait are meeting in Taipei this week to bring together an assumed
complete collection of 2,500-year-old bronze relics that were
unearthed early last century and have been kept separately in Taiwan
and mainland China since 1949.</P>
      <P>After two years of contact between Taipei's National Museum of
History and Henan Museum in northern mainland China, curators from
Taiwan and the mainland have compiled and published a new catalogue
of more than 100 bronze artifacts from the tomb of Prince Zheng who
died more than 2,500 years ago during the Epoch of Spring and Autumn,
which lasted approximately from 722 to 484 B.C.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that curators and historians from both sides
of the Taiwan Strait have worked together to produce a catalogue.</P>
      <P>In addition to publishing the catalogue, the National Museum of
History is also hosting the "Cross-Strait Symposium on the Bronze
Artifacts from the Tomb of Prince Zheng in Xinzheng" for the purpose
of presenting the results of their research.</P>
      <P>Zhang Wenjun, director of Henan Museum, who is leading an
archaeological team from Henan Province to take part in the
symposium, said Prince Zheng's bronze relics, which have been
separated for more than 50 years, can now finally "be reunited,"
thanks to the publication of the 216-page catalogue, which has not
only served as a cross-strait bridge of friendship between people,
but also as a starting point for more productive cross-strait
cooperation in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Henan Province, with a continuous cultural heritage of eight
thousand years, is located in the Central Plains of mainland China.
Numerous archaeological sites mark the more than 20 dynasties that
ruled in the region. The rich history and abundant artifacts enrich
the mysterious charm of this prosperous land.</P>
      <P>Over the past century, archaeological work in the province at
numerous ancient sites and tombs has led to the discovery of more
than 1 million artifacts reflecting the splendid cultural development
and politics of the various historical periods of the region.</P>
      <P>The Kingdom of Zheng, established by Prince Zheng during the
Spring and Autumn Period in the Xinzheng area of Henan, lasted for
390 years before perishing at the hands of the Kingdom of Han in 375
B.C.</P>
      <P>In 1923, many bronze relics from the Spring and Autumn Period
were discovered at the tomb of Prince Zheng in Xinzheng. This
discovery came five years before the first archaeological excavation
in mainland China, at Anyang, Henan Province in 1928.</P>
      <P>Although the bronze artifacts were not excavated in accordance
with archaeological practice, the discovery was the only one to occur
before 1928 where all the artifacts were kept together.</P>
      <P>In 1927, the first catalogue relating to the discovery was
published by director Guan Baiyi of Henan Museum. Because the site of
the discovery was well-known and easily accessible, the bronze
artifacts found there became the standard reference in research into
bronze artifacts of the Spring and Autumn Period.</P>
      <P>The collection of more than 100 relics has experienced two long
distance journeys due to two wars in the first half of the 20th
century. During the second journey, one portion of the collection was
moved to Taiwan in 1949, while the other remained in mainland China.
The two portions of the collection have remained separated since
then.</P>
      <P>The Xinzheng bronze artifacts from Prince Zheng's mausoleum,
including wine pots, cooking vessels and musical instruments, inherit
the solemnity and strength of the West Zhou Period and express the
fairness and liveliness of the Spring and Autumn and the Warring
Periods, according to Director Zhang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN CALLS ATTENTION TO PLA'S RECENT MILITARY MANEUVERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) on
Wednesday called his congressional colleagues' attention to the
recent military maneuvers by Communist China that "appear to threaten
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the House floor, the radio talk show host-turned
congressman said: "Let China hear that in this Congress, we will
stand with those who will stand for liberty."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the People's Liberation Army's response to
nearly every political development seems to be to increase its
military posture.</P>
      <P>"I wonder, Mr. Speaker, what is the People's Republic of China
afraid of," Pence asked.</P>
      <P>"To my knowledge, during the modern era, there has never been a
credible threat to the security of mainland China. The amphibious
military training maneuvers currently underway are similar to 1996
exercises that resulted in a missile launch aimed at the Taiwan
Straits," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The newly elected congressman reminded his colleagues that the
United States responded to those live missile-firing exercises by
deploying aircraft carrier battle groups to the region.</P>
      <P>"Now, as then, the United States is committed to stability in the
region," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>"The threatening nature of these recent maneuvers and their
proximity to Taiwan challenges the territorial stability of the
island and the long-term peace of the region," Pence said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. congressman then urged his colleagues to join him in
monitoring the conduct of the Communist Chinese military in the
coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang called on
the Legislative Yuan Friday in order to solicit support for convening
a special session so that several bills crucial to financial reform
can be passed into law as early as possible.</P>
      <P>The Legislature ended its most recent session Wednesday with a
backlog of bills, including several key bills related to financial
reforms. The next session is not scheduled to open until
mid-September.</P>
      <P>Yen, accompanied by Tsai Huang-liang, party whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, reaffirmed the importance of the six
bills concerning financial reforms.</P>
      <P>He said that with the support of the Legislature, the banking law
has been revised and a bill on the merger of financial institutions
has been signed into law, but he added that the six bills, including
those concerning bill finance management, the establishment and
management of a financial rehabilitation fund, and regulations
concerning financial holding companies, have yet to be passed into

      <P>The setting up of a financial rehabilitation fund is aimed
at helping banks write off mounting bad loans.</P>

importance to the nation's overall economic development and social
progress, and are crucial to luring foreign investment to the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PILGRIMS MAKE 1ST DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT VOYAGE VIA KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The direct "mini three links" program set
yet another record Friday when a group of pilgrims from Taiwan's
Yunlin County sailed across the Taiwan Strait directly to mainland
China's Xiamen via this frontline island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The 363-member pilgrimage group sailed from the southern Taiwan
port of Kaohsiung via a ferry boat to Kinmen early in the morning,
and the boat continued its voyage to Xiamen with the same passengers
aboard after a two-hour transit stop at Kinmen's Liaolo port.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Taiwan residents were allowed to
made a direct voyage to mainalnd China via the Republic of
China-held offshore defense outpost since the opening of the direct
cross-strait "mini three links" at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The pilgrimage group was organized by the Taoist Chupao Temple
in Mailiao, Yunlin County. Wei Jung-hui, head of the temple's
management commission, said the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), approved the group's application for a direct
cross-strait voyage via Kinmen on an experimental basis.</P>
      <P>The Chupao Temple is dedicated to a live-saving deity known as
Paosheng. An icon of the folk deity worshipped in the temple was
taken from Fumei Temple in Chuanzhou in the southeastern mainland
province of Fujian to Mailiao 290 years ago.</P>
      <P>"We have organized the pilgrimage group to accompany the icon to
make a visit to its home temple in Chuanzhou," Wei said, adding that
all pilgrims were excited at making the maiden direct voyage from
Taiwan to the mainland via Kinmen. "The direct shipping service has
allowed us to halve travel time and cost," he added.</P>
      <P>The group will make a similar direct voyage from Xiamen to
Kaohsiung via Kinmen after wrapping up its current five-day
pilgrimage and sightseeing trip on June 12.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to show goodwill toward mainland China,
the ROC government opened its two outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu for direct trade, mail and shipping links with mainland
China's port cities of Xiamen and Mawei in Fujian province Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>This "mini three links" program was originally designed to
benefit only Kinmen and Matsu residents. But the ROC government has
decided to gradually expand the scope of its implementation to pave
the way for eventual opening of full-fledged direct cross-strait
"three links."</P>
      <P>Friday's historic direct voyage from Kaohsiung to Xiamen via
Kinmen for religious purposes was part of the MAC's plan to expand
the role of the "mini three links" program, government sources said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has been reluctant to throw full support behind the
ROC-initiated "mini three links" program. For the past six months, it
has approved applications for direct Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei
voyages only on a case-by-case basis. And only a few group of
mainland visitors have so far made direct voyages from Xiamen or
Mawei to the two ROC offshore defense outposts.</P>

(By Jennifer Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been ranked by Forbes magazine
as the world's eighth best place to start a business.</P>
      <P>In its latest survey of the investment climate in major economies
around the world, Forbes wrote in its latest issue that the United
States tops all nations around the world as the best place to start a
business, followed by Singapore and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The top 15 best nations or areas within which to start a business
were found to be the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, Ireland,
Britain, Belgium, Australia, Taiwan, Finland, the Netherlands,
Germany, Japan, Sweden, Spain and Malaysia, in that order, according
to the Forbes survey.</P>
      <P>In terms of business start-up costs, Britain topped the list with
the lowest costs, while Taiwan ranked sixth in the world and first
among all Asian nations and areas surveyed.</P>
      <P>In terms of capital acquisition, the United States topped the
list as the easiest place in which to acquire capital and funds,
while Hong Kong finished at the top of the list among Asian nations
and areas. Taiwan ranked 11th in the world in this field, while
mainland China ranked 21st.</P>
      <P>On the issue of taxation of personal income, Singapore, Hong Kong

18th most competitive in terms of business while Poland finished at
the bottom of the list.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMUNIST CHINA SAID TO HAVE TEST-FIRED NEW CRUISE MISSILE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China test-fired a new
air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) for the first time last month, the
Washington Times reported Friday, quoting unnamed U.S. intelligence
officials.</P>
      <P>The paper called the weapon "Beijing's answer to the
ship-launched U.S. Tomahawk (cruise missile)." It is mainland China's
first land-attack cruise missile.</P>
      <P>The report quoted officials familiar with the test as saying that
the ground-hugging, air-to-surface missile was launched from a B-6
bomber and that the test was deemed successful by U.S. defense and
intelligence agencies.</P>
      <P>The missile is believed to be capable of carrying a 1-ton
high-explosive or nuclear warhead to an unknown range, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>Military analysts said mainland China has been working secretly
on the new weapon, which is an extended-range version of the C-802
anti-ship cruise missile. The missile is said to be powered by a
turbojet engine and is expected to have a range of at least 170
kilometers.</P>
      <P>Richard Fisher, a specialist on the Chinese military with the
private Jamestown Foundation, told the paper that the new ALCM will
have a "substantial range" and will be fitted with television-camera
precision guidance.</P>
      <P>Fisher said that the new missile has been dubbed variously the
"Hong Niao," meaning "Red Bird," and "Chang Feng," or "Long Wind."
The missile is said to be a hybrid of three missiles: the Russian
Kh-55 cruise missile, the Tomahawk -- obtained clandestinely from the
United States -- and a cruise missile purchased from Israel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP URGES TAIWAN PUBLIC `NOT TO BE FOOLED' BY BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
urged the Taiwan public Friday not to be "confused," or "fooled," by
Beijing's leaders on issues of the "one China" policy and the PLA's
increased deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a recent report, Beijing has said that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait can start talking about mainland China's removal
of missiles away from the coastal province of Fujian if Taiwan
"returns to the `one China' framework."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Lu said that if the "one China"
referred to by Beijing is the People's Republic of China, the truth
of Beijing's hegemony and bellicosity toward Taiwan is even more
threatening than real missiles.</P>
      <P>Lu called for the Taiwan public not to be "confused" by the
reports. Instead, she said, Taiwan's people and government should be
firm on its stance. "The Fujian missiles will not take a toll on
Taiwan's economy," she stressed.</P>
      <P>It was reported that mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhang Yuxi said Thursday that as long as Taiwan recognizes the "one
China" principle, the two sides can talk about virtually
"everything," including the issue of missile deployment.</P>
      <P>Lu said Zhang's reported remarks could be a reaction to her
continual calls over the past several months urging Beijing to remove
its threatening missiles aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Beijing used the "one China" principle as a
"shield." But if by "one China" Beijing means the PRC, the motive is
far more threatening that missiles, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lu added that she believes the 21st century will be "a century of
peace when no wars should be allowed to occur."</P>

two years ago when he saved two junior high students from drowning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAY STOCK EXCHANGE TAX REVENUE SETS RECORD LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local stock exchange tax revenue in May
totaled NT$4.3 billion, setting a record low for this year, according
to statistics released Friday by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that land tax revenue fell to NT$4
billion in May, setting a new low since December, 1990.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the MOF's Statistics Department,
attributed the drop in tax revenue to the recession in the local real
estate market and stock exchange, noting that many people are renting
accommodation rather than buying homes, which has affected land tax
revenue.</P>
      <P>As for the local stock exchange, he went on, both transaction
volume and value also shrank in May, with transaction value averaging
just NT$51.1 billion per day and dealing a heavy blow to the stock
exchange revenue.</P>
      <P>The national tax revenue totaled NT$224.6 billion, a decrease of
2.4 percent compared with the level of the previous year, of which
the stock exchange tax revenue fell by 53.4 percent, the business
operation tax fell by 8.2 percent and the land tax fell by 44.4
percent. Income tax, however, increased by 8 percent.</P>
      <P>Other tax incomes were broken down as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Import/export duty revenue totaled NT$7.9 billion, a decrease
of 15.9 percent;</P>
      <P>-- income tax revenue reached NT$103.4 billion, an increase of 8
percent; and</P>
      <P>-- business operation tax revenue amounted to NT$40.1 billion, a

    <HEADLINE>CANCER REMAINS TAIWAN'S TOP KILLER: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cancer remained the top killer in Taiwan
last year, with a total of 31,554 people dying from various forms of
the disease, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>It is the 19th consecutive year that cancer has topped the list
of causes of death in Taiwan. In 2000, one local citizen died from a
malignant tumor every 16 minutes and 39 seconds on average, compared
to every 17 minutes and 38 seconds a year earlier.</P>
      <P>And as Taiwan's population ages, DOH officials said, the number
of people who died from kidney ailments also increased significantly
last year, although fewer people died from hypertension.</P>
      <P>Among the various forms of cancer, lung cancer claimed the
largest number of lives last year, followed by liver cancer,
colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer,
oral cancer and prostate cancer, in that order.</P>
      <P>For men, liver cancer was the number one killer in 2000, but lung
cancer accounted for the largest number of malignant tumor-related
deaths among women.</P>
      <P>Compared with the 1999 figures, the annual growth rates of lung
and liver cancer-related deaths dropped in 2000, but the fatalities
from oral cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic
cancer all grew at a rate of more than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>According to DOH statistics, the average age of local men who
died from cancer last year was 65.15 years, slightly older than the
average age of 64.44 years for women.</P>
      <P>Stroke came in second on the top 10 killers list, followed by
heart disease, accidents, diabetes, liver ailments, kidney disease,
pneumonia, suicide, and respiratory diseases, including bronchitis
and asthma.</P>
      <P>While the death tolls from cancer, stroke, diabetes and suicide
continued to rise last year, the casualties from heart disease,
accidents, chronic liver ailments, pneumonia and bronchitis all
dropped from the year-earlier levels.</P>
      <P>The death toll from heart disease has declined steadily for the
past eight years and pneumonia fatalities have fallen continuously
over the past two years.</P>
      <P>A noteworthy development was that tuberculosis made the top 10
killers list for local men for the first time last year. Meanwhile, a
total of 1,214 children aged between one and 14 died last year, with
39.21 percent of them killed by accidents. Accidents also accounted
for more than 60 percent of deaths among adolescents and young
adults.</P>
      <P>DOH tallies also show that the life expectancy of local people
increased further last year, with that for men reaching an average of
72.63 years and the average life span for women surging to 78.3
years.</P>
      <P>Since the national health insurance program was launched in 1994,
male life expectancy has extended by 2.7 years and female life
expectancy has risen by 2.2 years.</P>
      <P>A total of 124,481 people died last year, translating into a
death rate of 561.12 out of every 100,000 people, slightly lower than
the 1999 level. A major cause of the higher 1999 death rate was the
devastating 9-21 earthquake that claimed more than 2,400 lives around
the island.</P>
      <P>Although suicides overall did not post any significant growth,
the number of people over the age of 65 who took their own lives
increased sharply.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the infant mortality rate continued to decline, with
an average of five newborns dying each day last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FABIAN SOCIETY FOUNDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A political alliance in the spirit of
Britain's "Fabian Society" was formed Friday by a dozen founding
members, including two chairmen of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and a former justice minister.</P>
      <P>The Fabian Society, a society formed by British intellectuals in
the late 19th century, exerted an important influence over the
government of the time.</P>
      <P>Former DPP chairmen Shih Ming-teh and Hsu Hsin-liang, former
Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao and 10 others served as the conveners
of the alliance, dubbed "The Mountain."</P>
      <P>A declaration titled "We Only Have This Home," was read at the
formal launch of the alliance. Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, legislators
across the party spectrum and several government officials were on
hand to greet its opening.</P>
      <P>The declaration notes that current political figures lack the
habit of reflecting on their power and adds that the current
government is the result of a political changeover under a democratic
system, of which the public harbors great hope and expectations.</P>
      <P>But one year after the inauguration of the Chen Shui-bian
administration, the public is disappointed as it sees no national
direction but only lust for power and political scheming and
maneuvering for the short-term interests of politicians, according to
the declaration. The public does not see any efforts being made to
establish a system of checks and balances, but only political figures
trying to shirk their responsibilities, it says.</P>
      <P>Chief convenor Shih, an incumbent legislator, said that he
suggested to Chen March 20, 2000 after Chen's victory in the
presidential election that he should form a majority alliance in the
legislature. He later suggested that Chen address squarely the
worsening economic situation and again expressed the hope that the
government should stick to the Constitution and form an alliance
government through party-to-party negotiation. None of his
suggestions were accepted, he noted.</P>
      <P>Shih said that he and others from various walks of life have
therefore decided to step forward to advocate rationality and to try
to point the way toward national development.</P>
      <P>Hsu stressed that the biggest crisis facing Taiwan is "the
determined efforts to do something in total disregard of a system,
the right direction or objective reality."</P>
      <P>Saying that Fabian Society charted the direction of Britain in
the late 19th century, "The Mountain" alliance added that it hopes to
follow suit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to Shih and Hsu, alliance secretary-general Jaw
Shau-kong and spokeswoman Sisy Chen, other conveners include Schive
Chi, former vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, former vice presidential candidate Wang Chin-feng and
art professor and director Stan Lai.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in future, the alliance will present their
suggestions on national affairs as its main pedestal and will
complement this by taking part in local politics.</P>
      <P>She said the participants come from all walks of life, including
those who have departed or partially retired from politics, as well
as some who have never been involved in politics, who are
participating because they want to contribute something to their
"only home." They will constantly remind themselves that they will
not serve as the tool of any political power, she added.</P>
      <P>Chen said the alliance will recommend to the public good
candidates of all political persuasions in the year-end legislative
and county and city chief elections.</P>
      <P>But among the 12 participants of the alliance, only Shih and
former minister Liao are likely to run in the elections.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the aim of the alliance is not to form a group for
political power, but to provide a rational view and "commend
excellent political figures."</P>

Chairman Lee Teng-hui still has high expectations for the party, KMT

      <P>Wang also said that a Thursday meeting between Lee and KMT

Lee as telling Lien that "although there have been some

      <P>According to Wang, the meeting was the first between the two men

ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will win 85 seats in
parliament in the election slated for December and that it will form

encouragement to the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"Lee's remarks should remind all the opposition parties that they
should continue to seek progress and win public confidence," Wang
noted.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that the KMT would also control a majority of
seats in the Legislative Yuan should it win 85 seats in the year-end
election and cooperate with other parties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local Internet cafe owners have formed an
association that will establish self-regulatory guidelines, it was
reported recently.</P>
      <P>The association was formed in response to the fact that Internet
cafes and online gaming are booming in Taiwan, and like everywhere
else in the world, the authorities find it difficult to supervise
their operations.</P>
      <P>Initiators of the association said that some Internet cafes use
pornography and gambling to lure customers, not only damaging the
image of the sector as a whole but also threatening the normal
operations of the business.</P>
      <P>Since the authorities have failed to work out any measure to
regulate the business, the association plans to invite lawyers and
software houses to jointly set up a screening group. Internet cafes
which can fulfill the requirements of the group will be issued a
certificate.</P>
      <P>The screening group will check on the facilities, including
emergency exits and non-smoking areas, as well as juvenile protection
enforcement at the Internet cafes.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the Taipei city government shows that 34
percent of the people polled said that they, their friends or their
relatives have visited Internet cafes, 53 percent of whom go to play
online games.</P>
      <P>Although about half of those polled said they would welcome the

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S MILITARY THREATS CANNOT FORCE ROC TO NEGOTIATING TABLE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's military threats and saber
rattling cannot force the Republic of China to the negotiating table,
a mainland affairs official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, was responding to Beijing's claim that if Taiwan were to
accept the so-called "one China" principle, the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait could negotiate the removal of guided missiles
deployed in mainland China's Fujian province, which lies opposite
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin told a routine news conference that mainland China's
military threats and attempts to catch Taiwan in a "rhetorical trap"
are unacceptable to ROC citizens.</P>
      <P>As far as cross-strait affairs are concerned, Lin said,
goodwill, moderate talks would be more constructive and productive
than rude, belligerent rhetoric.</P>
      <P>"Previous experiences showed whenever mainalnd China tried
to intimidate Taiwan in an unfriendly manner or with live-fire war
games, such practices had consistently drawn backlash from the
people of Taiwan," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lin said the Hong Kong media hype on mainland
China's ongoing routine military exercises on Dongshan Island off the
Fujian coast might be counterproductive.</P>
      <P>Lin further said it is regrettable that mainland China has so
far not taken any concrete actions in response to Taiwan's continued
expression of a great amount of goodwill toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that since Taiwan and mainland China remain
divided over the "one China" definitions, the two sides should sit
down to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's snub of Taiwan's olive branches, Lin went on,
the ROC government will not waver in its determination to boost
cross-strait exchanges under the premise that Taiwan's security will
not be compromised.</P>
      <P>Among others, Lin said, the MAC is considering allowing products
that have been shipped from mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou ports
to Taiwan's Kaohsiung Harbor to be airlifted to Southeast Asian
countries under the current framework of cross-strait offshore

      <P>Taiwan still bans direct cross-strait transport links. But it
allows cross-strait offshore transshipping services to meet the
demand of a large number of Taiwan investors in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under current cross-strait offshore transshipping regulations,
mainland goods can be shipped directly to Kaohsiung for
transshipment to third countries. Those products are banned
from clearing customs or entering Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reminded
local businesses Friday that they should not ignore possible risks
while launching investment projects in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen issued the caution during a community reach-out tour of
Taoyuan County, some 40 kilometers south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said some myths are prevailing in the local business
community. Those myths include that mainland China is the only ideal
investment destination and that opening of direct transport links
across the Taiwan Strait is the only cure for Taiwan's current
economic woes.</P>
      <P>"While we should not overlook mainland China's development
potential, we should also avoid turning a blind eye to possible
perils or traps in its overall investment climate," Chen cautioned.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's sustainable economic development over
past decades lies in its enterprises' brilliant adaptability and
their diversified business operations, Chen said local business
people should not disregard Taiwan's own economic vitality.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that with ambition, vision, ingenuity and
concerted efforts of the private and public sectors, we would be able

    <HEADLINE>CHEN TOURS COPPER FACTORY, VOWS TO BETTER THE ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
his vow to revive Taiwan's economy is no slogan and the government
will live up to its promise.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the opening of direct trade, transportation and
postal links across the Taiwan Strait is not the only way out of
Taiwan's current economic slowdown, Chen said that the government
must display its full determination to the public. He urged local
businesses not to underestimate Taiwan's own economic clout by
cashing in on the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>"Of course mainland China is a promising market, but Taiwanese
firms should not overlook the potential risks while deciding whether
or not to invest there," he said, pointing out that "flexibility and
diversification are the cornerstone of the stable developments of
Taiwan's industries."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a visit to S&amp;T Copper
Industries Co. Ltd. in Yangmei near Taipei, the first stop of his
one-day tour to local factories.</P>
      <P>Saying that he was very touched by the strong ambition and vigor
of local enterprises, Chen praised S&amp;T Copper Industries for its
important contribution to the island's industrial development.</P>
      <P>With its advanced technology and comprehensive after-sale
services, S&amp;T Copper Industries has successfully transformed itself
into Asia's leading copper plaque maker and the world's
second-largest, despite the fact that Taiwan must import all of its
copper, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Lauding S&amp;T Copper Industries' spirit of "breakthrough,
renovation, and superior performance," he said that those are the
values and principles of the so-called "knowledge-based economy," at
a time when the country's industries are facing a critical juncture
of rapid transformation.</P>
      <P>Chen later paid a visit to nearby China Motor Corporation, where
Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-i once served as a manager and
was labeled as "Taiwan's Lee Iaccoca" by the local business community
for his remarkable reforms of the company.</P>
      <P>Comparing Taiwan to a small sports car, Chen said the country's
future is bright as long as local industries pursue continued
diversification and technology upgrading. He hailed China Motor as a
good example which has created a new image for Taiwan's car industry.</P>
      <P>The president further pointed out that he has full confidence in
Lin, particularly because of his success in injecting a new lease on
life into the ailing China Motor. Describing Lin's success as "no
accident," he thanked Lin for leaving the highly-paid post in China
Motor and devoting himself to the country.</P>
      <P>"Reforms take time," Chen said, voicing his strong belief that
Lin will do a good job in his current post if he is given a little
more time and support.</P>
      <P>The president also hailed Lin's performance in the
recently-concluded ministerial meeting of the Asia -Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum held in Shanghai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG JIN-PYNG SPEAKS ON EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The president of the Legislative Yuan said
Friday that the law-making body should not call for a special session
to discuss bills that failed to pass in the regular session.</P>
      <P>Instead, Wang Jin-pyng said that it would be more appropriate for
the president to initiate the action with a specific purpose.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency, Wang said the
Legislative Yuan remains passive in arranging an extraordinary
session for fear that it might be misinterpreted as "an extension" of
the fifth session.</P>
      <P>"It is not proper for the Legislative Yuan to initiate the
convention of an extraordinary session for the purpose of screening
bills, and even when such a meeting is called at the request of the
president, it is better to specify the purpose," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The fifth session of the fourth legislature concluded at midnight
Thursday. The next session will open in September. Since several
bills which the administration considers urgent to the government's
economic stimulus programs were still outstanding, the Executive Yuan
hopes that an extraordinary session will be called during the summer
recess to have the bills approved.</P>
      <P>Although the Legislative Yuan can also call an extraordinary
session if a petition is signed by one-fourth of its members, Wang
said that without the consensus of all parties, the effort would be
in vain.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary session may also be called by the request of the
president, but Wang said the Presidential Office has not made any
such request to the Legislative Yuan. He believes that Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung should ask President Chen Shui-bian to make the first
move instead of having the Legislative Yuan take the initiative.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has had its most turbulent days in the past
year. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party is a minority and the
opposition parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party,
and the New Party -- are very diversified in their positions and
opinions.</P>
      <P>The public has been critical of the Legislative Yuan because of
its inefficiency and the breakdown of coordinating between members
and political parties. Wang said that one reason for the
Legislature's weakness is the seemingly routine quarrels that break
out on issues that are often trivial. This and the lack of
coordination between parties is the main reason important bills have
failed to be screened during the regular session.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the ruling party's faction in the Legislature, the
DPP, should be taking a responsible position for advancing the agenda
even though it only came to power a little over a year ago and is
inexperienced in many ways.</P>
      <P>A new legislature will be elected at the end of this year and it
is generally expected that none of the political parties will achieve
an absolute majority.</P>
      <P>Regarding the forming of a coalition government for political
stability, Wang said most legislators, including quite a few DPP
members, advocate negotiations on a party-to-party basis, although
there has been speculation that the DPP is trying to recruit
legislators of other camps to attain a legislative majority.</P>
      <P>Wang said that there would always be speculation of this nature,
but he personally doubted the possibility of an exodus of KMT
legislators after the election.</P>
      <P>"It is a very insecure expectation to base a political party's
stability on the splintering of other parties," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan drug trafficker known locally as
one of the most infamous kingpins was executed Thursday night at the
Taipei Prison, five years after he was arrested and escorted back to
Taiwan from Thailand, police said.</P>
      <P>Lee Yi-hsiung was the first drug trafficker who was put to death

after Chen announced on May 20 the planned policy of scrapping the
death penalty within three years.</P>
      <P>Lee began drug trafficking between Taiwan and Thailand in 1986
when nearly one-sixth of the narcotics smuggled from Thailand to
Taiwan came through Lee's channel, police said, adding that Lee had
accumulated more than NT$1 billion (US$29.42 million) from
trafficking until his arrest.</P>
      <P>Lee was caught in May 1996 at a Thai village bordering Myanmar in

      <P>The central government will offer some

      <P>Chen made the remarks while exchanging views with Kaohsiung

      <P>As Kaohsiung County has topped the unemployment rating among the

"Hope Project for Employment" for middle-aged and older jobless
workers.</P>

      <P>Chen noted that the central government will take various steps to
provide some 230,000 job opportunities in the coming months as a way
to counter the soaring jobless rate, which surpassed 4 percent in
some counties and cities.</P>
      <P>But she expressed the hope that the unemployed workers would be
willing to take the first job that they find, rather than hold out

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED NOT TO SET TRADE BARRIERS AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan would feel more at ease in relaxing
restrictions on mainland China-bound investment if Beijing is willing
to make a public promise not to adopt unfair trade barriers against
Taiwan companies, a senior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), made the remarks while attending a
seminar on Taiwan-U.S.-mainland China economic and financial
relations in the era of new economy.</P>
      <P>Chen said whenever Taiwan exports a large amount of certain
products to mainland China, Beijing authorities tend to ask
Taiwan-financed firms on the mainland to switch their orders for
those items to mainland manufacturers or impose unfair
administrative barriers to force Taiwan entrepreneurs to set up
production lines on the mainland.</P>
      <P>In Chen's view, this unfair trading phenomenon is not expected
to stop after both sides of the Taiwan Strait are admitted to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in the near future.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that Taiwan will join the WTO as a developed
economy while mainland China will enter the world trade regulatory
body as a developing economy.</P>
      <P>Logically, Chen said, developed economies should assist
developing countries in economic development by offering them
preferential treatment.</P>
      <P>"But this practice usually would give developing countries
opportunities to impose unfair trade barriers. And Taiwan still cannot
afford to do so because its per capita national income is the
lowest among all developed countries," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's top economic planner said he hopes all
developing countries would refrain from abusing their power to
create unfair market competition.</P>
      <P>At present, Chen said, Taiwan's overall investment in
mainland China accounts for 1 percent of the island's gross
domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>"As Taiwan still has a 2 percent excess savings rate, its
mainland investment would not have a serious impact on the
island's domestic capital supply. When the outbound investment
ratio exceeds 2 percent of its GDP, Taiwan's domestic investment and
economic development would be affected," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen further said Taiwan-U.S.-mainland China trade
interdependence has grown and deepened steadily. "As mainland China
has gradually become an important part of the global supply network,
any political conflict in the region would certainly result in
adverse economic impact," he explained.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the relocation of Taiwan's personal computer
production lines to mainland China would not only hinder Taiwan's own
economic development and high-tech industries but would also affect
the U.S. computer industry which relies heavily on Taiwan's OEM
(original equipment manufacturing) services.</P>

      <P>U.S. Senator George Allen (R-Va.) said
Thursday that Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian's historic
visit to the United States last month "deserves the notice and
respect of the U.S. Senate."</P>
      <P>Addressing the Senate floor, Allen pointed out that President
Chen became the second democratically-elected president in Chinese
history a little over a year ago, "and his election was certainly a
milestone in Taiwan's continued adherence to democracy and freedom."</P>
      <P>The newly elected senator stressed that "Congress has long
supported democratic development around the world, and Taiwan is no
exception."</P>
      <P>He called today's Taiwan a notable model of rapid and successful
democratic reform as well as an important U.S. trading partner that
has maintained amicable ties with the United States for decades.</P>
      <P>"What may not also be known is that Taiwan imports over 1.6 times
as many goods from the United States as does the People's Republic of
China. (Therefore) Taiwan is a vital economic partner for the United
States," Allen noted.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's economy offers its people one of the highest
standards of living in Asia, including universal education, excellent
medical care, and a well-developed social welfare policy. Moreover,
Taiwan's Constitution guarantees full political freedoms and basic
human rights to all citizens.</P>
      <P>"As Taiwan continues its democratic development, President Chen
and the people of Taiwan deserve our most sincere praise for their
exemplary adherence to individual liberty and freedom," he added.</P>

dagger and dies at the age of 31. His early reign was dominated by

cruelty and irresponsibility provoked widespread revolts which led to
his suicide.

shores, reformed the administration of the state, and founded St.

United States as the noose slips over the head of the last Nazi

different counts. Twelve men, including Nazis Hermann Goering and
Joachim von Ribbentrop, were given the death penalty.

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TELLS GRADUATES `SKY'S THE LIMIT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, June 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian
told graduates during a commencement at National Sun Yat-sen
University Saturday that "the sky's the limit" and that "one should
never restrict oneself to boundaries set by others."</P>
      <P>Addressing a full-house, Chen told a story about a drunken man
who lost his key on the road home at night to metaphorically express
that imposing restrictions on oneself is a pity. When the man in the
story discovered he had lost his key, he began looking for it but
failed to find it as he only searched the part of the road
illuminated by a streetlight when in fact the key lay in the darkness
just beyond the reach of the light.</P>
      <P>Chen used another metaphorical story to urge graduates not to be
pessimistic. In this story, a farmer watching from the banks of the
Hudson River the launch of America's first steamship expressed his
skepticism about the modern invention by saying "I don't think it
will ever sail." When the steamship did in fact set sail successfully
and began moving quickly along the river, the old man responded by
saying that "I don't think it will be able to stop."</P>
      <P>In order to urge the new graduates to never lose sight of their
original aspirations, Chen conveyed yet another story, this one
having once been told by the Republic of China's founding father Sun
Yat-sen.</P>
      <P>In this story, a laborer managed to buy a lottery ticket by using
all of his savings. He hid the lottery ticket in the bamboo pole that
he used to make his living as a punt pusher. One day, when he found
out that he had won the grand prize, he became so excited that he
threw the bamboo pole into the sea thinking that now that he was
rich, he would no longer need it. Gone with the bamboo pole where the
laborer's lottery ticket and his hopes.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the bamboo pole is similar to one's
original ideals and the lottery ticket represents the hopes and
desires for fame and fortune. He said that the pursuit of fame and
fortune is not necessarily bad, but one should never lose sight of
one's original ideals in the actual pursuit.</P>
      <P>During the commencement ceremony, Chen bestowed the university's
"Diligence Award" on two of the new graduates -- Chen Chu, chairwoman
of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs, and Su Chia-chuan,
magistrate of Pingtung County. Both stalwarts of Chen's Democratic
Progressive Party received their master's degree from National Sun
Yat-sen University's Institute of Public Affairs Management.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DECEASED GRADUATE AWARDED DIPLOMA POSTHUMOUSLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Chengchi University (NCU) on
Saturday awarded a diploma posthumously to an ethnic Chinese student
from Malaysia who died two days ago in a landslide tragedy.</P>
      <P>NCU President Cheng Jui-cheng said at a commencement ceremony
that although Chung Wei-chieh, a senior in the university's Public
Administration Department, has passed away, he deserves to receive
the diploma in recognition of his years of effort and study.</P>
      <P>Chung, accompanied by his parents, his girlfriend and her mother,
was driving a compact car on a mountain road linking Taipei to the
northeastern county of Ilan Thursday when a rock fell onto his
automobile during a landslide. All five people in the car were killed
in the tragedy.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Chung's abrupt death has saddened many people. "He had
been a diligent student. He was fully qualified to receive a
bachelor's degree," he added.</P>
      <P>The school reserved a seat for Chung at the commencement. A
diploma and a bachelor's degree robe and hat were placed on the empty
seat in memory of the deceased graduate.</P>
      <P>Three of Chung's sisters and his uncle, who flew to Taipei from
Malaysia Friday to handle affairs in the aftermath of the tragedy,
attended the commencement on his behalf.</P>
      <P>His elder sister said their parents had been proud of Chung's
academic achievements and had thus especially traveled from Malaysia
to Taiwan to attend his commencement.</P>
      <P>The NCU's administrative division will help arrange a funeral for
Chung. The bodies of Chung and his parents will be cremated in Taipei
and his siblings will then bring the ashes back to Malaysia for
burial.</P>
      <P>The university has also opened a special postal savings account,
No. 19580601, to receive donations from local residents to help
Chung's family.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S SOVEREIGNTY CLAIM OVER TAIWAN NOT LEGALLY GROUNDED: LIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  eastern Taiwan, June 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's unilateral claim of
sovereignty over Taiwan is not grounded in any international law, a
Republic of China diplomat said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-ching, chairman of the Association of East Asian
Relations, a quasi-official body in charge of relations between
Taiwan and Japan, said Japan returned Taiwan to the ROC government
after World War II and made the Taiwan Area, which also includes the
offshore islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, part of the ROC
territory.</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities, which have ruled the Chinese mainland
since 1949 after a Chinese civil war, have not governed the Taiwan
Area for a single day in history, Lin said, adding that their
sovereignty claim over Taiwan at present is not legally supported by
any article of the international laws.</P>
      <P>Lin, formerly the top ROC representative in Japan, made the
remarks during a speech at a seminar Saturday on the Prospects of
Asia held at Fuo Kuang University in Ilan City.</P>
      <P>Quoting historical facts, Lin said that in the Cairo Declaration
signed on Dec. 1, 1943, by the leaders of the Allied countries, the
return of Manchuria, Taiwan and the Pescadores (Penghu) was promised
to the Republic of China, founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1911. The
People's Republic of China was not even established until 1949, he
noted.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 25, 1945, Taiwan was formally returned to the ROC
government by Japan, leading to the designation of the date as
"Taiwan Retrocession Day" -- a national holiday until recent years.</P>
      <P>In the Treaty of Peace between the ROC and Japan signed in Taipei
in 1952, Japan evidently underlined the fact of its return of Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinman and Matsu to the ROC government, Lin added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION REQUEST SHOULD COME FROM PRESIDENT: WANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Any request to convene an extraordinary
session of the Legislative Yuan would come more appropriately from
the president rather than from the Cabinet or lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, the speaker of the Legislative Yuan
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative Yuan, made the
remarks in an exclusive interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Executive Yuan has requested an extraordinary
legislative session in order to screen and pass bills which did not
have the opportunity to be passed into law before the Legislature
went into recess.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that the Executive Yuan should ask the
president to make a formal request to the Legislative Yuan for an
extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>The fifth session of the fourth Legislature concluded at midnight
Thursday with only 42 bills being passed and dozens of others --
those involving financial reforms in particular -- still outstanding.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Thursday morning made several calls
on Wang and faction chiefs of the opposition parties in the
Legislative Yuan in a bid to arrange an extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>According to the Republic of China Constitution, there are two
ways of convening extraordinary sessions of the Legislative Yuan --
either by a petition signed by at least one quarter of the 225
members of the Legislative Yuan or by a request from the president.</P>
      <P>The issue of how the extraordinary session should be convened has
been a focus of attention in recent days. The legislative alliance of
the opposition camp has decided to discuss the issue next Monday.</P>
      <P>Basically, the extraordinary session would be an extension of the
Legislative Yuan's fifth session, Wang said, adding that he wondered
whether the DPP caucus' signature-seeking move would gain support
from the opposition alliance.</P>
      <P>Wang insisted on his position that the president ask the
Legislative Yuan to convene an extraordinary session, saying that the
process will be more proper and reasonable and that bills will be
screened more efficiently if the president calls for such a session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPENING OF TAIWAN PAVILION AT VENICE EXPO MARRED BY ROW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Venice, June 8 (CNA)
(By Tony Fang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of a Taiwan pavilion at the 49th
Biennial Venice International Fine Arts Exhibition was marred Friday
by a row between the Venice city government and a local labor union.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was originally scheduled to start at 5 p.m. Friday.
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou flew to Venice earlier in the day
especially in order to preside over the Taiwan pavilion's grand
opening.</P>
      <P>The ceremony, however, was delayed by three hours because the
planned site for the ceremony was occupied by members of a local
oarsmen association.</P>
      <P>The Italian labor organization regards the site as its own turf
and feels any activities held there must first receive its consent.</P>
      <P>To vent its anger at the Venice city government's approval of
Taipei's application for staging an open-air pop concert at the site,
the association stationed a boat in the area early in the morning and
then mobilized its members to converge on the region to block any
activities.</P>
      <P>Italian police initially tried to persuade the union members to
leave, but to no avail. After difficult negotiations between Venice
city officials and union executives, the opening ceremony finally
started after a three-hour delay.</P>
      <P>However, a popular Taiwan rock band, led by singer-songwriter
Chen Sheng, was still barred from performing on a specially designed
stage. The band, which arrived in Venice Thursday, was forced to
perform on the sidewalk of a nearby street.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma expressed his strong dissatisfaction with the
Venice municipal authority's failure to resolve the problem of what
he called the Italian labor union's unreasonable demonstration, which
seriously hindered normal operations of the Taiwan pavilion.</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai, director of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs of
Taipei City Hall, said she was disappointed by the Venice city
government's lack of operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has participated in the biennial Venice arts show for many
years. The 2001 exhibition will formally kick off June 10 and last
through November.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DGBAS CHIEF RULES OUT POSSIBILITY OF TAX RAISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite its financial difficulties, the
government is unlikely to raise tax rates or levy any new taxes at
the moment, a senior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chuan, director-general of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), made the remarks in a
call-in radio talk show.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government has consistently faced a NT$100
billion (US$2.94 billion) shortfall in its budget. "And Taiwan's
current economic slowdown has further cut into the government's tax
revenues," he noted.</P>
      <P>Even so, Lin said, the possibility of the government raising
tax rates is almost nil. "The domestic political reality would
hinder any attempt to raise tax rates at the moment," the budget
chief observed.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say what the government can do at present is to
restructure the country's taxation scheme and rationalize overall
taxation system.</P>
      <P>In fact, Lin said, Taiwan has lowered, not raised, taxes in
recent years. For example, the integration of personal and
business income taxes and the lowering of business tax have cost
the national coffers by NT$100 billion and NT$50 billion,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Asked whether government employees would get a pay raise next
year, Lin said he couldn't answer the question until after the
Legislative Yuan passes the relevant budget plan.</P>
      <P>In reality, Lin said, the Central Personnel Administration has
so far not come up with any plan to adjust the pay scale for civil
servants and military servicemen.</P>
      <P>As for the long-talked-about proposal to offer a NT$3,000
monthly subsidy to those aged over 65, Lin said the results of a
government opinion poll show that proponents outnumber opponents.</P>
      <P>"The DGBAS will respect the Cabinet's decision on whether to
put the elderly subsidy proposal into practice," Lin said. The
proposal is one of President Chen Shui-bian's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Lin further said the DGBAS is endeavoring to substantiate the
"zero growth" budget principle to prevent continued swelling of
government expenditure and curtail waste of public funds.</P>

      <P>The Board of the Zoological Park
Organization of Thailand and the Republic of China's Taipei Zoo
signed a memorandum Friday to promote the exchange of animals between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>The signing ceremony was held in the lobby of the Board of the
Zoological Park Organization of Thailand.</P>
      <P>Sampan Panpat, a member of the Thai organization, and Chen
Shan-lin, chief of the secretariat of the ROC representative office
in Thailand, signed the memorandum on behalf of their respective
countries.</P>
      <P>Following the signing ceremony, the Taipei Zoo donated three
Borneo orangutans to the Thai side, while the Thai side donated five
sarus cranes and two greater hornbills to the Taipei Zoo.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Chen thanked Krase Chanawong, a Thai
minister without portfolio, and the Board of the Zoological Park
Organization of Thailand for their efforts in pushing for the
exchange of animals between the two countries. He said he believes
further bilateral exchanges of animals will continue in the future.</P>
      <P>In his speech at the ceremony, Sampan extended his gratitude to
the Taipei Zoo for its donation. He said that through the Thai
government's animal exchange programs with foreign countries,
Thailand can expand the number of animal species at zoos around
the country without having to spend a lot of money.</P>
      <P>The Board of the Zoological Park Organization of Thailand

      <P>New Party Legislator Elmer Fung, who is a

it is unlikely that a resumption in cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations

Fung said, "I believe the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will not be

      <P>The legislator noted that the on-going mainland Chinese military
exercises on Dongshan Island "are mainly directed against the forces
who support independence for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He went on to say that "President Chen has a very clear

    <HEADLINE>MOST TAIWAN PEOPLE UNCONCERNED ABOUT BEIJING'S MILITARY EXERCISES: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most people in Taiwan do not believe that
Beijing will invade Taiwan in the next one or two years despite the
frequent military exercises by mainland China, a survey showed
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Focus Survey Research Corporation, found
that people asked about China's military exercises on the
southeastern coast of the mainland mostly felt that there was nothing
to worry about. Sixty-five percent said the war games would not
impact the future of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Thirty-one percent, however, said they were concerned about the
future of Taiwan. The remainder said they had no opinion on the
subject.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that up to 77 percent who responded do not
think that Beijing will invade Taiwan in the next one or two years.
Fewer than 10 percent believe Beijing will invade Taiwan in the next
one or two years.</P>
      <P>Asked about President Chen Shui-bian's attitude toward mainland
China after his first year in office, some 47 percent said the
president should maintain his approach toward cross-strait matters.
Nearly 20 percent said the president should be tougher and 11 percent
said the president should make more concessions toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the public supported Chen's recent
five-nation trip to Latin American which included two stopovers in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Some 62 percent said that the trip helped raise the international
profile of Taiwan, while 21 percent said it had no bearing on the
issue.</P>
      <P>About 54 percent were satisfied with his recent performance after
his overseas trip; 37 percent said that they were not satisfied, and
the rest said they had no opinion.</P>
      <P>The poll surveyed those over 20 years old in Taiwan June 7-8 and

    <HEADLINE>DPP SHOULD NOT PIN HOPES ON DIVISION OF OPPOSITION: WANG JIN- PYNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should pin its hopes for a steady government on union with
other parties instead of on the division of the opposition, said
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency, the
Kuomintang speaker of the legislature cast doubt over the prediction
by former KMT chairman Lee Teng-hui that some 35 non-DPP legislators
will switch their political support to the DPP if the ruling party
increases its seats from 67 to 85 in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Wang said it is difficult to estimate how many seats the DPP can
win in the year-end elections, but non-DPP legislators who flirt with
the idea of switching political affiliation should take into account
whether they would be accepted by the DPP, what benefits they will
get from the switch and how they should conduct their election
campaigns in the future.</P>
      <P>The basis of democracy is the cooperation between parties through
negotiations and dialogue, a concept which is more reliable than
seeking the support of independent legislators through exchanges of
political benefits.</P>
      <P>A ruling party which lacks the majority support at the
legislature should cement their grip on power by forming a coalition
with other parties, rather than by wishful thinking of the break-up of
the opposition, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He said the government and the ruling DPP should be partially to
blame for the lack of efficiency of the Legislative Yuan in the last
session which saw many urgent bills concerning the public interest
mired in partisan bickering.</P>
      <P>Wang said the DPP administration lacks the experience in
shepherding their bills through the legislature and the DPP caucus at
the Legislative Yuan often fails to consult thoroughly with its own
party members and does not act in unity.</P>
      <P>Recalling that former KMT vice premiers Hsu Li-teh and Liu
Chao-shiuan often stayed at the Legislative Yuan to see
party-sponsored bills going through the legislature when their party
had a majority, Wang said the DPP government leaders appeared at the
legislature during only the last few days of the legislative session.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 51 percent of Taiwan's eligible
voters will gauge the capabilities and morals of candidates over
their party affiliation in the legislative and local government
elections slated for December, a recent survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a telephone survey conducted by a
consulting firm June 7-9, only 7 percent of the respondents will
consider candidates' party affiliation in the year-end legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of who should be held responsible for
Taiwan's current political instability, some 21 percent said that
"all parties concerned should be held accountable."</P>
      <P>Around 12.3 percent think that the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) should assume the responsibility for the country's
present political situation, while 9.2 percent and 8.9 percent said
President Chen Shui-bian and the Legislative Yuan are responsible.
Some 5.2 percent and 4 percent are of the opinion that the leading
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Executive Yuan are to blame.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether cooperation between Chen and former
President Lee Teng-hui will help stabilize Taiwan's present political
situation, 42 percent said they disagreed with that hypothesis, ahead
of the 28 percent who thought cooperation could help.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 34.9 percent said they think that cooperation
between the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) will help stabilize
the country's political situation, in contrast to 38.5 percent who
disagreed with the view.</P>
      <P>The DPP and the PFP were supported by 24.2 percent and 21.4
percent of respondents, respectively, while 12.8 percent and 24.9
percent backed the KMT or said they were neutral, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chao Yung-ching said the survey results are very
interesting and called for all political figures to realize that
every one of them, including lawmakers, should take responsibility
for Taiwan's current political disorder.</P>
      <P>Chao said he believes that the "Lee, A-bian system" and the
"KMT-PFP alliance" will increasingly take shape and probably lead to
a competition between the two major camps. He urged the public to
"open their eyes wide" to check whether there are "under-the-table
deals being made by influence peddlers."</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chou Hui-ying said the results of the survey should
serve as an alarm to all lawmakers preparing to take part in the
December elections, as "candidates' personal capabilities are more
important regardless of their party affiliation" to the majority of
voters.</P>
      <P>The sample size of the survey was 1,006, with a margin of error
of 3.1 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S  MISSILES NO.1 THREAT TO TAIWAN: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Guided and ballistic missiles deployed by
mainland China targeting Taiwan pose the largest threat to the island
within the next few years, a lawmaker said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Parris Chang, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and a military strategist, said the Republic of China's armed
forces must further strengthen their air defenses and anti-missile
capabilities.</P>
      <P>Citing an assessment by the U. S. Department of Defense, Chang
said an invasion of Taiwan by mainland China's amphibious units will
be "the most dangerous and least possible option for Beijing," as the
mainland's has several alternatives to use force against Taiwan,
including blocking Taiwan's shipping lanes and ports and launching
large-scale missile attacks.</P>
      <P>Chang also stressed that Taiwan's top priority is to upgrade its
monitoring and telecommunications technologies, as it takes time for
the island to acquire advanced anti-missile equipment. With efficient
early-monitoring facilities, Taiwan can improve its interception
capabilities and improve its combat readiness.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a seminar on Taiwan's security, which
was attended by a dozen local experts and analysts.</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-jie, a defense analyst, said mainland China will not
resort to military attacks against Taiwan before 2010. He pointed
out, however, that Taiwan cannot afford to risk ignoring its national
defense.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that no war will break out in the Taiwan Strait,
a strong national defense is still one of Taiwan's bargaining chips
in cross-strait interaction, he noted.</P>
      <P>J. H. Su, a U. S.-based researcher, suggested Taiwan build a
military force strong enough to repel mainland China in the face of
its repeated military threats against the island.</P>
      <P>As the mainland has a comfortable advantage in the number of
weapons and troops over Taiwan, Taiwan should seek to upgrade the
quality and efficiency of its arms and military personnel and
facilities, he added.</P>
      <P>T. Y. Pan, an assistant professor at the Ching Yun Institute of
Technology, proposed that Taiwan should iron out strategies to
counter mainland China's saber-rattling based on ways which could end
Beijing's ambition for hegemony and to stop its infiltration into
Taiwan's "stable but complex" political structure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANCE TO ADJUST BASIC WAGE SLIM: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is not
in favor of an upward adjustment in the basic wage this year in view
of the sluggish domestic economy and rising unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said the chances of an increase in the basic wage
this year are slim considering the added financial burden it would
impose on employers of foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>As local workers generally receive salaries higher than the basic
wage, the impact of an upward adjustment on them would be limited.
However, as the basic wage is the standard for more than 320,000
foreign workers currently in Taiwan and is set as the reference for
insurance premiums, their employers have expressed great concern
about an upward adjustment.</P>
      <P>CLA Vice Chairman Kuo Chi-jen said that as an increase in the
basic wage would put an added burden on Taiwan businesses in a period
of economic sluggishness, an appropriate time for an increase will
not come before at least the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Chen Sheng-hsien, director of the CLA's Department of Labor
Standards, said that the review of a basic wage adjustment for this
year has not yet been finalized and that the CLA hopes the labor and
the management can first consult with each other and discuss the
issue.</P>
      <P>Although the Council for Economic Planning and Development has
proposed a downward adjustment, Chen said that the basic wage has
only either remained the same or been adjusted upwards over the years
and that the CLA is unlikely to propose a downward adjustment this
year.</P>
      <P>Each year since the inauguration of the CLA in 1987, the basic
wage has either remained the same or been adjusted upward, with the
latest increase coming in 1997. The basic wage was increased to
NT$15,840 (US$465) that year and has remained the same since.</P>
      <P>Labor officials said the CLA had originally planned to invite
labor and business groups to meet in early June to discuss the issue
of adjusting the basic wage. If no conclusion is reached within three
months of the start of such consultations, the CLA will then convene
a basic wage review committee to renew discussions, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the meeting has for all intents and
purposes been scrapped as the chairwoman of the CLA, Chen Chi, has
said that this is not the appropriate time to discuss an adjustment
in the basic wage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP LAWMAKER CALLS FOR NEW MEASURES TO END CHAOS IN LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan should improve its
inter-party consultative mechanism and raise the minimum number of
legislators needed to form a caucus in order to put an end to chaos
in the legislature, an opposition lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chou Hsi-wei, convener of the People First Party (PFP)
legislative caucus, said outdated and unreasonable legislative
regulations are to blame for the legislature's chaos and low
operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>"To improve the situation, the regulations governing the
formation of party caucuses in the legislative assembly should be
revised to cap the rapid increase of those groups," Chou said.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, five like-minded legislators can form
a caucus in the legislature, far lower than the minimum figure
required in other countries. For instance, the minimum number is 5
percent of the total number of legislators in Germany, at least 15
lawmakers in France and 20 legislators in South Korea.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's legislature, six political parties and groups are
currently eligible to send representatives to attend inter-party
consultations.</P>
      <P>The six groups are the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
the Kuomintang, the PFP, the New Party, the Non-Partisan Alliance and
the Cross-Party Alliance.</P>
      <P>At present, an individual lawmaker must muster the support of at
least 30 colleagues to present a legislative bill for discussion in
the assembly, but political parties and alliances are exempt from
this requirement and can freely initiate bills.</P>
      <P>"And this is the root cause of disorder and chaos in the
legislature," PFP legislative whip Chou claimed, adding that the
legislature should raise the minimum number of legislators needed to
form a political alliance to 5 percent of the total or at least 11
members.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, we may be able to limit the proliferation of
legislative caucuses and prevent a handful of lawmakers to sabotage
rules of the game and hinder smooth operations of the assembly,"
Chou explained.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chou said the legislature should also revise
current regulations to prevent any single legislator from
blocking the assigning of legislative bill to the steering
committee for inclusion into meeting agenda or to relevant standing
committees for first reading.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chou said, the legislature should also set a deadline
for legislative caucuses of ruling and opposition parties to forge a
consensus on some controversial bills. "If they cannot reach a
consensus within the deadline, those bills should be put up for a
vote in the legislative plenary session," he suggested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER SOLICITS SUPPORTS FOR SIX BILLS CRUCIAL TO REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang on
Monday again solicited the support of legislators to convene a
special session to pass six outstanding bills crucial to financial
reform.</P>
      <P>Yen was referring to the financial holding company bill, the bill
on the establishment and management of financial rehabilitation and
others which were left outstanding after the latest session of the
Legislative Yuan, which ended in the middle of last week.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the opening of Taiwan's financial markets is
inevitable, adding that many international financial groups have
become bigger and have begun entering other fields, and if the
financial holding company bill cannot clear the legislature, then
domestic financial institutions cannot compete with international
financial groups.</P>
      <P>Yen also said that if the financial rehabilitation fund is not
established to help write off the mounting bad debt of local
financial institutions, the problem will not be solved.</P>
      <P>Yen said the problem needs to be handled urgently, noting that if
the situation continues for another year, the government will have to
pay extra costs of between NT$9 billion and NT$10 billion.</P>
      <P>Yen urged the support of legislators and stressed that after
passing the six key bills, if the national financial situation is
still in poor shape, then it will be the responsibility of the
executive branch.</P>

(By C. L. Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 15-member delegation of journalists
from the Republic of China arrived in New York Monday to visit
prestigious U.S. think tanks to get first-hand information about
their views on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, is accompanying the group on its current U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>Lin said the visit is designed to offer opportunities for Taiwan
journalists covering cross-strait affairs to interact with U.S.
scholars and experts in relevant fields.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the visit will help our journalists better
understand American China hands' views on the development of
cross-strait relations and U.S. policies toward the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said the MAC also hopes that the visit will help
Taiwan journalists expand their vision and enhance the depth and
scope of their reporting to facilitate the formation of a consensus
among Taiwan people on cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>In addition to New York, the media delegation will also
visit several U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C. and San
Francisco.</P>
      <P>The U.S. think tanks the group plans to visit include the
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the Council on Foreign

    <HEADLINE>CATHAY AND DRAGONAIR TO COMPETE ON MAINLAND AND TAIWAN ROUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, June 11(CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Dragonair
will be allowed to compete on most routes to the mainland following a
deal with Beijing that will liberalize Hong Kong's long-standing "one
airline, one route" policy, media reports in Hong Kong said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to a report carried in the South China Morning Post,
the agreement, signed in March but still unannounced, is believed to
be part of a deal between the two Hong Kong carriers to begin
directly competing on major Taiwan and mainland routes.</P>
      <P>At present, only one designated carrier, Dragonair, has the right
to service mainland destinations from Hong Kong. But under the terms
of the new agreement, Hong Kong will be able to grant destination
rights on most mainland routes to a second airline, significantly
expanding the frequency and number of mainland destinations to which
Hong Kong carriers are allowed to fly.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the deal, Beijing will automatically approve
Hong Kong's carrier selections on any route, the report quoted a
source close to the negotiations as saying.</P>
      <P>The new agreement, it said, lays to rest Hong Kong's 50-year-old
"one airline, one route" policy on competition by giving the Hong
Kong government the option to allow the two carriers to compete
head-to-head on passenger services to certain routes if demand
justifies it.</P>
      <P>The government made its first moves to alter the policy last year
when it approved Dragonair's application to launch cargo services to
Dubai, Amsterdam and Manchester.</P>
      <P>"The government is now following a policy of progressive
liberalization in air services," the source was quoted as saying,
adding that Hong Kong's overall economic expansion was the dominant
theme in government policy.</P>
      <P>Dragonair gained the right to fly to mainland destinations in
April 1990 when Cathay acquired a stake in the fledgling airline and
decided to abandon its mainland schedule in favor of Dragonair.</P>
      <P>It is believed that, in exchange for granting Dragonair's wish to
compete on the lucrative Hong Kong-Taipei route, Cathay will be
allowed to resume mainland services.</P>
      <P>The source said it was the government's policy to "protect
competition, not the competitors."</P>
      <P>The source said it was understood that Dragonair's application to
service Taipei would be looked at on the basis of whether the route
needed additional capacity, rather than on protecting the existing
carriers.</P>
      <P>A date for Dragonair to begin servicing Taipei will depend
largely on when a new agreement can be reached, as the existing
five-year deal between Hong Kong and Taiwan is set to expire June 12.

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL SURGEON REPORTS PROGRESS IN TREATING SPINAL CORD INJURIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Progress has been made in the treatment of
those suffering from spinal cord injuries, a surgeon from Taipei's
Veterans General Hospital said Monday.</P>
      <P>More than 50 patients with spinal cord injuries are now
undergoing treatment, Cheng Hung-chih, neural surgeon at the hospital
said. Many of the patients have regained some motor function, he
said.</P>
      <P>Cheng's team, working with Swedish researchers, have been using
micro-surgical techniques and a cocktail of regenerative drugs to
reconnect severed or damaged spinal cords. He is currently
researching injuries to the lower part of the spinal cord and has
reported initial progress.</P>
      <P>Four of the patients who were paralyzed from the waist down and
one from the knees down have been able to walk again, Cheng said. He
also said that their incontinence has greatly improved.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that for those patients who are not so seriously
injured, he will use a special glue to help the regeneration of
neural cells, but if the injury is old or more substantial he will
have to transplant neural cells from other parts of the body to
repair the injured spinal cord.</P>
      <P>Cheng delivered his reports on his experiments on animals and his
neural regeneration techniques at a two-day international seminar on
biomedical technology which opened at the Grand Hotel Monday.</P>
      <P>He said that among his patients is TV actor Chao Hsueh-huang, who
sought his aid four months after a serious car accident in mainland
China. Chao is now undergoing rehabilitation to his hand, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Media reports have said that first lady Wu Shu-cheng, who was
paralyzed from the chest down since she was hit and run over by a car
in 1985, is very interested in Cheng's research. She has expressed
the hope to be able to stand up again after treatment.</P>
      <P>Cheng said, however, that a medical team would have to examine
the first lady's situation before he could recommend treatment.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that his experiments on people will be complete by
September.</P>
      <P>The ideal situation would be for the patients to make a full
recovery, he said, but added that much would depend on the location
of their spinal cord injuries, the seriousness and the time since
their injuries occurred.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THAI WORKERS TO SEE PAY CUT FROM JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign blue-collar workers in Taiwan will
endure pay cuts from July amid the island's current economic woes,
sources close to the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The sources said the CLA has negotiated with major labor
exporting countries on the reduction of salaries for foreign laborers
with a view to helping local employers cut production costs and tide
them over their current business difficulties.</P>
      <P>Under the CLA-proposed new salary calculating formula, the
sources said, local employers will be allowed to integrate boarding
and accommodation payment into the government-sanctioned basic wage
for foreign workers.</P>
      <P>At present, local employers have to pay NT$2,500 (US$73.53)
to NT$4,000 in boarding and accommodation fees for each
legally hired foreign worker per month, in addition to paying the
minimum wage of NT$15,840 (US$465).</P>
      <P>CLA sources said Thailand has agreed to the proposal in
principle. Therefore, the sources said, some 140,000 Thai workers in
Taiwan will be subject to the new salary calculating formula from
July.</P>
      <P>Thailand has been the largest source of foreign laborers working
in the local manufacturing and construction industries. Under
the new measure, the sources said, local employers would be able to
save an estimated NT$350 million in salary payments a month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CLA reportedly will also negotiate with other
labor exporting countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia and the
Philippines, on the new formula in the near future.</P>
      <P>The sources said the CLA is hopeful that the new measure can be
applied to all foreign workers in the construction and manufacturing
sectors as well as to foreign housemaids and caretakers.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, CLA officials said that because of different
national situations of major labor exporting countries, the
negotiation results with Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines
remain uncertain. Citizens from these three countries mainly
work as housemaids and caretakers in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will honor a
consensus of all political parties and initiate a special session of
the Legislative Yuan, government spokesman Su cheng-ping said Monday.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties -- the Kuomintang, the People First Party,
and the New Party, agreed in a coordination meeting earlier that day
that an extraordinary session will be convened during the summer
recess upon the request of the president.</P>
      <P>Concerned in particular about financial reform bills still
outstanding following the recent end of the legislative session, Chen
called Premier Chang Chun-hsiung Sunday to discuss the feasibility of
the Legislative Yuan arranging an extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) parliamentary caucus, said that the DPP
caucus had gathered signatories from one-quarter of the legislators
necessary for a petition.</P>
      <P>Chang, well aware that consensus will be needed to have the bills
approved, called Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to seek his
assistance in coordinating the opinions of all the parties.</P>
      <P>Wang said that convening an extraordinary session is a
constitutional matter and that the legislature should exercise it
only in time of great urgency. In the past 50 years, only three
extraordinary sessions have been convened -- in 1951 and 1952 for
issues relating to the post-war peace agreement with Japan, and on
Jan. 30 this year to address complications arising from the fourth
nuclear power plant project.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
considering seeking the right to requisition satellite broadcasting
(SNG) vehicles owned by private television stations, along with their
crews, during crisis periods or times of war, military sources said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The new plan is needed "to meet future warfare requirements and
beef up Taiwan's civilian defense and mobilization mechanisms,"
according to the sources.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, relevant MND departments are drafting
amendments to the existing regulations governing military requisition
of vehicles to pave the way for the requisition of SNG vehicles and
crews from private TV stations "to support wartime news reporting and
the transmission of combat information."</P>
      <P>In the initial stage of the plan, the sources said, the military
will begin to requisition SNG vehicles and crews when the country's
armed forces enter a standoff with enemy forces, known in the
military's preparedness scale as "Situation II."</P>
      <P>"We have come up with the proposal in view of changing
warfare strategy and developments in our domestic media industry,"
said an MND official.</P>
      <P>The official said the military has consistently made "civilian
mobilization operations" a major training item in the annual "Han
Kuang" combined services exercises in recent years in order to
upgrade civilian defense functions.</P>
      <P>"As part of our efforts to upgrade the Taiwan armed forces'
psychological warfare capability, the MND invited U.S. psychological
warfare specialists to watch this year's Han Kuang drills and assess
our combat capability," the official said.</P>
      <P>At the end of the exercises, the official said, the U.S. experts
suggested that the MND requisition SNG vans and crews from private TV
stations to "assist in wartime news reporting and the transmission of
warfare information."</P>
      <P>The official said the military is now endeavoring to learn more
about satellite broadcasting technology and relevant expertise.
"We'll learn from the U.S. experience," he said, adding that the MND
is also studying whether the requisition of private SNG vehicles
would involve issues of satellite channel control.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
worked out a series of measures to deal with the daily-worsening
Macedonian situation, a MOFA official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said that in addition to advising
Republic of China government officials, their dependents and overseas
Chinese in Macedonia to be safety-conscious, MOFA will monitor
developments there closely.</P>
      <P>MOFA will also monitor the development of ROC-Macedonia
relations, which may be decided at a Macedonian Cabinet meeting
Tuesday, she added.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from reporters, Chang said that the overall
situation in the Macedonian capital of Skopje was still stable
although some areas were said to be unstable.</P>
      <P>The ROC embassy in Skopje also informed Taiwan reporters covering
news in Macedonia to avoid going out at night.</P>
      <P>The embassy has also mapped out a series of emergency measures to
cope with the daily-worsening situation in the tiny European country.
These measures cover the protection of government officials, their
dependents and overseas Chinese, as well as their evacuation.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the ROC embassy in Skopje has close contacts with
the embassies of the United States, France, Italy and Greece and has
no plans to withdraw from Skopje at the moment.</P>
      <P>She further pointed out that although Western countries believe
that the current conflict between ethnic Albanian rebel forces and
government forces will not develop into an all-out conflict in
Macedonia, the factional conflict has not only had a physiological
impact but has also put great pressure on Macedonia's newly formed
coalition Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The proposal to normalize Skopje-Beijing relations, likely to be
proposed again at Tuesday's regular Cabinet meeting, comes a week
after Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski turned down a
proposal to normalize Skopje-Beijing relations made by Foreign

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT BEGINS EXCHANGING VIEWS WITH DPP LEGISLATORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
began meeting with legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Monday to exchange views on pressing domestic problems.</P>
      <P>During the meeting with 14 DPP legislators, Chen stressed the
importance of forming a coalition government after December's
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Admitting that it will be nearly impossible for the DPP to gain
half of the legislative seats in the forthcoming elections, Chen
expressed hope nevertheless that the DPP will become the largest
party. The party at present controls just one-third of the seats in
the legislature.</P>
      <P>In order to establish a stable majority in the Legislative Yuan,
the president pointed out the need to recruit the support of
opposition legislators who share the political ideals of the DPP.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, legislators connected with "black gold" will
not be targeted by the DPP for recruitment into a coalition
government.</P>
      <P>Regarding the "economic development advisory committee" he
proposed last month, Chen noted that the most urgent problem facing
Taiwan today is the economy.</P>
      <P>He said that as the present economic issue is not simply an
economic problem, but a problem of confidence and even a problem of
politics, he hopes to set up the committee "to restore the people's
confidence and to stabilize the political situation."</P>
      <P>According to the president, the proposed committee will be a
mechanism designed for consultation, will not become a permanent
organ and will not infringe on the present constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to continue to meet with other DPP lawmakers on
five more occasions on June 14, 18, 21, 28 and July 2.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN TO ADDRESS OXFORD SCHOLARS ON ROC MAINLAND CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,   June  12  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan is slated to deliver a speech at
Oxford University Tuesday evening on the ROC ruling party's mainland
China policy.</P>
      <P>In an advanced copy of his speech, Lien said that the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has avoided embracing the so-called 1992
consensus of "one China, separate interpretations" between Taipei and
Beijing even as Beijing decided in a turn-about last year to accept
it for the first time since 1995.</P>
      <P>Lien called that consensus "rare" and "the only political
compromise on the most difficult sovereignty issue" that had finally
led to years of bilateral dialogue.</P>
      <P>In another adjustment, Lien said, Beijing has shifted its claim
that "Taiwan is a part of China" to "Taiwan and the mainland are both
parts of one China."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added, although the DPP has not declared Taiwan
independence, it has denied the "1992 consensus" and has stressed
that "unification is not the only option" while failing to clearly
outline what option the government is in favor of.</P>
      <P>This has led to Taipei being the side that has "closed the door,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Lien also questioned claims that the Taipei-Beijing relationship
is "stable." Instead, he called it "a cold but still peaceful
stalemate" that has deepened the ideological, emotional and political
gap between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, he said that bilateral economic and cultural exchanges
have been helpful in stabilizing political, military and diplomatic
struggles between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The ideal of "democratic unification" that the KMT represents has
also served as a check on the DPP administration's mainland China
policy and has helped stabilize the Taiwan Strait situation, he
added.</P>
      <P>Lien urged both the ROC and the mainland Chinese governments not
to close their doors on each other. He advised against further
stimulating cross-strait ideological conflicts merely because of a
worsening of Beijing-Washington relations in order to avoid
developing toward a cold war situation.</P>
      <P>After his speech at Oxford, Lien is slated to proceed to Paris
where he will receive a scholastic citation at the University of
Paris. He will then head to New York, where he will attend an
academic forum sponsored by a U.S. think tank before returning to
Taiwan at the end of June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS CONSCRIPTS HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE IN CONSCRIPTION FAIRNESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local conscripts are afraid
of serving in the military and have low confidence in the fairness of
the conscription system and the military's internal management,
according to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Sun Min-hua, a psychology professor
with the military-run Fuhsingkang College, on selected conscripts in
various military branches, units and areas around the island. Sun
sent out 3,300 copies of a questionnaire and collected 3,028 valid
replies.</P>
      <P>Poll results showed that 55 percent of the respondents said they
have been fearful of serving in the military; 50 percent said they
believe that if their parents were wealthy and powerful, they would
not have been drafted into the military.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 40 percent said they think that they would be treated
better and would have been dispatched to "better" military units if
their parents had lobbied relevant military authorities.</P>
      <P>"This kind of thinking is shared by roughly the same percentage
of parents of conscripts," Sun said, quoting the results of a
separate survey conducted almost at the same time.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 37 percent of the draftees who responded
to the questionnaire said they dislike mandatory military service; 25
percent said they admire those who do not need to fulfill compulsory
military service; 21 percent said they think that fulfilling
compulsory military service is a waste of time; and 23 percent said
they are fed up with life in the barracks.</P>
      <P>Only 23 percent said they agree with the idea that the current
one-year-and-10-month mandatory term of military service is a
necessary process for each healthy man.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy was that a measly 15 percent said they think that
the current conscription system is a must in terms of maintaining
national survival.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey findings, Sun said the majority of
conscripts generally hold a negative attitude toward the existing
mandatory military service system.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Sun said, the poll also found that some conscripts
feel that the training they receive during their years in the
military will be conducive to their future careers.</P>
      <P>Some respondents even said they think that fulfilling mandatory
military service is an honor or that military service is an
alternative form of training, according to the survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH URGED TO INSIST THAT BEIJING RELEASE DETAINED AMERICANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 11 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A conservative American magazine Monday
urged U.S. President George W. Bush to state publicly that it will be
politically and morally impossible for him to attend a regional
economic summit in Shanghai this October if Beijing continues to hold
even a single American political prisoner at that time.</P>
      <P>The Weekly Standard wrote in an editorial in its latest issue
that two weeks ago, following a long round of high-profile diplomacy,
the Bush administration finally achieved what it thought was an
acceptable entente with Beijing regarding the downed U.S. EP-3
surveillance plane.</P>
      <P>The weekly magazine noted that on June 1, with the EP-3 still
squatting on a Hainan runway, President Bush announced his intention
to renew Beijing's normal trade relations status for another year
just as every U.S. president has done since 1980.</P>
      <P>Bush urged Americans to believe that bilateral commercial ties
are indispensable, "if we are to promote American values of
transparency and accountability and ensure that the Chinese
government adheres to the rule of law in its dealings with its own
people as well as with the international community."</P>
      <P>But, the editorial said, the president did not explain how it is
that with the United States having so guaranteed vigorous trade with
Communist China for more than 20 years, "that said country
nevertheless remains a virtual wasteland where such `American values'
are concerned. Nor did the president explain why he should feel
liberated to make public his `normal trade relations' decision merely
by China's promised return of a ruined plane."</P>
      <P>"We would have expected George W. Bush, in accordance with his
own stated principles, to care rather less about this piece of
machinery and rather more about certain other, priceless American
resources held captive by Beijing," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>The magazine was referring to the fact that, for several month,
Beijing's Ministry of State Security has been detaining -- and
refusing to provide more than superficial information about -- a half
dozen U.S. citizens and permanent residents.</P>
      <P>President Bush cannot seriously hope to maintain `normal'
relations with Communist China so long as Beijing is conducting a
terror campaign against selected visiting Americans, it said.</P>
      <P>The magazine urged the Bush administration to make the release
of these Americans its very highest China-policy priority at the
moment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL SHOWS MOST AMERICANS OPPOSED TO U.S. COMMITTING TO ROC'S DEFENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opinion poll released Monday
indicates that a majority of Americans are opposed to the United
States making a commitment at the present time to defend Taiwan if
mainland China attacks with military force.</P>
      <P>The poll, published by the Pew Research Center and Council on
Foreign Relations, has found that only 26 percent of respondents said
they are in favor of a U.S. commitment while 64 said they are
opposed.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that 19 percent of respondents think of
Communist China as "an adversary" while 51 percent consider Beijing
"a serious problem, but not an adversary." Another 22 percent said
they view mainland China as "not much of a problem."</P>
      <P>Morton H. Halperin, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, told a press conference that the figures demonstrate that
an expected "spike" in U.S. public opinion against mainland China has
not materialized.</P>
      <P>Despite tensions between Washington and Beijing caused by the
EP-3 incident, the sentiment on the part of some Republican officials
that mainland China has become "U.S. enemy No.1" has not been picked
up by the general public, he said.</P>
      <P>A similar poll conducted in March 2000 showed that 17 percent of
respondents thought of mainland China as an adversary while 44
percent said the country was only a serious problem. The respective
figures for a similar survey carried out in June 1999 were 18 percent
and 53 percent.</P>
      <P>The latest poll shows that 51 percent of those surveyed believe
that mainland China's emergence as a world power will pose a major
threat to the United States, 30 percent think it is a minor threat,
and 10 percent think it's not a threat.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the United States should come to
Taiwan's defense, the figures appear to bear out the general public's
aversion to U.S. armed intervention abroad.</P>
      <P>Even among Republican supporters, only 36 percent of respondents
said they think the United States should commit at this time to
defending Taiwan if it is attacked by the mainland, while 53 percent
said they are opposed to such a commitment.</P>
      <P>Among Democratic voters, 70 percent of those surveyed said they
are against such a commitment while 21 percent said they are for it.</P>
      <P>Of those questioned who regard Communist China as an adversary,
41 percent said they think Washington should make the commitment now,
while 52 percent said it shouldn't.</P>
      <P>The lack of support for such a commitment comes after a recent
remark by President George W. Bush that the United States would do
"whatever it took" to help Taiwan defend itself should it come under
attack by the mainland.</P>
      <P>The latest poll was conducted over the telephone between May 15
and 28, with a total of 1,468 adults being interviewed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Congress will withhold
US$250 million in United Nations dues owed by the United States in
retaliation for America's ouster from the U.N. Human rights
Commission earlier this year, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) said over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>Hyde told some 300 activists and politicians at the fourth
Chicago Conservative Conference that, as chairman of the House
International Relations Committed, he hs been trying to find out
whether some of America's European allies were among those who voted
the United States off the U.N. human rights panel.</P>
      <P>"The State Department bureaucrats are withholding the facts, but
I suspect some of our European allies may have been involved," Hyde
said, adding that he has a list of suspects.</P>

      <P>"It is nothing less than ironic that our place on the U.N.

    <HEADLINE>ROC MISSION IN MACEDONIA ON HIGH ALERT: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The situation in Macedonia is calm after
the Macedonian government and ethnic Albanian rebels declared a
cease-fire, and the Republic of China will not withdraw its mission
from the Balkan country at the present time, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said however that the ROC's
mission is on high alert and that it has worked out a contingency
plan. She added that the ROC and other countries are in fact closely
watching to see whether the truce will hold.</P>
      <P>Reports said some international airliners have suspended their
flights to Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, due to the tensions in
the Balkan country.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in addition to personnel at the ROC mission and
their dependents as well as some Taiwan businesspeople, the ROC
mission has also alerted ROC reporters covering news in the country
to refrain from going outside at night.</P>
      <P>The mission has also worked out a contingency plan, including the
protection and withdrawal of ROC personnel and the withdrawal of the
ROC mission as well as the handling of mission property if necessary.</P>
      <P>Asked if the ROC will take the next step and withdraw its mission
if the situation deteriorates and fighting intensifies, Chang said
that the foreign missions based in the tiny Balkan country have been
keeping in close contact with each other and have been monitoring the
situation.</P>
      <P>But as the United States, France, Italy and Greece have not
pulled out their embassy staff and so far are not prepared to
withdraw, the ROC mission is not expected to do so, although it has
made full preparations and is on the highest alert.</P>
      <P>Chang also touched on the formal diplomatic relationship between
the ROC and Macedonia, which is teetering on the brink of being
severed after Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva recently said that
Macedonia should switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister proposed in a motion during a Cabinet
meeting last Tuesday to sever ties with the ROC in an effort to
secure bigger support from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The proposal, however, was vetoed by Macedonian Prime Minister
Ljubco Georgievski on the grounds that it was against administration
process.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet later decided that the issue be raised by President
Boris Trajkowski for discussions and that the consensus reached at
such discussions be brought to a future Cabinet meeting for further
debate and a final decision.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the ministry understands that the Macedonian
president has not yet held such discussions over the past days and
that the ROC is still trying to learn if the issue will be put on the
agenda at a regular Cabinet meeting Tuesday night.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SCHOLAR URGES MAINLAND CHINA TO STOP ARMS EXPANSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, June 11 (CNA)
(By C.L. Tseng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Noted American China expert Jerome Cohen
on Monday urged mainland China to stop its arms expansion as this
could prevent an arms race with Taiwan from happening.</P>
      <P>During a seminar at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New
York-based think tank, Cohen told a 15-member delegation of
journalists from Taiwan that Washington should make it clear to
Beijing that a continued arms build-up is not in the interests of
mainland China, Taiwan nor the United States.</P>
      <P>He said that if mainland China can exercise more restraint in
this area, then the United States can consider not selling Taiwan
more weapons next year.</P>
      <P>Cohen also urged leaders in Beijing to try engaging in exchanges
with the Republic of China's ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) in the same manner that they have already been reaching out to
the Republic of China's opposition parties.</P>
      <P>He suggested that if "face" is a problem, Beijing could begin by
inviting DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh -- who also sports the less
politically sensitive title of Kaohsiung mayor -- to visit mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Cohen said that he hopes even more that ROC President Chen
Shui-bian can visit mainland China, adding that Taiwan can also
invite Beijing officials to visit the island to further increase
mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>With regard to Chen's recent transit stopover in New York on his
way to Latin America for a state visit to several ROC diplomatic
allies in the region, Cohen said that the American people have the
right to listen to what the leaders from each side of the Taiwan
Strait have to say.</P>
      <P>He criticized former U.S. President Bill Clinton's policy of not
welcoming ROC presidents to visit the United States. Calling the
Taiwan Strait issue the "most dangerous issue for the United States,"
he said that the American people have the freedom to understand
international situations but that the previous U.S. administration
did not give them the chance.</P>
      <P>He said that he had helped arrange for a video conference between
Chen and people in the United States last year for the very purpose
of letting the U.S. public understand the "truth" about the situation
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He added that he hopes the next time Chen visits the United
States, the U.S. government will agree to let the ROC president speak
with the American people.</P>
      <P>The journalists attending the seminar, led by Lin Chong-pin, vice
chairman of the ROC Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, are
scheduled to call on other U.S. think tanks in order to gain a deeper
understanding of the opinions within U.S. political and academic
circles regarding cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR EARLY RESUMPTION OF ROC-THAI ECONOMIC MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he
is hopeful that the suspended annual economic consultative meeting
between the Republic of China and Thailand can be resumed as early
as possible to further boost bilateral trade and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pitch while meeting with a group of Thai senators,
who are currently on a goodwill visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guests that despite the absence of diplomatic
ties, substantive ROC-Thai relations have been close and cordial.
For instance, he said, about 150,000 Thai nationals are legally
working in Taiwan, accounting for 50 percent of total overseas Thai
workers and making Thailand Taiwan's No. 1 source of foreign
laborers.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, Chen said, direct Taiwan investment
in Thailand had reached US$10.33 billion, making the ROC the third
largest foreign investor in the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, two-way trade amounted to US$5.3
billion last year, with Thailand posting a trade surplus of about
US$200 million. Moreover, ROC nationals made 650,000 visits to
Thailand in 2000.</P>
      <P>"All these figures point to the cordiality of our
relationship," Chen said, adding that in view of brisk bilateral
trade, the two countries should resume regular ministerial-level
trade and economic consultative conference, which has been suspended
since 1991.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the ROC government has consistently
encourage its entrepreneurs to invest in Southeast Asian countries,
particularly members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN). So far, he said, Taiwan business people have poured more
than US$40 billion into the region.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we hope Thailand can support our bid to
take part in ASEAN activities and forge a regular dialogue mechanism
with this important regional organization," Chen said, adding that
the ROC also needs Thailand's support for its bids to join the World
Trade Organization, the World Health Organization and other major
international bodies.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he looks forward to seeing senior ROC
and Thai officials exchange visits more frequently for mutual
benefits.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen lauded Thai workers for their diligence and
contribution to Taiwan's infrastructure construction and economic
development.</P>
      <P>"I hope labor officials from both countries can jointly work out
measures to cut brokerage fees for Thai nationals intending to work
in Taiwan," the president added.</P>
      <P>For their part, the visiting Thai senators said the ROC has
played an important role in the international community and
Southeast Asian region.</P>
      <P>"We'll be very pleased to see the ROC take part in ASEAN
activities as an observer," said Wiboon Shamsheun, the first vice
chairman of the Thai Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>Shamsheun told President Chen that he and his colleagues also
support the upgrading of official exchanges between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>In addition to booming commercial exchanges, Shamsheun said ROC
and Thai peoples also have close blood ties. "We appreciate the huge
Taiwan investment in Thailand to help spur our economic development
and we are also grateful that the ROC government has allowed our
people to work in Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Other members of the Thai delegation included Wittaya Masayna,
vice chairman of the Thai Senate Science, Technology and Energy
Committee, and Wichai Krongyuth, spokesman for the Thai Senate
Education and Culture Committee.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators and government
officials on Tuesday urged the public to fight back against sexual
assaults by reporting suspects who fit the descriptions of at-large
criminals and by following a series of measures to prevent becoming
victims of sex crimes.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang legislators Pan Wei-kang and Yang
Chiung-ying announced the physical characteristics and modus operandi
of five still-at-large sexual offenders at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Also in attendance were Deputy Commissioner Lin Kuo-tung of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau under the National Police
Administration and Executive Secretary Lin Tse-ling of the Interior
Ministry's Sexual Abuse and Family Violence Prevention Committee.</P>
      <P>According to police statistics, the great majority of the cases
of sexual assault occur between people who already know each other --
relatives, neighbors or close acquaintances -- or happen as date
rape. Figures show that over 90 percent of the offenders in these
cases over the past decade have been convicted.</P>
      <P>Statistics also showed that over half of the victims are between
the ages of 12 and 18, and that most of the crimes occur in
residential areas.</P>
      <P>The National Police Administration recommended that preventive
measures should be taken to avoid becoming victims of sex crimes.</P>
      <P>These measures include forming the habit of keeping doors closed
at night and allowing friends to stay only in the living room when
visiting at night.</P>
      <P>People should take care that they are not followed in situations
that could be dangerous, and if they feel uncomfortable with a
stranger -- as in an elevator -- they should avoid the situation and
seek out groups of people.</P>
      <P>The administration also said that keeping a cellular phone on
hand at all times for emergency calls is a good idea, and calling
taxis through radio dispatch is better than waving them down on the
street.</P>
      <P>Police said that people should filter job placement ads carefully
and refrain from accepting drinks or food during interviews.</P>
      <P>One technique to get out a situation that seems to be turning
dangerous is to find some way to buy time, police said. Telling a
would-be rapist that you are pregnant or have a contagious disease
could give a potential victim enough time to escape, officials said.</P>

      <P>It was believed to be the first time in many years that such a
large number of Taiwan officers have traveled to the United States to
attend a military workshop.</P>
      <P>"As the lectures cover diverse subjects and all lecturers have
rich experiences, the workshop is very useful to us," the officer
said, adding that the lecture topics included U.S. policies toward
Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, U.S. security strategy, U.S.
crisis management, global security trends, U.S. global challenges and
U.S. military exchanges with the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The workshop is being held at Georgetown University, with
lecturers coming from the White House, the Department of Defense and
the Central Intelligence Agency.</P>
      <P>The lecturers include Torkel Patterson, senior official in Asian
affairs at the National Security Council, Zbigniew Brzezinski, former
national security adviser under the Carter administration, former
Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe and Richard Bush, chairman
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), as well as several China
hands.</P>
      <P>The participants visited the Pentagon Monday where they held a
symposium with senior Pentagon officials in charge of Asia-Pacific
security affairs and missile defense programs.</P>
      <P>They will fly to Hawaii Wednesday to visit the U.S. Pacific
Command, the last event of the two-week lecture program. Last week,
they held talks with congressional aides on military and foreign
relations.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Kurt Campbell,
who is now vice chairman of the CSIS, reportedly took the initiative
to organize the workshop for ROC military officers. The proposal
received the support of ROC President Chen Shui-bian and then-Premier
Tang Fei when Campbell visited Taiwan last June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>17 MAINLAND BRIDES GO HOME BY SAILING DIRECTLY FROM KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Sophia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seventeen mainland Chinese brides who were
married to residents in the Republic of China-held frontline island
of Kinmen went back to mainland China Tuesday, sailing directly
across a small part of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that mainland brides have been allowed to
visit their mainland families via a direct voyage from Kinmen to the
southeastern mainland port city of Xiamen since the direct "mini
three links" program was implemented at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to show goodwill toward mainland China,
the ROC opened its two offshore defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu
for direct trade, mail and shipping links with mainland China's
Xiamen and Mawei ports, known as the "mini three links" program, on
Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Beijing has been reluctant to throw its full support behind the
program and has so far only approved applications for direct
Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei voyages on a "group in, group out" and
case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese brides were originally not covered by the
"direct sailing" measure. After strenuous efforts by opposition New
Party Legislator Lee Chu-feng, mainland authorities finally agreed to
allow the 17 mainland brides to make homecoming visits by sailing
directly on an experimental basis.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, which lies far closer to mainland China than to Taiwan,
now has about 300 mainland Chinese brides, but only three of them
have obtained permanent residency.</P>
      <P>Most other brides have to return to the mainland once their
short-term visitor visas expire. In the past, they had to travel to
Taiwan first and then back to the mainland via Hong Kong or Macau,
wasting much time and money. With the opening of direct shipping
services from Kinmen to Xiamen, each homecoming mainland bride can
save about NT$15,000 (US$441.18) in transportation fees.</P>
      <P>The mainland brides, accompanied by their spouses and other
family members, took the Kinmen County Government-run ferry boat
"TaiWu" from Liaolo Port early in the morning. They were all smiles
when they boarded the ship on their way to Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Also aboard the ship was a delegation of the Kinmen Red Cross
Society, a 35-member tour group and 80-plus individual passengers.
The33-member Red Cross Society delegation will visit its Xiamen
counterpart and meet with mainland officials to discuss ways to
promote bilateral humanitarian and cultural exchanges.</P>

    <DATELINE>New York, June 11 (CNA)
(By C. L. Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is not expected to help
mediate the resumption of regular dialogue between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, a U.S. scholar said Monday.</P>
      <P>John Holden, president of the National Committee on U.S.-China
Relations, a private, non-profit organization dedicated to promoting
U.S. exchanges with Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong, made the
remarks while meeting with a 15-member delegation of journalists from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Holden said he doesn't think that the United States should adopt
a "strategic ambiguity" approach in its policy toward cross-strait
affairs.</P>
      <P>In his view, Holden said, the United States should instead adopt
a "double deterrence" strategy, deterring mainland China from using
forces against Taiwan and simultaneously deterring Taiwan from
declaring independence.</P>
      <P>Holden further said he doesn't think that the United States is
capable of serving as a mediator in cross-strait disputes.</P>
      <P>Touching on future Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations, Holden
said stable U.S.-mainland China ties would benefit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He predicted that U.S.-mainalnd China ties would gradually
improve between June and October this year. Moreover, he said, the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait are likely to be admitted to the World
Trade Organization before the end of this year. Against this
backdrop, he said he does not rule out the possibility that Beijing
resumes talks with Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local media mogul and legislator who was
poised to change Taiwan's political landscape by trying to form a new
political party with several independent lawmakers, announced Tuesday
that he will not run for another term as legislator.</P>
      <P>In a formal written announcement, Wang Ling-lin, an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) legislator who owns at least two television news
channels and a broadband cable TV network in Taiwan, said he would
not take part in the year-end legislative election so as "not to
further stir up the already chaotic politics in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Wang expressed appreciation to the KMT for its support over the
past 12 years during which Wang served three consecutive terms as a
KMT lawmaker. He also said he would turn down any invitation from any
other political parties or groups to represent them in the year-end
legislative election.</P>
      <P>Although Wang made no mention of a new political party that he
was reportedly forming and rumored to be called the "Justice Party,"
local political observers speculated that he quit the plan as a
result of widespread accusations that the party would be formed by
several "black-gold" figures -- legislators linked to corruption or
organized crime -- an accusation that scared away some potential
participants and consequently led to Wang's failure to recruit enough
hopefuls to form the new political group.</P>
      <P>Wang said that from now on, he will devote all his time and
attention to his media group so as to allow it "to make more valuable
contributions to society."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, independent Legislator Lo Fu-chu said the "Justice
Party" will be established as planned, probably in July, despite
Wang's absence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD GIVES SPEECH AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan gave a speech Tuesday at Oxford University in the United Kingdom
in which he focused on Taiwan's economic and political situations and
the future of his party.</P>
      <P>In a speech titled "Think of Future Perils With Nothing to Hide"
and made in his capacity as head of Taiwan's largest opposition
party, Lien described Taiwan as "sick" because of internal factors
rather than as a result of external threats as had been a problem in
the past.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Taiwan has encountered serious economic
difficulties and a confidence crisis. With noticeable falls in the
country's economic growth, investment projects, export volume and the
stock market, the people of Taiwan have experienced rising
unemployment and have seen the value of their assets shrink.</P>
      <P>As for the confidence crisis, Lien said, all past surveys have
shown that Taiwan residents are dissatisfied with the performance of
the government led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and that
the local business community is pessimistic about Taiwan's
deteriorating economic prospects.</P>
      <P>Such a severe lack of public confidence in the government will
produce a tremendous adverse effect on national development, he
noted, adding that non-economic factors, such as the government's
failure to follow normal constitutional practices and its failure to
improve Taiwan's relations with mainland China are the critical
reasons behind Taiwan's present economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Shifting the focus of his analysis to the political front, the
KMT chairman used the term "three-sphere minority government" to
explain Taiwan's current political woes.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, "three-sphere minority" refers to President
Chen Shui-bian's election by only 39 percent of Taiwan's voters last
year, the ruling DPP's control of only one-third of the seats at the
Legislative Yuan and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's "cavalier" formation
of a Cabinet without negotiation with the majority parties.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP's minority in these three areas has resulted
in a majority for the opposition in the government's legislative
branch and an executive branch formed by a minority party, producing
tremendous difficulties for the DPP in trying to carry out its
policies and sparking declining public confidence in the government.</P>
      <P>On cross-Taiwan Strait ties and Taiwan's national status, Lien
criticized the government for its failure to recognize the "1992
consensus" reached between Taipei and Beijing in that year.</P>
      <P>He said the current pro-independence government's refusal to
accept the "1992 consensus" has shut the doors for continued
bilateral negotiations and has left its mainland China policies
"hanging in the air."</P>
      <P>Describing present Taiwan-mainland China relations as "at a
severe impasse," Lien voiced his hope that the KMT, with the support
of a vast majority of the Taiwan people, will exercise its role as a
stabilizer between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and as a
"tugboat" in the DPP's drawing up of its policies toward mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Lien said he hopes that the KMT's efforts will help build a "cold
but peaceful" climate between Taiwan and the mainland and prompt the
two sides to learn how to co-exist peacefully before accomplishing
the long-expected "win-win" goal for both sides.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the KMT's reforms, Lien said that the party is
seeking to achieve internal democratization, purification and
streamlining to win greater pubic backing. He stressed that the KMT
will try to lead and unite the country with the people who share its
ideals and aspirations.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking Taiwan's interests as the KMT's top
priorities, the KMT chief emphasized that the party will also be open
to mainland China and the world to recruit all kinds of talent,
regardless of ethnic background.</P>
      <P>Britain is the first stop on Lien's current "academic journey,"
which will also take him to Paris and New York.</P>

      <P>Around 74 percent of the island's
industrial sector affirms the establishment of an economic
development advisory committee proposed by President Chen Shui-bian
last month, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Chinese National Federation of
Industries among 143 representatives of the federation between May 25
and June 7, with a response rate of 68 percent.</P>
      <P>Fifty-three percent of the respondents said that the committee
would be "helpful" to the improvement of the country's long-term
development and management environment, while 21 percent said it
would be "somewhat helpful." Twenty percent termed it as "of no help
whatsoever."</P>
      <P>The respondents said that the committee should give its top
priority to the "investment environment and economic problems,"
followed by "the prospects for industrial development," "labor
conditions and regulations," "opening of cross-Taiwan Strait economic
and trade exchanges," "the financial market and order" and
"resolution of the unemployment problem."</P>
      <P>Regarding the improvement of the investment environment, they
proposed that the government increase the number of public
construction projects, enhance fundamental development, improve
administrative procedures, raise administrative efficiency, encourage
research and development through tax incentives, stabilize foreign
exchange rates and reduce investment restrictions.</P>
      <P>Chen told a group of legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Monday that the proposed advisory committee will be
designed as a consultation mechanism that will not infringe on the
constitutional system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An "Intel Teach to the Future" plan
dedicated to combining computer technology with education to raise
students' interest in learning has reached Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony held Tuesday in Taipei, the Republic of China
Ministry of Education, National Normal University and Intel Taiwan
jointly announced that the project will begin in Taiwan in July,
aimed at training 10,000 "e teachers" in primary and junior high
schools islandwide within two years.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, Education Minister Ovid Tzeng took a
recent distant conference in which he participated as an example,
saying that with the invention and application of state-of-the-art
technology, teachers and students have wider and faster access to
knowledge and Internet-related activities.</P>
      <P>Tzeng offered his appreciation to Intel for the U.S.-based
company's efforts to help promote information technology and related
education in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to an Intel Taiwan spokesman, under the "Intel Teach to
the Future" project, Intel plans to invest US$100 million to train
some 400,000 primary and junior high school teachers from 20 selected
countries around the world before 2002.</P>
      <P>So far, the project has already begun in the United States,
Britain, France and Germany, and is being carried out satisfactorily.
Similar programs are expected to kick off soon in Taiwan, Japan,
India and mainland China, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>If the project is successfully implemented in Taiwan before 2002,
5 percent of Taiwan's primary and junior high school teachers will be
"e teachers," who will in turn teach at least 300,000 primary school
pupils and junior high students with e-knowledge and related
technology, said Prof. Wu Cheng-yi from National Normal University.</P>
      <P>Before the 10,000 teachers are actually "taught" to be "e
teachers," said Wu, some 200 "seed" lecturers will be cultivated
first under the Intel project. These "seed" lecturers will mainly be
trained in skills including how to make presentations via computer,
Internet writing and editing, as well as basic Internet graphic
design, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior White House official told a
group of middle-ranking officers from Taiwan recently that the Taipei
government should take steps toward acquiring submarines.</P>
      <P>Torkel Patterson, who is in charge of Asian affairs for the
National Security Council, noted that the Bush administration
reversed the policy of previous administrations and agreed in April
to provide Taiwan with eight diesel-electric submarines.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that the U.S. government will not pressure the
Netherlands and other makers of such submarines to provide Taiwan
with blueprints of the submarines.</P>
      <P>The United States has not manufactured submarines of the type it
agreed to sell Taiwan for more than 40 years.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan officers, who began a two-week training
course in Washington June 4, Patterson made the remarks while
answering questions from the officers last week.</P>
      <P>He reportedly said that the Bush administration gave Taiwan an
opportunity to improve its anti-submarine capability, and added that
"Taiwan has to pick up the ball ... to make it happen."</P>
      <P>If Taiwan decides to acquire the submarines, he pointed out that
the defense industry will be able to help Taiwan attain the goal and
went on that Taiwan must first decide how to compile a purchase
budget.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Defense Weekly says in its current issue
that the manufacturers who could make submarines for Taiwan may alter
the competition for submarine exports permanently.</P>
      <P>A Connecticut-based naval analyst was quoted as saying that the
capital from Taiwan may lead to the emergence of a new industry to
manufacture conventional submarines in the United States.</P>

Turkey, Singapore and South Korea, will have procured 38 conventional
submarines carrying a total value of US$127 billion.</P>

potential.</P>
      <P>In its first ever cross-strait exposition of electronics market
vision and cooperation which opened in Shanghai Tuesday, the III has
successfully played the role of "matchmaker," enabling TBCommerce,
Taiwan, an affiliate of the U.S.-based TBCommerce, and the China
Internet Incubation Center (CIIC), an operation under mainland
China's Ministry of Science and Technology, to tie up for closer
cooperation.</P>
      <P>This tie-up marks the first cooperation agreement that the III
has successfully pushed to achieve after the institute decided to
make inroads into mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under the cooperation program, TBCommerce, Taiwan, TBLink, and
Shanghai Internet Incubation Investment Co. (SI3), the executive
operation of CIIC, will share equally the establishment funds of a
new company which will target mainland China's e-commerce as a major
market.</P>
      <P>The III, SI3 and TBCommerce also co-sponsored a forum meeting in
Shanghai Tuesday as a sideline to the e-commerce exposition. The
forum was participated in by trade officials, scientists and
researchers, as well as leaders in the IT industry across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>TBCommerce, which has actively tried to edge into mainland
China's Internet market in recent years, is mainly comprised of
American-Chinese talents who have worked at AT&amp;T and Bell Laboratory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT PRC'S REPORTED ARMS SUPPLY TO CUBA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China has reportedly been
delivering military equipment to Cuba, James Kelly, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for East Asian affairs, told a House subcommittee
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kelly, however, did not offer any more details when testifying
before the House International Relations Subcommittee on East Asia
and the Pacific because, he said, he needed more information before
he could comment on the matter further.</P>
      <P>The senior State Department official said he is looking into
reports by the Washington Times that at least three arms deliveries
have arrived in Cuba from mainland China over the past several
months. "We're very much concerned with this PLA (People's Liberation
Army) cooperation and movement of military equipment into Cuba," he
said.</P>
      <P>Trent Lott, the Senate minority leader, said that he wants
answers about the shipments. "If it is true, I think that is a very
bad sign for China. I think it's a violation of a lot of
understandings that probably are in place," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a member of the
House International Relations Committee and a consistent critic of
Beijing, said he believes the Communist Chinese "appear to be trying
to position themselves to have leverage over the United States
throughout the world."</P>
      <P>"Whether it's in Cuba or whether it's in the Panama Canal or
whether it's in the South China Sea, Communist China is trying to
have an iron grip on areas that are strategically important to the
security of the United States and the Western democracies," the
congressman pointed out.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher added that Beijing's efforts to establish a supplier
relationship with Fidel Castro is "totally consistent with the
Communist Chinese belligerence towards the United States in general."</P>
      <P>"I think that the new (Bush) administration should make it clear
to the Communist Chinese that they are either going to be our friends
or they are going to be treated as our adversaries and our potential
enemies. If they are going to be our friends, they have got to start
acting like our friends," he said.</P>
      <P>"Supplying weapons to Castro to put pressure on us is not what a
friend would do. If they continue to move in that direction, there
will be economic as well as political and military consequences," he
warned.</P>
      <P>U.S. officials told the Washington Times that the arms shipments
to Cuba could lead to economic sanctions against Beijing. U.S. law
requires the imposition of economic sanctions on any nation or
company that gives lethal military assistance to a nation designated
as a state sponsor of terrorism.</P>
      <P>But Philip Reeker, a spokesman for the State Department, said the
department has not yet determined whether sanctions are required in
this case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-BORDER HEROIN TRAFFICKING RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A cross-border drug trafficking ring
involving three Taiwan men and two "traffickers" from Singapore and
Malaysia was busted by Taipei law enforcement authorities Tuesday
night.</P>
      <P>Three bags containing a total of two kilograms of high-grade
heroin with a street value of over NT$10 million were seized.</P>
      <P>In a joint operation between the Taipei City Police Headquarters
and the Criminal Investigation Bureau under the directive of Taipei
district prosecutor Liu Cheng-wu, police locked their focus on two
Taiwan drug dealers, identified as Chiu Ching-chung and Tsao
Yung-hsing, whom police found out were scheduled to close a drug deal
at Mingchuan East Road and Chungshan North Road at around 8 p.m.
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu and Tsao were spotted making the deal at the expected
location before driving away in a Mercedes Benz with bags believed to
contain drugs.</P>
      <P>After being chased by police for a couple of blocks, Tsao got out
of the Mercedes and was nabbed with two big bags of heroin.</P>
      <P>After another frenzied chase toward the western side of downtown
Taipei, the police were able to stop the Mercedes and nab Chiu with
the other bag of heroin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, also acting on a tip, the Taipei police and
investigators raided a hotel on Shuangcheng Road where they arrested
Ang Lai Sin, a Singaporean, and Chaw Kok Lim, a Malaysian, who were
about to check out of the hotel and leave Taiwan. The police
discovered NT$1 million in cash in one of their luggage bags,
apparently part of the payment that they received from Chiu and Tsao.</P>
      <P>According to Ang and Chaw, a Taiwan man surnamed Yang handed them
the money right after they closed the "deal" on the street.</P>
      <P>According to police investigations, the cross-border drug
smuggling ring has trafficked high-grade heroin from Malaysia to
Taiwan several times over the past several months.</P>
      <P>The police also found out that Ang used to be an ace ten-pin
bowler who was selected to represent Singapore's national team in
2000. He later withdrew from the team after he was diagnosed to have
intestinal cancer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PITCHES FOR HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGES WITH MANILA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that the absence of bilateral diplomatic relations between the
Republic of China and the Philippines should not hinder exchanges of
visits by high-ranking officials from the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Antonio Basilio,
new chairman of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, which is
authorized by the Philippine government to handle exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and the Philippines are close neighbors, Chen
said the absence of formal diplomatic relations has not hampered the
development of substantive relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>For instance, Chen recalled that former ROC President Lee
Teng-hui met with his then-Philippine counterpart, Fidel Ramos,
during a transit stop at Subic Bay in 1994 on his way to Indonesia
for an unofficial visit.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that there is still ample room for Taiwan and
the Philippines to boost bilateral exchanges and cooperation in the
economic, trade, cultural and educational fields.</P>
      <P>The president told his guests that the ROC government has
consistently encouraged Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest in Southeast
Asian countries, particularly members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said the Philippines can be a good investment
destination and springboard for Taiwan business people to tap into
the vast Southeast Asian market.</P>
      <P>However, direct Taiwan investment in the Philippines remains
limited for various reasons, including worsening public order there.</P>
      <P>Chen said it takes only 45 minutes to fly from the southern
Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung to the Philippines. "It would be a pity
if our two countries could not further upgrade substantive
exchanges," he noted.</P>
      <P>With the Philippine political situation gradually stabilizing,
Chen said he is hopeful that substantive ROC-Philippine relations
will from now on make headway smoothly.</P>
      <P>More than 92,000 Philippine nationals are now legally working in
Taiwan. Chen said that although there have been some unpleasant
labor-management squabbles involving Philippine workers, most
Philippine laborers are generally diligent.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate their contribution to helping boost our economic
development over the past years," Chen said, adding that the ROC will
continue keeping its door open to Philippine workers.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said Taiwan will also encourage its people to
invest in the Philippines or vacation there in order to help enhance
bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chen said he also hopes that ROC-Philippine relations will enter
a new stage during Basilio's term of office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FPG TOPS IN REVENUE, PROFITS AMONG LOCAL BUSINESS GROUPS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) recorded
revenues totaling NT504.5 billion (US$14.76 billion) last year to top
all domestic business groups in Taiwan for the second consecutive
year, according to a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Business Weekly, which conducted the survey of the top 100
business groups in Taiwan, said that the FPG also made it to the top
of the list for 2000 in terms of after-tax profits, at NT$74.4
billion (US$2.176 billion).</P>
      <P>FPG's revenue in 2000 increased by NT$120 billion from the
previous year, mainly because of its Formosa Petrochemical Corp. and
its Mailiao power plant in Yunling, southwestern Taiwan, with both
helping to contribute more than NT$60 billion.</P>
      <P>FPG officials estimated that after the full development of its
petroleum products this year, total annual revenues are expected to
increase by NT$100 billion to over NT$600 billion.</P>
      <P>Following the FPG in terms of total revenues were Lin Yuan Group,
Shin Kong, Acer, Evergreen, Philips Taiwan, Tatung, Koo's, Yulon and
Far Eastern, in that order.</P>
      <P>One of the survey's noteworthy points is that Evergreen made it
into the top 10 list for the first time while President Enterprises
was squeezed out of that exclusive club.</P>
      <P>In terms of profits, FPG was also tops, accumulating NT$74.4
billion (US$2.176 billion) last year, followed by the group headed by
Robert Tsao, chairman of United Microelectronics Corp., which
recorded total profits of NT$58.6 billion (US$1.714 billion).</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top 10 list of most lucrative groups were Walsin
Lihwa, China Steel, Evergreen, Asustck Computer, Acer, Tatung, Delta
Electronic, and Pacific Electric Wire &amp; Cable, in that order.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, two information technology companies demonstrated
their high potential through their stunning growth last year.</P>
      <P>Hou Hai Precision Industry recorded total revenues of NT$103.3
billion, up 68 percent from the previous year, with its ranking
leaping to 18th overall from 30th a year earlier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET-LEVEL HAKKA AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO BECOME OPERATIONAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Committee for Hakka
Affairs (CHA) is expected to become operational Thursday after eight
months of preparation, sources from the Executive Yuan said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Fan Kuang-chun, who is a national policy adviser to the
president, will be the first chairman of the CHA, which has been
established to strengthen services to the nation's Hakka population
-- one of the most important branches of the Chinese people whose
ancestors emigrated from mainland China to Taiwan hundreds of years
ago.</P>
      <P>Roughly one-sixth of Taiwan's 23 million people are Hakkas.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung offered his appreciation to the
Legislative Yuan Wednesday for the legislature's passage of related
statutes allowing the establishment, operation and budget of the
long-awaited committee.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas constitute an important sector of Taiwan culture and
are part of the foundation from which Taiwan's "economic miracle" was
created, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>A cocktail party was scheduled to be held at Grand Hotel
Wednesday evening to mark the establishment of the committee, with
Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung delivering
keynote speeches.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will address a formal ceremony Thursday
marking the inauguration of the committee.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are Chinese whose ancestors lived in "Chung Yuan," or
"China proper," comprising Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and some
parts of other provinces in central and northern China. They
gradually migrated to southern China and emigrated to Southeast Asia
and other parts of the world during national upheavals since the
fourth century.</P>
      <P>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Taipei estimated in
1992 that there were about 34 million overseas Chinese at that time,
one-third of whom were Hakkas.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are noted for their persistent adherence to
traditional Chinese customs and values, such as patriotism, loyalty,
hard work, endurance, love of freedom, and resistance to alien
aggression and influence. In addition, they look upon themselves as
people of high social status, which is why they do not assimilate
well into the local community and are called "guest people" wherever
they live. "Hakka" means "guest family" in mandarin Chinese.</P>

      <P>In Tu's vision, the museum's collection of art treasures should
"unite with the new Taiwan," he says.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Tu said that the museum, with its
valuable art treasures "evacuated" from mainland China in the late
1940s, has in the past been a sensitive political symbol. Since he
assumed the directorship last year, he has been trying to place more
emphasis on the museum's mission as an institution of academic
research as well as art education. He also expects to inject "the new
vigor of Taiwan" into the establishment.</P>
      <P>A specialist in the social history of ancient China, cultural
history, and medical history, Tu was a visiting scholar of the School
of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, from 1992-1993
and director of the Institute of History and Philology of Academia
Sinica from 1995-2000. Constantly invited to international seminars
and symposiums, Tu is very keen on international cooperation
projects.</P>
      <P>From the diversified subjects of the exhibitions, one can have a
glimpse of the difference in style between the 57-year-old museum
director and his predecessors. Famous paintings on loan from Spain's
Gala-Salvador Dali Foundation were shown at the special exhibition
hall library from Jan. 20 to April 20. An exhibition featuring
portraits of the land and people by contemporary Taiwanese painter Li
Mei-shu (1902-1983) is on display from May 5 to Aug. 5. Another
special exhibition -- "The Land and Its People - Active Figures in
the History of Taiwan During the Ching Dynasty" focuses on
biographies of historical figures related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tu said that in the past years, selected items of the museum's
collection were loaned to museums in the United States and France for
special exhibitions. Museums in other countries are also interested
in sponsoring such exhibitions. The next international cooperation
project is expected to be realized in 2003 in Germany.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum has reached an agreement with the
German federal art museum in Bonn after long years of negotiations to
loan selected items to the German museum for a special exhibition.
The German parliament has adopted a resolution to provide legal
guarantees for the loaned objects.</P>
      <P>Tu said that in return, museums in Germany will loan selected
items of their collections to the National Palace Museum. Museums in
Vienna are also interested in co-sponsoring exhibitions of their
collections in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Stressing the educational function of the museum, Tu said that
the museum is organizing academic activities to make it a "classroom
of art and culture." In line with current exhibitions, symposiums are
being held. In the past two months, for instance, there has been a
symposium featuring the calligraphy and seal carving of Wang
Chuang-wei (1909-1998), a conference on the theme of poetry and
literature in Chinese art, and an international symposium on archives
of the Ching Dynasty and research on the history of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tu said that a large-scale international conference on Mongolian
culture is scheduled for October, when the museum will present a
special exhibition. In 2002, the museum will organize an
international conference on East Asia's early modern artistic
history, with the participation of specialists from the United
States, Japan and South Korea. The conference will be co-sponsored by
the National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>In addition to academic activities, Tu said that he hopes the
museum can also become closer to the people. The museum is giving
regular lectures on various themes and the Children's Program, using
educational games and activities to help children learn about Chinese
culture and history, is a popular community program in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The museum has also made contemporary Taiwanese artists a major
theme of its special exhibitions. Tu said the annual Centennial
Exhibition will feature one representative figure of Taiwan's
artistic history in the past century. This year, Li Mei-shu
(1902-1983), a pioneer of Western-style painting in Taiwan, is
commemorated with an exhibition of his landscapes and portraits.</P>
      <P>"While preserving its heritage, the museum must explore new
dimensions," Tu said, adding that he hopes the vigor of Taiwan will
enrich the treasures of the museum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>6  BILLS  TO HELP LURE FOREIGN INVESTMENT: FINANCE  MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said
Wednesday that if six bills crucial to financial reforms can clear
the Legislative Yuan, they will have the potential to lure at least
US$5 billion-worth of foreign capital to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks at a public hearing on his recent overseas
visit to woo foreign investment. The hearing was convened by
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao of the opposition New Party.</P>
      <P>Yen has lobbied for the convening of an extra session of the
legislature to pass the six bills, including a financial holding
company bill and regulations on the establishment and management of a
financial rehabilitation fund. The six bills are among a backlog of
bills left outstanding by the recently completed legislative session.</P>
      <P>Yen said that he will pitch for domestic financial reforms when
he travels to Europe to lobby for foreign investment later this
month.</P>
      <P>He noted that the establishment of a financial fund will help
write off mounting bad debts, while the financial holding companies
bill will enable financial institutions to diversify to other fields.</P>
      <P>He said that foreign institutional investors have great interest
in Taiwan's financial market and information technology industries,
adding that in the first five months of this year, foreign investors
have pumped in US$5.2 billion.</P>
      <P>He also said that foreign investors are concerned about
transparency in Taiwan's financial market, and that if he can provide
information on the island's financial reforms, it will be very
attractive to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>He predicted that between January this year and June 2002, net
increase of foreign capital inflow will be no less than US$20
billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAN DONATES BONE MARROW TO MAINLAND CHINESE WOMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  Taiwan,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's biggest charity, the
Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, was instrumental
Wednesday in enabling a 26-year-old Taiwan man to donate 1,305 c.c.
of bone marrow for transplant to a woman in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the foundation's medical center in Hualien, eastern
Taiwan, extracted the bone marrow from the donor early in the morning
for immediate delivery to Suzhou in the eastern mainland province of
Jiangsu for the transplant operation.</P>
      <P>Four Tzu Chi volunteers started the 15-hour journey to deliver
the bone marrow from Hualien to Suzhou via Taipei, Hong Kong and
Shanghai immediately after the soft, fatty, vascular tissue was
extracted from the donor.</P>
      <P>The bone marrow was scheduled to arrive at a Suzhou hospital at
10 p.m. Wednesday, where a medical team will transplant the tissue to
the 21-year-old mainland woman, who suffers from acute leukemia and
needs the bone marrow transplant to survive.</P>
      <P>This was the 86th Tzu Chi-mediated bone marrow donation to
mainland China. The foundation has so far mediated 280 cross-border
bone marrow donations to 15 countries around the world.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to encourage bone marrow donations for
transplant, the foundation arranged for two Taiwan, one Hong Kong and
two Suzhou TV stations to make live broadcasts of the bone marrow
extraction, the transportation process and the transplant procedure.</P>
      <P>"It's the first time that the foundation has given live coverage
of the whole donation and transplant process with a view to encourage
organ donation," said a Tzu Chi spokesman.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said mainland Chinese people are even more
conservative than their Taiwan counterparts in their attitudes toward
organ donation. "Mainland medical professionals have often sought our
assistance in matching compatible bone marrow donations with suitable
recipients," he added.</P>
      <P>As of the end of May, the Tzu Chi foundation's bone marrow
databank had collated information about 217,250 prospective bone
marrow donors, making it the largest databank of its kind in Asia.</P>
      <P>The foundation just made its 14th bone marrow donation to South
Korea last Saturday, extracting bone marrow from a 30-year-old local
man for transplant to a 29-year-old South Korean musician, also a
leukemia patient.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA KEEPING CLOSE WATCH ON DEVELOPMENTS IN MACEDONIA: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China mission in Macedonia
has no plans to evacuate strife-torn country for the moment as the
situation in the Balkan state's capital, Skopje, remains largely
calm, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue told a routine press conference
that the ROC mission in Macedonia has finalized a comprehensive
contingency plan, but will not implement it -- at least for the
moment.</P>
      <P>"The mission is closely monitoring the situation there and will
decide whether to evacuate based on the developments in the internal
fighting in that country," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the formal diplomatic relationship between the ROC
and Macedonia, Chang said the Macedonia Cabinet has yet to reach a
consensus on the proposal to sever ties with Taipei in favor of
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The Macedonian Cabinet remains divided over ties with the ROC
and Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski has yet to call a meeting
with the leaders of major political parties to discuss the issue,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the conclusion of Macedonia's Cabinet
meeting on Tuesday was that their president will have to convene a
meeting with leaders of major political parties in the near term to
discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>"We will wait and see," Chang noted.</P>
      <P>However, Macedonian government spokesman Antonio Milosovski
announced Tuesday that the country has indeed decided to normalize
relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Torn by a conflict with ethnic Albanian insurgents, Milosovski
said, Macedonia must weigh the goodwill of Beijing, one of five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, though, Milosovski's remarks only reflected
his party's stance and each Macedonian political party has its own
view on the issue.</P>
      <P>Until Macedonia makes a final decision, Chang said MOFA will not
comment on remarks made by delegates of the various Macedonian
political parties.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macedonia's political situation is very complicated
and the fighting between Macedonian government troops and ethnic
Albanian rebels has continued rising, Chang said uncertainties still
surround ROC-Macedonian ties.</P>
      <P>"The ROC mission there is stepping up efforts to contact all
major Macedonian poltiical parties to seek their support," she said,
adding that the ROC will do its utmost to safeguard ties with
the European ally with no compromise on national dignity.</P>

(By Ramon Huang and Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Substantive relations between the
Republic of China and Bolivia have been improving steadily, ROC
Representative to La Paz Chang Wen-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Chang said that the "present
environment is favorable for restoration of the two countries'
diplomatic relations, but the move is unlikely in the near future."</P>
      <P>Some newspapers in Taiwan had wrongly reported that restoration
of ROC-Bolivia ties "is imminent," speculation that was immediately
denied by the ROC Foreign Ministry.</P>
      <P>Although the Bolivian media reported the speculation from Taipei,
the Bolivian government did not bother to respond.</P>
      <P>Chang said that "Bolivia is basically very friendly toward the
ROC. Although it has diplomatic relations with mainland China, it
maintains goodwill with the ROC in cultural and other areas."</P>
      <P>Formal relations between the ROC and Bolivia were severed in July
1985 following La Paz's recognition of the Beijing government. The
semi-official "Commercial-Consular Office of the ROC" was established
in October 1990 to handle bilateral substantive relations.</P>
      <P>Office personnel are accorded the preferential treatment given to
staff members of international organizations, including exemption
from taxation and service of diplomatic parcels.</P>
      <P>Chang said that a trade mission organized by 10 large Bolivian
companies is scheduled to visit Taiwan later this year to explore new
markets in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The idea of dispatching the trade mission was raised by the
Bolivian side when ROC Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chairwoman
Chang Fu-mei visited La Paz in March of this year.</P>
      <P>As exchange of visits by the two countries' officials and
parliamentarians is frequent, Chang said that mutual understanding
between the two countries has been strengthened.</P>

him.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior U.S. official said Tuesday
that the central question in the relationship between mainland China
and Taiwan is how to shift the focus from a cross-strait military
balance to finding ways to resolve differences.</P>
      <P>James Kelly, assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the
Pacific, said that the answer lies in three areas.</P>
      <P>"A combination of political dialogue, economic cooperation and
mutual understanding offers the prospect that both sides will find
they have increased interests in common and therefore increasing
reasons to find practical ways to resolve their differences," he
said.</P>
      <P>The first priority for both Beijing and Taipei should be the
resumption of direct dialogue, he said in a written statement
submitted to the House Asia and Pacific Subcommittee.</P>
      <P>"But we would like to see not just a start but real
accomplishments in cross-strait dialogue," he said.</P>
      <P>On the question of mutual understanding, the official said that
both sides "need to have a better understanding of the other side and
what it seeks from a closer relationship.</P>
      <P>"In particular, we have urged the PRC to shift from seeking to
put pressure on -- even intimidate -- Taiwan and instead appeal to
the people of Taiwan," Kelly said.</P>
      <P>"Beijing needs to explain to Taiwan the benefits of a closer
relationship rather than the perils of a more distant one," he added.</P>
      <P>He also urged Beijing not to ignore the government of President
Chen Shui-bian and to instead "offer a case that is attractive" to
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The written statement is part of Kelly's testimony before the
subcommittee during a hearing held to discuss U.S. policy on the East
Asia and the Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Kelly stressed the U.S. commitment to seeing a peaceful
resolution of differences across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The abiding interest of the United States is that differences be
resolved peacefully," he said. "This interest lies behind the
commitments undertaken in the three (joint) communiques (signed with
Beijing) and it is at the heart of the Taiwan Relations Act."</P>
      <P>On the question of Beijing's and Taipei's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), Kelly reiterated U.S. support for mainland
China's entry "as soon as China is ready to meet WTO standards."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan, of course, is also ready for membership in the WTO, and
we expect both to enter, hopefully, this year," he said.</P>

the United States and the People's Republic of China will not fight
each other over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while meeting with Singaporean reporters.</P>
      <P>Lee said that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin told him
during their talks that Beijing wants to maintain friendly relations
with Washington.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lee said that he believes the U.S. and the PRC will

Chinese jetfighter and a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the South

      <P>Lee told reporters that the issue concerning U.S. military
activities in Singapore was not discussed in his talks with Jiang.</P>

normalized their relations in 1990 that Singapore would continue
sending military personnel to Taiwan for training and the U.S.
military would be allowed to use Singapore bases.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) said
Wednesday that the CBC will respect the market mechanism and let
foreign exchange rates be decided by the supply and demand on the
market.</P>
      <P>The CBC made the remark in response to the sharp depreciation of
the new Taiwan dollar against the greenback on the Taipei foreign
exchange market Wednesday, triggered by forecasts made by some
domestic and foreign research institutions that the local currency
had further room to depreciate.</P>
      <P>The local currency closed at 34.377 against the greenback
Wednesday, a sharp decrease of 0.312 from the closing level of the
previous trading session.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chung-yi, deputy director of the CBC's Foreign Exchange
Department, urged those research institutions that make predictions
to be cautious, saying the foreign exchange market is very sensitive
to financial information.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that presently the forecasts for the trend of the local
currency's exchange rate with the U.S. dollar made by various
research institutions are quite different. He urged the public not to
be taken in by rumors, calling for the public to pay more attention
to financial information before trading in the market.</P>
      <P>He also cited official statistics that should bring confidence to

    <HEADLINE>THAI, VIETNAMESE LABOR WAGES, BROKERAGE FEES TO BE LOWERED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Labor Affairs
(CLA) announced Wednesday that it has arrived at a consensus with the
Vietnamese representative office in Taiwan that will lead to lower
wages and lower brokerage fees for Vietnamese workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA, Vietnam has agreed to follow a similar
agreement between the CLA and Thailand to deduct room and board fees
from workers' pay, which would lead to approximately NT$2,500 (US$73)
to NT$4,000 (US$116) less in monthly wages.</P>
      <P>The new scheme will go into effect July 1 for Thai workers but
will only affect new contracts. No starting date has been set yet for
the agreement with Vietnam.</P>
      <P>To compensate for the lower income, the CLA said that labor
brokers in Taiwan have agreed to lower the high brokerage fees that
foreign laborers usually pay in advance for the chance to work in
Taiwan, where the guaranteed minimum wage of NT$15,840 (US$461) per
month is higher than what they could earn elsewhere in Hong Kong or
Singapore.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA, labor brokers in Vietnam have also agreed
to lower their management service charges by 5 percent to 7 percent.</P>
      <P>Foreign laborers often take out high-interest loans to pay for
brokerage fees and have to work one to two years before being able to
pay off the debt.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local police officers feel
 a great amount of job stress, while almost half of them have
 intention of switching professions, according to the results of an
 opinion poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted from June 1-8 by the office of
 opposition Kuomintang Legislator Tina W. K. Pang with a view to
 understanding the living conditions of local police personnel. Pan
 sent out 1,300 copies of a questionnaire and collected 1,150 valid
 replies.</P>
      <P>Poll results showed that 92.43 percent of the respondents said
 they feel police work entails a lot of stress; 91.74 percent
 described police work as toilsome; 87.83 percent said police work is
 dangerous; 80.43 percent said their work has affected their family
 lives; and 62.61 percent said they have often been scolded by their
 superiors or have faced unreasonable demands.</P>
      <P>While 38.52 percent said they feel that being a police officer is
 a decent job, 45.57 percent said they don't think so. Meanwhile,
 35.39 percent said they are satisfied with the salaries and welfare
 benefits for police officers, but 43.48 percent said they think
 otherwise.</P>
      <P>About 73 percent said they tend to feel frustrated by major
 disciplinary incidents or charges involving police officers.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 44.87 percent said they often have
 thoughts about leaving the police force; 63.3 percent said they would
 immediately resign from their current post if they were offered a
 different job with similar pay; 32.43 percent said they would give a
 thumbs-down if any of their relatives intended to marry a police
 officer; and 28.96 percent said they would not support a family
 member's plan to join the police force.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's public order situation over the past year,
 80.42 percent said they feel that the crime rate has risen steadily.</P>
      <P>Survey respondents also cited "improving the current police
 work-holiday system" as the assistance they most need. This was
 followed by rationalization of the pay scale, public recognition, the
 support of superiors, improvement in weapons and crime-fighting
 equipment, opportunities for on-the-job training, and psychological
 counseling services, in that order.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONLY MINOR DAMAGE REPORTED AFTER STRONG QUAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Only minor cases of damage in eastern and
 northern Taiwan have been reported by Thursday afternoon after an
 earthquake measuring 6.2 on the open-ended Richter scale struck
 northeastern Taiwan at 10 35 a.m., the Cabinet-level Disaster
 Prevention and Relief Center (DPRC) reported.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Lai In-jaw, who is the DPRC director-general, called
 for the Taiwan public not to panic over the disaster.</P>
      <P>Lai, however, reminded his fellow countrymen to be on high alert
 for any future quakes that may rock the island as seismologists at
 the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) have warned that aftershocks of
 Thursday's 6.2 tremor are very likely to occur in the following three
 to four weeks.</P>
      <P>The tremor, which lasted for more than 20 seconds, was detected
 about 19.6 kilometers east of the northeastern township of Suao in
 Ilan County, at a depth of 10.4 kilometers beneath the surface of the
 sea, according to CWB seismologists.</P>
      <P>It was the second strong quake to rock Taiwan in 12 hours,
 following a similar temblor of magnitude 6.3 in an adjacent area
 Wednesday evening. No damage was reported as resulting from
 Wednesday's quake.</P>
      <P>The CWB earthquake experts said Thursday's strong jolt was very
 similar to the one that occurred at about the same time of day at
 around the same location seven years ago. In that quake, one person
 was killed and two were injured while 25 houses were reported to have
 collapsed.</P>
      <P>As of press time Thursday, three people were reported injured in
 the greater Taipei area, where the quake had an intensity of 5.0. All
 three people, in Yungho City, Hsinchuang City and Panchiao City,
 respectively, were injured by falling objects during the earthquake.
 Their injuries are not life-threatening, according to National Fire
 Administration reports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, six cases of damage to property, also in the greater
 Taipei area, have been reported, including a fire that ignited at an
 electricity transmission station on Chuangching Road. The fire was
 extinguished after just 10 minutes. Also, ceramic tiles were reported
 to have fallen from a festooned archway of the Chiang Kai-shek
 Memorial Hall, and a glass wall at a local bank reportedly cracked
 during the quake.</P>
      <P>Other reported cases of damage included the collapse of an outer
 wall surrounding a building in downtown Taipei, and the collapse of
 the ceiling in a waiting room at Taipei's Sungshan Airport and also
 at the Ministry of Finance office. No one has been reported injured
 at any of these locations.</P>
      <P>In eastern Taiwan, no casualties were reported as of press time,
 although some telephone lines were interrupted. Fallen rocks were
 reported on the highway linking Suao and Hualien, as well as on the
 Central Cross-island Highway, but traffic has not been disrupted.</P>
      <P>Those using roads in eastern Taiwan have been warned against
 possible landslide, particularly in mountainous areas, in the wake of
 the two strong earthquakes, and because of the monsoon season, which
 has been battering the island with heavy rains.</P>
      <P>Thursday's quake, which has been preliminarily labeled as an
 isolated one from Wednesday's temblor, had an intensity of 5.0 in
 Taipei and the eastern city of Ilan, 4.0 in the northern counties of
 Hsinchu and Taoyuan, 3.0 in the counties of Nantou, Taichung, Hualien
 and Keelung, and 2.0 in Tainan County in southern Taiwan and on the
 offshore island of Penghu located southwest of Taiwan proper,
 according to the CWB.</P>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Co. reported that there has been no
 damage to any of its power stations or electricity supply systems
 around the island and that there has been no disruption in services
 except for a minor two-minute skip at a power relay stop in central
 Taipei.</P>
      <P>None of the semiconductor manufacturing companies located at the
 Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park -- "Taiwan's Silicon Valley" --
 in northern Taiwan were affected by the temblor, according to the

    <HEADLINE>70 PERCENT OF POLICEWOMEN SATISFIED WITH CURRENT JOB  POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local female police
 officers are satisfied with their current job, but many of them worry
 about the difficult balancing act between work and family life,
 according to the results of an opinion poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey of randomly selected policewomen, conducted by
 opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chin Hui-chu in
 connection with the advent of Police Day, found that 70 percent of
 the respondents said they are content with their present job.</P>
      <P>Chin sent out a total of 1,082 copies of a questionnaire early
 this month and collected 750 valid replies from female police
 officers from around the island.</P>
      <P>Eighty percent of the respondents said their families are
 supportive of their job; but more than 60 percent confessed that they
 often worry about their inability to balance their work and family
 life.</P>
      <P>Other worries cited by survey respondents included work stress
 and personal safety.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 50 percent said they feel a great amount of job
 stress; nearly 40 percent said they are worried about difficulties
 getting promotions or changing to other police positions; and 73
 percent said they feel that their capabilities are more likely to be
 overlooked than those of their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of female police officers also said they feel
 that they are more likely to face sex discrimination in seeking
 promotions than their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>About 64 percent said they have either often or occasionally
 thought about switching to other professions.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey findings, Chin said police work is tough,
 complicated and capricious, and that police officers often endure a
 lot of unseen hardships in fighting crime and maintaining law and
 order.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, female police officers have often faced an even
 greater amount of job stress than their male counterparts," Chin
 said, adding that relevant government authorities should pay more
 heed to women police officers' feelings, rights and welfare services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASHINGTON-BEIJING DISCORD COULD EXPLODE OVER TAIWAN  U.S. EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 14 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A simmering conflict between the United
 States and mainland China resulting from unresolved military and
 diplomatic issues could soon explode over the status of Taiwan, two
 U.S. experts on China have warned in an analysis.</P>
      <P>Writing in the latest issue of "Foreign Affairs," former U.S.
 Assistant Secretary of Defense Kurt Campbell, who is now director of
 the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and
 International Studies (CSIS), along with Derek Mitchell, senior
 fellow for the CSIS Asia Program, noted that although the standoff
 between the United States and China over the collision of a U.S.
 surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter in April ended peacefully,
 there are still unresolved military and diplomatic issues, which
 could bring greater discord to the relationship in the future.</P>
      <P>In their view, Washington's official relationship with Beijing on
 the one hand and its unofficial relationship with Taipei on the other
 represents perhaps "the most complex foreign-policy balancing act" in
 the world today.</P>
      <P>At stake are a number of core U.S. foreign policy goals the
 promotion of democracy; the preservation of U.S. credibility; loyalty
 to traditional allies and friends; the engagement and integration of
 an emerging power into the international system; and the maintenance
 of peace and stability in Asia as a whole. The interplay and
 potential conflicts among these various goals make the Taiwan Strait
 an unpredictable, and therefore dangerous place, they wrote in the
 bimonthly magazine.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan's recent democratization has undermined the "one
 China" principle and has made the prospect of conflict increasingly
 likely. Compounding the problem is the deep division within the U.S.
 foreign policy elite over how to maintain the increasingly fragile
 peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps nowhere else on the globe is the situation so seemingly
 intractable and the prospect of a major war involving the United
 States so real," they said.</P>
      <P>The current situation in the Taiwan Strait -- the escalating
 tensions, the lack of meaningful dialogue and the increasingly
 hostile rhetoric -- suggests that the U.S. approach to the region
 requires a wholesale review. In the end, Mao Zedong's oft-quoted
 warning about the need for patience in addressing the issue of Taiwan
 is perhaps more relevant today than when Mao first uttered it, they
 wrote.</P>
      <P>"Thus, the best option for the United States is to help create
 incentives that will encourage both Taipei and Beijing to maintain
 the undefined status quo -- a middle ground between reunification and
 independence. Each side dislikes the current situation for its own
 reasons, but for both it is the best choice among unhappy
 alternatives," they said.</P>
      <P>They noted that the United States must use its diplomatic skill
 and military muscle to dissuade China from continuing its coercive
 course regarding Taiwan and persuade it to pursue a more constructive
 and conciliatory approach. Meanwhile, Washington should seek ways for
 Taiwan to participate in the international community while accepting
 the inevitable limitations of its indeterminate status.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the United States must continue prudent
 contingency planning and maintain an active military presence in the
 region to sustain deterrence. It should also consider a more active
 diplomatic role to help facilitate future cross-strait discussions on
 political, military and other issues, they suggested.</P>
      <P>Campbell and Mitchell said that for the past two decades, the
 essence of U.S. policy in the Taiwan Strait has been to preserve
 peace and stability in the region while indefinitely deferring the
 ultimate resolution of the problem. This approach has led to 20 years
 of prosperity and the proliferation of commercial contacts between
 Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>"Yet today's stability shows unmistakable signs of strain. Unless
 both sides of the strait act creatively, Washington may find that the
 future it sought to postpone has already arrived," they concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO COMPROMISE ON NATIONAL DIGNITY, SAYS MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has launched a
 last-ditch campaign to salvage diplomatic relations with Macedonia as
 part of the Macedonian government mulls restoring formal ties with
 Beijing, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ROC will do its utmost to safeguard ties with the civil
 war-torn Balkan ally, but with no comprise on national dignity, said
 MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held Thursday following a strongly worded
 statement on the volatile Skopje-Taipei ties Wednesday by the ROC
 Embassy in Macedonia, Chang stressed that the ROC has tried its best
 to secure formal diplomatic ties with Macedonia based on principles
 of national interest and national dignity.</P>
      <P>Chang declined to confirm whether the statement made on Wednesday
 was an "ultimatum" to Macedonia concerning the uncertainties
 surrounding the bilateral relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>She only said that the Macedonian Cabinet has yet to reach a
 consensus on a proposal to sever ties with Taipei in favor of
 Beijing. "The Macedonian Cabinet remains divided over ties with the
 ROC and Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski has yet to call a
 meeting with the leaders of major political parties to discuss the
 issue," she added.</P>
      <P>It the statement issued Wednesday, the ROC Embassy in Skopje said
 that it deeply regrets that the decision of the Macedonian government
 to normalize relations with Beijing has seriously harmed not only the
 dignity of the ROC and its people but also the amicable relations and
 bilateral cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>As a result, should the bilateral relationship between the ROC
 and Macedonia be suspended, the government of the ROC will seriously
 consider undertaking measures to suspend, cease or nullify financial
 aid and all other bilateral cooperative programs that Taiwan has
 promised Macedonia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR HAKKA CULTURAL RENAISSANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he
 is hopeful that the newly inaugurated Council for Hakka Affairs will
 join forces with other relevant government agencies to push for a
 renaissance of Hakka culture.</P>
      <P>"I also look forward to seeing Taiwan become a world hub for
 Hakka cultural heritage inheritance and resurrection through
 concerted efforts of the new council and relevant public and private
 organizations," Chen added.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a speech delivered at the
 new Cabinet-level council's inaugural ceremony. The establishment of
 the council realized one of Chen's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the inauguration of the new commission
 reflects local society's respect for cultural diversity and
 underscores the government's determination to substantiate the
 constitutional spirit of equality.</P>
      <P>"The legislation of the statute governing the structure of the
 Hakka council also marked a critical step in maintaining our
 pluralistic democratic system," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that he admires Hakka people's
 can-do spirit and down-to-earth working attitude.</P>
      <P>"And their courage, perseverance and devotion to pursuing justice
 and fairness had been fully reflected in their fight against the
 corrupt Ching dynasty and Japanese invasion in modern Chinese
 history," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that during his stint as Taipei mayor, he took the
 lead in setting up a municipal Hakka culture foundation, a Hakka
 culture hall and a Hakka arts and crafts demonstration center as part
 of his efforts to bolster revival of obscure Hakka cultural and
 artistic heritage.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes the new Hakka council will pool the wisdom and
 resources of Hakka associations at home and abroad and even
 non-government international organizations to enable people around
 the world to appreciate the beauty of Hakka culture and art.</P>
      <P>In view of Taiwan's imminent accession to the World Trade
 Organization (WTO), Chen said the council should also join forces
 with other relevant government agencies to help local Hakka farmers
 transfer to other lines of business. WTO entry is expected to have a
 serious impact on Taiwan's agricultural sector and Hakkas form a
 large share of the island's farming population.</P>
      <P>Roughly one-sixth of Taiwan's 23 million people are Hakkas -- one
 of the most important branches of the Chinese people whose ancestors
 emigrated from mainland China to Taiwan hundreds of years ago.</P>
      <P>Chen has appointed Fan Kuang-chun, a national policy adviser to
 the president and a noted attorney, as chairman of the new Hakka
 council.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are Chinese whose ancestors lived in "Chung Yuan," or
 "China proper," comprising Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and some
 parts of other provinces in central and northern China. They
 gradually migrated to southern China and emigrated to Southeast Asia
 and other parts of the world during national upheavals since the
 fourth century.</P>
      <P>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Taipei estimated in
 1992 that there were about 34 million overseas Chinese at that time,
 one-third of whom were Hakkas.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are noted for their persistent adherence to
 traditional Chinese customs and values, such as patriotism, loyalty,
 hard work, and resistance to alien aggression and influence.</P>
      <P>In addition, they look upon themselves as people of high social
 status, which is why they do not assimilate well into the local
 community and are called "guest people" wherever they live. "Hakka"
 means "guest family" in mandarin Chinese.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
 said Thursday that party cooperation is required if no party gains
 half of the Legislative Yuan seats in December's legislative
 elections.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in an interview with Serge Berthier and
 Laurent Malvezin, publisher and general manager of the Hong
 Kong-based "Asian Affairs" quarterly.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
 policy is to seek cooperation from the opposition camp after the
 upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>However, he said that the targets for cooperation have not been
 fixed yet, because some uncertain factors remain.</P>
      <P>The premier quoted President Chen Shui-bian as having stated that
 the DPP will recruit opposition legislators who share the political
 ideals of the DPP to form a coalition government.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-strait relations, Chang admitted that
 no major breakthroughs have been made.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that bilateral relations have been stabilized
 as the allegations that the DPP is a party that pursues Taiwan
 independence and that a DPP government would mean a war with mainland
 China have been proven groundless.</P>
      <P>Regarding whether the government will resort to a public
 plebiscite to resolve the issue concerning the future of the island's
 fourth nuclear power plant, Chang said that the government's basic
 principle is to resolve controversial issues through public
 plebiscite.</P>
      <P>He added that the government has already forwarded the draft of
 the Public Plebiscite Law to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation
 and enactment.</P>
      <P>On the steps for stimulating the sluggish economy, Chang said the
 government will do its utmost to keep this year's real growth rate
 above four percent through expansion of public projects and increase
 of the employment rate.</P>
      <P>He also said that efforts will be placed on the development of
 new industries to ensure continued economic development in the coming

      <P>Eighty-three mainland Chinese fishermen on
 a floating hostel were temporarily forced ashore on Thursday after
 their ship ran aground off Pingtung in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration reported that the ship, the
 Changyi No.10, that houses the 83 mainland fishermen, ran aground 40
 meters off Tungkang, Pingtung, around 5 a.m. and that the hull had
 taken upwards of 80 centimeters of water and was in danger of
 sinking.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration and firefighters in Pingtung, upon
 learning the news, sent patrol boats and rescuers who used mooring
 rope to tie secure the vessel, and the mainland fishermen were able
 to swim to shore with assistance.</P>
      <P>According to the mainland fishermen, the sea was rough early
 Thursday morning, which broke the mooring ropes. The ship then
 drifted toward shore.</P>
      <P>The mainland fishermen were placed in a security check center
 before they were sent back in the afternoon to other floating
 hostels. There are estimated to be more than a score of the hostels
 anchored off Tungkang.</P>
      <P>The floating hostels are usually converted from old, dilapidated
 ships, and mainland fishermen are confined to the cramped space in
 the ships when they are not operating at sea.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said in a recent interview with the Asian Wall
Street Journal that each of the three main political parties in
Taiwan aims to win at least 60 seats in the year-end legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>In the interview, published Thursday, Soong said that if his
party were to win more than 60 seats in the 225-member legislature,
it would be considered by the party to be a major victory.</P>
      <P>He speculated that no single major party is likely to win as many
as 85 to 90 seats, and that no party is likely to fall below less
than 40.</P>
      <P>Regarding ongoing talks of cooperation between the PFP and the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the election, Soong said that the
two parties have certain overlapping interests and share the same
belief in a 1992 consensus with Beijing that there is only "one
China" but each side is free to interpret "one China" in its own way.</P>
      <P>Regarding the new U.S. administration's policies toward Taiwan

to encourage mainland China to come to the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>He also warned that mainland China might use the Taiwan issue to
distract its people from its own internal economic problems, adding

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not rashly open its market to
mainland Chinese agricultural products after both sides of the Taiwan
Strait enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), a top agricultural
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-ching, vice chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA),
said that any increased opening to mainland products will have to be
done through negotiation on an equal footing with the mainland, based
on the principles of national security and the impact on domestic
industries.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that Taiwan's relationship with the mainland will not
be quite the same as with other countries after WTO accession,
expected at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>He added that although the indirect trade in agricultural
products across the Taiwan Strait will move toward WTO norms after
entry, it will not conform completely with WTO norms.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's opening of agricultural products to the mainland
will still follow existing mainland policy and will be carried out
through negotiation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, during an intra-agency meeting convened by the COA to
review the result of the "mini three links" -- direct trade, postal
and transport links -- between Kinmen and Matsu islands and the
mainland ports of Xiamen and Mawei after six months' implementation,
the two offshore islands asked for more openness to mainland
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu representatives requested opening up to an
additional 152 agricultural products from the mainland, but the COA
would only agree to two of them.</P>
      <P>Lin said that no matter what channels mainland China uses to get
its agricultural products into Taiwan, a risk is posed to the
nation's quarantine system.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu representatives lamented that even after the
links, legal trade is still basically "small-scale," while smuggled
agricultural products continue to find their way into Taiwan via the
two islands.</P>
      <P>The COA decided to ask the Ministry of Finance to step up a
crackdown on smuggling and to work out control measures to stem the
illicit sending of mainland China agricultural products from Kinmen
and Matsu to Taiwan proper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT READY FOR DPP PLOY TO SPLIT OPPOSITION IN LEAD-UP TO ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) dismissed
allegations Thursday that former party Chairman Lee Teng-hui will
stump for Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidates in the
year-end legislative and city hall elections.</P>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, director of the KMT's Organization and Development
Department, said the allegations, supposedly spread by DPP sources,
are a ploy to alienate Lee and the KMT rank-and-file, adding that the
KMT is well-prepared to counter what he described as "a political
gambit."</P>
      <P>As a retired KMT leader, Chao said, Lee should be willing to
stump for KMT candidates rather than DPP rivals, but he stressed that
the KMT will not browbeat former party leaders who opt to quit
politics into canvassing voters.</P>
      <P>Chao made the comments after Thursday's China Times said that
Lee, who has moaned about the KMT's shift from the line laid down by
him toward more centrist policies, will throw his weight behind DPP
candidates in the year-end election to protest the KMT's change of
direction.</P>
      <P>Lee has already aired his dissatisfaction with his hand-picked
heir -- Lien Chan -- in a book penned by Japanese author Fuyuko
Kamisaka earlier this year and has often been quoted by his cronies
as finding fault in private with the KMT's political line under Lien.</P>
      <P>The local press quoted "sources" as assuring DPP President Chen
Shui-bian earlier this month that up to 35 KMT and independent
lawmakers will switch their support to Chen, as long as his DPP can
win 85 seats at the Legislative Yuan in the election.</P>
      <P>In the latest sign heralding Lee's forthcoming breakup with the
party which helped him ascend to the presidency of the country, the
China Times said that Lee will join Chen Saturday in the inauguration
ceremony of a pro-DPP group named "Peishe," or North Society.</P>
      <P>Chao tried to gloss over the prospects that Lee could appear
together with Chen, saying that it is "nothing unusual" for Lee to
meet his successor at a "social gathering" and that "outsiders"
should not read too much political overtone into the event.</P>
      <P>Chao further said that Lien has called on Lee quite often
recently in a friendly atmosphere and has maintained close, but
unpublicized, contact with his political mentor.</P>
      <P>Noting that many KMT members protested to the party headquarters
and demanded Lee's expulsion from the party upon reading Thursday's
press reports, Chao denounced the allegations as a DPP political ploy
to drive a wedge between the KMT and its former leader.</P>
      <P>Chao said he did not know what exact assurance Lee made to Chen,
but claimed that by no stretch of imagination could 35 lawmakers
defect to back the DPP.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the KMT will do its utmost to maintain
its majority in the legislature in the forthcoming election.</P>

      <P>The Seoul-based Tongyap Ilbo (East Asia Daily News) published a
list of 30 donors.</P>
      <P>South Korea is facing its worst drought in a century, with
rainfall down by one-third from "previous levels." Many farms have
turned to desert because of the lack of water and the South Korean
government and various civic groups have launched a fundraising
campaign to help farmers buy water pumps.</P>
      <P>Lee, who assumed his post only recently, donated the contribution
through the paper and after accepting the donation, Choi Kyu-chol,
the newspaper's editor-in-chief, said that Lee is the first foreign
envoy stationed in the country to answer his paper's drought aid
appeal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT CONTINUES EXCHANGING VIEWS WITH DPP LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
is optimistic that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will
be able to get 85 Legislative Yuan seats to become Taiwan's largest
party in December's legislative election.</P>
      <P>He told legislators from the ruling party that he based his
optimistic estimate on discussions with DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh and
other DPP officials.</P>
      <P>The DPP currently controls only one-third of the seats in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen exchanged views with the DPP legislators for three hours on
issues concerning the island's political and economic developments as
well as social welfare.</P>
      <P>It was the second time Chen has met with DPP legislators since
June 11. He will continue meeting the other DPP lawmakers in four
groups over the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Chang Ching-fang (Taipei County),
Chen promised to help campaign for the party's candidates during the
election period with the aim of winning 85 seats in the election.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chang said, some DPP legislators asked Chen
not to seek cooperation with lawmakers who have been tainted with
"black gold" allegations.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Chen admitted to the legislators that he met
with former President Lee Teng-hui early this month, while denying
speculation about a plan to form a "Chen-Lee cooperative alliance."</P>
      <P>He said that Lee's recent remarks favoring the DPP to win 85
seats in the upcoming election were made out of Lee's "sense of
mission" to see the emergence of a stable majority in the legislature
after the election.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Wen-yuan, vice chairman of the
Commission of National Corporations, returned to Taiwan Thursday
after an inspection tour of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lin, who led Taiwan Sugar Corporation (Taisugar) Chairman Chien

the delegation toured Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qingdao and Beijing, where
they met with local private enterprise heads. He added that he did
not meet with high-ranking officials during his stay in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lin said that whether national corporations will invest in the
mainland will hinge on the government's policy. But as Taisugar
currently has a market in the mainland for its butterfly orchids, the
corporation wanted to inspect the mainland market.</P>
      <P>Chien said that this is the second year that Taisugar's butterfly
orchids have been exported to the mainland, saying that more than
10,000 orchids were sold in Beijing last year and nearly 20,000 were
sold in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's butterfly orchids are popular in the mainland because of
their high quality and good looks, Chien said, adding that Taisugar
will increase sales and provide services to related industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HAS NO FIXED IDEA ABOUT COOPERATIVE PARTNERS: CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has no set idea with which political camp to forge a "coalition
government" following the December legislative elections, party
chairman Frank Hsieh said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the DPP does not have a set position on the issue. No
matter whether legislators are viewed as pro-former President Lee
Teng-hui or whether they are considered to be in the camp of
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, he noted, all political parties
might be the DPP's potential partners.</P>
      <P>But Hsieh stressed that such individuals must first join the DPP
as formal party members subject to party discipline. If they are a
separate group of people, they should form a political party so as to
allow the DPP to cooperate with them in a party-to-party pattern, he
added.</P>
      <P>The aim of forming a "coalition government" would be to create a
majority government capable of stabilizing the country's political
situation, he went on.</P>
      <P>The DPP chief made the remarks in a speech delivered at National
Sun Yat-sen University on the much-talked about "coalition
government" following the legislative election slated for December.
The ruling party currently holds only one-third of seats in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also predicted that the DPP and the main opposition
Kuomintang will each grab 80 seats in the year-end election, while
the People First Party will garner 35 seats and the New Party and
independent lawmakers will take about 30 seats altogether.</P>
      <P>As to widespread rumors that an addition 35 lawmakers will join
forces with the DPP following the election if the ruling party
manages to gain 85 seats, he claimed that the figure of 35 is a
fiction. If the DPP gains a good result in the year-end polls, such a
move would be unnecessary, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) said Thursday they were aware of growing anger among the party
grassroots with former party Chairman Lee Teng-hui and were watching
the situation carefully.</P>
      <P>The officials acknowledged that the KMT Central Committee had
received many phone calls from the party's grassroots-level members
demanding Lee's expulsion from the party for supposed "improper
remarks" regarding the KMT and its chairman, Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee's plan to appear Saturday with President Chen
Shui-bian at a ceremony to mark the establishment of "Peishe" or
North Society, a pro-DPP group, has heightened the discontent among
the KMT's grassroots, which was said by KMT administrative personnel
to be escalating.</P>
      <P>Because the KMT's 16th party plenary meeting is due to take place
in July, the Central Committee is watching the anti-Lee sentiment
closely for possible impact on the 100-year-old party.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is still a controversial figure despite having quit
politics, was reluctant to step down as KMT chairman after the
party's humiliating defeat in the 2000 presidential election.
However, a large crowd of furious party members forced him to resign
as the party head after several days of violent protests in front of
KMT headquarters.</P>

      <P>The head of a rural township near the
epicenter of the disastrous Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake was given a
life sentence Thursday for corruption during the post-quake
reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-feng, magistrate of Chungliao rural township in Nantou
County, was sentenced to two concurrent life terms, in addition to a
fine of NT$22 million (US$647,000) and a lifelong ban on running for
public office.</P>
      <P>Chungliao was leveled by the 7.3-magnitute quake and Wu was
accused for rigging public bidding processes for post-quake
reconstruction projects in exchange for kickbacks.</P>
      <P>A judge of the Nantou District Court said in his verdict that Wu
is particularly culpable for doing the opposite of what he was
elected to do by pursuing his personal greed for profit without
giving any consideration to public welfare.</P>
      <P>Wu's illegal gains, totaling more than NT$2 million (US$58,823)
should be returned to the Chungliao township government, according to
the verdict.</P>
      <P>Pai Hwa-poh, a technician at the Chungliao township government
who pleaded guilty in a plea bargain, offered to return his share of
the illegal gains and testify against Wu in the trial. He was handed
a jail term of two years and 10 months.</P>
      <P>All but six of the other 18 co-defendants, mainly contractors who
offered Wu bribes to obtain the projects, were given prison terms
varying from seven years and 10 months to 10 months.</P>
      <P>Wu, who was briefly detained for investigation last year, was
released for medical reasons afterward and continued his duties as
magistrate. He was not present at the courtroom Thursday when the
sentences were read.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait higher learning
exchange programs are escalating, although the political atmosphere
across the Taiwan Strait is still at a low ebb.</P>
      <P>Educators from Sinkiang, Honan, Santung and Jiangxi, who are
currently taking part in a two-day seminar on adult education at
National Taiwan Normal University along with local education
officials, expressed hope that cross-strait educational exchange
programs will not be hindered by political barriers.</P>
      <P>Liu Chun-yuan, curator of Soochow University in Taipei, recalled
that his university began its exchange program with universities in
mainland China with some trepidation three years ago.</P>
      <P>"We started our exchanges step by step," Liu said, adding: "Now
we hold exchange programs with many universities in mainland China,
including Soochow University in Suzhow, Peking University,
Xiamen University and others."</P>
      <P>In addition to jointly holding seminars and conducting
cooperative research on economics, "we have been carrying out
exchanges of professors and student programs," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Soochow University in Suzhou sends visiting professors to the
Chinese Language Department of Soochow University in Taipei every
semester, while law professors have also been on exchange visits, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>In terms of student program exchanges, Liu said, students from
Soochow University topped the leading four at the national college
student debate contests sponsored by mainland TV channels two years
ago. The good performance of Taiwan students in the debate contest
attracted attention from mainland students, he went on.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the education exchanges, Chen Wei-chao, president of
National Taiwan University (NTU), said that his school has been
implementing educational exchanges with universities in the mainland
through the international educational organization and other academic
organizations.</P>
      <P>NTU maintains educational exchanges with the Peking University,
Nanjing University, Fudan University, Tsinghua University in Beijing
and the University of Science and Technology of China.</P>
      <P>NTU and Tsinghua University in Hsinchu have jointly held biannual
seminars on biochemical technology and information technology and the
Internet with universities in mainland China, as well as universities
in Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that NTU has also carried out exchange programs with
members of Pan-Pacific College Alliance, which comprises some 30
universities from mainland China, the United States, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, every university will select a potential
young teacher to take part in the exchange program for professors in
the summer vacation. NTU will host a seminar for those students
pursuing their doctoral degrees next summer, he added.</P>
      <P>Chan Shih-hung, president of Yuan Ze University, said that his
university has already planned to open an educational promotion
department in mainland China but has been forced to halt because the
Ministry of Education objected to the program on the grounds that the
university has violated Taiwan's mainland policy.</P>
      <P>Chan stressed that the university wished to upgrade its
international image through the international educational exchange.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University has entered into academic exchange programs
with Tsinghua University in Beijing, Peking University,
Shanghai Jiaotong University and Hefei Science and Technology
University, Chan said.</P>
      <P>He said the university is cooperation with Peking
University to computerize ancient Chinese rare books, with Shanghai
Jiaotong University on wireless communications systems, with Xian
Jiaotong University on automatic control systems and with Tsinghua
University in Beijing on micro machines.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yuan Ze has also sent professors and students to
participate in seminars in mainland China, Chan said.</P>
      <P>National Central University has maintained intensive exchange
programs of professors and students with universities in the
mainland, according to Liu Chao-han, president of the university.</P>
      <P>At present, he went on, a professor of history from the mainland
is doing a research study on the development of local media, while at
the same time, the university receives mainland Chinese educational
groups every week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN JOB SEEKERS EYEING OPPORTUNITIES IN MAINLAND CHINA (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing global as well as local economic
sluggishness, Taiwan's employment market has recently begun to notice
the effects of a "mainland China fever." The island's job seekers
seem to be feeling the importance of the transition toward
globalization, and mainland China -- where the same language is
spoken and people are of the same race -- has become the choice for
their move toward that globalization.</P>
      <P>Since the end of last year, Taiwan started experiencing a new
mainland fever that was unlike two earlier waves, which were
respectively led by World War II veterans returning to their home
provinces and traditional industries looking to cash in on the lower
labor wages in mainland China.</P>
      <P>This most recent wave of mainland fever appears to be
across-the-board -- from the high tech industry to the medical
industry and even the real estate industry, the education sector and
franchise service sectors are riding the wave.</P>
      <P>What is even more unique is that this latest fever has spread
from the industries to the job seekers, bringing about the
never-before-seen rush to find employment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to a study by 104 Job Bank, a noted local Internet
company that tracks employment trends, the number of people willing
to work in mainland China reached a new high for 2000 in December,
while as of February this year, as much as 64 percent of the
respondents to a new study expressed interest in working in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>According to its recent study, 25.1 percent of the 15,000
respondents expressed "very strong" willingness to work in mainland
China, while 39 percent expressed a "strong" willingness. Of those
who expressed such willingness, 30.6 percent said that their main
consideration was their optimism toward the mainland market, while
24.5 percent said that there would be more opportunities for
advancement and more room to put their skills into play.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another online study shows that Shanghai has replaced
Taipei as the first choice for Taiwan's job seekers, another
indication of the mainland employment fever.</P>
      <P>Compared to local industries, which earlier on had already
determined that the entire world would be their market and embraced
international trade, Taiwan's employment population seems to have
only begun to explore this transition to globalization since being
hit by the recent wave of global and domestic economic slump.
Mainland China -- often called the "world's fastest-developing
country" -- has become the obvious choice for local workers thinking
of taking their first step away from the island.</P>
      <P>Chien Lee-feng, an information science researcher at Academia
Sinica who often travels between Taiwan and mainland China, said that
the mainland market is growing in importance internationally. It is
like Taiwan three decades ago, where opportunities are everywhere,
not like the present-day Taiwan where the economy has reached a stage
of maturity and cannot follow the linear explosive growth of the
past.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is inherently limited in its economic development because
of its land size and the fact that it is an island. However, Chien
said that Holland, which shares a similar lack of natural resources,
can serve as a model of economic progress for Taiwan.

    <TEXT>
      <P>In Holland, juniors or seniors in college must study abroad for a
year to broaden their global perspective. After graduation, it is not
unusual for them to work in another country. Chien noted that he once
knew a student who came from Holland to Taiwan for his year abroad.
That student's three brothers each work in a different country.</P>
      <P>The fact is, once Taiwan and mainland China join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Taiwan's job market will be faced with major
changes, and "stepping out" can be said to be a certain trend.</P>
      <P>Chan Wen-nan, director of the Institute for Information
Industry's Market Intelligence Center, warned that because top talent
from all over the world -- including mainland China -- will come to
Taiwan after WTO accession and compete in the local job market, the
island's existing work force must be prepared by thinking of
themselves as workers who are not limited by national boundaries.
Heading across the Taiwan Strait to work in mainland China is one of
the possible choices in terms of location.</P>
      <P>Faced with this situation, some of the people who are planning to
work in mainland China are full of ambition. Take Mr. C., for
example. He recently quit his job and is ready to work for his
masters in economics at Duke University. He plans to head straight to
Shanghai after receiving that degree because he is strongly attracted
to what he says is a market of unlimited potential, considering that
mainland China is about to enter the WTO and is sure to attract a
mass influx of global financial experts after the financial market is
liberalized.</P>
      <P>Ms. Liao Li-chuan, 28, is currently working in Beijing as a
marketing manager. She is from Taiwan and has been there for nearly a
year. She believes that it really does not matter which country she
goes to because, she says, anywhere abroad is good experience. She
says that although some people might think that working in mainland
China is the same as working in Taiwan because of the common language
and ethnic heritage, in fact, the work ethic, the mindset and
behavioral norms are completely different.</P>
      <P>Chien agrees, pointing out that compared to Taiwan, workers in
mainland China have less work ethic, while "a boastful culture" is
more prevalent there.</P>
      <P>Faced with this wave of mainland fever, experts are quick to
remind job seekers to brush up on their professional knowledge and
skills. 104 Job Bank President Yang Chi-kuan points out that the job
market in mainland China is most in need of high-level managers at
this time. For freshmen who are just starting out, the opportunities
are close to nil. He urged first-time job seekers to find work that
will be helpful to their own personal growth so that they can build
up their experience.</P>
      <P>Chien suggests that for those who are ready to go to mainland
China, the "shortest distance from Taiwan to mainland China is
through Silicon Valley." That is, those who have studied or worked in
Silicon Valley are seen as "gold-plated" and stand a better chance of
stepping into the mainland job market.</P>
      <P>More important, however, says Chien, is that anyone who wants to
work in mainland China must first possess a global perspective and
abundant work experience.</P>
      <P>Summing up the Taiwan worker's employment opportunities, Chien
says: "To the right of Taiwan is the Pacific Ocean, which directly
connects to Silicon Valley. To the left of Taiwan is the Taiwan
Strait, which directly connects to mainland China. If you're not
afraid of water, when you go to the right, you reach Silicon Valley.
To the left, and you get mainland China. The employment opportunities
for the Taiwan people have `never been better.'"</P>

      <P>Taiwan's outbound investment in the first
five months of this year grew nearly 40 percent over the same period
of last year, according to statistics released Friday by the
Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that Taiwan's outbound investment totaled
US$2.124 billion during the January-May period, a year-on-year
increase of 39.5 percent.</P>
      <P>During the period, Taiwan's investment in mainland China amounted
to US$1.068 billion, a year-on-year growth of 33.18 percent, the
figures show.</P>
      <P>However, overseas Chinese and foreign investment in Taiwan
decreased 19.65 percent to US$2.159 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's net capital outflow reached US$930 million for the
period, the highest level since the Republic of China's central
government moved to Taiwan in 1949.</P>

prompted Taiwan businessmen to increase their investments abroad.</P>
      <P>Although officials of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS MANY CAREER WOMEN WORRY ABOUT LOSING JOBS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local women think that
Taiwan's unemployment rate will surge further to set yet another
record and many of them worry about losing their jobs, according to
the results of an opinion poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,109 randomly selected women aged
between 20 and 45 was conducted from June 6-8 by the women's affairs
department of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 80.1 percent of the respondents said
they think Taiwan's jobless rate will hit another peak in the future
and that 47.4 percent of them said they are worried about losing
their jobs.</P>
      <P>Forty-one percent said they are dissatisfied with their present
jobs; 34.4 percent said they are now in the "process of changing
careers and have yet to land a new job;" 78.5 percent said they feel
that it has become more difficult to find a job than it was a year
ago; and 65.1 percent said they have dropped their idea of changing
jobs in consideration of Taiwan's current economic woes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 34.3 percent said they would be willing to go to
mainland China to work at their employers' request and 42 percent
said they would agree to allow their husbands or boyfriends to work
in mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 46.2 percent said classified
advertisements in newspapers are their main channel for seeking jobs;
18.5 percent said they mainly rely on the assistance or
recommendation of friends and relatives; and 15.8 percent said they
rely on the Internet.</P>
      <P>About 29 percent said they would lower their job terms if they
could not easily find new work; 20.4 percent said they would cut
their daily spending; 16.5 percent said they would expand their "job
seeking channels;" and 14.7 percent said they would then pursue
advanced studies or sit various professional examinations.</P>
      <P>The poll found that the civil service and teaching are the
professions local women most like to undertake; followed by financial
services, the information industry, the travel service, the
restaurant service, the medical profession, traditional manufacturing
industries, the mass media services, skin care and hair styling
services, and international trade, in that order.</P>
      <P>Things that women most fear to encounter in job seeking are
falling prey to criminal rings; entering companies that are in
financial straits; failing to get any pay; and joining groups
specializing in illegal "pyramid" selling scams.</P>
      <P>The survey respondents also cited several major hindrances to
landing jobs, including a sharp decrease in job openings, a
reluctance to take jobs incompatible with one's career expectations
or personal qualifications, unreasonable pay scale, and local
employers' unwillingness to recruit newcomers or those lacking in
experience.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN URGES BEIJING TO FOCUS ON ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's main opposition
leader Lien Chan urged mainland China Friday to abandon military
rivalry with Taiwan in favor of "win-win" bilateral economic
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is chairman of the pro-unification Kuomintang, said
after receiving an Outstanding International Politics Award from the
University of Paris that Taiwan continues to hope for the steady
development of the mainland Chinese economy and democratic politics,
although the two have been on opposite sides of the fence for the
past few decades.</P>
      <P>He said that he is optimistic that most people in mainland China
are far more interested in their livelihoods and welfare than they
are in communism because the mainland has already slowly amassed
approximately 20 years of reform experience.</P>
      <P>As long as the communist leadership does not make any major
policy mistakes, Lien speculated, the domestic gaps in political,
social and economic power in mainland China will be filled in as time
goes by.</P>
      <P>However, he warned that if Beijing is unable to resolve the
poverty gap between coastal and inland areas and the problems of
corruption, then mainland China might adopt an even more
confrontational approach to foreign policy in order to channel
domestic unrest into nationalism.</P>
      <P>This could lead to military conflicts in Northeast Asia, the
Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, Lien added.</P>
      <P>He told the approximately 50 political scholars and China experts
in the audience that European nations such as France should take on
the "moral mission" to help mainland China transform into a
democratic nation in order to assure world peace and economic
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Lien is slated to leave for New York Sunday to continue his
three-city visit that has so far included London, where he delivered
a speech at Oxford University.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES WARN OF MAINLAND CHINESE THREAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two members of the U.S. House of
Representatives warned Americans Thursday of the threat posed by
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) told the House that the United States
faces two significant threats: the People's Republic of China, and
massive uncontrolled immigration into America, both legal and
illegal.</P>
      <P>"China is a threat to the United States and can be identified as
such as a result of analyzing China's history and its most recent
actions," the congressman claimed. "China is a nation with a very
long history of aggressive behavior; that behavior is often activated
by grievances, both actual and perceived."</P>
      <P>Tancredo further claimed: "It is motivated by a sort of raging
nationalism that finds expression in expanding its borders in
xenophobia. I believe that the best way to successfully deal with
China is to understand these realities and to fashion a foreign
policy accordingly."</P>
      <P>Another important understanding for Americans with regard to
mainland China, he went on, "is the fact that China believes itself
to be our number one enemy. They look at us as their enemy. There is
absolutely nothing we can do by way of appeasement that will ever
change this reality."</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has already acquired Hong Kong and Macau through
more peaceful mechanisms, they are now preparing for Taiwan to follow
suit, peacefully or otherwise. Beijing has embarked upon the
construction of three missile bases along the coast to threaten
Taiwan. And six days ago, the mainland launched a military drill
involving an attack of amphibious vehicles and landing craft on an
island near Taiwan, said Tancredo.</P>
      <P>He added that Beijing's capability to deliver nuclear weapons to
targets including Los Angeles and many other cities in the United
States has been perfected by the application of advanced technology
that has been both purchased and stolen from the United States.</P>
      <P>Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), meanwhile, quoted Adm. Dennis Blair,
the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, as telling Congress last
March that "China's ongoing missile buildup opposite Taiwan is
destabilizing, and will lead to a U.S. response unless halted."</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) on the need for
missile defenses, the congressman said: "To ensure that we have the
freedoms that we enjoy, we must continue to invest in a missile
defense system."</P>

      <P>Channels of communication between
Taiwan and the United States have been relatively smooth and the Bush
administration's attitude toward Taiwan has been positive, the
Republic of China's representative to the United States said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen told a delegation of journalists from Taiwan that
bilateral relations are cordial, stable and firm.</P>
      <P>In terms of strategic security, Taiwan hopes the United States
will provide even more resources and also lend the island greater
support in the international community, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan is not against improved Beijing-Washington
relations, but cautioned that Taiwan's interests must not be harmed
in the process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, American China expert Larry Wortzel told the

      <P>Wortzel, who is director of the Heritage Foundation's Asia Policy

negotiate with Washington.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to try approaching the elected leader in Taiwan

      <P>Some 4,000 Taipei residents joined
professional athletes from both Taiwan and mainland China Saturday in
road run relays aimed at fostering support for Beijing's bid to host
the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The cross-Taiwan Strait relays will take place in 10 cities in
Taiwan and mainland China over 15 days and are expected to attract
the participation of an estimated 30,000 people.</P>
      <P>Following a kick-off race in Taipei, the runners are scheduled to
travel to the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung later Saturday, where
another race will be staged. They will then proceed to the mainland
Chinese cities of Shenzhen, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi,
Nanjing, Qingdao and finally Beijing, according to the race sponsors.</P>
      <P>The International Olympic Committee is scheduled to vote July 13
to decide whether Beijing, Toronto or Paris will be chosen to host
the games in 2008.</P>
      <P>A 23-member mainland Chinese delegation arrived in Taipei

Dashuang, two brothers who are both Olympic gold medalists in
gymnastics, Lu Lin and Qiao Hong, both of whom are formerly Olympic
gold medalists in swimming.</P>
      <P>Although veteran Taiwanese athlete Chi Cheng -- who earned the
nickname "the flying antelope" for breaking records at world track

of the race that the cross-strait run is purely sporting in nature,
local politicians and activists did not lose the opportunity to
promote their political causes.</P>
      <P>While supporters of the opposition New Party placed propaganda
banners along the streets through which the runners were scheduled to
pass, activists from the Independence Party voiced their opposition

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S U.N. BID NOT `HUMBLE PLEA' BUT DIGNIFIED PROTEST: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
the Republic of China's bid to join the United Nations is not a
"humble plea," but rather a dignified protest against the U.N.'s
discrimination against the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at a seminar on Taiwan's U.N. bid, Chen
said the U.N.'s submission to the repressive Beijing regime's
blackmail to deny democratic Taiwan's membership application has
seriously violated the organization's own founding purposes and
ultimate goals.</P>
      <P>Noting that several U.N. members, such as Liechtenstein, Andorra,
Kiribati and Seychelles, have populations similar to that of the
ROC's National Taiwan University (NTU) and that their annual national
budgets are even less than that of NTU, Chen asked: "What legitimate
reasons does the U.N. have to reject the ROC's entry?"</P>
      <P>With its outstanding economic achievements and smooth
democratization, Chen said, the ROC is better qualified for a U.N.
seat than many current members.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC ranks 21st in terms of population, 20th
interms of national gross product, 25th in terms of per capita
national income, 14th in terms of its annual two-way trade and third
or fourth in terms of its information-technology industry
production.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we think it's our undeniable basic right to take part
in the U.N.," Chen stressed, adding that since the U.N. is dedicated
to promoting world peace, social progress and better standards of
life under freedom, it should not have yielded to the pressure of a
repressive country like communist China to shut out Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"By launching its U.N. bid, the ROC is not making a humble plea
to the international community. It is instead lodging a painful
protest against the U.N.'s discrimination, in its capacity as a
sovereign, democratic country," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>He further said the ROC has consistently promoted its U.N. bid
with dignity and confidence to underscore the common aspiration of
Taiwan's 23 million people for international justice.</P>
      <P>Chen reaffirmed his administration's determination to continue
pushing for Taiwan's U.N. bid. He also said that even if the U.N.
denies the ROC's legitimate right to join the body, the ROC will
continue to fulfill its obligations as a member of international
society to promote world progress in various fields.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a U.N. founding member, has been shut out of the world
body since 1971, when the U.N. gave the China seat to mainland China.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of its diplomatic allies, the ROC began to
ask the U.N. six years ago to review the exceptional situation faced
by Taiwan and to work out measures to let Taiwan's voice heard in the
world body. The ROC's bid, however, has been consistently shot down
by Beijing and has failed to make the agenda of the annual U.N.
General Assembly for the past six years.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC will not be daunted by these defeats and will
continue its pursuit of a U.N. seat with courage and perseverance.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that diplomatic work needs concerted efforts of the
private and public sectors, Chen said he is hopeful that all domestic
political parties and groups will pool their wisdom and resources to
push for the ROC's U.N. bid and break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic
embargo against Taiwan.</P>

took effect immediately.</P>
      <P>Air Macau Chairman Gu Tiefei and Tsui Yung, president of the
Taipei Aviation Industry Association (TAIA), signed the accord on

      <P>Taiwan and Macau signed their first five-year air pact in 1995,
which expired at the end of last year. The two sides began to
negotiate a new accord in the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>After lengthy talks, Air Macau and the TAIA initiated a new
agreement Nov. 24, 2000 and the draft accord was recently approved by
their respective government agencies.</P>
      <P>Under the new pact, the total number of seats on Macau-Taipei and
Macau-Kaohsiung flights will increase from the previous 28,200 per

      <P>The new agreement will remain valid for five years. Air Macau and
Taiwan's EVA Airways and TransAsia Airways will jointly operate the
Taipei-Macau and Kaohsiung-Macau routes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-Macau air routes are regarded as "special" routes because
Macau is now a special administrative region under Beijing's rule and
relevant government officials from both sides took part in the
negotiations as advisers to the two intermediary bodies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight graduates from the
Fulien Primary School and three pupils of the school located at the
easternmost point of Taiwan snorkeled Saturday across a 1,000-meter
wide bay to receive their diplomas and certificates of "the brave."</P>
      <P>The children all finished the 1,000-meter bay crossing within 20
minutes and obtained their certificates from Taipei County Deputy
Magistrate Lin Wan-yi, who awaited them at the other side of the bay.</P>
      <P>Principal Chen Jui-chih, who swam with the graduates and pupils
during the bay crossing, said the special method of commencement is
aimed at "leading the children closer to the sea and encouraging them
to become more capable of making a living as seaside-residing
people." All the pupils from the primary school are from families
which make their living from fishing or aquaculture.</P>
      <P>Chen said he feels proud that under the guidance of swimming
coach Chang Feng-dah, most of the graduates of the school, weighing
an average 30 kilograms, are capable of towing alone a 100-kg
drowning person to the shore.</P>
      <P>The seaside Fulien Primary School was not the only school to hold
an unconventional commencement.</P>
      <P>The Atayal-tribe Fushan Primary School in Taipei County's
mountainous township of Wulai is scheduled to hold an exceptional
commencement Sunday in a "rite of passage or accrescence" -- a ritual
event during which 12- and 13-year-old children are taught how to
hunt, fish and weave as they become adults.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Homei Primary School in Kungliao Township on
Taiwan's northeast coast -- another seaside school -- is scheduled to
hold a sub-aqua commencement Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The graduates will dive into the sea and swim to undersea abalone
shelves where they will distribute abalone fry and other fish fry and
then swim to a marked point in the sea where their principal will be
waiting with their laminated diplomas.</P>
      <P>Baby abalone is a prime ocean crop of the Homei community, a
fishing village embraced by deep blue water in which coral reef fish
and plants are both abundant and magnificent.</P>
      <P>All the school's 110-odd children, including the 2001 graduates,
come from families supported by the fishing industry, so none are
strangers to the sea.</P>
      <P>The Homei school began to hold underwater commencements in 1999,
an exceptional graduation method initiated by Principal Lai
Lien-kung, which has been favorably received by the graduates and
their parents ever since.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the Pitou Primary School will give diplomas to its
2001 graduates, six of whom will climb the Pitou lighthouse as part
of the commencement ceremony.</P>
      <P>The lighthouse, located at the northernmost point of Taiwan
proper, was opened to the public only recently, despite having been
operational for more than 100 years.</P>
      <P>Before receiving their diplomas at the lighthouse, the graduates
will first embark on a sail boat which will take them for a short
cruise along the reef coast around the island's northernmost tip.</P>

      <P>The European Parliament (EP), the
legislative arm of the 15-member European Union (EU), has again
urged the union to set up a representative office in Taiwan,
EP sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, EP members have expressed their hope
in a resolution passed on Wednesday that they look forward to seeing
the EU open representative offices in selected countries in
Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Muslim areas to
reinforce the union's presence and status in those regions.</P>
      <P>Among Southeast Asian countries, the resolution said, the EU
should especially set up footholds in Taiwan, the EU's 14th
largest trading partner, and Singapore, the EU's 15th trading
partner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the EU passed another resolution Thursday, calling
for strengthening of EU-Asia dialogue. The resolution supports
increased engagements between South and North Korea and resumption
of regular dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In addition, the resolution demanded that the EU and its member
countries grant visas to the Republic of China president and other
senior ROC officials to enable them to make private visits to EU
countries.</P>
      <P>According to a World News Digest report on March 19, Denmark,
an EU member, has decided not to grant a visa to ROC President
Chen Shui-bian, the winner of the 2001 Prize for Freedom presented

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of scholars and lawmakers
recommended Saturday that each political party should form a "shadow
Cabinet" prior to the year-end legislative elections, to let the
public know who might be members of a new coalition government.</P>
      <P>In a seminar organized by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) think
tank the National Policy Foundation, Chinese Culture University
Political Science Department Director Yang Tai-shun pointed out that
some coalition governments in Europe actually work against democratic
principles because the people are unable to predict what the
government's makeup will be after an election.</P>
      <P>Sometimes, he added, the reality turns out to be very different
from the people's original expectations. Therefore, he suggested that
having a shadow Cabinet will help bridge the possible gap between
expectation and outcome.</P>
      <P>Predicting that none of the major parties will be able to win a
majority of the seats in the upcoming election, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Cho-shui described the forming
of a coalition government as a foregone conclusion.</P>
      <P>He said that if the DPP -- which currently holds less than
one-third of the seats in the KMT-dominated legislature -- cannot
claim a legislative majority, then "naturally" the Cabinet will have
to be formed with another party.</P>
      <P>The establishment of such a coalition government would
temporarily resolve the problem of political instability that has
been troubling the current minority government, he said.</P>
      <P>However, only when the ruling party is able to claim a two-thirds
majority can it reform the entire system, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) on Sunday urged all party members to rally behind the KMT to
avoid splintering.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng made the remarks after
reports said an alliance between President Chen Shui-bian and former
President Lee Teng-hui is forming after both attended the
inauguration of a pro-independence academic group the previous day.</P>
      <P>The presence of Lee, a former KMT chairman before stepping down
shortly after the KMT lost the presidential election in March 2000,
is widely expected to give political backing to Chen because of their
common approaches and concepts on relations across the Taiwan Strait.
Observers also say that Lee's passion for Taiwan nationalism is
another important factor in his decisions.</P>
      <P>Lee also said in his address to members of the newly formed
"North Society" that although the political landscape has changed
after the transfer of power from the KMT to the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) after the presidential election, there is
"still one who has yet to recognize the mainstream opinion of the
public."</P>
      <P>Lee stopped short of naming "the one," although it is widely
believed that he was referring to Lien Chan, current KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>Asked about a possible Lee-Chen alliance for the crucial year-end
elections, Lin said the KMT hopes its members will be calm, rational
and more tolerant in the face of developments.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he talked with Lien, who is currently visiting
France, over the phone Saturday to brief him on the domestic
political and economic situation, during which Lien expressed the
hope that all party members would show solidarity, so that those who
try to drive a wedge between KMT members would not be successful.</P>
      <P>On calls from KMT grassroots members to revoke Lee's KMT
membership because of his recent remarks, Lin said that there are
900,000-plus KMT members and every one of them is entitled to his own
view. He urged all members to be calm and rational.</P>
      <P>Asked if Lee would face disciplinary action if he decided to
stump for candidates from the ruling DPP or other political parties,
Lin said that he would not comment on speculative questions.</P>
      <P>Lin also appealed for economic and political figures to devote
more time to the nation's economy instead of politics. He said the
emphasis now should be on the quality of life for the people of
Taiwan. The issues of unification with mainland China and Taiwan
independence are not currently in the forefront, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin also asked those concerned with Taiwan's future not to let
Taiwan become engulfed in money politics, which he said would be
detrimental to Taiwan's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Lin also asked voters to make wise decisions in the year-end
elections so that qualified candidates will be elected to serve the
people.</P>

wearing a leisure shirt, picked up garbage with a pair of long tongs
along the Waishuanghsi stream, in Shihlin district, where he lives.
He also painted over graffiti on nearby walls.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the beginning of the high-profile activity, Lee said
he has always been willing to join his neighbors in cleaning up the
neighborhood around his house, adding that he hoped his participation
in the effort would inspire the public to take better care of their
neighborhood and homeland.</P>
      <P>Lee, however, brushed asides questions from journalists about his
political shift toward supporting President Chen Shui-bian and the
rift between himself and his Kuomintang (KMT) chairman successor,
Lien Chan, stressing that he would rather stick to his clean-up work
than to make political statements.</P>
      <P>Lee joined president Chen in attending the inauguration of a
pro-independence group in Taipei Saturday which fueled speculation
that Lee is breaking ranks with his party.</P>
      <P>The speculation was further boosted by Lee not inviting Taipei
City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is the highest-ranking elected public
official of the KMT, to join him in Sunday's event.</P>
      <P>Although Lee was quoted as saying that he preferred to keep the
activity a non-political one, observers interpreted it as a gesture
by Lee to distance himself from the KMT.</P>
      <P>Ma spent Sunday morning presiding over a ceremony to honor 154
elementary school students who had excelled in their studies. He said
he was not in any way offended by not being invited to the clean-up
activity. He said that his schedule was fully booked by other public
appearances on Sunday and that he could not have squeezed in the
activity.</P>
      <P>The mayor down played the political consequences of Lee's
appearance with President Chen Shui-bian at the launch of the
pro-independence group called the "North Society" Saturday, saying it
is not unusual for a former president to join his successor in public
events and the incident should not be interpreted as a rift between
Lee and the KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BIOGRAPHY OF FORMER PRESIDENT BECOMES  HIT IN JAPAN AND TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Chinese and Japanese versions of a
biography of former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui have
become hot sellers in the two countries, showing that many have an
interest in the life and times of "Mr. Democracy."</P>
      <P>Japanese historian and novelist Fuyuko Kamisaka, the author of
the book entitled "President Inside the Tiger's Mouth -- Lee Teng-hui
and Tseng Wen-hui," organized a news conference Sunday in Taipei to
thank the public, as the Chinese version of the book has hit the
best-seller list just one week after its publication.</P>
      <P>The book was originally published in Japan and later released in
Taipei. In Japan, the book went to a second printing only two weeks
after going on sale.</P>
      <P>The book, through interviews with Tseng, Lee's wife, depicts
post-war Taiwan history and the political life and times of the
former first couple.</P>
      <P>Tseng attended the news conference to congratulate Kamisaka.
Tseng said she has known Kamisaka for more than 20 years and praised
her as a good historian and writer who has won many awards in her own
country.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the book is based on fact and that Kamisaka had
visited Taiwan more than 10 times to do research.</P>
      <P>Kamisaka said that she planned to write the history of post-war
Taiwan 15 years ago, and she finally decided that the story could be
best told through the eyes of the former president and his wife.</P>
      <P>The book sold briskly when it was first released in Japan, a
phenomenon that Kamisaka attributed to the interest of the Japanese
people in Taiwan and their affection for Lee.</P>
      <P>The book was released at the time that Lee was seeking medical
treatment in Japan, a visit that caused some controversy. The
Japanese government was divided on whether to issue a visa to Lee in
the face of mainland China's strong objection. Beijing considers Lee
a separatist who does not want unification with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee's strong criticism of the Japanese government also made many
Japanese interested in reading the book, according to Kamisaka.</P>
      <P>Peng Ming-min, senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, said
that when Lee was president, he always felt strongly about leading
Taiwan toward being a modern and democratic country.</P>
      <P>Peng said that there were a number of things that Lee could not
comment on while he was president, but now he can speak more freely,
as is borne out in the book.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD URGES PARTY MEMBERS TO FACE CHALLENGES WITH CLEAR MINDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan told
party members Saturday to broaden their vision and be rational when
faced with challenges. Lien said this would be an important step for
the party in the future.</P>
      <P>In a written statement to the 12th congress of the party's Huang
Fu Hsing Committee, Lien said that he realizes that the KMT's defeat
in last year's presidential election is still painful for some and
that he understands those who have contacted him with suggestions.
Lien said he was aware of those who sought to "take strict measures
to deal with matters and people which have caused the party's loss of
power."</P>
      <P>Lien said he realizes that the request is a reflection of love by
many loyal party members but stressed that "the party authorities
must weigh the issue rationally from many aspects." He called on all
party members to face the coming challenges with a clear mind and to
leave history to make its own judgments of the party's doings.</P>
      <P>Lien said the KMT is a broad-minded party and that all party
members should be visionary and rational when challenged by
confrontation and resentment to help the party rebuild its strength.</P>
      <P>Lien is currently visiting France, the first stop of his current
"academic tour" which will also take him to London and New York.</P>
      <P>Many grassroots KMT members have demanded that party authorities
revoke the party membership of former party chairman and president
Lee Teng-hui for his recent display of support for President Chen
Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, who
defeated the KMT's Lien in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Although strong pressure to send Lee packing is coming from the
KMT's rank-and-file, no formal motion has been put forth in the Huang
Fu Hsing Committee's congress. KMT Vice Chairman Chiang
Chung-ling and Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng took part in the
gathering.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Ting Shou-chung, who also attended the congress,
said Lee's resorting to "local content" to garner public backing for
Chen goes against the present mainstream public aspirations for sound
economic development and a harmonious ethnic integration as well as a
stable social order and peaceful relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"An 80-year-old retired man is unable to decide for the people
which is the mainstream public opinion," Ting said, adding that the
KMT should deal with Lee in compliance with the party's disciplinary
rules if he causes a split within the party or stumps for candidates
of other parties in the coming elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The second leg of a long-distance run held
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to highlight Beijing's bid to host
the 2008 Olympic Games ran into trouble on Sunday in Kaohsiung with
runners being greeted by shouts of protest from a pro-independence
group.</P>
      <P>The "Beijing Olympics, Chinese pride" race, began its second leg
in Kaohsiung City Sunday morning, with fanfare rivaling the first leg
of the race in Taipei Saturday, not because of the number of runners
but because of a protest by a pro-independence group, the Taiwan
Independence Party.</P>
      <P>In addition to the dancing and singing marking the event, the
protesters contributed to the spectacle by blaring anti-Beijing
slogans through microphones near the starting line of the race and
turned the sporting event into a political show.</P>
      <P>Cordoned off from the starting line by police, the protesters
waved placards saying, "Taiwan Independence," "Opposed to one China,"
and "Why is Beijing's Olympic bid of any concern to Taiwan?" The
protesters also stamped on a Chinese flag to show their contempt for
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was also attended by players from the President
Lions professional baseball team. They signed autographs for fans and
joined hundreds of runners, including 23 from mainland China, in the
five-kilometer race.</P>
      <P>The race will next move to Shenzhen, Southern China on Monday and
seven other mainland Chinese cities afterward to demonstrate the
solidarity of Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO HELP OFFSHORE ISLANDS DEVELOP TOURISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will redefine its goal for
tourism development of offshore islands so that each of them will
have its distinctive feature, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said that they will redefine Kinmen as the epitome
of southern Fujian provincial culture and landscape and historical
sites of important battles with mainland China. Matsu will be
developed into the epitome of eastern Fujian province and as a
frontline outpost.</P>
      <P>Green Island is to be a marine and holiday center with a human
rights memorial park. Orchid Island will be a Yami tribe cultural
center and example of a rain forest. Hsiaoliuchiu will emphasize its
Liuchiu Island reef.</P>
      <P>The officials said the ministry will start planning the aspects
of transportation, accommodation, tourism packages, administrative
coordination and the work with travel operators to devise attractive
tourism packages.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials noted that offshore islands have played important
roles in the nation's defense, politics and economy over the past
decades, but their roles have diminished over tine and now they all
hope to develop tourism to stimulate their sluggish economies.</P>
      <P>They said that Kinmen and Matsu, formerly two frontline outposts
opposite the mainland, have seen stationed troops, the lifeline of
their economy, drop sharply after the government implemented the
policy of streamlining the military.</P>
      <P>Orchid Island is the hometown of the Yami tribe. Penghu, Green
Island, Hsiaoliuchiu used to be the strongholds of the fishing
industry, but their development has declined because of depleted
fishing resources.</P>
      <P>But officials noted that the offshore islands have encountered
different problems in developing tourism basically because they fail
to offer attractive tourism packages and their prices are also high,
hindering the development of tourism.</P>
      <P>They noted that Penghu is swept by strong winds all year round,
which affects tourism. They also said the supply of water and
electricity is still insufficient and the accommodation and
restaurants tend to center in Makung, but upscale hotels are limited
and the service quality is unstable. Public transportation
facilities are also lacking in Penghu.</P>
      <P>They said that Kinmen, though being defined as a frontline park,
still has much work to do to extend the whole area into a national
park.</P>
      <P>In addition, some scenic spots along the coastline are still
controlled by the military and could not be put into full use,
resulting in gaps between planning and reality.</P>
      <P>Matsu, because of its steep terrain and military needs, does not
have enough space to develop tourism. Local residents also lack the
experience in running tourism businesses.</P>
      <P>Green Island started to develop tourism a decade ago and now the
tourism industry has replaced agriculture and fishing as the lifeline
of the local economy. But the influx of tourists has posed
environmental pressures and steep competition. The supply of water
and electricity is also not sufficient to meet the needs of all the
tourists.</P>
      <P>Hsiaoliuchiu, which lies off Pingtung in southern Taiwan, is said
to have yet to reach consensus on developing tourism. Its tourism
activities are not diversified enough, and some of the public
facilities are left idle because of lack of proper management.</P>
      <P>Orchid Island has seen its infrastructure lagging. Local people
also have no confidence in the government's plan to establish a
national park and related facilities.</P>

      <P>Taiwan lags developed countries in
digitization and noticeable gaps exist between Taiwan's urban and
rural areas and between the rich and poor, the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Citing an assessment made by an international information
industry organization, the CEPD said Taiwan's spending in Internet
content technology was only 4.8 percent as a ratio to the country's
gross domestic product in 1999, far lower than 8.9 percent in the
United States and 7.1 percent in Japan posted in the same year.</P>
      <P>There is a difference of 61.3 percentage points in computer
ownership rate between Taiwan's wealthiest and the poorest families
in 1999. At the same time, differences between the two groups in
mobile phone ownership and Internet access rates also reached 67.1
percentage points and 40 percentage points, respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of urbanization, a gap of 30.8 percentage points in
family computer ownership exits between Taiwan's urban and rural
areas, while the gap in mobile phone ownership rates and Internet
access rates was 23.7 percentage points and 18.1 percentage points,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of regions, Taiwan's northern region posted the highest
ratio in family computer and mobile phone penetration rates, which
were 28.7 percentage points and 21.7 percentage points ahead of the
island's eastern region. The divide in Internet connection rates was
12.4 percentage points.</P>
      <P>To reduce the digital gaps among Taiwan's regions, the CEPD said
information industry-related infrastructure facilities and expertise
must be further upgraded on the island, in addition to a set of
comprehensive rules and systems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui clarified
Sunday that a statement made by him the previous day was not a jab at
his successor within the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>At an ceremony marking the launch of the Chinese-version of
"President Inside the Tiger's Mouth," a biography penned by Japanese
writer Fuyuko Kamisaka, Lee said when he blamed people yesterday for
being oblivious to public opinion, he is referring to "some persons"
instead of "one person."</P>
      <P>Local media quoted Lee as saying in a speech at the inauguration
of a pro-independence group Saturday that there is a person who is
still ignorant of public opinion, resisting people's desire for a
stable country and disrupting the ushering in of a new era.</P>
      <P>Lee's statement caused an uproar among the Kuomintang
rank-and-file who believed it to be a dig at their chairman, Lien
Chan, in light of Lee's previous disapproval of the party's line
under Lien. Many party members, therefore, have demanded the
expulsion of Lee from the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Lee refused to be pinned down Sunday morning by journalists. But
he apparently tried to defuse the situation by modifying his intent.</P>
      <P>The former KMT chairman has made no secret of his grievance
against Lien. In the book "President Inside the Tiger's Mouth," Lee
was quoted as blaming Lien for forcing him to step down from the job
as KMT chairman after Lien lost the presidential election, although

    <HEADLINE>ROC SEVERS DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China broke off diplomatic
relations with Macedonia Monday after the Balkan state made its
intention clear that it would establish formal ties with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Chang Siao-yue, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA), said the ROC regretted that Macedonia had decided to switch
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing and that the ROC will
immediately close its embassy in the Macedonian capital of Skopje.</P>
      <P>Chang also said the ROC will terminate all cooperation projects
with Macedonia, which are estimated to be worth more than US$140
million, and recall all its diplomatic personnel and technical
assistance experts in the country.</P>
      <P>David Lin, director of MOFA's Department of European Affairs,
summoned Vera Modanu, Macedonian charge d' affairs, to convey the
ROC's decision and its stance, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The Macedonian national flag, which flew at the entrance of the
foreign ministry in Taipei, was also removed to signify the official
severance of diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Peter Cheng, the ROC minister to Macedonia, presented an official
letter of protest to the Macedonian government in Skopje to express
the ROC's dissatisfaction over its decision.</P>
      <P>Media reports have said that Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka
Mitreva, who has insisted on an early resumption of diplomatic ties
with mainland China, arrived in Beijing Monday and would immediately
contact mainland officials on the resumption of ties.</P>
      <P>Chang said that since the formation of a coalition government in
Macedonia on May 13, the ROC learned that contacts between mainland
China and Macedonia were increasing. The foreign ministry was aware
that the situation was not favorable, but it did its best to maintain
ties as long as possible, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC embassy in Skopje will officially close and
stop all operations Monday. All personnel in the embassy will leave
Macedonia "as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>Chang said that after the severance of ties with Macedonia, the
Vatican will become the only ally of the ROC in Europe, but that the
foreign ministry will continue to promote relations with European
countries.</P>
      <P>She noted that Beijing has tried every means to squeeze the ROC
diplomatically over the years, but the ROC government and people will
continue to actively promote diplomatic ties with other countries in
a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Macedonia established diplomatic relations in January
1999. But the civil-war torn country also wants to gain mainland
China's support in dealing with ethnic Albanian rebels.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OLYMPIC FLAME TO REACH TAIWAN IF BEIJING HOSTS 2008 GAMES: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Olympic flame -- the light of
spirit, knowledge and life, and a herald of peace -- will be arranged
to be carried in Taiwan if Beijing succeeded in winning the right to
host the 2008 Olympic Games, a mainland Chinese sports official
visiting Taiwan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Che Xiangdong, deputy director of the liaison department under
Beijing's All-China Sports Federation, said Taiwan will be included
in the flame relay during the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Olympics
if Beijing hosts the Games.</P>
      <P>Che, at the head of a 23-member group of mainland Chinese
athletes in Taiwan since last week for the cross-strait "Beijing
Olympics, Chinese pride" race, made the remarks at Kaohsiung's
international airport Monday morning before leaving for Hong Kong,
where athletes from both sides of the Taiwan Strait will proceed to
Shenzhen to continue the 10-city, 15-day relay run.</P>
      <P>Soliciting support from the Taiwan public, Che said in Asia, the
Koreans and Japanese have hosted the Olympic Games, so why can't the
Chinese?</P>
      <P>A group of Taiwan athletes, led by veteran Taiwanese athlete Chi
Cheng -- who earned the nickname "the flying antelope" for breaking
records at world track and field events -- also boarded the same
plane bound for Hong Kong to join the mainland Chinese athletes to
continue the cross-strait relay run, which will take place in
Shenzhen, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, Nanjing and Qingdao
before arriving in Beijing on June 30.</P>
      <P>Some 4,000 Taipei residents joined the cross-strait athletes in a
kick-off race in Taipei Saturday to highlight Beijing's bid to host
the 2008 Games.</P>
      <P>The race was partially disrupted on Sunday in Kaohsiung by noisy
demonstrations from the Independence Party riding on their "democracy
tank," shouting, "No to China's united front," and "Oppose China's
scheme to localize Taiwan in the guise of the cross-strait relays."</P>
      <P>Cordoned off from the starting line by police, the Independence
Party activists waved placards saying, "Taiwan Independence,"
"Opposed to one China," and "Why is Beijing's Olympic bid of any
concern to Taiwan?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEVERANCE OF MACEDONIA TIES NOT TO AFFECT WORK IN EUROPE: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The severance of diplomatic ties with
Macedonia will not affect the Republic of China's diplomatic work in
Europe, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official, who preferred anonymity, made the remarks after
the MOFA formally announced the breakup of relationship with the
Balkan state which has decided to resume official ties with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The official said although some people are concerned that the
breakup of ROC-Macedonia ties would mark a serious setback to
Taiwan's efforts to expand its diplomatic frontiers, the severance
would not hinder the MOFA's work in Europe.</P>
      <P>The ROC had regarded Macedonia as a bridgehead to forge economic
and diplomatic relations with Southeastern European countries since
it established diplomatic ties with Macedonia in January 1999.</P>
      <P>"Over the past two-plus years, we have devoted much energy to
assist Macedonia in national development," the official said, adding
that the severance of bilateral ties mainly resulted from changes in
Macedonia's domestic situation, particularly its worsening ethnic
confrontation, not from any deficiencies or faults on the ROC's
part.</P>
      <P>In reality, the official said, many former Soviet-bloc countries
in eastern and southeastern Europe are fully aware of the ROC's
financial aid to Macedonia and its strenuous efforts to promote
pragmatic cooperative projects with that country.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts have achieved some results," the official
explained, adding that substantive relations between the ROC and
European countries have continued to grow in recent years.</P>
      <P>"In addition to upgrading relations with major West European
countries, we have also managed to improve our ties with
southeastern European countries in the past few years," the official
added.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the MOFA staff will not be daunted by
Macedonia's switch of diplomatic allegiance and will even redouble
efforts to break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the severance of ties with Macedonia, the ROC now has only
one diplomatic ally in Europe -- the Vatican City.</P>

      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui is scheduled to leave for the United States next Sunday to
visit his alma mater, Cornell University, sources from Lee's office
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee, who received his Ph.D. in agricultural economics in 1968
from Cornell, is visiting his alma mater mainly to attend a ceremony
marking the establishment of the Lee Teng-hui Institute for
Scientific Research in the prestigious university during his visit.</P>
      <P>Cornell also set up a Lee Teng-hui Professorship of World Affairs
in 1994 to pay tribute to Lee, then president of the ROC, using
US$2.5 million donated by Lee's friends in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to travel to Ithaca, New York via Los Angeles
June 24.</P>
      <P>This will be the second time that Lee will have visited his alma

landmark visit to the United States by any ROC head of state.</P>
      <P>In June 1995, Beijing unilaterally suspended official
cross-strait dialogue, known as the "Koo-Wang talks," which was
initiated in Singapore in late April 1993, to show Beijing's anger
with Lee's U.S. tour, which it considered as a move to promote Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>In addition to suspending the regular cross-strait dialogue,
Beijing conducted several rounds of missile tests and military

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
categorically denied Monday that the military is developing
medium-range ballistic missiles.</P>
      <P>The MND made the denial in response to a newspaper report that
the Republic of China military is secretly developing medium-range
ballistic missiles under a program code-named Tiching.</P>
      <P>"The media report is not true. The military has absolutely not
made any plans or research into this," the MND said in a press
release.</P>
      <P>The ministry stressed that news reports concerning the
development of new weaponry systems should be based on formal press
releases issued by the MND's Office of Military Spokesman or
explanations by identified MND officials.</P>
      <P>The MND also expressed regret that many recent military news
reports were sheer speculation. "As military news reports could
affect national security, public morale and the ROC's international
image, we hope that local media will refrain from giving misleading,
speculative reports on military events or arms development plans,"
the MND news release said.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation United Daily News quoted unidentified
military sources Monday that the ROC military is developing ballistic
missiles with a range of 1,000-2,000 kilometer for defensive purposes
in the face of mainland China's growing military threat. Mainland

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS NOT SURPRISED BY SEVERANCE OF ROC-MACEDONIA TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators across the party spectrum said
Monday that they are not surprised by the severing of diplomatic ties
between the Republic of China and Macedonia as the basis for both
nations to establish ties was "shaky" from the start.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said that he was not optimistic about the diplomatic relations
between the ROC and Macedonia since the two established ties in
January 1999, especially because Macedonia has been torn by civil
war.</P>
      <P>The Balkan nation will naturally tilt toward mainland China
diplomatically because it needs its support in the United Nations for
sending peacekeeping forces to the nation to help it deal with ethnic
Albanian rebels, Chai said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spends around
NT$13.7 billion (US$400.58 million), or half of its budget, to assist
more than 20 allies, and urged the government to rethink its
diplomatic policy, especially given mainland China's growing economic
might.</P>
      <P>His colleague Lin Feng-hsi of the DPP said that though the ROC
made last-ditch efforts to salvage its diplomatic relations with
Macedonia, the severance of ties was inevitable, adding that the
public should try to understand the situation.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), People First
Party (PFP), and New Party urged the government not to engage in
"money diplomacy" in a bid to increase the "number of the allies,"
which currently stands at 28 after severing ties with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Sen-zong of the KMT said that it is unfortunate to
sever ties with Macedonia and expressed the hope that the ruling DPP
government would continue to make efforts to cement ties with allies.</P>
      <P>Another KMT legislator, Lee Shang-ren, said it is right for the
foreign ministry to take the preemptive move by announcing the
severance of diplomatic ties after media reports said that Macedonian
Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva had arrived in mainland China Monday
for talks with mainland officials.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC will at least maintain its national dignity,
adding that if Taiwan had not done so, it would lose esteem in the
eyes of other nations.</P>
      <P>He said that the government should not let other countries make
irrational requests for assistance, and that the foreign ministry
should also do what it can to have the aid money given to Macedonia
returned.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the PFP said that it was predictable 
that the two countries would sever ties sooner or later. He also
said that it is right for the foreign ministry to take the initiative
to announce the breaking up of ties.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the focus of diplomatic works should be exchanges
between nations, and "the increase in the number of allies" should
not be the focus of the efforts.</P>
      <P>Legislator Levi C. Ying of the New Party said that it is time to
review the necessity to keep the number of diplomatic allies for the
sake of "vanity," especially at a time when Taiwan is not as rich as
it used to be.</P>

      <P>Taipei, June 18 (CNA): Athletes from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait have put aside political differences and are holding a
long-distance race on Taiwan and China that has been put off since
1997.</P>
      <P>Taiwan runners headed to the city of Shenzhen in mainland China
Monday to continue the 10-leg run which is highlighting Beijing's bid
to host the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Initiated by Chi Cheng, bronze medal winner in the 80-meter low
hurdles in the 1968 Mexico Olympics and currently board chairman of
the Hope Culture and Education Foundation, the long-distance run is
considered a gesture of brotherhood aimed at creating a more friendly
atmosphere for cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Since the Olympic committees in Taipei and Beijing first reached
an agreement in 1989 to promote exchanges under the framework of the
International Olympic Committee, athletes, coaches, referees and
sports officials from Taiwan have made 60,000 visits to mainland
China. However, visits to Taiwan by their mainland counterparts were
less than 3,000 in 12 years.</P>
      <P>Frequent exchanges have helped promote understanding and
cooperation between sports officials and athletes, but the atmosphere
of cooperation is still overshadowed by ideological conflicts.</P>
      <P>In many international events, political confrontation has been
obvious as Taiwan's sports officials and athletes were not granted
the same privileges as other participants, and Taiwan has been forced
to compete under the name Chinese-Taipei -- a name satisfactory to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait tensions have interrupted what should have been
non-political sports exchanges in the past. The long-distance run on
both sides of the Strait, for example, was first held in 1992 and
participant and organizers hoped the run could be held every year.
The second run was held in 1993, but no subsequent events were held
until 1997. The third run was held that year, but political
disagreements again spilled over into the exchanges and the run was
suspended until this year.</P>
      <P>After 1997, no event was planned because cross-strait relations
had turned sour with former President Lee Teng-hui pronouncing his
"state-to-state" model for China-Taiwan relations. Beijing finally
agreed to holding the recent race after the name of the run was
proposed as "Beijing Olympics, Chinese pride."</P>
      <P>Sports officials and coaches have been willing to put aside
political considerations and are well aware of the prowess of China's
athletes. Taiwan coaches in weightlifting, basketball and swimming
have taken their athletes to mainland China for training. Some
athletes in gymnastics have even paid their own way to continue
training on the mainland.</P>
      <P>As baseball is becoming more popular in mainland China, some
professional baseballers in Taiwan are looking for opportunities on
the other side of the Strait.</P>
      <P>A group of mainland sports officials visited Taipei in early May
to attend the fourth cross-strait sports exchange symposium. A
memorandum of agreement was signed and both sides are looking forward
to improving the political atmosphere.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. URGED TO PLAY MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday it is
a common hope of the 23 million people of Taiwan that the United
States will play a more active role in relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the United States will play the role of a
stabilizer, balancer, peace messenger and mediator in cross-strait
relations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China president made the remarks while meeting
with John L. Holden, president of the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations, a non-profit private American organization
dedicated to promoting U.S. exchanges with Taiwan, mainland China and
Hong Kong. Holden is currently on a visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen, who took office in the ROC's first-ever democratic transfer
of power between different political parties in May 2000, said a
democratic Taiwan would certainly contribute to Taiwan Strait peace
and Asia-Pacific stability.</P>
      <P>Likewise, Chen said, a democratic mainland China would also be
conducive to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the entire
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has become an open, pluralistic, democratic society,
Chen said, mainland China still has a long way to go to
democratization.</P>
      <P>Noting that democracy means respecting the people's choice, Chen
said the people of Taiwan have every legitimate right to decide
whether to accept the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems"
unification scheme.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guest that both incumbent U.S. President George W.
Bush and his predecessor, Bill Clinton, have said Taiwan's future and
any change to its status quo must respect the free choice of the
people of Taiwan. "This is a manifestation of democracy," he noted.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he continued, it is not up to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, but rather up to the people of Taiwan, to
decide whether the "one country, two systems" would be an acceptable
unification scheme.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has on numerous occasions extended olive branches to
mainland China since his inauguration more than a year ago. "We
absolutely do not want to see cross-strait relations become a
zero-sum game," he stressed.</P>
      <P>In his view, he said, one of the most important obstacles to a
resumption of cross-strait dialogue lies in a lack of mutual trust.
"Without dialogue, the two sides lack mutual understanding and even
have many mutual misunderstandings," he went on.</P>
      <P>With a view to minimizing misunderstandings and forging
rapprochement, Chen said, the two sides should sit down to talk on
every topic of mutual concern and interest. "Only by so doing can we
break the lingering cross-strait political limbo," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS, TRAVEL INDUSTRY QUESTION PREMIER'S PLEDGE ON TOURISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators, scholars and
tourism industry representatives at a Monday seminar questioned the
likelihood of opening up Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists by July
as Premier Chang Chun-hsiung pledged last year.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang legislator Ting Shou-chung noted that the
government has yet to complete any preparations for receiving
mainland tourists and has so far failed to set up related measures
such as visa regulations.</P>
      <P>Instead, he charged, the government is using the possibility of
opening up tourism to mainland China as a bargaining chip, which he
said might not be enough incentive for mainland China to allow its
people to visit.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party legislator Lai Shyh-bao urged both sides of
the Taiwan Strait to "give up their ideologies" and truly consider
the benefits of opening up exchanges between the two peoples.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-han, vice chairman of the Chinese Cross-Strait Travel
Association, which was set up in 1999 by over 100 local travel
agencies to promote bilateral private-sector exchanges, said that
many of the related measures and details must be worked out through
dialogue.</P>
      <P>He added that because he believes the two sides show no signs of
resuming negotiations, Chang's pledge to open up Taiwan to mainland
tourists is "certain" to fizzle.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that although would-be mainland tourists are
curious about such local scenic spots as Sun Moon Lake and Mount Ali,
they still cannot compare in terms of vista to some of the more
famous scenic areas in mainland China. He warned that if the tourists
are disappointed by what they see in Taiwan and go home to tell about
it, the consequences will be "serious."</P>
      <P>Therefore, he recommended that Taiwan should focus on presenting
"sightseeing spots" such as modernized farms and the National Palace
Museum instead.</P>
      <P>Wang also noted that the cost of a seven- to 10-day visit in
Taiwan would be around US$2,000, which is about US$1,000 more than
mainland tourists are used to spending elsewhere in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih Hsin University Department of Tourism Director
Chen Szu-lun urged the domestic travel industry to plan for the long
term because the island's current tourism resources can only attract
mainland visitors in the short run.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate is expected
to hit a record high in May, despite government measures to increase
the number of temporary contract workers in local government
administrations.</P>
      <P>Preliminary figures compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that the jobless rate
could break the 3.96 percent high posted in April.</P>
      <P>A DGBAS official attributed the rise to seasonal reasons, such as
the large number of new graduates entering the job market, coupled
with declining export orders and a reduction in the growth of both
exports and imports.</P>
      <P>Although the government has worked out programs to stimulate
domestic demand, the official said, most of the programs are not yet
implemented and will not help reduce the number of people out of a
job in May.</P>
      <P>The unemployment figure is not expected to dip until the economy
turns around, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR FREE TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the Republic of China will continue to support free international
trade and further boost bilateral commercial exchanges with countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a keynote speech delivered at the
opening of the 46th World Congress of the International Council of
Small Businesses (ICSB).</P>
      <P>Chen said it is of great significance that the 46-year-old ICSB
is holding its first world congress of the 21st century in Taiwan,
where small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of
the economy.</P>
      <P>Noting that SMEs in both advanced and developing countries have
grown rapidly since the 1980s, Chen said SMEs have become an
important integral part of the global economy.</P>
      <P>In the past few decades, Chen said, SMEs have contributed greatly
to tax revenue increases, job openings, technological innovation and
production value. "All these are common features of economic
development in the United States, Germany, Italy and Taiwan in recent
decades," he observed.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to point out that the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis
allowed the world to better understand the advantages of SME-driven
economies.</P>
      <P>In comparison with other Asian countries, Chen said, Taiwan
emerged relatively unscathed from the crisis. "As adaptability,
flexibility and competitiveness are critical to the survival of SMEs,
the SME-driven Taiwan economy has been more adaptable to the changing
climate and more capable of coping with adversity," he noted.</P>
      <P>With the arrival of the knowledge-based economy, Chen said,
innovation is crucial not only to industry and corporations but also
to individuals.</P>
      <P>"To a certain extent, innovation and learning have become an
equivalent to corporate growth," Chen said, adding that while the new
trend has posed great challenges to SMEs, it has also offered them
opportunities to "march toward yet another peak."</P>
      <P>As SMEs will continue to play a pivotal role in future economic
development, Chen said the ROC government has updated its regulations
to assist SMEs in upgrading their production and management, and has
joined forces with local governments to improve services to SMEs.</P>
      <P>Stressing that market opening is essential to SME development,
Chen said the ROC will never waver in its support for free trade and
market liberalization.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the ROC has been endeavoring to offer SMEs
easier access to major technological research and development
programs to facilitate their innovation and upgrading of
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration has also made "investment, the
economy and Taiwan's well-being" its three top policy goals and is
determined to do its utmost to attract investment to create more jobs
and revitalize the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Chen further encouraged the 500-plus SME executives, policymakers
and scholars from 50-odd countries around the world to present their
valuable opinions on future SME challenges and development strategies
during the four-day ICSB congress.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The suspension of diplomatic relations
between the Republic of China and Macedonia will not affect the ROC's
efforts to improve relations with European countries, an official
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The remark followed an earlier MOFA announcement that the ROC had
suspended diplomatic relations with Macedonia, although Skopje and
Beijing had still not yet normalized relations.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA official, all the nations of Europe are
well aware that the ROC has strived to help Macedonia, so the cutting
of ties will not affect the ROC's efforts to improve its relations
elsewhere in Europe.</P>
      <P>Taipei established diplomatic relations with Skopje Jan. 27,
1999, making Macedonia not only the ROC's second diplomatic ally in
the European region but also a bridgehead for the ROC to expand its
diplomatic and economic relations with the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that relations between the ROC and
European nations have improved very much during the past few years
and added that in addition to upgrading its relations with major West
European nations, relations with East European nations have also
improved.</P>
      <P>He said that all the cooperation projects the ROC has implemented
in Macedonia in the past two-and-a-half years have yielded some
effects in East European countries, which he said indicates that the
suspension of Taipei-Skopje relations was not because "we did not do
well in Macedonia."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Noted Chinese-American forensic scientist
Dr. Henry Lee examined Monday the remains of a Taiwan couple who were
murdered more than a decade ago.</P>
      <P>Lee examined the bodies of Wu Ming-han and his wife at the
Institute of Forensic Medicine under the Ministry of Justice with a
view to helping solve a controversial criminal case.</P>
      <P>Lee, who retired from the post of commissioner of the Public
Safety Department of the U.S. Connecticut State Government last year,
told a press conference after preliminary examinations that Wu's
skull had more than 10 knife wounds.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the wounds were left by the same knife or several
different knives, Lee said he would need to conduct a further
microscopic examination before arriving at a conclusion in that
regard.</P>
      <P>Lee also said he would need to examine the knife or knives
allegedly used in the murder of the Wus to determine whether there
was any correlation between the tool and the wounds on the bodies.</P>
      <P>"Without the alleged murder weapon or weapons, I couldn't draw
any conclusion simply by examining the remains of the murdered
couple," Lee explained, adding that if necessary, he would be willing
to assist in solving the riddle surrounding the couple's tragic
deaths.</P>
      <P>Lee arrived in Taipei Sunday at the invitation of the Institute
of Forensic Medicine, which had been asked by the Taiwan High Court
to examine the remains.</P>
      <P>Three men were convicted of murdering the Wus and were given
death penalties by the Supreme Court. On the trio's special petition,
the Supreme Court ordered the Taiwan High Court to re-try the case
last May upon the revelation that the police may have used torture to
elicit confessions, while the case itself is widely regarded to have
been built on the flimsiest of circumstantial evidence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, military sources said Monday that the military has
uncovered a kitchen knife which was allegedly used in the murder of
the couple at their home in Hsichi, Taipei County.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China
said Monday that the two sides should communicate more instead of
maintaining the current stalemate, and talk more about substantial
issues than prerequisites to resuming stalled dialogue.</P>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu said at an
SEF board of trustees meeting that leaders in both Taipei and Beijing
must develop greater vision and more rational attitudes if a
breakthrough is to be achieved.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a semi-official organization that is empowered by the
government to handle relations with mainland China in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Koo said that President Chen Shui-bian has already stressed
numerous times the importance of resuming dialogue on the
normalization of bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>However, he lamented that not only have relations failed to
improve, greater competition in the diplomatic arena and the
ever-changing international situation have made them more complicated
and worrisome than ever.</P>
      <P>Just as mainland China was able to achieve formidable
achievements in economic growth over the past 20 years because it set
aside the "shackles of ideology" and made conscientious efforts to
face the issues that came up, so can cross-strait relations improve
in the same manner, Koo said.</P>
      <P>Because that improvement cannot possibly be based on military
intimidation or diplomatic embargoes, he continued, the two sides
should focus on greater communication as well as substantial issues
in order to gradually build up mutual trust.</P>
      <P>He added that just as the rest of the world is pursuing peace and
security and taking up negotiation in place of confrontation, Taipei
and Beijing -- despite their differences -- are no different when it

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Lien Chan of the Kuomintang
(KMT), the Republic of China's largest opposition party, said here
Sunday that his party will never deviate from its
"middle-of-the-road" policy.</P>
      <P>Lien, who arrived in New York from Paris that afternoon for a
private visit, made the remarks at a dinner given in his honor by
supporters in the local Chinese community.</P>
      <P>Lien told about 1,000 Chinese community representatives that the
107-year-old KMT is "a broad-based party dedicated to developing
Taiwan into a humane, secure and refined society."</P>
      <P>"The KMT will continue its efforts to promote ethnic harmony in
Taiwan and will unswervingly oppose any attempt to instigate or
aggravate ethnic confrontation," Lien said.</P>
      <P>He further stressed that the KMT will reach out to the grassroots
people to win their hearts and minds with its devoted services and
forward-looking policy proposals.</P>
      <P>Lien, also a former ROC vice president, noted that many countries
around the world have been troubled by religious, regional or ethnic
conflicts due to misjudgments of the situation.</P>
      <P>"Their erroneous judgments have also resulted in retrogression of
their democratic developments," Lien said, adding that he would not
want to see such a scenario in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The KMT ruled Taiwan for more than 50 years until it lost to the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the presidential election of
March 2000, although it still controls a comfortable majority in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lien criticized the current DPP government for what he said is
its failure to respect the ROC constitutional system and normal party
political principles.</P>
      <P>"The minority DPP government's failure to respect constitutional
provisions concerning Cabinet formation and operations has resulted
in domestic political chaos and has hindered Taiwan's economic
recovery," Lien lamented.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TRYING TO REVIVE TAIWAN'S AGRICULTURE VIA STRATEGIC ALLIANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The local agricultural sector has been
riding a tidal wave of strategic alliances within the sector since
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture Chairman Chen Hsi-huang
advocated reviving Taiwan's agriculture through such alliances.</P>
      <P>A COA official said that although such alliances were common in
the earlier days of the Republic of China, most of the agricultural
sector has neglected the essential knowledge needed to create
strategic alliances.</P>
      <P>The ideal stems, he went on, from the concept of the
"post-industrialized society" advocated by sociologist Daniel Bell in
the 1970s, who described how Western economically developed countries
employed the service industry to boost the production industry.</P>
      <P>According to Chi Schive, dean of Taiwan's Institute of Financial
Research and Training, the post-industrialized society was based on
"knowledge" and "creation value." He added that human society
developed from agricultural society, to industrialized society,
computerized society and to the current stage of "knowledge-based"
society.</P>
      <P>Agricultural society uses the land to produce small quantities of
agricultural products, while knowledge-based society uses ideas and
creative concepts to produce many products, said Schive.</P>
      <P>Creation plays a very important role in the development process
of the knowledge-based society, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan is now transforming into a
knowledge-based society and that the country's agricultural and
manufacturing sectors have yielded to pressure resulting from
entering into the "post-industrialized society."</P>
      <P>As a result, the unemployment rate in both the agricultural and
manufacturing sectors have soared to record highs, he went on, adding
that the COA is trying to help the farming sector transfer to new
industry so as to "avoid being eliminated."</P>
      <P>He expressed regret that the farming industry has generally
failed to capture the "real meaning" of the agricultural strategic
alliance.</P>
      <P>Lee Chien-chuan, deputy chairman of the COA, said that the local
farming sector does not understand the true meaning of the
agricultural strategic alliance, believing instead that agricultural
strategic alliances connect local farming associations.</P>
      <P>He described the real meaning of an agricultural alliance as
connecting farmers with consumers through the marketing system, using
standardized packaging, administration and classification.</P>
      <P>Lee added that out-dated thinking in the agriculture sector will
hinder the development of such an alliance.</P>
      <P>Noting that the mission of the COA is to build an agricultural
image for Taiwan but not to build a localized ideology for local
farming products, Lee said that the government should implement a
complete set of regulations to govern the sanitation, quality and
pesticide control of the nation's farm products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Schive called on the government agencies concerned to
take measures to help farmers move into other industries to cope with
the impact of Taiwan's imminent World Trade Organization entry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN ASKS FOR EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Executive Yuan
formally asked President Chen Shui-bian Monday to request the
Legislative Yuan to convene an extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>The request, delivered to the Presidential Office, capped two
weeks of political wrangling between the ruling and opposition
parties over whether a special session is necessary and which bills
should be put on its agenda.</P>
      <P>Su Tzen-ping, director-general of the Government Information
Office, said the request was submitted to the president after Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung spoke to Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
to put the final touches to an understanding that six finance-related
bills will be debated during the special session.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan had originally listed the passage of 18 bills
as badly needed in order to streamline the country's financial
market, but negotiations between the political parties at the
legislature saw the list whittled down to six bills.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary session, slated to take place from June 27-28,
will be preceded by a social gathering of lawmakers on June 26, when
they are supposed to exchange views on how to proceed with the
session debates.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution, the country's lawmakers gather for two
regular sessions each year, one which lasts from February to May and
the other from September to December. Extraordinary sessions might be
held at the request of the president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO HELP FARMERS ENTER SERVICE INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan  County,  southern  Taiwan,  June  18 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of
Agriculture (COA) plans to earmark an annual budget of NT$900 million
to assist 10,000 farmers each year to transfer to the service
industry.</P>
      <P>The plan has been drawn up in a bid to cope with the impact on
domestic agriculture of Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), according to an agriculture official.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-pin of the Farmers Service Department under the COA,
said the council will first pass a "one
agricultural-and-fishery-based recreation park per township" plan for
30-40 townships within the year to integrate agricultural and fishery
industries, recreational facilities, cultural activities and scenic
spots in specially constructed parks.</P>
      <P>Besides coping with the impact of Taiwan's WTO entry on domestic
agriculture, the plan is also designed to help farmers create a
"second channel" of income, Chen added. Taiwan's farmers are expected
to be particularly hard-hit when WTO membership forces the government
to reduce tariffs and open its market to foreign agricultural
products.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung asked the Council
of Agriculture to make all necessary preparations in the run-up to
the accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) as Taiwan is very
likely to join the world trade regulatory body this November.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while on an inspection tour of the
council Tuesday, adding that WTO entry will have a significant impact
on farmers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the council will have to work closely with the farmers
and keep in close communication with them so that both could
face the challenges ahead together.</P>
      <P>The premier also said the impact on Taiwan of agricultural
products smuggling will be as great as the smuggling of guns and
drugs, and that the council must find a way to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said that as this is the rainy season, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and the council should take measures to
guard against possible mudslides, especially in areas affected by the
September 1999 earthquake in central Taiwan that killed over 2,000
people.</P>
      <P>The premier also touched on the reforms of farmers associations,
adding that he hopes related regulations of financial rehabilitation
funds can be cleared in an extraordinary meeting of the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The establishment and the management of the fund will help write
off the mounting bad loans in Taiwan's financial institutions,
especially in the grassroots institutions, such as the farmers

      <P>Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang
Yung-ching said Tuesday that Taiwan should accept mainland China's
"one China" principle out of consideration for its mutual benefits at
this critical moment of development for the entire Chinese race.</P>
      <P>One of Taiwan's wealthiest and most influential entrepreneurs,
Wang said at a seminar on biotechnology and health care that there is
no hatred between Taiwan and mainland China, and that both sides of
the Taiwan Strait should treat each other with parity as both come
from the same roots.</P>
      <P>Wang warned that with the economic gloom and rising unemployment
facing Taiwan today in part due to the mass migration of local
manufacturers to the more production-friendly mainland China, the
future for Taiwan lies in biotechnology -- but only if the system is
sound and the political environmental is stable.</P>
      <P>He said that the current social disorder and political problems
are even worse than the corruption of the Kuomintang era 40 years
ago, when Taiwan began receiving aid from the United States that
helped develop a local industrial base.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Republic of China citizens
support the proposal to add the word "Taiwan" to ROC passports to
distinguish them from the PRC's, according to the results of an
opinion poll released Tuesday by a government agency.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
publicized the results of the June 5-6 survey after President Chen
Shui-bian said Monday that the proposal would certainly be
implemented because it has received majority popular support.</P>
      <P>The commission's survey of 1,068 randomly selected adult
residents found that 52.8 percent of the respondents were either
"very supportive" or "supportive" of the proposal to add "Taiwan" at
the end of the ROC's English national title printed on the cover of
the passport to avoid confusion with mainland China's national tile,
"People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>In contrast, 45.7 percent gave a thumbs-down to the proposal,
with 22.4 percent voicing strong opposition.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey findings, commission officials said the
president's decision to go ahead with the proposed addition of the
word "Taiwan" to the ROC passport is not unfounded.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 60 percent of the respondents to a similar poll
conducted by the mass-circulation United Daily News earlier this
month also supported the proposal.</P>
      <P>A recent telephone survey by TVBS cable television company also
found that 56 percent of those interviewed gave a thumbs-up to the
proposal.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the pro-unification opposition New
Party, however, voiced strong opposition to the proposal, claiming
that the move was a trick to signify pro-independence sentiments.</P>
      <P>Levi C. Ying, the New Party legislative whip, told a news
conference that if the Cabinet and the Presidential Office insist on
putting the proposal into effect, the New Party would take every
possible measure to block its implementation.</P>
      <P>"The measures could include demanding the minister of foreign
affairs to deliver a report to the Legislative Yuan, boycotting the
passage of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget plan and seeking a
constitutional interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices," Ying
explained.</P>
      <P>Other New Party legislators, including Elmer Fung and Cheng
Lung-shui, echoed Ying's views at the news conference, alleging that
the proposed addition of "Taiwan" to the ROC's English national title
would be tantamount to changing the country' formal designation and
in stark violation of the ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>They urged the president to refrain from triggering a new round
of debate on the sensitive "independence or unification" issue at
this time of domestic economic hardship.</P>

      <P>The president noted that the two nations have always maintained
close and solid relations, adding that Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman visited the ROC for Chen's inaugural ceremony in May 2000, and
that Chen had led a delegation to visit Nicaragua in August 2000.</P>

address Taiwan's current economic woes.</P>
      <P>According to the commission's telephone survey of 1,068 adult

provoking Beijing; Taiwan would never be a pawn in any country's

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ANALYST ADVOCATES REFUSING NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS FOR CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned American expert on China
Monday urged the U.S. Congress not to grant Communist China permanent
normal trade relations.
 Steve Mosher, who was the first U.S. social scientist to
study in rural mainland China, stressed that "one of the best ways
for America to help Beijing prepare for war with the U.S. and Taiwan
and continue to wage war against its own people, is to renew normal
trade relations with China."</P>
      <P>"Despite prompts from President George W. Bush to renew normal
trade relations with China, the U.S. Congress must have the courage
to do otherwise," said Mosher, president of the Population Research
Institute, an organization dedicated to ending human rights abuses in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mosher pointed out that a prevalent misconception, promoted by
those who rely heavily on Beijing and foreign investment in mainland
China, is that economic prosperity accomplished through free trade
will usher in a new age of democracy in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"This paradigm may hold true in a democracy, but in China the
exact opposite is happening. The sad fact is that under Beijing's
one-party dictatorship, democratic freedoms have never and will never
follow on the heels of free trade," he said.</P>
      <P>Mosher also warned that "China is currently expanding the range
of its autocratic reach both internally and abroad. Funding for
China's hegemonic expansion comes from foreign trade.</P>
      <P>"Without normal trade relations, Beijing's commitment to a
unilateral military buildup, and to strengthening domestic campaigns
which violate the basic human rights of the people of China, simply
would not be possible," he said.</P>
      <P>Mosher urged the U.S. Congress to oppose normal trade relations
with Communist China, all Americans to boycott goods made in mainland
China, and foreign investors to pull out of the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURE MAY NEED NT$ 120 BILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING AFTER WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, June 19 (CNA): The Executive Yuan needs to set aside
NT$120 billion in its budget planning for the next four years to
restructure the agricultural sector after Taiwan enters the World
Trade Organization (WTO), said Chen Hsi-huang, chairman of the
Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>As the agricultural sector may be one of the hardest hit sectors,
the agricultural official said that the Cabinet is required to use
its reserve fund to help farmers to endure the impact if membership
in the world trading body is realized before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In the next three budget years, he suggested that NT$30 billion
should be set aside each year as compensation to farmers whose
operations have succumbed to lower-priced imports.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung told the Council of Agriculture to
prepare Taiwan's agricultural sector for the impact WTO membership
will have on Taiwan. All member states of the WTO are required to
liberalize their markets and to lift both tariff and non-tariff
barriers. He said that Taiwan is likely to be admitted to the WTO
this November.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang declined make any promises regarding financial
support, but emphasized that it was important for the government to
keep open communication channels with the agricultural sector, and
farmers personally, to that they would be clear on government policy.</P>
      <P>Together with the Board of Foreign Trade and agricultural
associations, the council has organized a series of symposiums for
farmers to advise them of the government's measures to minimize the
loss to the local agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>An agricultural official estimates that the impact of the WTO may
danger the livelihood of some 10,000 farmers. An urgent task is to
provide vocational training to those in farming so that they may find
employment in other sectors should they be forced out of their
current profession.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture has set aside NT$900 million from its
fiscal 2000 budget for job training programs for farmers. However,
the restructuring program will not be easy, considering the high
percentage of elderly in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>A report by the Council of Agriculture shows that more than 30
percent of the operators of small farms are over 65, and senior
citizens account for 14 percent of the overall agricultural
population.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIAN AVIATION AUTHORITIES SUSPEND CHARTERED FLIGHTS TO BALI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines will suspend its charter
flights to Bali, Indonesia starting June 21 after negotiations over
aviation rights between the Republic of China and Indonesia hit a
snag, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines had received approval in February for the
chartered service between Kaohsiung, in southern Taiwan, and Bali,
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>But the CAA said that as talks with its Indonesian counterpart
hit turbulence, flights were to have been stopped from July 1.
However, Indonesia notified Mandarin Airlines on Monday that air
routes were decided on a case-by-case basis and that Mandarin would
have to cancel its service earlier than the original deadline.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines had been notified in May that starting from
July, chartered plane service would no longer be approved.</P>
      <P>The CAA said that Indonesia had agreed to allow Taiwan's China
Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways to fly the Taiwan-Bali route while
with chartered flights by another two Taiwan airlines, -- Mandarin
Airlines and UNI Airways Corp. On the other hand, two Indonesian
airlines have cooperated with CAL and EVA by sharing their flights.</P>
      <P>UNI Airways, however, said that their two flights every week have
not been affected.</P>
      <P>The CAA said that negotiations broke down mainly because its
Indonesian counterpart wants to half the number of flights by Taiwan
and scrap the current cooperation system and approve two Indonesian
airlines with a smaller passenger capacity to fly the routes.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between Mandarin and the Indonesian aviation
authorities are expected to resume in August. Regular flights between
the two countries remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sudden cancellation of Mandarin's chartered
service to Bali has caused complaints by travel agents in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The travel agents said that they were given short notice that
service would be canceled on June 21 and that this is not enough time
to adequately reorganize tours to Bali. They also say that if the
tours are called off, they stand to lose double the money they
were paid by passengers for the trips due to compensation to them.</P>
      <P>In a meeting between Kaohsiung travel agents and Mandarin
Airlines representatives, Mandarin Airlines official Chen Hung-ta
stressed that after being notified in May that its Kaohsiung-Bali
flight would be suspended, it has made every effort to strike a deal
with the Indonesian authorities. But Mandarin Airlines officials say
that they were caught by surprise by the sudden change.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the airlines is also a victim, and that canceling
the route has cost the company money and made many customers unhappy.
The airline will work on alternative flight options and will
distribute a coupon worth NT$3,000 to other southeast Asian
destinations for those affected by the cancellation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FM HOPES DIPLOMACY CAN BE TOPIC FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao
said Tuesday that the Republic of China will not be daunted by
mainland China's endless diplomatic offensive against it and hopes
that diplomacy can be a topic for future bilateral talks.</P>
      <P>Tien made the remarks during a tea party with a group of
reporters covering diplomatic affairs. It was also the first time
that Tien has met the press since the ROC announced the breakup of
its diplomatic ties with Macedonia Monday.</P>
      <P>The minister said the ROC took the initiative to sever diplomatic
relations with Macedonia mainly to maintain its national dignity and
sovereign status.</P>
      <P>In the face of "various inevitables," Tien said, the ROC could
not sit idly by to await "insults by other people."</P>
      <P>Tien further said that even though mainland China has never
hesitated to block the ROC's "breathing space" in the international
community, the ROC would never be daunted by the mainland's
diplomatic embargo.</P>
      <P>"We'll face all challenges bravely," Tien said, adding that so
long as opportunities present themselves, the ROC will never miss a
chance to forge diplomatic ties with other countries.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tien said he still hopes that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can sit down to talk on a range of topics of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>"Certainly, we hope that diplomatic issues can be included on the
agenda for future cross-strait talks," he explained.</P>
      <P>Touching on the choice of new diplomatic allies, Tien said the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will review "relevant
qualifications" of prospective candidates more carefully in the
future, particularly their domestic political stability, their
strategic importance in regional geopolitics and the cost the ROC
would have to pay for diplomatic recognition.</P>
      <P>In view of Taiwan's economic slowdown and its people's increasing
concern about financial aid to other countries, Tien said, MOFA will
also exercise more prudence in committing aid to prospective
diplomatic allies. "We'll make commitments in proportion to our own
financial resources," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that humanitarian aid and economic assistance remain
essential to maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan's allies,
Tien said MOFA will endeavor to make the ROC's foreign aid system and
procedures "more transparent and institutionalized."</P>
      <P>"We have sent a draft bill on international cooperation and
development to the Legislative Yuan for screening and approval with a
view to ensuring transparency, openness and institutionalization in
our foreign aid operations," Tien explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, MOFA has no intention of asking Macedonia
to repay financial aid already given by the ROC. "We have never had
such an idea," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The minister also clarified that the total amount of ROC
financial assistance to Macedonia over the past two-and-a-half years
is "not as big" as the figure reported in the press.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign aid programs are kept secret. But I want to stress
that the actual amount of our aid to Macedonia was less than the
figure speculated by the press," he said, adding that many planned
aid or cooperative programs had not been put into force. "With the
severance of diplomatic ties, our cooperative programs with Macedonia
have all been scrapped," he added.</P>
      <P>The political scientist-turned-minister was scheduled to leave
for the United States later in the day to attend a seminar on world
affairs to be held in Colorado. The seminar is being organized by the
American Enterprise Institute, a noted U.S. think tank. During the
four-day forum, both Tien and U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney will
deliver speeches at a panel session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAGAZINE EDITOR CALLS FOR U.S. TO STOP APPEASING BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should use its
foreign policy to help bring about the peaceful transformation of
Beijing's dictatorship into a democracy like the one in Taiwan,
according to a former Reagan administration official.</P>
      <P>Writing in the latest issue of the Weekly Standard,
William Kristol, publisher and editor of the conservative
magazine, said that although certain forms of U.S. engagement with
Communist China may well be justified, the goal of American foreign
policy should encourage Beijing to change peacefully from a
dictatorship to democracy.</P>
      <P>"This is a project worthy of a great power. It would require a
foreign policy of military strength, political boldness, and moral
clarity," Kristol said.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that the idea may not be endorsed by
liberal newspapers like The New York Times, which carried an
editorial "China Viewed Narrowly" last Sunday, saying the United
States needs "a realistic China policy" and "a balanced approach to
trade, diplomacy and geopolitics." The paper is worried that the Bush
administration has been focusing too much on military issues rather
than keeping them in perspective.</P>
      <P>Kristol said the New York Times would prefer that military issues
not impede "active engagement with China on economic and arms control
issues." But Beijing routinely agrees to and then routinely breaks
various nonproliferation agreements. And the former is something the
Bush administration is already pursuing vigorously, and apparently
successfully, with the completion of negotiations for Beijing's
accession to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>"It's hard to see what the Times is fretting about -- except that
we have not yet subordinated U.S. foreign policy in its entirety to
the goal of making the Chinese dictators blissfully happy," wrote the
former professor of politics at the University of Pennsylvania and
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.</P>
      <P>Kristol said, "That's the point. The Times, to be fair, is
faithfully echoing the American business and foreign policy
establishments. They don't simply want a policy of economic
engagement. They want us to avoid any activities in the strategic,
political, or diplomatic spheres that might offend Beijing.</P>
      <P>"So economic engagement becomes an excuse for appeasement. We
accede to Beijing's wishes and limit our contacts with democratic
Taiwan. We don't make a fuss about the detention of American
citizens. We turn a blind eye to Beijing's weapons proliferation
abroad and human rights abuses at home," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT COMPETITION TO GET FIERCER: SEF OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait will
enter an era of "structural competition" and their competition will
become increasingly intense in the future, an official with the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin made the remarks
during a seminar on cross-strait peace, organized by the Peacetime
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Yen's comments followed SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu's statement on
Monday that he was worried that cross-strait relations have become
even more complicated and delicate. Koo is the ROC's top negotiator
with mainland China in the absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>Yen pointed out that both cross-strait relations and the general
international strategic environment are at a critical juncture of
structural changes.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Yen said, cross-strait relations would
increasingly be characterized by mutual "structural competition."</P>
      <P>"At present, cross-strait relations are in a state of steady
change. Once they enter the era of 'structural competition,' their
race in economic, social and political reforms as well as social
order would become ever fiercer," Yen said, adding that the people
of Taiwan should face this reality in long-term cross-strait
interaction.</P>
      <P>Yen stressed that Taiwan hopes both sides of the Taiwan Strait
can develop and grow in a peaceful environment. "We hope to keep
dynamic balance in cross-strait interaction," he added.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yen said that as a small peace-loving power, Taiwan
must understand how international powers or super powers operate.
"We must pay prices, must have strategy and prudently deal
with variables and invariable in cross-strait ties from a
pragmatic angle."</P>
      <P>Yen outlined three conditions for future peaceful cross-strait
competition -- continued dialogue to minimize misjudgments;
willingness to accept open-ended evolution of their relations;
and dynamic balance of military developments on the two sides.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Legislator Chien Hsi-kai of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said he earnestly hopes that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can sign a peace agreement by
2008.</P>
      <P>Chien, also chief executive of the Peacetime Foundation, said
as Beijing is seeking the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games,
now is a good time to promote the signing of a cross-strait peace
accord.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Peacetime Foundation is pursuing "fair and just
treatment," Chien said the foundation does not want to see the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait trapped in an endless, costly arms race.</P>
      <P>"Arms races would threaten peace and cause a retreat in
cross-strait relations," Chien cautioned, adding that the
Peacetime would join forces with other private
organizations to push for the signing of a cross-strait peace
pact by 2008.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan met with several members of major U. S. think tanks Monday and
agreed with them that stability in the Taiwan Strait is of utmost
importance to both Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lien reached the consensus during a meeting with Winston Lord,
former assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and
Donald Zagoria, a senior researcher with the Foreign Policy Research
Institute, who visited Lien at his New York hotel to exchange
opinions on issues of mutual concern ranging from the political
situation in Taiwan to the country's legislative and local government
elections slated for December.</P>
      <P>KMT Deputy Secretary-General Jason Hu and former Republic of
China Representative to the United States Stephen Chen were also
present on the occasion.</P>
      <P>Lord was described as being "very concerned" about Lien's
viewpoints of the George W. Bush administration, while Lien was
quoted as telling Lord and Zagoria that he believes Washington's
policy toward Taiwan is consistent and stable and that mainland China
will keep a close watch on the coming elections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He was also quoted as pointing out that mainland China must be
closely monitoring the government of President Chen Shui-bian in the
run-up to the year-end elections and that Taiwan must pay heed to how
Beijing will react to the poll results.</P>
      <P>Lien flew into New York Sunday from Paris on the third and final
leg of a three-country "academic journey" in his capacity as head of
Taiwan's prime opposition party. He also visited the United Kingdom

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAMBASTES MAGNATE'S ADVOCACY OF `ONE CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ridiculed Formosa Plastics Group
Chairman Wang Yung-ching Tuesday for his call for the government of
Taiwan to accept the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>At a press conference called to respond to Wang's "one China"
advocacy, Tsai Huang-lang, a DPP party whip at the Legislative Yuan,
said Wang's "rather absurd" call apparently ignores national security
and national interest of Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>Wang made the call out of solely personal business considerations
and paid little heed to existing political reality across the Taiwan
Strait, Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that the relocation of Taiwan businesses to mainland
China, the opening of direct trade, travel and transportation links
across the Taiwan Strait and the so-called "one China" policy are
actually three different issues that are not necessarily logically
linked.</P>
      <P>Beijing's intentional linking of those issues is a deliberate
attempt to make things difficult for Taiwan and thus create
additional tension between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Tsai
added.</P>
      <P>Tsai continued that Taiwan has never demanded prerequisites on
the development of cross-strait relations and pointed out that
President Chen Shui-bian has on many occasions stressed that
cross-strait issues, including the "one China" issue as well as the
"three direct links" issue, can all be discussed on a basis of
equality.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted, however, that Beijing has never eased off on its
schemes to suppress Taiwan in the international community,
exemplified by Macedonia's recent switching of formal diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing under Beijing's influence. Taiwan
cannot accept the "one China" principle under these circumstance,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He also said that while warmly beckoning Taiwan businesses to the
mainland, the Beijing authorities continue to turn a deaf ear to
Taiwan's request for the signing of accords aimed at protecting
Taiwanese investments in mainland China. Because of this, the
government cannot feel happy about letting Taiwan businesses go to
the mainland without restrictions, he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai added that if Wang, one of the most influential business
tycoons in Taiwan, is really concerned about Taiwan's future, he
should play a different role in cross-strait relations and use his
personal clout to urge the Beijing authorities to accept the fact of
the Republic of China's legal and sovereign existence and resume
cross-strait dialogue based on equality.</P>

      <P>A delegation composed of representatives of
more than 30 Taiwan-based pharmaceutical firms has paid a visit to
mainland China in search of investment opportunities in that
promising market, industry sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan Pharmaceutical Industry Association (TPIA) spokesman
said that the delegation, the largest-ever of its kind, was warmly
received by officials with the State Drug Administration -- mainland
China's highest authority in charge of the management of its
pharmaceutical industry -- during its visit.</P>
      <P>Several Taiwan pharmaceutical makers are highly interested in
edging into the mainland Chinese market following the recent trip,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that those Taiwan pharmaceutical investors who
have already entered the mainland have not yet turned a profit with
their investments there, the official said that the mainland's 1.2
billion population still constitutes a very attractive market for the
Taiwan industry.</P>
      <P>The scale of Taiwan's medical market is worth around NT$80
billion each year, with local pharmaceutical makers grabbing only 30
percent to 40 percent of the total, according to the TPIA official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BRAZILIAN IN CUSTODY BATTLE ENTERS TAIWAN WITH ROC ENTRY PERMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Brazilian orphan Iruan Eugui Wu, a
five-year-old at the center of a custody battle between his Brazilian
and Taiwanese relatives, entered Taipei Tuesday with a Republic of
China entry permit.</P>
      <P>Wu's relatives in Taiwan can now apply for a legal residence
permit for the child while they attempt to override Brazilian law by
keeping the child here.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an ROC passport for Wu
Yi-hua, as he is known by his Taiwanese relatives, on May 27. The
passport identifies Wu as an overseas Chinese, which means he cannot
enter the country without an entry permit and must still apply for
residency rights here.</P>
      <P>The child, accompanied by his uncle Wu Hou-yen and opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yi-shih, left for Hong Kong Tuesday morning
and reentered Taiwan later in the day after being issued with the
relevant documents.</P>
      <P>Mentioning the custody fight, Lin admitted that the status of his
Brazilian grandmother's guardianship of Wu remains unchanged and that
she has been legally named as the boy's official guardian. Lin
expressed hope that the issue will be resolved through the courts or
negotiations between his Taiwanese relatives and Brazilian relatives.</P>
      <P>The child's father, who was the captain of a Taiwanese fishing
vessel, took him back to Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan from his
home in Brazil to visit his Taiwanese relatives in March, but died of
a heart attack 11 days later. Yi-hua was then taken into the care of
Wu's younger brother, Wu Hou-yen.</P>
      <P>The move sparked a dispute over the guardianship rights between
his Taiwanese relatives and his maternal grandmother, Rosa Leocia
Ergui, who is demanding that the child be returned to his home on the
grounds that the boy's father himself appointed her guardian for the
child before a Brazilian court three years ago following the death of
his Brazilian mother, Marisa Tatiane Ergui Tavares.</P>
      <P>However, the boy's uncle in Taiwan has been seeking the ROC
government's assistance in ignoring the Brazilian court ruling and
forcing the boy to stay in Taiwan "to receive an education in
accordance with the will of his father."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Tuesday
echoed a local business tycoon's call for Taiwan to accept the "one
China" principle, claiming that Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait will benefit only when they reconcile.</P>
      <P>Coming out in support of Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang
Yung-ching, Lee Cheng-tsung, a KMT party whip at the Legislative
Yuan, called for the Chen Shui-bian government to seriously assess
the "one China" policy at this critical moment of development of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the KMT has for long advocated that Taiwan
openly recognizes the so-called "1992 consensus" of "one China,
separate interpretations" and that this stance remains the KMT's set
policy as far as cross-strait relations are concerned.</P>
      <P>He criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for
"never giving a thought" to the "1992 consensus." Because of that, he
said, the administration has failed to score any points in efforts to
ease off the cross-strait stalemate, consequently dragging down
Taiwan's economy -- a fact underlined by Wang's remarks Tuesday that
"Taiwan's current social disorder and political turmoil are even
worse than during the corruption of the KMT era."</P>
      <P>Noting that since the DPP took the helm of the government one
year ago, it has led the country to greater economic strain, more
serious social disorder and much higher unemployment, Lee said the
DPP should pay heed to Wang's words rather than simply "rebuffing the
opposition parties."</P>
      <P>He reiterated that only when Taiwan recognizes the "1992
consensus" can the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resume dialogue at
an early date.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Ho Chih-hui, who is a former KMT party whip, also
called for the DPP to observe what he claimed is the "mainstream"
opinion of the Taiwan public. "Only when both sides of the Taiwan
Strait return to the "1992 consensus" can the cross-strait impasse
start to thaw," Ho said.</P>

Tuvalu will continue to support the ROC and speak for Taiwan in

      <P>Luka arrived in Taipei Monday for a week-long visit, his third to

Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that whether the name

      <P>The government of the Republic of China has
never shunned and will not shun the "one China" issue, although the
issue itself has been defined and acknowledged differently by all
parties concerned, government spokesman Su Tzen-ping said Tuesday.</P>

is that both sides should shelve the sovereignty dispute until such

jointly tackle the "one China" problem.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that the vision of "one China" espoused
by Wang himself in newspaper reports and books in the past as a
"Chinese confederation" comprised of mainland China, Taiwan and Hong
Kong, is a concept unacceptable to Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs

    <HEADLINE>ROC NAVY URGED TO REFUND COMMISSIONS PAID IN  WARSHIP SALES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker urged the Republic of China Navy
Tuesday to try to retrieve money from a Swiss bank after press
reports said that Swiss authorities have frozen an account suspected
of containing illegal gains of a wanted Taiwan arms broker.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-hua said the navy should attempt to claim
the 250 million Swiss francs stashed in a Credit Suisse account owned
by the son of Taiwan arms broker Andrew Wang, as the money is
believed to be commission paid in the 1991 purchase from France of
six Lafayette-class frigates.</P>
      <P>According to the terms of the purchase contract, the navy is
entitled to reclaim any money later found to have been paid in the
form of commission for the deal.</P>
      <P>Lee also prodded the navy to take legal action to secure evidence
collected by a French Court presiding over the trial of former French
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who was indicted for approving the
sale of the six frigates to Taiwan after receiving bribes from
state-owned oil company Elf, which had lobbied for the deal on behalf
of the frigate builder, Thomson-CSF.</P>
      <P>In a news conference, Lee displayed the address and pictures of a
house allegedly owned by Wang in the United States and asked law
enforcers to go after the arms broker who is also wanted by police
for questioning in connection with the suspicious death of a navy
captain in 1993.</P>
      <P>Lee said the navy, if necessary, should ask for arbitration in
Switzerland to get back the money.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Policy Adviser to the President Roger Hsieh
also called on the government to contact the authorities in France
and Switzerland to reclaim the money and to find out which Taiwan
officials and politicians, if any, received kickbacks in the deal.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the call one day after Wang's bank account with
Credit Suisse in Switzerland came to light.</P>
      <P>The German-language Swiss paper Sonntags Zeitung reported Sunday
that the account, opened under the name of Bruno Wang, a young Asian
man, came to the attention of the authorities after the 250 million
Swiss francs (US$142 million) were transferred in April. The banking
authorities moved to freeze the account after discovering that its
holder is the son of Andrew Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang, who acted as Thomson's agent in Taiwan, has brokered many
arms sales to Taiwan. He escaped the island on Dec. 20, 1993 after
learning that police wanted to question him in connection with the
mysterious death of Captain Yin Ching-feng, who was the head of the
navy's weapons procurement department and was preparing to blow the
whistle on massive arms procurement corruption just before he was
found dead.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ordered the six frigates from France in 1991 at a price of
US$2.8 billion but was alarmed to find in 1996 that the price had
been inflated with about US$500 million-worth of commission, which
was prohibited under the contract.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is entitled to a refund of any commission under
the contract, all investigative and legal actions taken by the Taiwan
authorities have been proved fruitless thus far, partly because of
the absence of diplomatic ties between Taipei and Paris.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP DEBATES PROS AND CONS OF COOPERATION WITH FORMER KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  19  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democrative Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers were divided Tuesday on whether they should cooperate with
former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lee Teng-hui in the year-end
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung said during a debate presided over by
DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh that cooperation with Lee would alert the
KMT establishment to the displeasure among its native Taiwanese
supporters and curtail its shift toward the People First Party,
another opposition party, which would not be in the best interest of
the DPP.</P>
      <P>He wondered how many of Lee's former cronies will follow Lee's
lead in defecting from the KMT, given the fact that many of them have
already accepted nomination as KMT candidates in the year-end
election.</P>
      <P>Another of his concerns, said Sheng, is an overlap of Lee's
supporters and DPP supporters that could split the DPP vote.</P>
      <P>He estimated that Lee's followers might win 12 seats at the most
in the legislature, but that the DPP might lose three of four seats
as a result, which would mean that cooperation with Lee would add no
more than eight seats -- not enough to help the ruling party gain
control of the legislature.</P>
      <P>The DPP at present controls 67 seats in the 220-seat Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Julian Kuo, a pro-DPP political science professor at Soochow
University, supported Shen's view, saying that cooperation with Lee
would underline the DPP's "native Taiwanese" nature, limit its shift
toward the political middle road and downgrade the year-end election
into a battle between native Taiwanese and non-native Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Chuo Jung-tai said an alliance with Lee would
boost the party's chances of winning in the election and widen the
party's support base, so long as care is taken to play down Lee's
pro-Taiwanese stance and keep a distance from Lee's followers, who he
said are closely associated with gangsters and business tycoons.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Accusing Russia and Communist China of
arming rogue states with weapons of mass destruction, more than 50
U.S. conservative leaders have expressed their support for President
George W. Bush's efforts to establish a national missile defense.</P>
      <P>In a June 18 letter to President Bush made public Tuesday, the
conservative leaders, headed by David A. Keene, chairman of the
American Conservative Union, also urged scrapping the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972, claiming that it has been rendered
obsolete by technology and changing world events.</P>
      <P>"We, the undersigned, thank you for your unwavering commitment to
provide an effective ballistic missile defense for the United States,
its forces overseas and allies. We agree that we can no longer safely
allow our country and interests to remain unprotected against this
real and growing threat," they wrote.</P>
      <P>The conservative leaders told President Bush: "Your leadership is
deeply appreciated in ending at the earliest possible time our
present vulnerability to blackmail, coercion or attack from rogue
states -- and from countries like Russia and China that are, among
other things, arming those nations with ever more dangerous missiles
and weapons of mass destruction."</P>
      <P>"This vulnerability is, of course, the by-product of the nearly
30-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed with a country, the
Soviet Union, that ceased to exist 10 years ago. The ABM treaty
prohibited the United States from developing and deploying effective
national missile defenses. Today, such an accord is clearly a threat
to our 'supreme interests.'" the letter said.</P>
      <P>"Accordingly, under the ABM treaty's terms, we have the right to
withdraw from that pact. We urge you without further delay to give
notice of our intent to do so, clearing the way for us to begin
deploying missile defenses six months from now," the conservative
leaders said.</P>
      <P>They concluded by saying that the United States cannot affort to
remain undefended, and that they share President Bush's confidence
that the United States can build and deploy a robust, global missile
defense system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SUCCESSFULLY TEST-FIRES PATRIOT MISSILES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung,  Taiwan,  June  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China military
test-fired three of its U.S.-made Patriot missiles Wednesday at an
army base in the southern Taiwan county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Military sources said all of the missiles successfully downed
dummy targets fired from Green Island, off the coast of Taitung in
eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the anti-missile defense system has
been test-fired outside the United States.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense kept secret the test-firing
schedule, but had tightened security at the Chiupeng army base in
recent days. Private cable television stations, however, managed to
broadcast footage showing exhaust trails from a Patriot missile.</P>
      <P>Army sources said the three Patriot missiles were fired between
9:12 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. to intercept drones fired from Green Island.</P>
      <P>U.S. military officers and engineers from Patriot manufacturer
Raytheon Co. and its subcontractor Lockheed-Martin Co. reportedly
were present at the Chiupeng army base to witness the tests.</P>
      <P>The ROC military has acquired three sets of modified air defense
systems (MADS), known as "Patriot PAC-2 plus" or the upgraded version
of the Patriot missile system the United States used in the Persian
Gulf War in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Patriots are defensive missiles intended to intercept
high-altitude incoming missiles. Military experts said MADS are
capable of partially destroying ballistic missiles.</P>
      <P>The three sets of MADS have been deployed in northern Taiwan to
protect the heavily populated greater Taipei area in the face of
mainland China's mounting military threat.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has deployed more than 300 M-class guided missiles
in its southeastern province of Fujian, which lies close to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER DEMANDS EXPULSION OF FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN LEE TENG-HUI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior member of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) proposed Wednesday that former KMT Chairman Lee
Teng-hui be expelled from the KMT in light of Lee's recent apparent
alliance with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and allegedly
helping to form a new political group that is poised to greatly
affect the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting, Hung
Hsiu-chu proposed the expulsion of Lee, who is also the former
president of the Republic of China, from the KMT because "Lee
betrayed and has been heartless and unjust to the party."</P>
      <P>"Even if the party has yet to decide whether to expel Lee from
the party, he has already been ousted from everyone's heart," Hung
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee's recent deeds and remarks have caused an uproar
among the KMT rank-and-file, Hung called for the KMT Evaluation and
Discipline Committee to look further into the matter. "The party
decision-makers should not turn a deaf ear and condone Lee's improper
behavior any longer," she added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on discussions made in the meeting concerning Lee's
alleged formation of a new political group with DPP and other party
cronies, KMT spokesman Wang Chih-kang said the issue will be
discussed further after the return to Taiwan of KMT Chairman Lien
Chan who is currently visiting New York.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a KMT stalwart, said Lee's
expulsion is a "hypersensitive" issue which should be handled with
extra care. "Any party member who intends to express his or her
opinions should at the same time bear the principle of process in
mind," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching's
call on Tuesday for the government of Taiwan to accept mainland
China's "one China" principle, Ma said as far as he knows, only the
KMT accepts and recognizes the "1992 consensus" of "one China,
separate interpretations," which is also what Wang was referring to.</P>
      <P>Ma said the Chinese communists on the mainland have continuously
stressed the importance of the "1992 consensus," but have been
intentionally oblivious to the "separate interpretations."</P>
      <P>By comparison, Ma said that the ruling DPP does not altogether
recognize the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Ma said both Beijing and current rulers in Taiwan should readjust
their attitude and mentality toward the "one China" issue in
cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS TYCOON EXPLAINS 'ONE CHINA' REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastic Group Chairman Wang
Yung-ching said Wednesday that when he said that Taiwan must accept
the "one China" principle, he meant that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should be able to give separate interpretations of the
principle on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Wang was trying to dispel some of the concern raised by his
address at a biotech meeting the previous day when he said that
Taiwan should embrace the "one China" principle to help break the
current economic slump. He also criticized the government for "being
even more chaotic than it was 40 years ago."</P>
      <P>The remarks by Wang, dubbed the "management guru of Taiwan,"
raised eyebrows at the meeting and has sparked heated debate in the
news media.</P>
      <P>Trying to cushion some of the impact, Wang said that his remarks
about the "one China" principle conform with the "one China, separate
interpretations " consensus reached between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait in 1992.</P>
      <P>As for the government "being more chaotic," Wang also explained
that previous administrations under the Kuomintang (KMT) were more
efficient in implementing their policies because the KMT was the
dominant political party. He said that currently, however, things
have become more complicated, with various political parties and
different viewpoints. He also said that the Democratic Progressive
Party, as a ruling party, should have the determination to overcome
current problems.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has had several major projects blocked by the
government's "go slow" policy, said that investing in the mainland is
an unstoppable trend.</P>
      <P>Under the "go slow" policy, Taiwan businessmen are barred from
investing in infrastructure projects on the mainland, and are
forbidden to invest more than US$50 million in any other project in
China.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-language daily "China Times" reported that Wang will
travel to Beijing later this month to establish branch hospitals of
the Chang Kung Memorial Hospital. Wang dismissed the report but said
that the mainland has welcomed him with open arms to build hospitals
in China.</P>
      <P>The reports said that Wang is planning to invest in Beijing,
Xiamen, and Fuzhou to establish hospitals with 11,000 beds.</P>
      <P>Wang's previous trip to the mainland in September of last year
was to inspect the investment environment for raw materials purchases
for the petrochemical industry. He also scouted for possible sites to
build the hospitals, the report said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official in charge of mainland policy said that it
is "impossible" to accept the "one China" principle as defined by
mainland China, as it has "grossly ignored the existence of the
Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
said that Beijing's "one China" principle is "three-pronged"
rhetoric, meaning that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan
is a part of that China, and that the People's Republic of China is
the only legitimate government of China in the world.</P>
      <P>"There is no room for the existence of the Republic of China
under that definition, and we can't accept or agree with it," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that President Chen Shui-bian has repeatedly said
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should sit down to talk over the
issue of "one China," and increase exchanges and dialogues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CONTINUES OFFERING SCHOLARSHIPS TO MACEDONIAN STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the severance of diplomatic ties,
the Republic of China will continue offering scholarships for
Macedonian students to study in Taiwan, Minister of Education Ovid
Tzeng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ROC government currently offers scholarships to five
Macedonian students who are studying at local universities, Tzeng
said, adding that the measure will not be suspended simply because of
the break-up of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In line with the principle of separating international academic
exchanges from the general international political situation, Tzeng
said the ROC has consistently maintained academic exchanges with many
non-diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The ROC government now offers each Macedonian student NT$15,000
(US$441.18) in living subsidy per month, in addition to NT$70,000 in
tuition fees.</P>
      <P>"In all, we spend about NT$1 million a year supporting Macedonian
students' study programs in Taiwan. The amount is not large, but the
scholarship program is of great significance," Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macedonia is an old, civilized country and has a rich
cultural heritage, Tzeng said the ROC has come to better understand
ancient Greek culture through its engagement with Macedonia over the
past two-and-half years.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said although Macedonia switched its diplomatic allegiance
from Taipei to Beijing earlier this week, the ROC will continue
academic and cultural exchanges with the Balkan state and offer its
students scholarships to study in Taiwan. Nevertheless, Tzeng said
the Ministry of Education will study on a yearly basis whether to
adjust the number of Macedonian students qualified for ROC
scholarship.</P>

village government office to get first-hand information about several
grassroots community development projects. Chen also toured an

installments and personnel training programs. He also visited a
remodeled residential community and a primary school.</P>
      <P>Chen ended his tour in Kaoteng, the Matsu group island closest to
mainland China. The island covers an area of 1.42 square kilometers
and is 8.9 kilometers from the mainland at its closest point.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his gratitude for the devotion of the officers and
men stationed on the islet and encouraged them to continue their
dedicated service to the country before he left for Taipei on a

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MUNICIPAL HOSPITALS LAUNCH COMMUNITY ELDERLY CARE PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Municipal Yangming Hospital
inaugurated the first community elderly care service center in Taipei
Wednesday to provide medical services to aged handicapped people
living alone.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Taipei city government indicate that
in Taipei alone there are some 43,000 aged handicapped citizens,
including a large number of Alzheimer's patients. Many of these
people are living without company and the service center will locate
them and offer them assistance, according to a hospital spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman noted that two other municipal hospitals in
Taipei -- Jen Ai and Ho Ping -- will also set up similar service
centers. In this way, the health authorities in Taipei expect to
organize a medical network for senior citizens in need.</P>
      <P>The service center will be staffed by doctors, nurses, social
workers, rehabilitation medical personnel and data management staff.
They will first make home visits to aged handicapped people to assess
their needs, then arrange for them to receive assistance such as
medical care or household assistance.</P>
      <P>A study conducted by the Chinese Association for Human Rights has
revealed that elderly care is a weak point in Taiwan, as many elderly
people unable to take care of themselves are actually living alone.</P>
      <P>With 10 percent of Taiwan's population over the age of 65, Taiwan
is facing many problems related to the aged population and medical
authorities have been urged to take note of this development.</P>
      <P>The Yangming Hospital spokeswoman said her hospital hopes to
first serve the 4,200 aged handicapped people living in the Shihlin
district, where the hospital is located.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET URGED TO SET TIMETABLE FOR OPENING DOOR TO MAINLAND TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators from both ruling
and opposition parties urged the government Wednesday to set a
timetable for opening Taiwan's door to tourists from mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers made the call at a public hearing held at the
Legislative Yuan, with the participation of legislators, tourist
industry representatives and officials from the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang To of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Premier Chang Chun-hsiung stated clearly in the
legislature last year that the government would begin to allow
mainland people to make sightseeing visits to Taiwan from July 1,
2001.</P>
      <P>"The premier's promise is certain to break as the MAC is not
expected to complete a preliminary planning report until the
end of this month," Wang claimed, adding: "How could a premier
easily back off his promise?"</P>
      <P>In response, MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung said the
government has not wavered on its determination to open Taiwan's
door to prospective mainland tourists.</P>
      <P>"In an effort to ensure travel quality and avoid any adverse
impact on national security and public order, we must work out a
comprehensive plan and hope to discuss with mainland China some
practical issues before the new open-door policy is put into
effect," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>He ensured lawmakers that the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China, would finalize a blueprint at the end of
June. "By then, I can't divulge any details of the plan," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that implementation of the new open-door policy needs
interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Chen said
all relevant Republic of China government authorities are stepping
up efforts to forge contacts with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Both sides should show goodwill and sincerity to tackle all
issues related to the opening of Taiwan to prospective mainland
Chinese tourists," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Legislators present at the hearing, including Wang, Chiu
Chui-chen of the People First Party and Chen Horng-chi of the
Kuomintang, were generally not satisfied with Chen's remarks and
demanded the DPP government set a timetable for opening the door to
mainland holidaymakers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ARMY SUCCESSFULLY TEST-FIRES THREE PATRIOT MISSILES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Army successfully
test-fired three U.S.-made Patriot missiles Wednesday in the first
test-firing of the anti-missile defense system ever conducted outside
the United States.</P>
      <P>Immediately upon learning of the success, President Chen
Shui-bian, who was inspecting military installations on the offshore
island of Matsu, wired a message of congratulations to the personnel
who participated in the exercise.</P>
      <P>The drill took place in the morning without prior announcement by
the Ministry of National Defense, and the results were released later
in the day by the Army General Headquarters (AGHQ).</P>
      <P>According to the AGHQ, two of the missiles were fired
consecutively from Chiupeng army base in the southern Taiwan county
of Pingtung to intercept a target missile launched from Green Island,
off the coast of Taitung in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another Patriot missile was then fired to intercept a target
drone aircraft.</P>
      <P>All three missiles successfully downed their targets.</P>
      <P>Military sources said that it is standard procedure to fire two
Patriots to intercept a single incoming missile in order to increase
the probability of success.</P>
      <P>U.S. military officers, as well as engineers from Patriot
manufacturer Raytheon Co. and its subcontractor Lockheed-Martin Co.,
reportedly were present at Chiupeng army base to witness the tests
and to assist the ROC Army in evaluating and analyzing the results.</P>
      <P>By 1997, the ROC military had completed the deployment of three
batteries of Patriot missiles in northern Taiwan to protect the
heavily populated greater Taipei area against the 300-some M-class
guided missiles that mainland China has deployed across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The model acquired by the ROC Army is known as the Modified Air
Defense System, or MADS. It is an upgraded version of the
configuration used by the U.S. Army in the Persian Gulf War of 1991.</P>
      <P>Military sources said that a team of U.S. experts was very
impressed by the performance of the ROC Patriot missile batteries
during a combat readiness evaluation in July 1998 and after
conducting a study the following year to determine the feasibility of
allowing the test-firing to take place in Taiwan.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has been running under a
"Lee-A Bian" system for the past year and facts have proved that such
an alliance is unworkable, a senior member of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hung alleged that the "Lee-A Bian" system -- supposed
to describe an alliance between former President Lee Teng-hui and
incumbent President Chen Shui-bian -- was "in fact unofficially
declared" upon the inauguration of the government May 20, 2000. Chang
also said that events of the past year have proved that the new
government is unable to function at all in internal affairs.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a seminar sponsored by the DPP in the
face of the alleged formation of a political group by Lee, who is
said to be seeking to lure members from the prime opposition
Kuomintang, the DPP and the independent camp to take part in the
legislative elections planned for December under the slogan of
"localization."</P>
      <P>The lawmaker also expressed skepticism that the alleged "Lee
Group" can effectively cooperate with the DPP, as potential
supporters of Lee and the DPP are largely overlapping, which would
only lead to a split of the vote in the elections. He predicted that
the DPP will garner as much as 40 percent of the seats in the
225-member legislature in the year-end elections.</P>

      <P>Firms from Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Honduras, Belize, Costa

      <P>Taipei will host the 2001 annual conference
of International Kiwanis from June 23-26, an organizer said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu will
deliver speeches at the opening and closing ceremonies, respectively,
said Wu Hui-wan, head of the Republic of China Kiwanis club.</P>
      <P>Taipei was chosen over Sydney and other contestants five years
ago to host the 2001 Kiwanis annual conference, which will be the
group's first in Asia.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-originated group has always held its annual conference
in North America in its 86-year history except for once in Austria
and once in France, a fact that Wu said adds extra significance to
the conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Noting that nearly 10,000 Kiwanians will gather in Taipei for the
conference, Wu called it a valuable opportunity for Taiwan to boost
its visibility on the international stage.</P>
      <P>During the conference, both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
the Taipei city government will hold receptions for the Kiwanians,
while the ROC Kiwanis club will field three dragon boat teams in the

Kinmen Wednesday as a part of the Taipei city government's efforts to
promote Taiwan culture.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Lee Ping, deputy director of Taipei's Bureau of

military sites that are now open to the public in the form of a war
memorial national park.</P>
      <P>The group also visited some of the island's historically
preserved buildings and traditional villages, which are reminiscent
of Fujian-style designs that feature swallow-tailed roofs and
enclosed courtyards.</P>
      <P>Paraguayan Ambassador Ceferino Adrian Valdez said on behalf of
the other members of the group that Kinmen is "truly a beautiful
island renowned for its historical battlefields and sorghum liquor,
where the people's warmth can be felt deeply."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, foreigners in the past generally think of the
capital city of Taipei as the sole representative of Taiwan culture.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is assessing and projecting
the timing of opening up Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists, but it
does not have a set timetable for implementation of the plan, a
ranking government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Government Information
Office, Chiou I-yen, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, said
that relevant government agencies will complete the assessment and
projection of the plan as scheduled by the end of June, but added
that no fixed timetable for its implementation has been worked out.</P>
      <P>According to Chiou, a timely completion of the assessment does
not mean that the government will be able to implement the plan as
scheduled on July 1.</P>
      <P>Dismissing speculation that the government might have shifted
from its original stance of implementing the plan, Chiou reiterated
that the matter requires bilateral negotiations with mainland China
and that this does not mean the government has failed to honor its
promise.</P>
      <P>Without prior negotiations between the two sides, many problems
which could arise from Taiwan's opening up to tourists from the
mainland could pose a serious threat to social order and local law
enforcement authorities, he noted.</P>
      <P>As an example, he asked which mainland agencies the Taiwan
authorities should approach if tourists from the mainland should
break away from a package tour or overstay their visas in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiou claimed that the Democratic Progressive Party-led
government has never eased its efforts to promote cross-Taiwan Strait
relations since its inauguration May 20 last year. Describing the
adoption of a more open policy toward mainland China as a set
government policy, he said the government will continue its efforts
despite a cool response from the mainland Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, he went on, the government has steadily
brought in new measures to improve Taiwan-mainland ties, pointing as
an example to the opening of the "mini three links" between the
Republic of China-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and two ports in
mainland China's Fujian Province opposite Taiwan at the beginning of
this year.</P>

or US$4.6 million, of the total sum, while the IDB will come up with
the remainder to help the Dominican Republic modernize its
parliamentary system and cement its democracy.</P>
      <P>The ROC was asked by the IDB to help it grant the loan one year
ago and although Taipei is responsible for providing only a small
part of the loan, the deal would have been difficult to organize if
Taipei had not made its 17 percent contribution, a Taipei official
claimed.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The economic slowdown has bitten into the
revenue of Taiwan's 12 state-run firms, which posted combined pre-tax
profits of just NT$75 million (US$2.34 million) in the first five
months of this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
disclosed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nine of the 12 firms, including the Taiwan Power Co., which used
to be the government's milk cow, have sunk into the red. The three
firms that kept the state-owned sector's head above water are Chinese
Petroleum Corp., with pre-tax profits of NT$4.88 billion, Taiwan Salt
Industrial Corp., with pre-tax profits of NT$338 million and Taiwan
Water Supply Corp., with pre-tax profits of NT$134 million, according
to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The nine loss-making firms have run up a total deficit of NT$1.73
billion, which has driven down the state-owned firms' overall revenue
to a paltry NT$75 million.</P>
      <P>In May, only Chinese Petroleum Corp. and Taiwan Salt Industrial
Corp. managed to register profits of NT$380 million and NT$69
million, respectively, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>In an effort to reverse the declining trend, the MOEA is said to
have worked out an action program to curb these firms' expenditure
and boost their performance.</P>

      <P>Chen also said that without compromising national security, the
government will gradually review and relax the current cross-strait

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local business tycoon predicted Wednesday
that Taiwan's economy will not recover this year judging from the
United States' recent economic performance.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce and of Chinatrust Commercial Bank, made the
remarks during a regular meeting of a trade promotion association in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Koo said that during a stopover in the United States while
accompanying President Chen Shui-bian on his diplomatic tour of
Central and South America in May, he had a chance to exchange
viewpoints with American experts about U.S. economic prospects, and
was told that the U.S. economy will only recover in the fourth
quarter of this year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Koo said Taiwan's economy depends greatly on the U.S. economic
performance and usually reflects the American economic situation,
although six months afterward. He predicted therefore that there is
no chance that Taiwan's economy will improve in the rest of this year
and estimated that Taiwan's economy may recover gradually after the
middle of next year.</P>
      <P>He added that the United States has adjusted its economic
recovery forecast from the third quarter to the fourth of this year,
with some predicting that the recovery will not come until the first
quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the ROC Finance Ministry,
Taiwan's imports and exports began to decline sharply earlier this
year, with some months even suffering double-digit declines from the
year-earlier levels.</P>
      <P>Referring to ties with mainland China, Koo emphasized that it is
very important that Taiwan maintain peaceful relations with mainland

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco, June 20 (CNA)
(By Tseng Chun-liang &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Lin Chong-pin issued a six-point statement in San Francisco
Wednesday to reaffirm Taipei's position on the development of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lin had just concluded a tour of major U.S. think tanks at the
head of a delegation composed of Taiwan reporters covering mainland
Chinese affairs.</P>
      <P>He issued the statement to counter Beijing's three-point stance
that "there is only one China in the world, both the mainland and
Taiwan belong to one China, and China's sovereignty and territory are
indivisible."</P>
      <P>Lin's six-point statement is as follows:</P>
      <P>1) Beijing has softened its tone, but it should also change its
actions;</P>
      <P>2) ROC President Chen Shui-bian continues to display his
sincerity toward Beijing with more constructive suggestions;</P>
      <P>3) We hope Beijing will respond with concrete action;</P>
      <P>4) Taiwan and the mainland are not subordinate to each other. The
"one China," which includes democratic Taiwan and the one-party
dictatorial mainland, does not exist at present;</P>
      <P>5) As Beijing's statement could be interpreted as an annexation
of Taiwan, it is considered unfavorable to Taiwan's status during
future cross-strait negotiations; and</P>
      <P>6) Beijing should resume the cross-strait negotiations that it
shelved unilaterally by it, because the exchange of words through the
airwaves alone cannot remove mutual distrust.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed the hope that Beijing will take concrete actions in
response to Taipei's goodwill posture.</P>
      <P>He described such desirable actions as allowing Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman Wang Daohan to
visit Taipei, ceasing its boycott against Taipei's participation in
non-governmental international organizations and resuming exchanges
between ARATS and its Taiwan counterpart, the Strait Exchange
Foundation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of foreign laborers in Taiwan
dipped in May as the government's policy of curbing their numbers to
ease soaring local unemployment began to bite.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) under the Executive Yuan said
Wednesday that there were 328,800 foreign laborers in Taiwan as of
the end of May, 512 less than month-earlier level.</P>
      <P>However, a breakdown of the statistics shows that foreign
caregivers bucked the overall trend by increasing by 1,364 to 14,019,
although the pace of increase in this sector also slowed down.</P>
      <P>Foreign maids also registered a minor increase of 186 to 8,737.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign construction workers decreased by 512 to
31,928, mainly because of a government decision to freeze their
numbers in major public projects.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities began putting the brakes on the
introduction of foreign laborers last September after the
unemployment rate started to increase. The local jobless rate hit a
record high of 3.96 percent in March.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several local business tycoons Wednesday
opposed the government's planned shrinking of the foreign workforce
and urged the government to understand the plight of bosses whose
factories have closed amid the economic slump.</P>
      <P>The tycoons, including Wang Yu-tseng, chairman of the Rebar
Group, and Kao Ching-yuan, head of the President Group, voiced their
opposition at a business association's monthly meeting that was also
attended by Chen Chu, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs,
Taiwan's highest government body in charge of labor policy making.</P>
      <P>Chen first delivered a lecture on the government's labor policy
during which she expressed her opposition to freezing the Labor
Standard Law as suggested by some domestic businessmen in reaction to
the economic slowdown, claiming that the law provides fundamental
protection to laborers.</P>
      <P>She suggested that pension funds should be increased in order to
enable most laborers to receive a pension.</P>
      <P>Wang opposed Chen's suggestion, saying that the government should
emphasize instead the stable implementation of its labor policy and
should not increase laborers' retirement funds in the midst of the
economic slump, or even more enterprises would not be able to afford
to continue.</P>
      <P>Kao suggested that the government increase instead of reducing
the number of foreign workers, claiming that although the CLA has
said there are presently 320,000 foreign workers on the island, less
than half of them are involved in the manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Kao urged Chen to make sure the CLA formulate the best labor
policy possible in consideration of the real situation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 113 Tibetan adults, who used
fake passports to enter Taiwan in previous years, have turned
themselves in to Taiwan police authorities in the hopes of obtaining
permanent residence in Taiwan, sources from the Ministry of the
Interior said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 113 Tibetans, who used phony Indian or Nepalese passports to
enter Taiwan after 1993, are expected to be granted permanent
residence in Taiwan soon under a special relief program that was made
possible after the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan exiled spiritual leader,
made an appeal to President Chen Shui-bian in April.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama appealed to Chen for help to those Tibetans who
have been living in Taiwan over the past years without identification
and consequently were deprived of benefits such as health insurance
and work opportunities.</P>
      <P>The Tibetans, some of whom have already married local ROC
citizens, however, would first be charged with violations for either
overstaying their visas or holding fake travel documents to enter
Taiwan, officials from the National Police Administration said.</P>
      <P>The Tibetans turned themselves in over the past two days under a
guarantee by Chueh-An Tsering, chairman of the Tibet Association in
Taipei, a private organization established to handle Tibetan affairs
and relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are basically two groups of Tibetans residing
illegally in Taiwan, depending on their dates of arrival.</P>
      <P>For those who came before 1993, they mainly arrived from refugee
camps in India with travel documents obtained with the help of the
Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. Most of them
have now overstayed their visas.</P>
      <P>Those who came after 1993 purchased fake passports at costs
ranging from NT$3,000 to NT$30,000 from organized crime gangs in

    <HEADLINE>U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT CALLS TAIWAN'S PATRIOT TEST-FIRING ROUTINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 20 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Wednesday that Taiwan's test-firing of Patriot missiles
was routine.</P>
      <P>"Like any military, the Taiwan military routinely tests its
weapons," Boucher said in response to a media query about Patriot
missile test-firing at a southern Taiwan army base Wednesday.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Boucher said, what Taiwan test-fired was a
modified air defense system (MADS) that was derived from the U.S.
Patriot system.</P>
      <P>"It's primarily an anti-aircraft weapon, although it has some
capability against lower-tier missile threats," Boucher said, adding
that reporters should turn to the Taiwan military for any details of
the test-firing.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Patriot test-firing would accelerate missile
buildup around the Taiwan Strait, Boucher said he didn't think so.</P>
      <P>"Facilitating a missile buildup? No," he said.</P>
      <P>Boucher further said Taiwan bought the MADS from the United
States. "It's derived from the U.S. Patriot system. I don't know the
exact nature of the technology, but certainly it's associated with
one of our systems."</P>
      <P>Boucher said the MADS sale was in line with a U.S. commitment to
furnishing Taiwan with defensive weapons to safeguard its security.</P>
      <P>"We have always said we'll provide Taiwan with the wherewithal to
meet its legitimate defensive needs, and any sales are within that
context," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Defense didn't comment on the latest
Taiwan test-firing of Patriot missiles. A spokesman for the
Pentagon's International Security Cooperation Agency said that no
U.S. military servicemen took part in the Taiwan Patriot test-firing.</P>
      <P>But the spokesman added that the U.S. Army's Patriot Project
Office sent civilian staff members to observe the Taiwan test-firing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's military test-fired three of its U.S.-made Patriot
missiles Wednesday. The tests reportedly hit two airborne targets --
a dummy missile and a dummy airplane.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Patriot missiles were test-fired
outside the United States. Taiwan authorities said the tests were
conducted with Washington's blessing.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the Taiwan Visitors
Association on Thursday urged the government to speed the lifting of
restrictions on mainland tourists visiting Taiwan to give the local
tourist industry a much-needed shot in the arm.</P>
      <P>Yen Chang-shou, who is also the president of the Ritz Landis
Taipei hotel, called for the government to stop making opening Taiwan
tourism to mainland Chinese visitors a "political bargaining chip" in
the development of the cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>One of the top hoteliers in Taiwan and the chairman of the Landis
Group of Hotels and Resorts, Yen called for related government
agencies to handle the issue on business considerations, rather than
political, or consider it as some kind of favor to the mainlanders or
the local hotel and restaurant operators.</P>
      <P>He added that when mainland China opened its tourism markets to
Taiwan visitors, there were no "conditions." Hong Kong enjoys
prosperity by operating a successful tourism industry which has set
no any restriction, he said.</P>
      <P>Yen, the only man in Asia to become president of an American
Express operation with just a high school diploma, made the call
during a national transportation and communication conference
Thursday hosted by the government.</P>
      <P>In response to Yen's complaint, Chou Chi-sheng, deputy director
of the Economic Affairs Department of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said the issue of opening the Taiwan tourism
market to mainland Chinese visitors is not and will not be a
"political bargaining chip."</P>
      <P>The MAC is Taiwan's top official agency responsible for
formulating policies toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chou, however, noted that for the sake of maintaining the quality
of local tourism, officials from both sides should meet and talk ovr
the issue before concrete measures are mapped out.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Oct. 20 that visitors from
mainland China will be able to take leisure trips to Taiwan
beginning June 2001 as part of the ROC government's efforts to
address the cross-strait impasse.</P>
      <P>The plan, nevertheless, has apparently not been implemented and

    <HEADLINE>MAC PLANS TO RAISE MAINLAND INVESTMENT CEILING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) will consider easing restrictions on the ceiling for mainland
China-bound investment and allowing direct investment across the
Taiwan Strait, a senior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"These are the tasks high on the MAC's future work agenda," MAC
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said at a public hearing on the Republic of
China government's current "go slow" mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting calls for the government to open direct
cross-strait "three links" and ease mainland investment restrictions,
Tsai said the gap is actually not large between the government's
stance and the business community's desire.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai said drastic liberalization of cross-strait
commercial exchanges, including investment, would have a profound
impact on the Taiwan economy in the short term.</P>
      <P>In her view, Tsai said the existing "no haste, be patient"
mainland investment, adopted by the previous Kuomintang government,
is not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, it would not be likely that 40,000 to 50,000 Taiwan
companies have so far invested in mainland China," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>As future Taiwan investors on the mainland would mostly be large,
high-tech and publicly listed companies, Tsai said, the MAC will
study the feasibility of raising the maximum amount of each mainland
China-bound investment project. At present, the cap is set at US$50
million (US$1.47 million).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, will also work on a plan to allow direct cross-strait
investment.</P>
      <P>Until now, all mainland China-bound investments must be made via
a third place. "The indirect measure is mainly aimed at protecting
our investors' interests in view of systematic
incompatibility between the two sides," Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>With mainland China gradually improving its economic and
financial systems, Tsai said, the MAC has made "direct investment" a
key subject for study.</P>
      <P>In preparation for allowing direct cross-strait investment, Tsai
said, Taiwan must adopt a more flexible accounting supervision system
to ensure transparency and avoid double taxation on capital gains
remitted from mainland China.</P>
      <P>"To sum up, the MAC will join forces with other relevant
government agencies to adjust our mainland investment policy to
minimize interference with local businesses' investment activities,"
she said.</P>
      <P>During the public hearing organized by opposition New Party
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, Tsai also said the MAC has almost finalized
a plan to allow foreign financial institutions to invest in Taiwan's
sluggish real estate market.</P>
      <P>"We have almost completed all preparatory work. We are now
awaiting the Legislative Yuan to pass an amendment bill to the
existing Land Law to provide a legal basis for the entry of foreign
institutional investors into our property market," Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>Once the new market-opening framework is established, Tsai said,
the government will also allow mainland institutional investors to
invest in Taiwan's property market.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai urged local land developers not to have
unrealistic expectations of the possible bonanza that mainland
investors may bring to Taiwan's recession-hit real estate market.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China is known to be good at policy manipulation and
has consistently imposed strict restraints on capital flow," Tsai
cautioned.</P>
      <P>Touching on the government plan to open the door to mainland
Chinese tourists, Tsai said this policy remains unchanged. "The MAC
is scheduled to finalize a blueprint by the end of June, but will not
set a timetable for the implementation of the new open-door policy,"
Tsai said, adding that cross-strait coordination and consultations
are necessary before opening Taiwan's door to mainland tourists.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Legislator Lai and noted economist
Ma Kai both voiced support for the establishment of a special
economic zone for direct cross-strait trade and transportation links.</P>
      <P>Lai and Ma said the establishment of the special economic zone
would help pave the way for full-fledged liberalization of
cross-strait trade and economic links.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MISSILE TEST NOT INTENDED TO PROVOKE CHINA: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, June 20 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's national broadcaster said Thursday
that Taiwan's successful Patriot missile tests were in no way
intended to be provocative to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-built missiles, which came to prominence during the 1991
Gulf War, were fired from the Pingtung military base at drones fired
from a mountain.</P>
      <P>The test-firing was conducted while China was carrying out war
exercises, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</P>
      <P>Communist China considers the island to be a breakaway province,
and is irritated by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CBC said Taiwan believes that over the next decade,
mainland China will add to the 800 missiles already aimed at the
island.</P>
      <P>The Patriots are defensive missiles intended to shoot down
incoming missiles. Taiwan purchased 200 of the missiles, which are
upgraded models of those used to combat Iraq's Scud missiles.</P>
      <P>The military has deployed the missiles around the capital,
Taipei, but has never fired one on Taiwanese soil, the CBC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANGING WORK SCHEDULE `TOUGH JOB': CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) officials
said Thursday that "it will be a very tough job" to change the
current 84-hour bi-weekly working schedule to a 44-hour per week
schedule as proposed by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated his proposal when he met with a group of
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators a day earlier. Chen said that
the ruling and opposition parties had originally reached consensus on
the 44-hour work-week and in the end, it was the 84-hour bi-weekly
working schedule that cleared the legislature "quite by accident."</P>
      <P>In view of the current economic slump, Chen also said that if the
ruling and opposition camps can agree to his view in a proposed
economic advisory meeting scheduled for August, then he hopes the new
legislative session in September will revise the law to delay the
implementation of the work schedule for two years and change it to 44
hours per week.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director of CLA's Department of Labor Affairs,
said that changing the work-week will involve views from labor and
management, ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that making the changes will be very difficult if
there is no consensus reached on the president's proposal.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the issue caused confrontation between labor and
management last year and resulted in political chaos.</P>
      <P>But he also said that in view of the global economic
developments, the Basic Labor Law needs to be amended. He stressed
that the law must provide more leeway so as to give more room for
consultation between labor and management in various fields.</P>
      <P>He also said that the goal of the Basic Labor Law is to upgrade
the country's competitiveness and that anything that is beneficial to
both labor and management could be discussed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the three main opposition parties concurred that the
adjustment of working hours is not a solution to the current economic
problems.</P>
      <P>KMT party whip Lee Cheng-chung noted that the 84-hour bi-weekly
system was implemented Jan. 1 this year. It is "not appropriate" that
the government should think of changing it to a 44-hour week when the
new system has been in effect for less than six months.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, "a poll" shows that 25.2 percent of the people
think that the exodus of businesses is the main reason for the rising
unemployment, 24 percent feel that the jobless problem is a result of
the world economic slump and only 1.7 percent think it is caused by
the shorter work week.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that the number of foreign laborers introduced
last year increased to 320,000 and added that it is "unreasonable"
for foreign laborer numbers to increase at a time of domestic
economic sluggishness.</P>
      <P>Lee offered his opinion that the current economic woes have been
caused by a lack of sound financial and economic policies on the part
of the government led by Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chou Hsi-wei, party whip of the People First Party (PFP), echoed
Lee's words, saying that the government should come up with an
overall solution and should not try to apply "simple political
maneuvering" to address the economic woes.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the adjustment of the work-week should respect
market mechanisms and be agreed upon by labor and management.</P>
      <P>The PFP will try to understand more about the work schedule, pay,
economic competitiveness and the views of labor and management, he
added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyi-bao of the New Party also said that shortened
working hours are not directly related to economic woes and that the
president is trying to put the blame on shortened work hours, which
is "unfair" to laborers.</P>
      <P>Lai urged the president to present more substantial data and
figures to convince the legislators that increased work hours will
help stimulate economy and upgrade business competitiveness,
"otherwise, the president's idea will not get support from the
opposition legislators."</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's business conditions may not be
able to recover in the third quarter as expected, as leading
indicators for May soon to be made public by the government reveal
16th consecutive monthly falls in all seven categories.</P>
      <P>The May leading indicators to be released next week by the
Cabinet-level Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
show that figures for export volume, the stock market weighted index,
the average monthly work hours and wholesale price indexes all
registered drops.</P>
      <P>As those indicators serve to reflect business conditions in the
coming three to six months, economists said that the local business
climate is not very likely to recover in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The economists, however, pointed out that this current wave of
recession has lasted for 17 months, longer than the latest expansion
period of 13 months (from December 1998 to January 2000). They also
noted that this is the first time in Taiwan that an economic
expansion period has been shorter than an economic contraction
period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei District Court ruled Thursday that a
mainland Chinese woman claiming to have supernatural healing powers
is guilty of fraud and of practicing medicine without a license.</P>
      <P>Zhang Ying, who arrived in Taiwan with her locally born husband
last December, was sentenced to 14 months in prison.</P>
      <P>She has been barred from leaving the island since January,
pending an end to the investigations that began when prosecutors were
alerted to her claims that she can "see through bodies" to diagnose
diseases and that she can "snatch pills" out of thin air.</P>
      <P>Between Dec. 28 and Jan. 5, nearly 10 "patients" were led to
believe that she had supernatural powers and sought medical treatment
from her for a fee.</P>
      <P>She was indicted April 10 along with Hsieh Szu-tao, a local woman
who helped introduce patients to Zhang.</P>
      <P>The bill of indictment stated that Zhang simply hid a pinch of
powder containing Chinese medicine ingredients in the palm of her
hand or under a table during her "treatment" sessions. In a sleight
of hand trick, the prosecutors said, she would then rub the powder
into a pill.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VINTAGE WARSHIPS CONDUCT LIVE-FIRE DRILL TO MARK 60TH ANNIVERSARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Keelung,  Taiwan,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three of the Republic of China's
vintage Gearing-class destroyers conducted a rare live-fire exercise
near Pengjia Yu Islet off the northeastern Taiwan coast Thursday to
mark the 60th anniversary of their commissioning into service.</P>
      <P>As Pengjia Yu lies just 75 nautical miles southwest of the
disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, the ROC Navy has seldom conducted
live-fire drills in the area.</P>
      <P>The Navy General Headquarters (NGH) said Thursday's drill was
mainly designed to demonstrate the three warships' strong combat
capabilities even after so many long years of service and had nothing
to do with any sovereignty disputes.</P>
      <P>However, the ROC military has stationed officers, men and radar
stations on Pengjia Yu and the navy regularly ships military supplies
and daily necessities to the islet.</P>
      <P>The three U.S.-made destroyers -- Chienyang, Yunyang and
Chengyang -- were built in the 1940s. After they retired from the
U.S. naval service, they were sold to the ROC and have been helping
defend Taiwan's security for about 30 years.</P>
      <P>Despite their age, naval sources said, the three warships are
still in good condition and perform well. They all sailed at a speed
of 20 knots during the Pengjia Yu exercise. The flotilla steamed in
formation and flexed their muscles in the half-day drill, firing
anti-submarine rockets, decoy rockets, Phalanx rapid fire guns, 76 mm
rapid fire guns and many other types of ammunition.</P>
      <P>At the end of the drill, the flotilla cruised around Pengjia Yu
to pay tribute to officers and men stationed on the small island.</P>
      <P>The navy arranged for a group of journalists to cover the
flotilla's live-fire drill with an aim of showing the local public
the aging warships' strong combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>The three destroyers are armed with standard missiles, MK46
torpedoes, Phalanx guns and many other types of rapid fire guns. They
can sail at a maximum speed of 33 knots.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy now has seven Gearing-class destroyers whose combat
capabilities have been beefed up greatly under a "Wuchin No. 3"
mid-life upgraded program. Naval sources said the seven upgraded
destroyers can continue their services for 10 to 15 years.</P>
      <P>Military sources further said that the seven aging destroyers
will continue their services no matter whether the ROC would
purchase Kidd-class destroyers or not.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIR OUTLINES TAIWAN'S CURRENT WOES IN CNN INTERVIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's failure to follow the previous Kuomintang government's
policy toward mainland China has made cross-Taiwan Strait relations
more severe than ever, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said in an interview
with CNN Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is now on a private visit to New York, claimed that
Chen's disregard of the KMT-initiated National Unification
Guidelines and the 1992 "one China, separate interpretations"
consensus has hindered any progress in cross-strait relations since
Chen took office in the ROC's first-ever democratic transfer of
power between different political parties in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Lien went on to say to that the linger cross-strait political
limbo has not only weakened Chen's approval rating but has also
resulted in deterioration of cross-strait relations, a loss of
investor confidence, a Taiwan stock market slump and overall
economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>In addition to uncertainty in cross-strait relation, Lien said
another reason behind Taiwan's current plight lies in Chen's failure
to respect the ROC's constitutional spirit.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that Chen's current administration is basically
a minority government as his Democratic Progressive Party controls
barely a third of seats in the legislature. In contrast, the KMT
controls more than half of legislative seats. Lien said Chen's
administration has had a hard time coming to terms with the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former ROC vice president, finished third in Taiwan's
2000 presidential election. Asked whether he would run again in the
2004 election, Lien said both the KMT and he himself will make a
decision when the time is right.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's test-firing of three U.S.-made Patriot
missiles Wednesday, Lien said the testing schedule has long been
planned and was not designed to provoke mainland China. Mainland
China's military is now conducting a series of combined services
drills in its offshore Dongshan Island near Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to travel to Colorado Thursday to attend a
world forum organized by noted U.S. think tank American Enterprise
Institute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT  TO  MAKE  EFFORTS TO CARE FOR ABORIGINES: PREMIER</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday
that Taiwan's current financial situation is not in good shape, but
the government will make efforts to take care of the country's
aborigines "as best as it can."</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when he addressed a two-day
aborigine conference that focused on bridging the gap in the living
standards between Taiwan's aborigines and non-aborigines.</P>
      <P>He also urged the aborigines to fight for their own destiny and
to make every effort to upgrade the dignity of their tribes and
continue their cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>Representatives from government agencies, legislators and chiefs
of Taiwan's 55 aboriginal villages and townships took part in the
conference that ended Thursday.</P>
      <P>The participants discussed issues related to raising the average
income, improving employment opportunities, increasing educational
levels and increasing aborigines' life expectancy.</P>
      <P>The premier said that "respecting aborigines and helping them
improve the quality of their lives" is a world trend and he expressed
hope that all can work together toward realizing the goal of bridging
the gap between Taiwan's aborigines and non-aborigines.</P>
      <P>According to the recently formed Council of Aboriginal Affairs,
the average monthly income of non-aboriginal households is NT$87,000,
or 2.3 times that of aboriginal households, which only earn an
average of NT$38,087. The jobless rate among aborigines is 7.55
percent, or 2.6 times that of non-aborigines.</P>
      <P>Up to 60 percent of aborigines have less than junior high
school-level education, all of which show that there is an enormous
gap in the living standards between aboriginal and non-aboriginal
people.</P>

      <P>Visiting Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tun
Chanareth urged Taiwan Thursday to ratify a law banning landmines in
order to prevent further civilian injuries from accidental contact.</P>
      <P>Chanareth said at a press conference that the law is necessary
because the Republic of China is not a U.N. member and therefore
ineligible to join some 130 countries in signing a 1997 international
treaty in Ottawa against landmines.</P>
      <P>According to U.N. estimates, about 110 million landmines still
exist in the world, with over 100,000 of them located on the
frontline ROC-held islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Chanareth was scheduled to visit Kinmen Friday to listen to a
military briefing on the island's mine-clearing efforts. He will then
participate in a series of activities the following day aimed at

      <P>A Cambodian ex-soldier who lost both his legs in 1982 when a

      <P>Taiwan's Evergreen Group is to
increase its investment in Panama, according to a report in a local
newspaper.</P>
      <P>The paper reported that new investment projects will include the
second stage expansion of an Evergreen container terminal at Colon, a
hotel and a business center.</P>
      <P>Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa made the decision to
expand his investments in Panama during a meeting with Panamanian
President Mireya Moscoso when he accompanied President Chen Shui-bian
on a visit to Panama last May, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>Evergreen has already invested US$100 million to build a
container terminal at Colon and the second-stage expansion will be
financed with a further US$80 million. The paper said no date had
been fixed for construction of the hotel and business center.</P>
      <P>Chang is member of the Advisory Council of the Panama Canal and
he has proposed that the Panama Canal's locks should be widened to 50
meters and lengthened to 310 meters in order to accommodate ships
bigger than the "Panamax" class and increase the revenue of the
canal.</P>
      <P>The Evergreen Group has a commercial fleet of 130 ships and this

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO FURTHER DEVELOP CKS AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Kai-shek International Airport no
longer enjoys advantages over other regional airports and the
government should take action to upgrade the airport's facilities and
capabilities, aviation industry sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>This was the consensus reached during the first National
Transport Conference held in Taipei and attended by representatives
of major local aviation companies.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government should fully develop the airport
into a competitive facility, China Airlines (CAL) Chairman Y.N. Lee
urged the government to "link the airport with nearby transport
networks."</P>
      <P>As international civil aviation organizations have decided to
adopt routes in the Shanghai International Flight Information Zone
instead of the A1 route within the Taipei International Flight
Information Zone where CKS airport is located, Lee noted that the
Taiwan airport no longer has advantages over others in the region.</P>
      <P>The CAL executive also called on the airport authorities to
improve the airport's facilities in the face of the imminent entry of
the new A380 airplanes into the global civil aviation market.</P>
      <P>Echoing Lee's view, EVA Airways Chairman C.C. Su also urged the
government to do its best to quickly upgrade CKS airport facilities
and improve its transport links with nearby traffic networks.</P>
      <P>According to Su, CKS airport is only marginally better than those
in the Philippines and Indonesia in terms of airport facilities. He
noted that CKS airport had only one highway link to serve its
capacity of eight million passengers per year and that it still has
only one highway link now when its handling capacity has grown to
11.5 million passengers annually.</P>
      <P>C. J. Wang, an engineer with a local construction company, said
that the airport's capacity will become saturated by 2006 and that
its facilities will become seriously insufficient by 2021. He
contended that the airport should be expanded to tackle the
increasing number of travelers.</P>
      <P>Scholars and experts attending the conference also said that
there is no need for the government to build an international airport
in central or southern Taiwan, because a trip from central Taiwan to
CKS airport will be much shorter with the completion of the planned
high speed railway.</P>
      <P>Judging the matter from the viewpoint of international travel,
there is a difference of only one minute between a trip departing
from CKS airport and one departing from central Taiwan, he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Both Lee and Su agreed that the need for Taiwan's international
travelers can be sufficiently met by only one international airport
because of the island's small size and that the government should
better develop CKS airport.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Labor Affairs
(CLA) announced Thursday that it has arrived at a consensus with the
Indonesian representative office in Taiwan that will lead to lower
brokerage fees for Indonesian workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA, Indonesia has agreed to follow a similar
agreement that exists between the CLA, Vietnam and Thailand to deduct
room and board fees of between NT$2,500 (US$73) and NT$4,000 from
workers' pay, which would then be compensated by lower brokerage fees
that the workers have to pay to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Their actual wages -- legally guaranteed to be a minimum of
NT$15,840 -- will therefore not be affected, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA, brokers in Taiwan have already agreed to
lower their brokerage fees by NT$10,000, while brokers in Indonesia
have yet to decide on a figure, although they are expected to lower
their fees by approximately NT$20,000-NT$30,000 per person.</P>
      <P>Indonesian workers each pay approximately NT$60,000 to their
brokers in Taiwan and another NT$60,000 to their brokers in
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>At the earliest, the new fee scales will be put into effect in
August, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Foreign laborers often take out high-interest loans to pay for
brokerage fees and have to work one to two years just in order to be
able to pay off the debt.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Brazilian grandmother of a boy born to
a Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese father will arrive in Taiwan on
June 24 to seek to regain his custody, the boy's Taiwanese uncle, Wu
Huo-yien, said Thursday in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said from his Kaohsiung home that he has written a letter in
Chinese to Rosa Leocadia Dasilva, the grandmother, to express his
welcome but to reiterate that he has no intention of giving her back
her grandchild, five-year-old Iruan Wu, who he has kept in Taiwan
since he arrived to visit his Taiwanese relatives at the beginning of
this year.</P>
      <P>The letter will be relayed to Dasilva by the Brazil Business
Center, the country's representative office in Taiwan, which
has arranged her trip to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is willing to greet Rosa at the airport but cannot do
so because the Brazil Business Center has kept him in the dark about
the exact time of her arrival.</P>
      <P>Claiming that his brother intended to have Iruan schooled and
raised in Taiwan, Wu said he will do his utmost to realize his
brother's will but will not block "the grandmother's right to visit
the child."</P>

resolved amicably.</P>
      <P>The boy, whose mother died three years ago, was officially put
into the custody of his grandmother by his Taiwanese father through 
a Brazilian court.</P>
      <P>The fight for the child's custody stemmed from the sudden death
of Iruan's father during the visit to Taiwan. Iruan's grandmother
asked for the child to be returned to her after learning that Wu had
died, but Wu's brother refused, saying he wanted to raise his nephew.</P>
      <P>The Dasilva was seen on local television several weeks ago
appealing tearfully for the child's return from his Taiwanese
relatives, all of whom were strangers to the boy.</P>
      <P>The geographic distance between Brazil and Taiwan, the absence of
diplomatic ties between them and the language barrier have
complicated the dispute all the more.</P>

      <P>It is the government's vacillations rather
than the two-hours shorter work-week which has prompted the exodus of
local firms, said two labor leaders Thursday amid reports that the
government is drumming up support for a 44-hour work-week.</P>
      <P>Lin Huei-kwung, chairman of the Chinese Federation of Labor and
Huang Ching-hsien, chairman of the Taiwan Confederation of Trade

attempt to reinstate the 44-hour work-week, which was phrased out at
the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Huang said the government should not pin its hopes of
revitalizing the economy on lengthening the work-week while there are
many ways to boost industry, such as ensuring sufficient water and
electricity supplies and more efficient administration.</P>
      <P>The labor leader, who is also a national policy adviser to the
president, said the government's policy flip-flops are the real
culprit behind the economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Lin Huei-kwung warned the government not to make the country's
seven million laborers into scapegoats for the island's faltering
economy, saying there is no evidence that the shorter work-week is
the main cause of the exodus of local industry.</P>
      <P>Exploiting the workforce to save the economy is a futile attempt

reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said that export orders totaled US$11.5
billion, down 13.96 percent from the same time last year. Barring
seasonal factors, the decline was the largest since export orders
were first recorded in 1981.</P>
      <P>Export orders in May declined by US$1.87 million, or down 13.96
percent, from the same time last year. Officials said that the May
decline was precipitated by the continued fall of semiconductor
prices and the continued poor demand for information and electronic
products.</P>
      <P>Among export items, all but machinery products recorded a
decrease from the same time last year. Major export destinations also
showed an overall decline. For example, exports to the United States
declined by US$660 million, down 15.34 percent; exports to Hong Kong
dropped by US$220 million, down by 9.07 percent; exports to Japan
down by US$210 million, down 14.4 percent; exports to Europe dropped
by US$550 million. down by 25.13 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the industrial production index fell for the third
consecutive month since March, including the manufacturing sector
which was down by 9.91 percent.</P>
      <P>The industrial industry index was down 8.2 percent from the same
time last year. It is estimated that the industrial production index
in the first five months was down 5.29 percent from the same period
last year.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials noted that it was unusual for the industrial
production index to fall for three months in a row. Affected by a
slump in the world economy, the uncertain future of the information
and electronics sectors, and more conservative domestic demand, the
decline in the manufacturing industry has widened every month, they
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE BOGUS KIDNAPPING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan man allegedly kidnapped in
mainland China and subsequently released is under suspicion of
masterminding a ploy to bilk money out of a Taiwanese friend who was
also abducted in the same incident.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese manager of a U.S.-based metal company, surnamed Chen,
and his close friend, surnamed Kao, were taken by three mainland
Chinese men on Sunday in the southern city of Shenzhen, police
sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the kidnappers wanted 500,000 (NT$2.09
million) renminbi in ransom. But while Chen was held in a fishing
boat, Kao was released and instructed to return to Taiwan and pick up
a ransom from Chen's family of HK$10 million (NT$44.21 million).</P>
      <P>Angry and anxious, Chen's family asked Kao whether the ransom was
negotiable. Kao said he would do his best to "talk to the gangs."</P>
      <P>Kao told Chen's family that he had purchased a round-trip ticket
and had to return to mainland China. He said that Chen's life could
be at risk if he was not back in Shenzhen by Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Chen was released and returned to Taiwan safely late Thursday
evening via Hong Kong after Kao was paid NT$280,000 by Chen's family.
Kao was picked up by police in Taiwan before he could board a flight
to the Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Police are questioning the veracity of Kao's claim that he was
acting under the sole instruction of his kidnappers and are looking
closely at his statement to see if Kao was actually working with his
captors to extort money from Chen's family.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Cambodian Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Tun Channareth lauded the Republic of China military's
efforts Friday to clear landmines from the frontline island of
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Channareth flew to Kinmen from Taipei early in the morning in the
company of senior executives of the Taipei-based Eden Social Welfare
Foundation to see for himself demining operations at the ROC's
offshore defense outpost.</P>
      <P>Channareth, an ex-soldier who lost both his legs in 1982 when a
landmine exploded while he was patrolling with his troops near the
Thai border, first visited the state-owned Taiwan Power Co.'s Tashan
power plant where he was briefed on the company's achievements in
demining land nearby.</P>
      <P>Channareth then toured six previous minefields near a temple in
Hsiputou village. The landmines in those regions had all been cleared
by a British demining firm.</P>
      <P>Channareth recognized the ROC's efforts to demine its outlying
islands. As Kinmen still has many minefields, Channareth suggested
that the ROC seek the U.N. demining task force's assistance in
clearing all remaining Kinmen minefields.</P>
      <P>According to Channareth, the U.N. task force offers free
demining services and its senior engineers can help teach ROC
military servicemen demining technology and expertise.</P>
      <P>"Seeking U.N. assistance, you will be able to save much money,"
Channareth said.</P>
      <P>Until now, the ROC has employed foreign companies to assist in
demining its offshore defense outposts.</P>
      <P>Channareth also urged Taiwan to pass a law banning landmines to
prevent further civilian injuries from accidental contact. Channareth
said the legislation is necessary because the ROC is not a U.N.
member and therefore ineligible to join some 130 countries in signing
a 1997 international anti-landmine convention in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>Huang Huang-hsiung, a member of the watchdog Control Yuan who was
also visiting Kinmen to inspect its demining operations, told
Channareth that he would help push for enactment of an anti-landmine
law in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Huang said the ROC's Ministry of National
Defense, the Kinmen County Government and Taiwan Power Co. have
gradually carried out various demining programs.</P>
      <P>With the opening of Kinmen for sightseeing and direct "mini three
links" with mainland China's port city of Xiamen, Huang said, the ROC
military has attached great importance to demining certain Kinmen
areas and adopt necessary supporting measures to facilitate demining
operations and ensure the offshore island's security.</P>
      <P>According to U.N. estimates, about 110 million landmines still
exist in the world, with over 100,000 of them located on the ROC-held
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, both of which lie far closer
to mainland China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Channareth, now a goodwill ambassador of the International
Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), said he looks forward to seeing
Kinmen become a landmine-free island.</P>
      <P>Channareth flew back to Taipei after concluding his Kinmen visit
in the afternoon. During his Taiwan visit, Channareth will take part
in a series of activities aimed at helping the public understand the
hazards of landmines and experience how it feels to be confined to a
wheelchair.</P>
      <P>The ICBL is a coalition of more than 1,000 non-governmental
organizations in over 60 countries. The campaign and its director,
Jody Williams, were also co-recipients of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "It is not right to refuse to enter
public service. For if it is wrong to ignore the duties arising out
of the relations between the members of a man's family, how is it
right for a man to ignore the duties he owes to his sovereign and
country?"</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators confirmed Friday that an
extraordinary session of the Legislative Yuan will be held June
26-27.</P>
      <P>But legislators in an official meeting Friday had mixed reactions
about whether to invite Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to report and field
questions at the special session.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators want the premier to report on the current
economic situation, why the six financial bills need to be passed as
quickly as possible and the effect of their passage.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan ended early this month with a backlog of
outstanding bills, including six bills that the Cabinet said are
crucial to the ongoing financial reforms. As the next session will
not begin until September, the Cabinet has since lobbied for the
convening of the provisional session to pass the bills, which include
a financial holding company bill.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the opposition People First Party said
that the provisional meeting will convene only because of economic
problems and the premier should explain the relationship between the
six bills and the economy.</P>
      <P>Legislators Kuo Su-chun, Hsiao Chin-lan, and Chiang Yi-wen of
the Kuomintang questioned whether the financial holding company bill
would only help certain companies.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyi-bao of the New Party said that the amendment
to the public bond bill is important, but is not included in the six
bills, and he said the premier should report on this in the
extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-liang of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party expressed the hope that his colleagues would put away
ideological differences and work toward passing the six financial
bills for the development of the nation.</P>
      <P>A procedural committee in the legislature later decided the
agenda for the first day meeting June 26, which will have the premier
reporting in the afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CASES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCREASE SHARPLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Reported cases of domestic violence in
Taiwan have increased dramatically over the past several months,
women's welfare activists said Friday.</P>
      <P>Acting on police requests, courts around the island issued a
total of 9,941 protection orders between July 2000 and April 2001
aimed at protecting women who were physically battered by men in the
house, said officials from the Association for the Promotion of
Women's Rights during a public hearing marking the enactment of the
Domestic Violence Prevention Act some two years ago.</P>
      <P>The number of protection orders issued during the July 2000-April
2001 period nearly doubled the figure reported for the same period of
the previous year, association officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to a survey by the association, only about
113 "batterers" have been ordered to receive medical examinations,
health checks and related education under a program called the
Batterer Treatment Program that was initiated by the Department of
Health two years ago.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Li-ping, who was
also present at the hearing, said it is worrisome that the number of
assailants, mostly husbands, who are taking part in the treatment
program is proportionally much less than that of the people who were
physically hurt.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang noted, the efficiency of the Batterer Treatment
Program is doubtful as even some personnel in charge of the program
in several medical institutions do not exactly know what it is they
are expected to do.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Bureau of Social Affairs under the Taipei City
Government reported Friday that the bureau's hotlines set up for
victims of domestic violence received nearly 5,000 calls for help
during the first five months of this year, a noticeable jump from
some 2,000 posted for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Bureau Director Chen Chiao-mei said the sharply increased number
of emergency calls for help indicated that domestic violence is on
the rise as a result of various reasons, including the floundering
economy, rising unemployment and the decline in social order.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out, however, that the nearly 5,000 calls included
calls made by the "batterers" themselves, who accused the bureau of
"intervening" in their own business at home and called the bureau "to
leave them alone."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SURVEY SHOWS PROFESSIONALS STILL IN HIGH DEMAND</HEADLINE>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, June 22 (CNA): A survey conducted by the manpower
resources Web site CTCareer indicates that professionals in IT
engineering, finance and securities, business administration and
marketing are still in high demand on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>CTCareer has recently joined with the manpower resources Web site
in mainland China -- ChinaHR -- to offer information on job
opportunities. An analysis of job opportunities posted on the two Web
sites shows that managers with MBA degrees are offered the highest
salaries plus bonuses and allowances among all the employed
population.</P>
      <P>The highest-paid professions in mainland China are business
managers, securities analysts, IT engineers and marketing
specialists; in Taiwan, the jobs with the highest income include IT
engineers, financial analysts, marketing specialists and computer
science research personnel.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that employees of the computer and Internet
sectors topped the list of high-income groups on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait before the burst of the Internet bubble. The highest
paid sectors now are medical instruments, telecommunications, and
electronics -- areas still related to high technology.</P>
      <P>Although the average annual income of the employed in Taiwan is
3.5 times of that in mainland China, Taiwan's job seekers are
interested in opportunities across the Strait, especially in business
administration.</P>
      <P>According to CTCareer, the average annual income of the employed
in Taiwan in 2000 was NT$502,488; in mainland China, the amount was
equivalent to NT$147,390.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars and analysts from Taiwan, Hong
Kong and mainland China discussed cross-strait relations in a just
concluded symposium in Hong Kong, a Hong Kong daily reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Ming Pao Daily News reported that the participants mainly
discussed the "one China" issue, the consensus reached between the
negotiators from two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1992, economic
exchanges of both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the year-end
elections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report said that the symposium, held June 19-20, was not open
to the public and mainland China scholars had repeated the stance of
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Mainland participants included Zhang Nianchi, director of the
Shanghai-Taiwan Research Institute; Xu Shiquan, director of the
Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences. Taiwan scholars included former Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Chang King-yu; Yen Chien-fa, director of the department of
mainland affairs of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP); Wu
Jui-kuo, special assistant to People First Party Chairman James
Soong; and Chang Jung-kung, director of the Department of Mainland
Affairs of the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Sources said that director reaffirmed China's stance that
resumption of the cross-strait dialogue should be based on the 1992
consensus, adding that "one China" principle will be the condition
for resuming cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>While Yen of the DPP reaffirmed President Chen Shui-bian's words
on the gradual integration of economic and cultural relations between
the two sides before they can discuss future political integration,
adding that the current cross-strait policy will be to maintain the
status quo.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted an unnamed source as saying that the symposium
was basically discussions on theory and was not an attempt to
announce government policies.</P>
      <P>But observers said that given the background of the participants,
the conclusions reached at the meeting could have an effect on Taipei
and Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China First Lady Wu
Shu-chen presided Friday over a christening ceremony for a new
container ship for Taiwan's Evergreen Group in the southwestern
Japanese port city of Kobe.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was held at the Mitsubishi Heavy Engineering
dockyard, where the vessel was built. The 78,000-ton container ship,
named Ever Eagle, rumbled down the slipway after Wu smashed the
traditional bottle of champagne across its bows.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, deputy secretary-general to the president, ROC
Representative to Japan Lo Fu-chuan, Evergreen Group Chairman Chang
Jung-fa and many other dignitaries from Taiwan and Japan attended the
new freighter's christening and launch ceremony.</P>
      <P>The Ever Eagle is the 28th container ship that Mitsubishi has
built for Evergreen Group, which operates the world's largest
container shipping fleet. It is also the largest and most advanced
container vessel that Mitsubishi has ever constructed.</P>
      <P>Wu arrived in Kobe Thursday for the ceremony at the invitation of
Evergreen Chairman Chang and was scheduled to return to Taipei
Saturday.</P>
      <P>It was Wu's second private trip to Japan since her husband Chen
Shui-bian assumed the ROC presidency in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has been confined to a wheelchair since being paralyzed
in a car accident 16 years ago, gave an interview to the Japanese
business daily Sankei Shimbun shortly after her arrival in Kobe in
which she said she has suffered heavy stress since her husband took
office in the ROC's first-ever democratic transfer of power between
different political parties.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she went on, she also feels proud that her husband
became the ROC's youngest president through a democratic election. "I
hope that my husband will redouble his efforts to help Taiwan win
dignified status in the international community," she said.</P>
      <P>Wu was run over by a car one day after her husband was defeated
in a county chief election in 1985. "The incident is a painful
memory, but I have never been daunted by any adversity. I tend to
face realities with an optimistic attitude. I don't like to indulge
myself in old memories and always set my eyes on the future," she
explained.</P>
      <P>The Sankei Shimbun also published an article in its Friday issue
titled "First Lady in a Wheelchair." The article said Wu's
straightforwardness and sense of humor have won her high popularity
among the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The paper is scheduled to publish details of Wu's interview in
early July.</P>

      <P>A high Court upheld Friday jail terms
handed down by a lower court to an arms broker and his former navy
contact for bribing navy officers in 1993.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High court upheld the 14-month sentences for arms
broker Cheng Cheng-kuang and former navy captain Liu Shu, in addition
to one-year deprivation of political rights for each of them.</P>
      <P>It was the fourth review of the case since it was sent back by
the Supreme Court to the Taiwan High Court for further review.</P>
      <P>Neither of the defendants were present in the courtroom to hear
the sentences, which can still be appealed within ten days.</P>
      <P>Cheng, a Taiwan representative for Italy's Fincantieri
shipbuilder, was charged with offering bribes through Liu to a group
of navy officers in 1993 in exchange for a contract to sell the navy
a spy ship at a price of NT$1.24 billion.</P>
      <P>The ship, described in relevant documentation as "an
oceanographic research ship" was actually designed for gathering
military intelligence and was christened the Takuan after being
delivered.</P>
      <P>The bribery came to light as a result of a navy probe into the
mysterious death in 1993 of a captain who was responsible for the

      <P>Liu retired from the navy before the case was unearthed and
worked as Cheng's aide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TIMETABLE FOR TAIWAN OPENING TO MAINLAND CHINESE TOURISTS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of Taiwan's doors to mainland
Chinese tourists will hinge on interaction between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, a senior mainland affairs official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"We'll not set a timetable for implementing the new open-door
policy. When mainland people are allowed to make sightseeing trip to
Taiwan will depend on cross-strait interaction," said Deng
Chen-chung, a vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Deng pointed out that the direct "mini three links" program
launched early this year can serve as a reference for other
cross-strait opening measures.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's reluctance to throw its full support behind
the "mini three links" program, Deng said, Taiwan has encountered
many difficulties implementing the program.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we must exercise more prudence in opening our doors
to prospective mainland tourists," Deng said, adding that as allowing
mainland people to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan will involve far
more complicated issues than the implementation of the "mini three
links" program, cross-strait interaction is very important.</P>
      <P>"The new open-door policy presents many problems, such as entry
quotas, emergency incident handling, law enforcement and handling of
rule-breaking incidents," Deng explained.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he went on, the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should enter discussions to ensure the new policy's smooth
implementation.</P>
      <P>Deng further said the Republic of China government will exercise
great flexibility in cross-strait interaction and engagements.</P>
      <P>He also said that the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, will study the feasibility of allowing Taiwan
companies to directly investment in mainland China. At present,
cross-strait investment must be made via a third place.</P>
      <P>"When the overall climate and conditions reach maturity,
including mainland China's commitment to protecting Taiwan investors'
legitimate rights and interests, we'll allow direct cross-strait
investment," he said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the mainland's protest over the ROC military's
test-firing of U.S.-made Patriot missiles Wednesday, Deng said the
tests were part of a routine weaponry testing program and had no
other purpose.</P>
      <P>Deng also clarified that MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen didn't
oppose Formosa Plastics Group's (FPG's) new investment projects in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to local press reports, FPG Chairman Wang Yung-ching's
recent slam on the government's cross-strait policy was mainland
a backlash on Tsai's opposition to FPG's mainland invesmtent
applications.</P>
      <P>Deng said the reports were not true. "During a recent
mainland invesmtent projects screening meeting, Tsai only
suggested that the FPG present more detailed information about its
new mainland investment projects, including capital sources,
management plans and profitability forecast," he explained.</P>

      <P>The 2001 annual conference of Kiwanis
International will kick off in Taipei Saturday, in which around
10,000 Kiwanis members from around the world will take part.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu are slated
to attend the formal opening and closing ceremonies in Linkou,
suburban Taipei, Sunday and Tuesday, respectively.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a welcome party for foreign participants of the
conference at the Taipei International Conference Center, Vice
Foreign Affairs Minister Wu Tzu-dan said the Republic of China has
long spared no efforts to promote humanitarian activities around the
world. As a constructive member of the international community, the
ROC is also committed to helping developing countries pursue peace
and prosperity, he said.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, the ROC government has sent agricultural
technology and medical missions to help many countries improve their
rice and vegetable cultivation and to help eradicate disease. The
Taipei authorities also provide vocational training to help those
countries develop their small- and medium-sized businesses, he went
on.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said, the ROC also cooperates with the Asian
Development Bank, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development
and the Inter-American Development Bank to offer multilateral
financial and technical assistance to needy countries.</P>
      <P>Stressing that it is very important to build mutual trust and
parity to create a better world, the vice foreign affairs minister
said Taiwan needs international backing and friendship and he voiced
his hope that "foreign friends" can extend their support to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kiwanis International is the only one of the world's four major
non-governmental organizations in which Taiwan can participate under
its formal national title of the ROC.</P>
      <P>After five years of efforts, Kiwanis International finally
approved Taipei's application to sponsor this year's annual
conference, the first of its kind in Asia since the organization's
establishment in 1915.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Echoing the position taken by the
Republic of China government, a senior U.S. official said Thursday
that Taiwan and mainland China should resume dialogue without
preconditions.</P>
      <P>Torkel Patterson, senior director of Asian affairs at the
National Security Council, said that ROC President Chen Shui-bian
"has followed the correct path" because he has been open to
discussion with Beijing.</P>
      <P>"I don't think there needs to be any preconditions for dialogue
between the two sides," Patterson added in answer to a reporter's
question related to the stalemate between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>This is believed to be the first time a Bush administration
official has openly expressed support for Taipei's position that no
preconditions be set for cross-strait dialogue but it was not known
whether he was following the official government line on the issue.</P>
      <P>Beijing has insisted that Taipei recognize the "one-China"
principle before any talks can restart, while Chen's government says
the question of "one China" can be an item on the agenda, but not a
precondition.</P>
      <P>Patterson also reiterated the long-standing U.S. position of not
mediating between the two sides. "I'd encourage both sides to meet
and discuss but the U.S. will not try to get involved in the
process," he said.</P>
      <P>On a trip to mainland China by President George Bush scheduled

channels of communication with his mainland Chinese counterpart,

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corporation (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang said Friday that his company
is not planning to invest in mainland China as the government has not
yet lifted its ban on mainland-bound investment by local hi-tech
industries.</P>
      <P>Although conditions exist in mainland China to make possible
six-inch silicon wafer manufacture, Chang said TSMC is not planning
to invest there within the next three or five years because his
company needs 12-inch silicon wafers and because of the current
government ban on hi-tech investment in the mainand by Taiwan firms.</P>
      <P>Noting that other industries may have different reasons for
investing in the mainland and that he is not in a position to comment
in this regard, Chang, however, said that the government should
remove its restrictions and he stressed that market mechanisms should
be respected.</P>
      <P>The TSMC head made the remarks during an interview with local and
foreign reporters.</P>
      <P>In the face of fierce competition from mainland China and
Taiwan's deteriorating investment climate, Chang asserted that
professional talent is the foundation for Taiwan's economic progress
and that the government must take action to improve the country's
overall conditions, ranging from adequate water and electricity
supplies to upgraded living standards, in order to keep local talent
at home.</P>
      <P>"In essence, the government must transform Taiwan into an
advanced country if it is to achieve this goal," he noted.</P>
      <P>Speaking of his career, Chang said he has not yet thought of
retiring and stressed that TSMC is a team infused with professional
elite. He likened the ties between TSMC and its clients to the
dynamics of a "big family" and attributed the company's success to
technology, service and good customer relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwan soy sauce makers Friday shrugged
off British warnings that some of their products may contain levels
of cancer-causing chemicals above safety standards.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Wan Jia Shian Brewery Co., one of Taiwan's
largest soy sauce manufacturers, said the company has improved its
soy sauce production process and product quality in recent years to
meet international standards.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said more than 80 percent of their soy sauce
products are produced by brewing and that fermented soy sauce is
free of any 3-MCPD -- a chemical that can cause cancer if taken
daily.</P>
      <P>British health officials began removing 22 brands of soy sauce
across the country Thursday after a warning from the Food Standards
Agency (FSA) that they contained levels of 3-MCPD above safety
guidelines.</P>
      <P>The brands were imported from Thailand, China, Hong Kong
and Taiwan. Products of two Taiwan firms -- Wang Jia Shian and
Kimlan Foods Co. -- were included in the list.</P>
      <P>The Wan Jia Shian spokesman said the company didn't have any
sales agent in Britain. "We must check to determine whether those
products were produced at our plants in Taiwan or the United
States."</P>
      <P>The spokesman said soy sauce products produced in Taiwan were
mainly for domestic sales and exporting to Japan and Singapore.
"All of our products have consistently been sent to the Hsinch
Foodstuff Industry Development Institute for inspection before they
hit market shelves to ensure that our product quality meets
international standards," he explained.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years, the spokesman went on, all soy sauce
products produced by the company's U.S. plant have also met U.S.
safety standards.</P>
      <P>At present, countries around the world have different
requirements for 3-MCPD levels. The 15-member European Union has set
a very stringent requirement of "no more than 0.01 parts per million
(ppm)" to be implemented next year. The current U.S. requirement is
0.1 ppm.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) is
planning to require soy sauce makers to keep 3-MCPD levels below 0.1
ppm from July 2002. The current requirement is no more than 1 ppm.</P>
      <P>Noting that only soy sauce produced through the process of
hydrolysis may contain levels of 3-MCPD, the Wan Jia Shian spokesman
said such products only account for a very small portion of the
company's overall output.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said the company has also taken measures to
minimize 3-MCPD levels in its products made through the hydrolysis
process.</P>
      <P>He added the company is expanding its plants in Taipei and
Pingtung counties to produce fermented soy sauce which is free
of any 3-MCPD level.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwan soy sauce maker, Kimlan Foods Co., said the
samples tested by the British Food Standard Agency could have come
from its mainland Chinese plant, where their products had traceable
levels of 3-MCPD. The company stressed that it has already stopped
such production there, adding that the products available in Britain
might be inventory products.</P>
      <P>"We have shifted focus to production of 3-MCPD-free soy sauce by
brewing," a Kimlan spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Shu-kong, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food
Sanitation, said his bureau has advised local soy sauce makers to
gradually reduce the levels of 3-MCPD. "We will be moving to
internationally accepted standards," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE INCREASED IN MAY TO 4.22 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan unemployment rate surged to a new
record high of 4.22 percent in May, which is a historic high for any
May and any single month, economics officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Because of the increasing number of firms that have closed or
downsized, the jobless population surged from 385,000, or 3.96
percent, in April to 411,000, or 4.22 percent, in May, according to
officials from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics.</P>
      <P>The figures are the highest ever since the government began to
compile unemployment figures in 1978.</P>
      <P>The May figures brought the average monthly jobless population in
the first five months of this year to 374,000 and threatened to push
the unemployment rate to 4.1 percent for the whole year.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the unemployed population found that people with
senior high school-level education registered the highest
unemployment rate of 4.65 percent, followed by those with a junior
high school-level education, at 4.59 percent.</P>
      <P>The figures might contradict a long-held belief that higher
education is a key to job security, according to analysts.</P>
      <P>An analysis by age shows that unemployment is most rampant among
people aged between 15 and 24, with 9.38 percent of them out of a
job, followed by those aged between 25 and 44, at 4.87 percent.</P>
      <P>The seriousness of the situation is also indicated by an
ever-longer unemployment period for these out of work, which
lengthened from 25.5 weeks on average in April to 25.7 weeks in May.</P>

1952: The four characters "Wu Wang Tsai Chu," an ancient saying

between the two countries. ROC-Macedonia diplomatic ties ended less
than a year later when Macedonian pro-Beijing forces gained the upper
hand in the nation's coalition government and transferred diplomatic
recognition to Beijing.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A man who withdraws himself from
the world for no other reason than to show his personal purity of
motive is one who breaks up one of the greatest ties in the
foundation of society. A good and wise man, on the other hand, who
enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to be
right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is
well aware of that."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>SKIRTS OF TYPHOON CHEBI SWEEPING THROUGH SOUTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Chebi, which had intensified from a
tropical storm over the past few days and was packing winds of up to
155 kilometers per hour Saturday, was expected to sweep across the
southern tip of Taiwan later in the day, according to the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>Chebi, the second typhoon to threaten Taiwan this year, was
expected to storm across the Taiwan Strait and make landfall near
Fuzhou in the southeastern mainland Chinese province of Fujian by
midnight, bureau meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Inspecting operations at the CWB and at a Cabinet-level central
disaster contingence center, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung called for
residents in low-lying areas in southwest Taiwan to heighten
vigilance against possible sudden inundations of sea water, as Chebi
brought torrential rains and heavy seas to the island and its
surrounding waters.</P>
      <P>Chang also instructed related government agencies to render every
possible help to Tungkang-based fishing boat Chingchingfa No. 16,
which had lost contact in the open seas off the northern Philippines,
after sending an SOS to the Tungkang Fishermen's Association late
Friday.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said, some 3,000 mainland Chinese fishermen
and laborers are currently taking shelter in fishing boats anchored
at seaports around the island because of the typhoon. He instructed
relevant government agencies to take good care of them.</P>
      <P>According to the weathermen, as of Saturday noon Chebi was
centered 90 km south of Taiwan's offshore island of Penghu. With a
radius of 200 km and packing winds of up to 165 kph, the weather
system was moving north-north west at a speed of 25 kph.</P>
      <P>Bearing the brunt of Typhoon Chebi were the southern counties of
Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, the eastern counties of Hualien and
Taitung, as well as the offshore islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu.</P>
      <P>Flights to and from the southern and eastern cities and the
offshore islands were canceled, the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) reported. Most of the international flights were not affected,
although Kaohsiung-Phnom Penn flights and Kaohsiung-Macau flights
were rescheduled some two hours earlier, according to CAA sources.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Finance Minister
Yen Ching-chang departed Taiwan Saturday at the head of a delegation

investment in the island.</P>
      <P>He said that he has already scheduled one-to-one side-meetings in
London with the investment representatives of 17 large international

reform efforts at the seminars.</P>
      <P>Touching on President Chen Shui-bian's recent proposal to
consider giving the economy a shot in the arm through tax cuts, Yen
said that such an economy-stimulating measure is often used elsewhere

      <P>However, he added that it will require the Legislative Yuan's
cooperation to amend related laws, as well as further coordination
and discussion with other government agencies.</P>

      <P>Some 700 overseas Chinese in the eastern
United States will welcome former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui at a reception upon his arrival at Ithaca, New York, on June
26.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles June 24 for a two-day
stay and then fly to Ithaca, where he will visit his alma mater,
Cornell University.</P>
      <P>It will be Lee's second visit to Cornell. He last visited in 1995
for the inauguration of a "Lee Teng-hui professorship" when he was
still president of the ROC -- a visit that incurred a strong protest
from Beijing, which saw the visit as a move to publicize Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Reception organizers said that because Lee is now a private
citizen, the preparations for his visit have been completed much more
easily than for his previous trip, as U.S. officals were under less
pressure from Beijing to restrict Lee's activities.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to deliver a lecture at the reception and
Cornell University President Hunter R. Rawlings III is expected
announce at a luncheon June 27 the formation of a "Lee Teng-hui

    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven young Taiwan cancer patients left for
a specially arranged visit to South Korea Saturday to convey the
"love" and concern of the people of Taiwan to South Korean
schoolchildren suffering from various forms of cancer.</P>
      <P>The seven youngsters -- Lin Chia-sheng, Wei Li-jung, Hsu
Wei-ling, Hsieh Shu-jung, Chen Hsun-fang, Lu Chien-yi and Kuo Wei-chi
-- were all recipients of a special global award dedicated to
encouraging people to love their lives.</P>
      <P>The five-day trip is being organized by the Chou Ta-kuan Culture
Foundation with a view to encouraging local young cancer victims to
pass on their personal experiences in fighting cancer to their South
Korean counterparts, said founder Chou Chin-hua.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Chang Po-ya met with Chou and the seven child
cancer patients before their departure and praised the children's
courage in facing adversity and standing up to help foreign friends.</P>
      <P>Chou founded the Chou Ta-kuan Foundation in memory of his son
Ta-kuan, who died at the age of 10 in May 1997 from a rare form of
cancer known as Rhabdomioparcoma.</P>
      <P>During the group's South Korean visit, Chou said, the Korean
version of a collection of poems written by his son during the last
eight months of his life will be launched.</P>
      <P>Ta-kuan wrote a total of 42 poems in his hospital bed in which he
described the physical and mental ordeals he endured in his struggle
for survival. The themes of the poems range from portrayals of
doctors and nurses to descriptions of documents diagnosing his
conditions to odes to life, health and freedom. The Chinese edition
of the collection remains high on the local best-sellers' list.</P>
      <P>Chou said royalties from the Korean edition will be donated to a
South Korean foundation dedicated to helping child cancer patients,
as well as to South Korea's Central 119 Rescue Team, which helped
rescue a child in Taiwan's Nantou County in September 1999 following
the disastrous 7.6-magnitude earthquake of Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>In support of the special travel program, the Taiwan branch of
U.S. Federal Express Corp. donated 1,000 model aircraft to the Chou
Ta-kuan foundation for presentation to sick South Korean
schoolchildren.</P>

      <P>Zhu Ying, a student of Montreal's Concordia University, was

June 21.</P>
      <P>Zhu told a press conference Friday that her detention was a
nightmare in which she was kidnapped, interrogated, threatened and
mentally tortured by state security officials.</P>
      <P>Scott Reid, a Canadian Alliance Party MP of Ontario set up the
cross-party pressure campaign to release Zhu along with Concordia
University Student Union, the Canadian Federation of Students,
Amnesty International and other NGOs.</P>
      <P>On May 31, Reid organized a joint news conference with other MPs

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CULTURE OFFICIAL VISITS SHANGHAI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai, June 23 (CNA)
(By Liao Chen-yi and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City's top culture official called
Saturday for all Chinese, regardless of where they live, to get rid
of the "Opium War complex" that has plagued them with a sense of
inferiority and humiliation for decades.</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai, director of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs under
Taipei City Hall, who arrived in Shanghai Friday for a nine-day "city
cultural exchange" visit, urged the Chinese to free themselves from
the "psychological nightmare" of the last century so as to allow them
to explore the much wider horizons of international cultural
assimilation.</P>
      <P>Writer-turned-official Lung is on her first visit to mainland
China since she assumed her post a couple of years ago.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a symposium on comparisons between city cultures of
Shanghai and Taipei held at Shanghai Normal University, Lung said
Taipei's solid economic power and well-educated citizens are the
city's advantages over Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The facts that Taipei never experienced any type of "cultural
revolution" and "suffered no cultural faults or isolation," gives it
another competitive edge over Shanghai, Lung claimed.</P>
      <P>She went on, however, that the spate of "inflow" into Shanghai in
recent years of "Taiwanese cultural, economic and creative elite," is
a worrisome trend to the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>Lung urged residents of Taipei and Shanghai to "cooperate" while
remaining "competitors," so that people from both cities can create
their own strengths through benign competition.</P>
      <P>Lung, who lived in Germany as a scholar and writer before being
invited by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou to return to Taipei to become an
official in 1999, was also a columnist for the Shanghai-based Wen Hui
Bao daily for three years prior to 1999.</P>
      <P>Her crisp comments, particularly a 1998 short story titled "Alas!
The Shanghai Men," which has been translated into English by the BBC,
have made her one of the most popular Chinese-language writers in
Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Wen Hui Bao and Shanghai Normal
University, Lung, a graduate of Taiwan's National Cheng Kung

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei police SWAT teams were mobilized
Saturday as a man claiming to have a "judicial grievance" took a tour
bus and its passengers hostage at gunpoint and demanded to meet with
Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan.</P>
      <P>The hijacker also asked to see Environmental Protection
Administrator Hau Lung-pin, who handled a similar crisis in 1998 when
he talked a man holding 26 bus passengers at knifepoint for over two
hours into surrendering to police.</P>
      <P>Chen and Hau both rushed to the city's Chung Ching North Road,

the scenes to allow the police to continue attempting to engage the
hijacker in communication.</P>
      <P>As of 5 p.m., after a nearly three-hour standoff, police had
still been unable to determine how many hostages were aboard the bus

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made an inspection
tour of an inter-department disaster relief center at the National
Fire Administration (NFA) to show his concern about damage caused by
typhoon Chebi.</P>
      <P>Chen said he appreciates the devotion of staff of various
government disaster relief agencies in their efforts to help minimize
typhoon-related damage and human casualties.</P>
      <P>He reminded relevant central government agencies and local-level
governments that although the typhoon was gradually moving away from
Taiwan, it might still bring heavy rain to the island.</P>
      <P>"We should pay heed to the possibility of flooding in low-lying
areas after the typhoon," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president also ordered relevant government agencies to pool
their resources and join forces with the Philippines to rescue a
Taiwan fishing boat, which had lost contact since sending out a
distress call in northern Philippine waters Friday evening.</P>
      <P>The Tungkang-based Chingchingfa No. 16 radioed for help after it
lost power and began taking on water. According to Foreign Ministry
officials, Philippine navy and coast patrol ships were still waiting
to mount a rescue mission as of Saturday morning due to the adverse
weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The northern Philippines and southern Taiwan had taken a
battering from typhoon Chebi.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC military rescue center, an ROC vessel was
dispatched to the vicinity of the Chingchingfa No. 16's last reported
coordinates but was unable to find the vessel, which also could not
be picked up by radar.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Chebi hit southern and southeastern Taiwan and the
offshore island of Penghu Saturday with strong winds and heavy rain.</P>
      <P>Preliminary government tallies showed that a 45-year-old man in
Chengkung, Taitung County had gone missing after a plastic raft he
and five other men were boarding capsized offshore. The five other
men were rescued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 72-year-old man in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung was injured by a falling shop billboard. He was later
reported to be in stable condition after medical treatment.</P>
      <P>The typhoon also caused a blackout to more than 37,400 households
in the Kaohsiung area and landslides were reported on some mountain
highways.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau, which forecast that Chebi would make
landfall near Fuzhou in southeastern mainland China early Sunday, was
expected to lift a land typhoon warning later Saturday.</P>
      <P>Airline flights to and from Taiwan's southern and eastern cities
and offshore islands were canceled due to the typhoon, but
international flights were generally unaffected.</P>

(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Was one of the core members of the leadership group behind the 1989
military crackdown on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square,
according to the mainland's former de facto envoy in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Xu Jiatun, former director of the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong
Branch, was quoted Saturday by the local English-language iMail as
saying that Jiang, who was Shanghai party chief at the time of the
crackdown, was called to Beijing and was involved in the
decision-making in the days leading to the bloody June 4 massacre of
student demonstrators in which hundreds were murdered.</P>
      <P>Xu reportedly said Jiang was put in charge of daily business in
the Secretariat of the Central Committee, the party's nerve center,
before the military's killing spree, even though he was still
nominally only secretary of the party's Shanghai municipal committee.</P>
      <P>Jiang, then a member of the decision-making politburo, was
elevated to membership of the Politburo's Standing Committee (PSC).
It was in his new roles as a member of the PSC and chairman of the

    <HEADLINE>`FAST 30' CAMPAIGN AIMS AT RAISING NT$ 100 M FOR THE NEEDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In what has become an annual tradition, a
"fast to help" drive to give participants the experience of feeling
hunger and prompt them to make generous donations to the needy, is
scheduled to kick off in Taipei July 1.</P>
      <P>This year's annual 30-hour fast, also sponsored by World Vision
Taiwan (WVT), is aimed at raising NT$100 million (US$2.9 million) to
help war-torn and famine-stricken people in 13 countries and 24 areas
around the world, including Kenya, Mozambique, Kosovo and El
Salvador, said WVT Executive Director Tim Shao.</P>
      <P>Shao said this year's "Fast 30," the 12th of its kind, carries
the theme of "live simply and help generously."</P>
      <P>Despite the current floundering economy in Taiwan, he added,
affluent Taiwanese people can still easily help people in need simply
by treating themselves to one less feast at a restaurant or by not
going to a movie and donating the money saved.</P>
      <P>Just NT$30 is capable of buying food for a child in Ethiopia for
two months, while NT$50 is capable of providing relief packages for a
four-member family in war-torn Kosovo, Shao noted.</P>
      <P>Shao said that for many previous participants, "Fast 30" is a
fond memory.</P>
      <P>Eighty-one-year-old grandfather Yin Chi-shan, who has taken part
in the annual "Fast 30" drive every year since 1992, said he enjoys
the program, which actually helps himself while helping other people.</P>
      <P>Noting that fasting for 30 hours poses no problem for him, Yin
called for more young people to join him to support the program.</P>
      <P>The 2001 "Fast 30" drive is scheduled to run until Sept. 30.
During the period, 750 supporters will experience their 30-hour fasts
on a train which will travel around the island July 28-29 to solicit
more support for the drive.</P>
      <P>WVT, one of Taiwan's major charity organizations, has sponsored
"Fast 30" for the past 11 years, in addition to sponsoring other
relief and medical aid activities in many countries around the world.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A nearly four-hour standoff between Taipei
police and two husband-and-wife bus hijackers ended Saturday evening
when SWAT teams stormed the bus and rescued the 13 hostages on board.</P>
      <P>No one appeared to have been injured in the process and police
said that guns wielded by the two hijackers turned out to be fake.</P>
      <P>The standoff came to an end quickly when Justice Minister Chen
Ding-nan acquiesced to the hijackers' demands by appearing in the
dense crowd of rubberneckers that had gathered at the scene. A woman
stepped off the bus and rushed toward Chen to deliver a petition of
grievance. The contents of the petition were not immediately known.</P>
      <P>Seconds after the woman left the bus, SWAT teams detonated two
flashbangs to disorient the remaining hijacker still aboard the bus
and shattered a window to attract his attention. Other policemen
swarmed in from the other side and took control of the situation.</P>
      <P>The incident began at around 2 p.m., when the hijackers forced
the tour bus they were on to come to a stop and then demanded to meet
with Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAVY RETAINS LAWYER TO HANDLE WARSHIP KICKBACK SCANDAL: NGHQ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Navy General Headquarters (NGHQ) said
Saturday it has commissioned a lawyer to protect its legitimate
rights in a kickback scandal involving its purchase of six
French-made Lafayette-class frigates 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>The NGHQ issued the statement after French judicial authorities
said Friday they had launched an investigation into the payment of
illegal commissions in France to grease the wheels of the warship
sale to Taiwan in 1991.</P>
      <P>French defense contractor Thomson-CSF sold the six frigates to
the Republic of China Navy for 16 billion French francs (about US$2.8
billion).</P>
      <P>According to the terms of the purchase contract, the ROC Navy is
entitled to reclaim any money later found to have been paid in the
form of commission for the deal.</P>
      <P>French judicial authorities decided to probe the frigate
commission scandal after the discovery by Swiss authorities of a bank
account containing 250 million Swiss francs (US$142 million), which
press reports there said was linked to a vast corruption scandal at
the French oil giant Elf.</P>
      <P>The investigation also followed remarks by former French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas, who told a newspaper this week that US$500
million in commissions were paid for the frigate sale and that the
money went to "personalities -- political and otherwise, in France
and elsewhere."</P>
      <P>Dumas also said the commissiomns should never have been paid
because the contract had already been drawn up and agreed upon.</P>
      <P>The frigate sale -- in which Elf officials were paid by
Thomson-CSF to procure support for the deal -- is one of several
cases under investigation in the many-tentacled scandal involving the
former state-owned French oil company. Dumas was last month sentenced
to six months in jail for receiving gifts paid for by Elf as part of
its lobbying effort.</P>

      <P>President Chen
Shui-bian said Saturday that the government should learn from private
enterprises and "join them in doing many things."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending a double ceremony to
celebrate both the Yu Chih primary school's 100th founding
anniversary and the inauguration of its new premises following
reconstruction made necessary by the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Chen first presided over a ribbon-cutting ceremony to unveil a
monument built to commemorate the post-quake reconstruction of the
school.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction project was jointly sponsored by the Ministry
of Education, the China Times, Winbond Electronics Corp. and Walsin
Lihwa Corp.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Chen stressed the importance of
education and children to the development of the nation, saying that
the reconstruction is not only the creation of a physical environment
but also the reconstruction of "a room for humane concerns."</P>
      <P>In addition to thanking the private enterprises involved for
their assistance in the reconstruction, Chen particularly praised
their spirit and said the government should learn from private
enterprises' efficiency.</P>
      <P>After listening to a recital of poems and watching a traditional
folk dance performance, Chen cut a birthday cake with a 95-year-old
alumni of the school to celebrate the school's 100th founding

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rescuers in southern Taiwan on Sunday found
an oil slick and three life buoys in the sea where a
Belize-registered freighter, the Guang Yuan, issued a mayday signal
the previous day.</P>
      <P>But rescuers, bracing strong winds and incessant rains brought
about by typhoon Chebi, said they have found no trace of the 22
mainland fishermen aboard the freighter. The search will continue
despite the treacherous weather conditions, they added.</P>
      <P>The life buoys marked Guang Yuan were found along the coast
between the mouth of the Tsengwen Creek and old Kuohsin Harbor, while
helicopters detected an oil slick five nautical miles south of
Tsengwen Creek.</P>
      <P>The 4,200-ton freighter, carrying 5,300-tons of gravel, was 1.8
nautical miles off Anping Harbor Friday afternoon, but could not
enter the harbor because of the low tide, and temporarily anchored to
wait for the next high tide the following day.</P>
      <P>But as typhoon Chebi hit southern Taiwan Friday night, Kaohsiung
Harbor prohibited ships from entering or leaving the harbor because
of the high winds and seas.</P>
      <P>Port authorities contacted captain Zhou Wenchao of the Guang Yuan
Saturday to see if everything on the ship was all right and were
reassured about the situation.</P>
      <P>But typhoon Chebi, passing through Tainan quickly Saturday
afternoon, whipped up rough waves off Anping Harbor. Anping Harbor
received a call for emergency assistance from the Guang Yuan at 3:30
p.m. Saturday, and failed to receive further response when it tried
to contact the freighter at 3:55 p.m.</P>
      <P>The coast guard sent patrol boats and the navy also immediately
sent vessels to join the search, but no survivors have been found.</P>
      <P>Anping Harbor said that the Guang Yuan, carrying a heavy load of
grovels, could have been seriously affected by high waves and could
have sunk quickly.</P>
      <P>Anping Harbor is the supplementary harbor of Kaohsiung.
Currently, about five or six freighters that ply international routes
moor in Anping Harbor every month, but tugboats and professional
guides have to depart from Kaohsiung to lead the vessels into the
harbor.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor is now planning to build four tugboats and
station one in Anping Harbor after they are completed in July or
August. In addition, a professional guide will also be stationed in
Anping Harbor.</P>

      <P>But both Lien and the U.S. political leaders he met had no

      <P>The former Republic of China (ROC) vice president also gave a
five-minute speech on Asia-Pacific security and Taipei-Beijing ties
during a panel discussion on U.S. engagement in Asia.</P>
      <P>Lien said the consensus reached in 1992 between Taipei and
Beijing on "one China" -- that there is only one China with its
definition varied between the two sides -- is the key to reopening
dialogue across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

for an independent Taiwan, has turned it back on the consensus since
it was swept into power one year ago, Lien said.</P>
      <P>The DPP's deliberate vagueness on the island's ties with mainland

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The couple who hijacked a tour bus Saturday
along the freeway leading to Taipei have been detained by a
prosecutor Sunday for further questioning after preliminary
interviews by police.</P>
      <P>Police said that Chang Wen-liang and his wife, Chuang Pao-yun,
appeared to be mentally unstable. Their discussions wandered wildly
in diverse directions while answering questions from the police.</P>
      <P>Investigators speculated that the two commandeered the tour bus
to underline their grievances against the government over three
separate incidents. One was that the couple said that a prosecutor
failed to question men who had allegedly beaten their son. Another
was a dispute over water and electricity bills. The couple also said
that they had requested a copy of their land title documents but had
been refused and they thought that this was unfair.</P>
      <P>Although the couple brought with them stacks of court documents
and copies of their written complaints filed with various government
agencies, police were baffled by their erratic writings, one
investigator said.</P>
      <P>The couple boarded a Kaohsiung to Taipei tour bus at Chubei, in
Hsinchu County on Saturday morning. The man then brandished a pistol
converted from a toy while the bus was near Chungli, Taoyuan County.

    <HEADLINE>AGENTS UNCOVER DRUG TRAFFICKING RING; SEIZE  55 KG OF AMPHETAMINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Agents of the Criminal Investigation Bureau
Sunday uncovered a drug trafficking ring and discovered 55 kilograms
of amphetamines in Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the bureau said that the drug trafficking ring
was run by Peng Tsun-fung, a gang leader whose activities covered
areas ranging from Hsinchu to Keelung.</P>
      <P>Peng, along with his family and other gangsters in the Hsinchu
area, has illegally smuggled drugs into Taiwan from the mainland by
using fishing boats and bamboo rafts.</P>
      <P>Preliminary estimates by police say that the ring has so far
brought over 1,000 kilograms of amphetamines into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In order to control the drug supply in Taiwan, Peng sent his son
to mainland China to set up a drug supply center, police said, adding
that his brother and his nephew acted as go-betweens for Taiwan and
the mainland to pick up and arrange for transportation and storage of
the drugs.</P>
      <P>The bureau uncovered a drug trafficking ring run by Lin
Lien-sheng and his family and discovered 30 kilograms of amphetamines
at the Patoutze Fishing Port near Keelung last April. Lin had
obtained the drugs from Peng's ring, police said.</P>
      <P>Chen Tai-hung, a shipowner and a follower of Peng, built hidden
compartments into six holds of a fishing boat in May to store the
drugs, police said.</P>
      <P>The boat took advantage of Typhoon Chebi to navigate directly to
Fuzhou in mainland China and brought back the drugs hidden in the
modified holds to Naliao Fishing Port near Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>The anti-drug police unit under the command of Prosecutor Wu
Tsung-kuang of the Panchiao Prosecutor's Office discovered 55
packages or the equivalent of 55 kilograms of amphetamines in a
secret hold under the bulwark of the ship Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Police then took into custody six suspects including Peng in
Hsinchu.</P>

      <P>One of the 22 mainland Chinese crew of a
missing freighter has been rescued, it was reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>A Belize-registered, 4,200-ton freighter was reported missing
Saturday afternoon off Anping Harbor, Tainan, after it sent a
distress signal to harbor authorities amid high winds and seas
brought about by Typhoon Chebi.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration sent helicopters and the navy also
sent vessels to search the area, but only found an oil slick and
three life buoys without any trace of the missing crew Sunday.</P>
      <P>But fisherman Hsu Tsung-ming of Chiayi County, while operating in
area between Chiayi and Yunlin, found a mainland fisherman, Chu Liwu,
caught in the oyster beds near Waishantingchou, off Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Chu, 33, was still conscious when he was rescued. He suffered
from multiple bruises and was mildly dehydrated. He was rushed to the
hospital for emergency treatment. Doctors said that he had multiple
cuts on both feet, but is otherwise uninjured.</P>
      <P>The coast guard learned that another crew member of the missing
freighter may have been picked up by a passing foreign ship and is in

    <HEADLINE>IS DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT SHIPPING A BOON FOR TAIWAN PORTS?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan shipping companies are eagerly
awaiting the opening of direct links between mainland China and
Taiwan, but a recent assessment by the government shows that
increased commerce will come with a cost.</P>
      <P>According to the report made by the Institute of Transportation
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC),
Keelung, Taichung and Kaohsiung harbors will face stiffer competition
from mainland China with the establishment of direct shipping ties
across the Taiwan Strait regardless of whatever advantages resulting
from the new openness.</P>
      <P>The assessment forecasts that by 2004, direct cross-strait
shipping will save as much as NT$1 billion in transshipment fees for
Taiwan shipping companies should the links be opened.</P>
      <P>The institute made the forecast on the grounds that direct
Taiwan-mainland shipping will save transshipment costs of US$100 for
each TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) containers and that the number
of cross-strait transshipment TEUs will increase to 1 million units
in 2004.</P>
      <P>The three international ports of Keelung, Taichung and Kaohsiung
on Taiwan's west coast will benefit most by the opening of direct
cross-strait shipping, the institute said.</P>
      <P>Keelung Port in northern Taiwan is expected to handle a much
larger number of cross-strait transshipped containers because it is
located closer to Fuzhou Port in mainland China's Fujian province and
to those northward other than Fuzhou. In addition, Keelung Port's
harbor duties are cheaper than those ports in neighboring Japan and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>Taichung Port in central Taiwan has the potential to integrate
different levels of industries on both sides because of its vast
hinterland and comprehensive loading, unloading, warehousing and
distribution and processing facilities following the linkage,
according to the assessment.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port in southern Taiwan, the world's fourth-largest
container port, will move a step closer toward its goal of
transforming into a shipping hub through direct cross-strait
shipping, as the MOTC is also actively streamlining the port's
operation.</P>
      <P>However, the institute pointed out that in addition to the
government's policy to open up, the possibility of making profits
will be the major element for local shipping firms while considering
whether or not to cash in on the cross-strait routes.</P>
      <P>Should actual profits be less than expected, it will be hard to
attract Taiwan-based shippers to operate cross-strait shipping, it
noted, adding that direct shipping between the two sides will become
a unilateral opening to the mainland Chinese side and produce a
greater negative impact on Taiwan's shipping industry.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait negotiation has been suspended since 1996, the
institute proposed that the private sectors of Taiwan and mainland
China take the initiative to conduct bilateral negotiations.
According to its assessment, private organizations of the two sides
can sign cooperative pacts under the supervision of respective
overseeing authorities to serve as the foundation for direct
cross-strait shipping in the initial stages.</P>

      <P>The Brazilian grandmother of a
five-year-old boy at the center of a high-profile custody battle was
reunited with the orphaned child in Tainan, southern Taiwan Sunday
evening.</P>
      <P>Rosa Leocadia Dasilva Ergui vowed to fight to bring the child,
Iruan Ergui Wu, or Wu Yi-hua in Chinese, who was born to a Taiwanese
father and a Brazilian mother, back to Brazil. The grandmother and
the boy were shown on television in a long embrace.</P>
      <P>The child returned to Taiwan with his father three months ago but
the father died shortly after and the child has since lived with his
uncle, Wu Hou-yuan in Chiehting Village, Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Ergui, accompanied by Adir Ferreira, the five-year-old boy's
Brazilian uncle, arrived In Taiwan Saturday. They and Paulo A.P.
Pinto, director of the Brazil Business Center, as well as their
lawyer, Hsu Wen-ping, earlier arrived at a hotel in Tainan to have a
meeting with Wu Sunday afternoon. The meeting was arranged by
Legislator Lin Yi-shih of the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Hsu explained that in accordance with ROC civil law, Mrs. Ergui
is the sole legal guardian of the boy, whose father gave guardianship
of the boy to Rosa before he returned to Taiwan. The mother of the
child died several years ago.</P>
      <P>But the meeting soured when Rosa Ergui saw that Wu didn't bring
along the child. She even said in exasperation that she felt that the
Wu family was without warmth and were being cold-blooded.</P>
      <P>She tearfully said that she had brought along with her the love
and concern for the boy for the past five years, as well as many of
the gifts and letters from children of Brazil.</P>
      <P>Wu was accompanied by Legislator Lin when he arrived for the
meeting. Lin said that they had wanted to greet Rosa Ergui at the
airport, and had hoped that she and the child's Brazilian uncle would
come to Chiehting Village, Kaohsiung to visit the child, but the
request was turned down and they didn't know why.</P>
      <P>The child was not with them because they thought the occasion was
not suitable for the child, Wu said.</P>
      <P>After discussions, both sides agreed to meet in closed-door
meeting with one interpreter with each.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the child played happily during the whole afternoon in
his Chiehting home, ignoring the media's question about whether he is
happy to see his grandmother.</P>
      <P>The Chiehting Village residents, not happy about the accusation
of being cold-blooded, gathered near Wu's family, holding placards
that said "we are family," and "we welcome the grandmother." They
said that they hoped that Rosa Ergui would come to the village to see
how Ergui lives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Sunday praised
International Kiwanis for its long-time dedication to social
development.</P>
      <P>Chen, speaking at the opening of the Kiwanis' 2001 conference in
Linkou, suburban Taipei, paid his respect to Kiwanis members for
their achievements in charity and public services.</P>
      <P>He said that International Kiwanis was established in Detroit,
the United States in 1915 with the aims of promoting cooperation
among the peoples and safeguarding peace, and has now developed to
such an important world organization with more than 600,000 members
in over 80 countries around the world.</P>
      <P>He added that the Kiwanis' Republic of China branch was formed in
1967. With 300 offices and 12,000 members around the island, the
Kiwanis' ROC club is now the largest Kiwanis branch in the
Asian-Pacific area and in areas outside of North America, winning
itself the right to host the 2001 Kiwanis conference, the third time
that a Kiwanis annual meeting was held outside of North America.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the gathering, which was participated by some
10,000 members from International Kiwanis member countries, will help
promote both the visibility of Taiwan in the international community
and mutual understanding between the people of the nation and other
parts of the world.</P>
      <P>The four-day conference began earlier in the day with a carnival
at the plaza in front of the Taipei City Hall. The carnival,
organized by the Republic of China Kiwanis club, featured dragon

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Sen. John McCain stressed Sunday
that the threat of terrorism, the threat of proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, and challenges from mainland China compel the
United States to not reduce its military capability.</P>
      <P>The senator said on TV that it is fine to get rid of the theory
that the United States should be prepared to fight two major wars at
the same time, but he opposes "using it as an excuse to reduce the
size of our military further and our capabilities further, and not
spend the money that we promised the American people, and make the
changes that we promised the American people we would" during the
presidential election campaign.</P>
      <P>Noting that the possibility of a two-war scenario has become less
and less likely, McCain said: "Let's not fool the American people
that we don't live in a very, very dangerous world."</P>
      <P>"Events where we have just had to pull our military units out of
ports all over the Middle East clearly indicate that the threat of
terrorism and the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, the rise of radical Islamic fundamentalism and of course
our challenges with China, compel us to not reduce our military
capability. In fact, we have got a lot of repair work to do," pointed
out the senator.</P>
      <P>When asked would he support and try to help President George W.
Bush find more money for increased defense spending, McCain replied:
"Absolutely."</P>
      <P>He said what he really wants to do with Bush is to eliminate
items that have nothing to do with national defense but have exploded
to billions in the past few years on defense appropriation bills. For
example, some US$250 million spending on breast cancer research in
the current defense bill ought to be put over in the Health and Human
Services bill, he said.</P>

      <P>There are no signs that mainland China will
conduct a massive-scale military exercise in the near future, a
Ministry of National Defense (MND) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was responding
to a report by Hong Kong's Ming Pao Daily News that mainland China's
People's Liberation Army (PLA) will prolong its ongoing military
drills on Dongshan Island and expand the exercise area.</P>
      <P>The MND official said the report was exaggerated and that there
are no concrete signs to suggest that the PLA is going to hold a
large-scale exercise.</P>
      <P>In reality, the official said, the PLA's current Dongshan Island
drills are routine and on a scale similar to those conducted in
previous years, with the participation of about 10,000 servicemen,
not 100,000 as claimed by the Hong Kong media.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said, the MND has not spotted any signs
that the PLA will expand its area of maneuvers to the East China Sea,
the Yellow Sea and the South China Sea -- another claim made by the
Hong Kong newspaper in its Monday issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that some Hong Kong news media often publish "exaggerated

the MND does not rule out the possibility that the Hong Kong media

defense and not be affected by false or exaggerated media reports,"

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN URGED TO USE PARAGUAY AS INTERNATIONAL GATEWAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Outgoing Republic of China Ambassador to
Paraguay Agustin Liu Sunday urged Taiwan businessmen based in
Paraguay to use the South American country as a gateway to launch
their international ventures.</P>
      <P>In the face of the sweeping globalization trend, Liu said, Taiwan
business people here should first turn Paraguay into a regional food
supply and telecommunications center, as well as a distribution,
transport, and exhibition hub for computer parts and components,
before expanding into the international market.</P>
      <P>In addition to the country's rich natural resources and abundant
water and electricity supplies, Paraguay has the potential to become
a world food supply center and a regional exhibition, transport, air
traffic, and distribution telecommunications hub because of its ideal
location, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that it was decided in a recently concluded summit
of the Southern Common Market in Asuncion to authorize Paraguay to
produce automobile accessories for sale to neighboring countries, Liu
suggested that Taiwan businessmen could consider setting up factories
to make car and motorcycle components.</P>
      <P>The ROC ambassador made the remarks during a conference with
Taiwan businessmen operating in Paraguay. The meeting was held in the
Brazilian city of Foz do Iguacu, which borders Paraguay's Eastern
City.</P>
      <P>The previous evening, Liu took part in a banquet sponsored by the
Chinese community of Eastern City in Foz do Iguacu, in which he was
awarded the keys to Eastern City by the city's mayor in recognition
of his contributions to the city over the past seven-and-a-half
years.</P>
      <P>Liu is slated to leave his current post June 30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL NOT ESTABLISH NEW PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, June 24 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui said during a flight that arrived in Los Angeles Sunday that
he will not establish a new political party in Taiwan and is only
interested in "nurturing more young people."</P>
      <P>Arriving from Taiwan for a two-day transit stop en route to
Cornell University, his alma mater in Ithaca, New York, Lee denied
media reports that he is prepared to form a new political group of
"pro-Lee" legislators who will work together with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to gain a legislative majority in
the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Lee was also chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), the largest
opposition party in Taiwan, before stepping down from that post last
March following the defeat of his protege, Lien Chan, in the
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>He said that when he saw the poor domestic economic performance
and the unstable political situation over the past year, he was
concerned the democratic political system he helped establish after
much difficulty seemed to be close to collapse.</P>
      <P>Lee speculated that "the problem lies in the legislature," where
the KMT retains a comfortable majority over the DPP and together with
other opposition parties has presented a major obstacle for the
ruling administration -- in effect a minority government.</P>
      <P>He said that he is willing to help young and capable people with
a clean image get elected in the upcoming legislative elections, when
all 225 seats are up for grabs.</P>
      <P>Lee added that he is not trying to cut into the KMT or DPP vote,
or to take away their people.</P>
      <P>Upon arriving at his hotel in Los Angeles, Lee was greeted by
both supporters and protesters. About 300 well-wishers turned out to
show their support for Lee, while another 200 protesters shouted
slogans claiming that Lee was "disrupting politics and destroying
parties."</P>
      <P>Some of the protesters were overseas members of the KMT, students
from Taiwan and even some mainland Chinese immigrants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, three branches and a party service center of the KMT
in the Western U.S. area jointly released an open letter to Lee,
condemning his support of the DPP and urging him to continue to
follow the teachings of his own party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG MAKES INSPECTION TOUR OF TUNGSHA ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung made an
inspection tour of Tungsha (Pratas) Island Monday to express his
concern about the well-being of Republic of China Coast Guard staff
members stationed on the small island in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>During his inspection tour, Premier Chang reaffirmed the ROC's
stance that any South China Sea disputes, particularly sovereignty
disputes over the Spratlys, should be resolved strictly by peaceful
means.</P>
      <P>This was Chang's first trip to Tungsha Island, some 240 nautical
miles southwest of the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung, since
he took over the premiership last October.</P>
      <P>Chang flew to Tungsha Island in the company of Vice Premier Lai
Ing-jaw, Minister of National Defense Wu Shi-wen, National Coast
Guard Administration head Wang Chun and Deputy Kaohsiung Mayor Lin
Yung-chien.</P>
      <P>Chang presented the coast guard staff stationed on the island
with NT$100,000 (US$2,941.18) in celebration of the Dragon Boat
Festival, which fell on Monday this year.</P>
      <P>The South China Sea is rich in natural resources, including crude
oil and marine resources. Many countries have been expanding their
presence in the area and conflicts have been reported from time to
time. Mainland China reportedly intends to make the South China Sea
its "inland territorial waters."</P>
      <P>Premier Chang said Tungsha Island symbolizes the ROC's
sovereignty claim to the South China Sea. Moreover, he said, Tungsha
Island occupies a very important strategic location as it sits at the
center of waters important to mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan
and at a strategic point in major Taiwan Strait sea lanes.</P>
      <P>Noting that true peace relies on strength, Chang encouraged all
ROC personnel stationed on the island to beef up defense capabilities
to ensure the ROC's territorial integrity.</P>
      <P>Quoting the ROC' Policy Guidelines for the South China Sea
adopted in 1993, Chang said the ROC is willing to cooperate with
other countries in exploring and managing resources in the South
China Sea and in protecting the ecology the area.</P>
      <P>Chang encouraged coast guard staff stationed on the island to
step up ecological protection and to crack down on fishing boats that
operate illegally in the area. "Of course, you should also take care
of fishermen who encounter troubles or disasters in the region," he
added.</P>
      <P>In the past, the ROC posted marines on Tungsha Island. Starting
last year, coast guard officers took over garrison and patrol
missions there. There are runways and piers on the island. The ROC
air force's C-130 transports airlift supplies to the island
regularly.</P>
      <P>Tungsha Island is now under the jurisdiction of the Kaohsiung
City Government. Deputy Kaohsiung Mayor Lin Yung-chien said the
operator of a 27,000-ton passenger ship is negotiating with the city
government for starting tour services to Tungsha Island.</P>
      <P>Lin said the city government will step up efforts to develop the
island's tourist resources, with fishing and diving as main
attractions of Tungsha package tours.</P>
      <P>A coast guard officer said Tungsha Island has beautiful ocean
scenery and fishery resources, particularly lobsters, crabs and other
marine resources.</P>
      <P>If the government wants to develop the tourist industry in the
Tungsha Island area, the officer said, power and water supply
facilities must be improved first.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CUSTODY BATTLE OVER BRAZILIAN-CHINESE BOY TEMPORARILY STALLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung  County,  Taiwan,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The atmosphere of a
high-profile international custody battle over a five-year-old
Brazilian-Chinese boy turned sour again Monday after what seemed like
a breakthrough earlier in the morning.</P>
      <P>Rosa Leocadia Da Silva Ergui, the Brazilian grandmother of the
child, Iruan Ergui Wu, or Wu Yi-hua in Chinese, visited the house of
Iruan's uncle, Wu Hou-yuan, in Chiehting Village, Kaohsiung, where
the boy has been living for the past few months, supposedly following
his father's last wishes.</P>
      <P>At first, the meeting appeared amicable as the entire village
turned out to welcome Ergui. Her lawyer Hsu Wen-ping said that
hostility no longer exists between the two sides, and that after
seeing Wu's living conditions, Ergui does not rule out the
possibility of allowing Iruan to stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was the second time that she has been able to see Iruan since
she arrived in Taiwan two days ago.</P>
      <P>She is the child's legally appointed guardian after his mother
died several years ago. Iruan was brought back to Taiwan in March by
his father, a local sea captain who died a week afterward.</P>
      <P>The meeting turned sour when during lunch Ergui asked to be able
to spend an hour alone with Iruan, a suggestion that was turned down
by the boy's uncle. Wu told her that he would accompany the two of
them wherever they wanted to go.</P>
      <P>With that, Ergui left, claiming that she was not feeling well.
Afterward, she said through her interpreter that she had thought both
sides were sincere, yet Wu still did not seem to trust her alone with
the child.</P>
      <P>After she left, Wu said that he did not refuse Ergui because he
didn't care about human emotions, but rather because he was worried
what would happen if some problem were to occur while the two were
alone.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of Wu, Kuomintang legislator Lin Yi-shih, who
has been closely helping the Wus with the custody battle, claimed
that when Ergui was invited to dinner together with the family and
the boy the previous evening, she would not let go of him and even
intended to threaten to cut her own wrist.</P>
      <P>That was the reason the Wu family refused her request to be alone
with the child, Lin added.</P>
      <P>The two sides decided to let their lawyers negotiate in the
meanwhile, and an originally scheduled meeting for Tuesday between
the two sides was temporarily canceled.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian
visited a centuries-old temple Monday in Taichung as part of the
celebrations for the Dragon Boat Festival.</P>
      <P>The Dragon Boat Festival is one of the most important Chinese
festivals and the president chose to mark the day with a visit to the
Wanhe Temple in Taichung, central Taiwan, where he was welcomed by
thousands of worshipers and people from nearby shops.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by several government officials responsible for
cultural affairs, Chen offered incense to the folk deity Matsu, the
Goddess of the Sea, one of the most popular deities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was happy to see the positive spirit of the local
people and said that this was not the first time that he had visited
the 317-year-old Wanhe Temple. Chen said that the temple was
well-known for the many charitable activities that it had sponsored
in years past. He also said the temple has set a good example of
compassion and has contributed much to society.</P>
      <P>While in Taichung, the president also opened the central Taiwan
office of the National Cultural Association, of which Chen is
chairman. Chen encouraged the workers there to contribute to the
promotion of Taiwan culture.</P>
      <P>During the Dragon Boat Festival, also known as Poet's Day, rowing
races are held and glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves
are eaten in remembrance of Chu Yuan, a famous scholar-statesman of
the Warring States Period. Chu drowned himself after failing to
convince the king of Chu to guard the kingdom against the enemy.</P>
      <P>Chen said the opening of the Taichung office of the National
Cultural Association was a significant event and he hoped that the

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no room in the domestic market
for a new petroleum company because of fierce competition in Taiwan,
Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Vice President J. H. Hsieh said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Since the government's opening of the local market in 1987 and
the entry of Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) in September 2000, supply
has outpaced demand in Taiwan's petroleum market. "No third petroleum
company would be able to survive in the domestic petrochemical
market," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The local downstream petrochemical sector has requested the
Executive Yuan to allow them to market their goods in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although challenged by foreign competition, the FPG and pressure
from privatization, Hsieh said the CPC has been able to pull in
NT$360 billion each year. He said that annual profit earmarked for
the government and taxes contributed by the CPC to the national
coffers also averages more than NT$20 billion and NT$100 billion,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In an effort to tackle increased competition following Taiwan's
long-awaited admission into the World Trade Organization, the CPC has
also taken measures to slash its production costs over the past three
years, Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>Although 48 percent of a group of recently

been "foundering" over the past year, 54 percent said they will
continue to support the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>According to the poll, which was conducted by a weekly

      <P>Also, 53 percent of the 632 northern Taiwan university students
polled said they will not support President Chen Shui-bian if he
seeks another four-year term.</P>
      <P>However, 54 percent of the respondents said that they will
support the DPP and are hopeful to see it become a majority party in
the legislature after the year-end elections. The primary reason for
supporting the DPP, according to 26 percent of the respondents, is
because "other parties are too lousy."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 41 percent of the students said that they believe if
the DPP controls the legislature, where it is currently a minority,
then "Taiwan's political situation will become better."</P>
      <P>Also, 60 percent of the respondents said that Chen should create
a coalition Cabinet with opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Regarding the rising domestic unemployment rate, nearly 75
percent said that the fault should not lie with the DPP

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
arrived in San Francisco from Denver, Colorado, Sunday after
attending a symposium on international issues in Beaver Creek,
Colorado.</P>
      <P>Lien would not comment on the details of his meeting with United
States leaders at the World Forum, organized by the American
Enterprise Institute, saying only that it was very good to exchange
views with more than 100 world leaders on international issues.</P>
      <P>He brushed aside questions from waiting journalists at the
airport about his opinions on reports that former KMT Chairman Lee
Teng-hui is putting together a political organization outside the
party.</P>
      <P>One of Lien's aides said it never occurred to Lien to telephone
Lee, who arrived in Los Angeles Monday on his way to visit his alma
mater, Cornell University, in New York.</P>
      <P>Taipei's representative to Washington, Chen Chien-jen, who
attended the World Forum in Colorado along with Lien, flew from
Denver to Los Angeles to greet Lee Sunday. Lien was accompanied by
Stephen Chen, former Republic of China representative to Washington.</P>
      <P>Lee is reportedly trying to set up a political movement of
Taiwanese politicians to run in the year-end elections against the
KMT because he believes the KMT under Lien's leadership has strayed
from the ideology that he had fostered during his 12-year tenure as
KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile in Taipei, KMT lawmakers are planning to give Lien a
warm greeting at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan
when he returns to the island on Wednesday, according to a Taipei
evening newspaper, the China Times Express.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted KMT sources as saying Monday that the party
legislators, especially Lee's former followers, will voluntarily
gather to welcome their chairman to quell speculations that many of
them will desert the KMT and join Lee's movement.</P>
      <P>The enthusiastic welcome for Lien will be in sharp contrast to
the lukewarm send-off that Lee received at the same airport on Sunday
when he left for Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Lee was seen off then by Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
and a cluster of KMT officials. Many KMT heavyweights were
conspicuous by their absence at the occasion, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted KMT sources as saying that the party will not
officially jettison its former leader before Lee announces the
formation of his own movement, but that Lien's status as the party
leader is very solid with or without Lee's endorsement.</P>

and business leaders meet to explore various global economic, social

    <HEADLINE>ROC FINANCE MINISTER IN LONDON TO LURE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  25 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Finance Yen
Ching-chang encouraged international investors Monday to participate
in Taiwan's financial markets and promised to give them "national
treatment."</P>
      <P>Yen, who is in London heading a delegation of local finance and
high-tech industry leaders for a 10-day tour of major European
financial centers, said at a trade seminar in London that Taiwan
realizes the importance of foreign capital in the development of
Taiwan's financial markets, and is accelerating its financial reforms
and improving its investment environment.</P>
      <P>He said foreign investors always closely watch the financial
situation of a country in which they want to invest. Yen emphasized
that Taiwan's foreign debt constitutes only 24.4 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP), far lower than the 60 percent permitted by
the Maastricht Treaty signed by European countries in 1992,
indicating that Taiwan's financial situation is quite healthy.</P>
      <P>Yen also said he believes that Taiwan's economic growth can reach
4 percent this year. He admitted, however, that the ratio of the
nation's overdue loans has increased more than in the past, but he
believes that the ratio will be kept under control by measures
adopted by the government.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has assigned 2001 as the year for financial reform, which
Yen says demonstrates its determination to tackle the problems,
adding that related financial bills that have been passed by the
legislature and those which will be passed in the future will be good
news for foreign investors. He also said that after tax reform,
Taiwan's average tax has been reduced to 13.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Underlining the difference between investment environments of
Taiwan and its neighboring countries, Yen said under current
financial reforms, Taiwan's financial structure will be further
reinforced and can weather further difficulties.</P>
      <P>Yen said he believes that the improved and more transparent
investment environment in Taiwan will attract more attention from
European investors.</P>
      <P>During his stay in London, Yen will meet with representatives of
many important international financial institutions. Yen's European
tour will also bring him to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris.</P>

      <P>Professional athletes from Taiwan

      <P>The 10-city, 15-day run began June 16 in Taipei. As of Monday,
cross-strait runners have raced in Taiwan in Taipei and Kaohsiung,
and in China in Shenzhen, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi and
Nanjing.</P>
      <P>The start of Monday's three-kilometer run was jointly presided
over by Kong Qingpeng, the chairman of Jiangsu province's sports
federation, Yang Chuan-kuang, the leader of Taiwan's athletes in the
event, and Che Xiangdong, the leader of mainland China's runners.
Some 2,000 local people joined professional athletes in the run which

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY SAYS BEIJING MAY POSTPONE WAR GAMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China is likely to postpone its
planned war games near Dongshan Island off Fujian province because
of Typhoon Chebi that wreaked havoc in the coastal areas of mainland
China, a spokesman for the Ministry National Defense said Monday.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng made the observation when asked to
comment on a news report from Hong Kong that said the Communist
Chinese military will stage large-scale military exercises because of
the test-firing of Patriot missiles by Taiwan last week.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the People's Liberation Army will have to delay
its amphibious landing operations around Dongshan Island because of
the damage wrought by Typhoon Chebi, which swept through the Taiwan
Strait several days ago.</P>
      <P>Huang said that there has been nothing irregular detected by the
defense ministry which would lead them to believe that the PLA is
gearing up for extended military exercises.</P>
      <P>The PLA regularly stages war games between March and October each
year, Huang said, adding that Dongshan Island is a common site for
the amphibious landing exercise. He said that there is no indication
that the programs of the drill and the number of military personnel
involved in it this year are anything different from previous years.</P>
      <P>Huang made the comments after a Hong Kong newspaper, the Ming Pao
Daily, said Monday that Beijing will extend its ongoing military
exercises on Dongshan Island in response to Taipei's test-firing of
its U.S.-made Patriotic Advanced Capacity-2 anti-missile defense
system on June 20.</P>
      <P>The PAC-2 missiles were deployed to counter Beijing's missile
threat to the island and the test-firing, the first outside the
United States, was deemed by Beijing as a provocation, according to
the Ming Pao.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to allay any public concerns over Beijing's saber
rattling against Taiwan, Huang said his ministry has always kept a
close eye on China's military movements and will keep the public
informed of events, but will not reveal information that could
compromise ongoing intelligence work or issues of national security.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that as the test-firing of the Patriot missiles
were routine and not provocative, he saw no reason for Beijing to be
overly concerned with the tests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE CONVENES EXTRAORDINARY SESSION TO DEBATE FINANCIAL BILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   26   (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan convened an
 extraordinary session Tuesday at the formal request of President Chen
 Shui-bian to discuss six pressing financial reform bills.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of a resolution by a 85-63 vote in the
 legislature earlier in the day calling on Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
 to report on the significance of the bills, Chang said that although
 he believes the resolution does not conform with related laws and
 constitutional norms, he would report to the legislature in the
 afternoon out of respect and partisan harmony, and out of hope that
 the bills' passage will infuse renewed vitality into the economy.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said that the resolution
 -- the first time that a premier has ever been requested to report to
 the legislature at an extraordinary session -- was not illegal or
 unconstitutional, but that it was a new constitutional precedence.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislators criticized the
 resolution as setting a "bad precedence," and that the demand for
 Chang's presence was "seriously sidetracking" the main issues to be
 discussed at the special session.</P>
      <P>However, opposition Kuomintang legislators said that the session
 has been convened primarily because the Executive Yuan requested it,
 and that the premier should therefore report to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The two-day special meeting marked the first time in the nation's
 history that an extraordinary legislative session was convened twice
 in the same year.</P>
      <P>A previous session was convened Jan. 30 to debate the
 controversial issue of whether work on a partially completed nuclear
 power plant project should recommence after being halted last
 October.</P>
      <P>Only two other extraordinary sessions have ever been convened in
 the past. In 1951 and 1952, special sessions to debate pressing
 international treaties with Japan were convened.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution, the country's lawmakers gather for two
 regular sessions each year, one lasting from February to May and the
 other from September to December. Extraordinary sessions may be held
 at the request of the president, or after a vote by more than 25
 percent of the legislators.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An evaluation report by the Taiwan
 Institute of Economic Research forecasts Taiwan's economic growth in
 the second quarter of this year at only 1 percent, less than the
 government's expectation of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the non-governmental research institute,
 said that the government's forecast is based on a presumption that
 the government's economic stimulus measures can be approved by the
 Legislative Yuan and be effectively implemented.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the composite indicator which reflects
 business climate seen by manufacturing companies dropped to 89.22
 points in May, down 4.93 points from the previous month.</P>
      <P>After dropping to an all-time low of 88.34 points in January, the
 composite indicator registered surges in February, March and April.
 However, as the forces of rebound failed to sustain the impact of the
 global economic slowdown, it receded again in May.</P>
      <P>The report says that the business climate may show signs of
 recovery at the end of the third quarter or the beginning of the
 fourth quarter, though the development may be affected by
 unpredictable factors.</P>
      <P>The U.S. economic recovery and an improvement in the
 international economic climate remain the keys to Taiwan's economic
 prospects, the report says.</P>
      <P>It adds, however, that both the legislature and the
 administration should improve their efficiency in improving the
 domestic investment environment, boost domestic demand, encourage
 investments in infrastructure, and relax monetary policies.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
 signed an agreement with his Guatemalan counterpart, Marco A.
 Ventura, Tuesday to help train youth from the Central American
 nation.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, the Republic of China will train Guatemalan
 youths in Taiwan for one year in skills that will enable them to
 start their own businesses. The program will be made available to a
 maximum of 20 people.</P>
      <P>Officials with the International Cooperation Department under the
 Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the project will promote the
 ROC's experience in small- and medium-sized industry development, as
 well as enhance the trade and economic relations between the two
 countries.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the Guatemala youth will also help the
 ROC's exports if they buy machinery from Taiwan after returning to
 their homeland. Domestic manufacturers who take the Guatemalan
 trainee could also use the chance to increase their trade
 opportunities to invest overseas.</P>
      <P>The Guatemalan youths will be trained in electrical engineering,
 auto mechanics, construction, food and metal processing.</P>
      <P>The officials said Guatemala is well situated as the gateway to
 central America, and is near the economic free trade zone in Mexico
 which services the United States and Canada. Guatemala also enjoys
 preferential tariff treatment from Europe and the United States.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Ministry of Finance showed that trade
 between the ROC and Guatemala in 2000 totaled US$111.12 million, with

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS ROC SUPPORTS GLOBAL ANTI-LANDMINE CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he is
 willing to sign an international declaration against landmines and
 warfare on behalf of the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>"We are more than willing to sign the declaration to show our
 opposition to the use of landmines and military force and to signify
 our support for love and peace," Chen said while meeting with
 visiting Cambodian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tun Channareth.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Channareth for his longtime devotion to the global
 anti-landmine and anti-warfare campaign. "Anti-landmines, anti-war,
 love and peace are just like freedom, democracy and human rights.
 They are all universal values," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president further said the ROC fully supports the activities
 of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), of which
 Channareth is now a goodwill ambassador.</P>
      <P>The ICBL, founded in 1990, is now a coalition of more than 1,000
 non-governmental organizations in over 60 countries. The campaign and
 its director, Jody Williams, as well as Channareth were co-winners of
 the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>"I admire the ICBL's anti-landmine campaign. Its activities are
 significant. It will never go it alone. The ROC government will not
 hesitate to support its cause," Chen told his guest.</P>
      <P>For his part, Channareth said during his visit to the ROC's
 frontline island of Kinmen a few days ago that he was impressed by
 the ROC government's efforts to hire foreign engineers to assist in
 clearing landmines from the offshore island.</P>
      <P>"I think that your country can ask the United Nations to send its
 demining experts to help clean up Kinmen," Channareth said, adding
 that he hopes Kinmen can soon become a landmine-free area.</P>
      <P>Channareth further suggested that the ROC government offer
 landmine victims more support and care to help them rebuild their
 lives.</P>
      <P>Channareth admitted that promoting the anti-landmine drive is no
 easy task. "But I'll never be daunted by any difficulty and will
 continue carrying out the campaign," he said, adding that more than
 140 countries around the world have signed the ICBL-initiated
 anti-landmine declaration. "I look forward to seeing all countries
 around the world endorse the declaration and restrict the use of
 landmines," he said.</P>
      <P>Channareth, an ex-soldier who lost both his legs in 1982 when a
 landmine exploded while he was patrolling with his troops near the
 Thai border, arrived in Taiwan last Thursday to take part in a series
 of activities aimed at helping the public understand the hazards of
 landmines and experience how it feels to be confined to a wheelchair.</P>
      <P>According to U.N. estimates, about 110 million landmines still
 exist in the world, with over 100,000 of them located on the ROC-held
 frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, both of which lie far closer
 to mainland China than to Taiwan. Channareth urged Taiwan to pass a
 law banning landmines to prevent further civilian injuries.</P>

 Tuesday at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, Ambassador
 Bagher Asadi of Iran, chairman of the Group of 77 (G-77), called on
 the developed nations of the world to increase their contributions to

      <P>Asadi, echoing the words of the secretary-general earlier at the

 said that the funds made available so far are simply inadequate for
 an effective campaign against the deadly virus. Asadi also emphasized
 the importance of debt relief to free national resources in
 developing countries.</P>
      <P>Asadi considered the 26th Special Session of the United Nations
 General Assembly a welcome development and a timely indication of the

 the situation as a major crisis, he said that the world now seems to

      <P>He expressed hope that the special session would be able to
 muster the necessary political will and the requisite resources to

      <P>The G-77 chairman also welcomed the decision of some of the major

 developing countries to afford.</P>

 legal recourse to gain custody of the orphaned child.</P>
      <P>Rosa Leocadia Da Silva Ergui's three-day trip to Taiwan ended
 after talks with the Taiwanese uncle of the child failed to produce a
 consensus on the issue of guardianship of five-year-old Wu Yi-hua --
 or Iruan Ergui Wu as he is known in Brazil.</P>
      <P>Ergui was appointed by a Brazilian court to be the boy's guardian
 about three years ago after his mother died. However, following what
 were supposedly his father's last wishes, Iruan has been living with
 his uncle in Taiwan after his sea captain father died in March.</P>
      <P>The uncle, Wu Huo-yen, said that because the local Brazilian
 representative office did not answer questions about when Ergui would
 be flying out of Taiwan, he felt that the Brazilian side was not
 reciprocating his offer of good will. Wu did not see Ergui off at the
 airport.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuomintang legislator Lin Yi-shih, who has been
 closely helping the Wus with the custody battle, questioned the
 motives behind Ergui's just-concluded trip.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Ergui had continuously tried to create friction
 between the two sides and even "acted out" in front of a Brazilian
 television camera the determination that she would bring Iruan back
 to Brazil or else slit her own wrists.</P>
      <P>He charged that her crying and not letting go of the child seemed
 aimed at creating a scene of tragic familial separation for the
 viewers back in Brazil.</P>
      <P>Lin also questioned Ergui's sometimes amicable, sometimes hostile
 attitude, citing as an example the previous evening when she seemed
 pleasant when the television crew was on hand to witness her
 returning the child to the Wu family after spending two hours alone
 together, and then doing an about-face immediately after the media
 left by being unwilling to engage in any further communication with
 the Wus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FINANCE MINISTER CONFIDENT OF PROMOTION EFFORTS IN BRITAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Republic of China Minister of
 Finance Yen Ching-chang said Monday that his efforts to promote
 investment in Taiwan will see positive results after his intensive
 round of meetings in Britain.</P>
      <P>Yen, in London at the start of a five-nation European tour,
 delivered a speech at a seminar to promote Taiwan's investment
 environment in which he made specific mention of his country's
 ongoing financial reforms.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yen spent most of Monday meeting with executives of
 international investment management companies, including Goldman
 Sachs, Legal &amp; General, Gartmore, Britannic and Aegon.</P>
      <P>Yen tried to sell them on Taiwan's overall environment and lauded
 especially the lure of high-tech shares and financial stocks in the
 Taiwan stock market.</P>
      <P>He noted that with the rising labor and land costs in Taiwan, as
 well as the environmental impact assessment of any investment
 projects, it is more difficult to attract foreign manufacturers to
 set up plants in Taiwan, although he stressed that shares in the
 above two categories are still attractive.</P>
      <P>Yen pointed out that Taiwan's high technology shares have a
 competitive edge in Asia and rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Although he admitted that there are still some misgivings about
 Taiwan's financial systems, he said that compared with other Asian
 countries and mainland China, which has bad loans reaching as high as
 40 percent, Taiwan still enjoys a competitive edge in the Asia and
 Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Yen said that his focus is not to encourage foreign investors to
 set up plants in Taiwan, but to let them know that if they invest in
 its high-tech shares, the prospects are rosy.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's financial issues, Yen said that investors are
 naturally concerned about the lack of transparency and credibility,
 and whether the financial system is healthy.</P>
      <P>He said that his trip aims to address some of the misgivings
 directed at Taiwan's financial system, and he reiterated the
 government's determination to push for financial reforms.</P>
      <P>After the series of meetings and promotions, Yen said that he
 expects foreign investors will increase their investments in Taiwan
 in the medium term, if not in the short term.</P>
      <P>He was scheduled to visit the London stock exchange and be
 interviewed by the Financial Times Tuesday before continuing to
 Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-CZECH JOINT-VENTURE WINS ORDER FOR NEW AIRCRAFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  June 25 (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's aerospace industry
 has achieved a breakthrough, with an ROC-Czech joint-venture firm
 receiving orders for a new type of commercial aircraft at the
 just-concluded Paris Air Show.</P>
      <P>IBIS Aerospace, a joint venture formed by the ROC's state-owned
 Aerospace Industry Development Corp. (AIDC) and the Czech Republic's
 Aero Vodochody Co. (AV), received orders for 27 units of its
 10-seater AE-270 commercial aircraft at Paris Air Show which ended
 last weekend.</P>
      <P>The orders came from Australia, the United States and South
 Africa. In addition to the definite orders for 27 AE-270 planes, the
 joint-venture firm may be able to secure orders for 24 additional
 AE-270 planes later.</P>
      <P>Senior executives of AIDC, AV and IBIS signed an agreement
 in Prague Monday on cooperation in producing 10-seater AE-270
 commercial planes.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to the Czech Republic Roy Wu also attended
 the signing ceremony.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Wu said the ROC and the Czech Republic
 have spent four years jointly developing the new type of commercial
 aircraft.</P>
      <P>"We are very pleased to see our efforts finally bear fruit. And
 the development of the new plane has laid a solid foundation for
 our bilateral cooperation in the aerospace industry," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The prototype of AE-270 had been successfully displayed in
 aviation shows in the United States, Britain and France. "After the
 stages of development and marketing, the plane now formally enters
 the stage of mass production," Wu said, adding that he believes the
 joint-venture firm will have a bright future through concerted
 efforts from both sides.</P>
      <P>AIDC, Taiwan's only aircraft maker, formed a joint venture with
 AV Co. in 1997 to develop AE-270 commercial aircraft. The
 development, production, testing and certification have all
 proceeded smoothly. IBIS is expected to be able to produce 50 planes
 annually. The first plane is scheduled to be delivered to its
 customer in the fourth quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>AE-270 stands 12.23 meters long and 4.78 meters high. It is
 powered by a PT6A-66A or a PT6A-42A engine. It can fly up to 389 km
 per hour.</P>
      <P>AIDC was originally operated by the ROC's military. It managed
 to develop and produce 130 IDF jet fighters, which, together with 150
 U.S.-made F-16 and 60 French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters, form
 the backbone of the ROC's new-generation air defense arsenal.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) sent
 officials to the offshore island of Penghu again Tuesday to inspect
 conditions there in the wake of the passage of typhoon Chebi over the
 weekend.</P>
      <P>Due to the havoc wreaked by Chebi on the Taiwan Strait
 archipelago, the COA declared the area disaster-affected and said it
 will start reconstruction work immediately of its agricultural and
 fishery industries.</P>
      <P>The disaster-affected status allows farmers and fishermen to
 apply to the government for cash assistance and loans to start the
 reconstruction of their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The COA's initially estimated that cage aquaculture in the west
 islet of Penghu County suffered the most serious losses, with about
 900 metric tons of cobia, snapper and grouper lost, while Paishah
 Village and Makung City also lost 230 metric tons and 200 metric tons
 of assorted cage-reared fish, respectively.</P>
      <P>Initial loss estimates for this sector alone were estimated at
 more than NT$200 million.</P>
      <P>Penghu has been listed as a major areas for the development of
 cage aquaculture by the government over the past few years, but faced
 with the effects of Chebi, the future of the industry is in jeopardy,
 with even the roof of the fry hatchery blown away.</P>
      <P>COA officials reported that 109 fishing boats sank during the
 typhoon, while some 88 others were damaged. The losses were estimated
 at around NT$18 million, with damage to Chimei and Yuanan islets yet

    <HEADLINE>SIX FINANCIAL BILLS HELPFUL BUT NOT A PANACEA: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The passage through the legislature of six
 bills related to financial reforms will help improve Taiwan's overall
 economic situation, although they are not a "wonder drug," Premier
 Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of an extra ordinary legislative session
 to explain the importance and urgency of the six bills, Chang said
 financial reforms are the most pressing issue on the government's
 agenda in face of the greater international competition inevitable
 after Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan opened the additional session Tuesday to
 discuss the six bills at the request of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Citing Ministry of Finance estimates, Chang said about NT$200
 billion will be needed to set up a "finance reconstruction fund"
 designed to resolve the problems arising from debt-ridden banks and
 grassroots financial institutions. According to the premier, delay of
 the establishment of the fund will cost the public an additional
 NT$10 billion each year.</P>
      <P>Following the approval of the bills, the government will be able
 to handle poorly operated banks and court foreign capital more
 efficiently, which Chang said will improve the current economic slump
 and curb the rising unemployment.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on the bill on setting up financial holding
 companies, Chang said it will provide the government with a legal
 basis upon which to allow foreign and local financial institutions to
 be merged, consolidated or forge joint ventures. That will help boost
 the competitiveness of Taiwan's financial sector and stimulate the
 local economy, he added.</P>
      <P>Timely passage of the six bills through the legislature will not
 only strengthen Taiwan's international image among foreign financial
 and rating institutions, it will also boost the Ministry of Finance's
 ability to lure foreign investment to Taiwan, the premier stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CONSIDERING ALLOWING GAYS TO ADOPT, START FAMILIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China is
 considering allowing gay couples to organize families and adopt
 children as it drafts a bill to strengthen human rights protection,
 sources from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>For the first time in ROC history, law articles are expected to
 be enacted to show respect to homosexuals, allowing male and female
 homosexuals to legally form families and adopt children, MOJ
 officials said.</P>
      <P>However, the Human Rights Protection Law, which has just been
 drafted by the MOJ and is pending approval from the Executive Yuan
 before being sent to the Legislative Yuan for passage, stipulates
 that homosexuals will not be allowed to "marry."</P>
      <P>MOJ officials said male and female homosexuals will be allowed to
 live together as families but the arrangement would not be considered
 "marriage" in the eyes of the law, as ROC law defines marriage as a
 man and a woman committing themselves to each other.</P>
      <P>People of the same sex living together as families can be
 described as "sexual partners" but not "married couples," the
 officials said.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials were clarifying false reports made by local
 reporters in early June saying that the ministry was drafting
 statutes to allow homosexuals to legally marry.</P>
      <P>The just-drafted bill also emphasizes protection of people's
 rights to privacy, medical care and work, and their rights of freedom
 of speech, religion and communications. The people will also be
 protected from being illegally drafted into military service or
 having their personal property requisitioned for military use, MOJ
 officials said.</P>

      <P>Peter Cheng, Republic of China's minister
to Macedonia before the ROC announced it had severed diplomatic ties
with the Balkan country June 18, returned home Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he takes full responsibility for not being able to
maintain relations with Macedonia after diplomatic relations ended
after only two years and five months.</P>
      <P>He also said that the staff of the ROC embassy, including his
wife, are remaining behind in Macedonia to take care of the
administrative work needed after the two countries severed ties.</P>
      <P>As the fighting between Macedonian government forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels could reignite at any minute, he said he was worried
about the safety of the staff at the embassy.</P>
      <P>He said that before his return to Taiwan, he called on Macedonian
Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski, who is friendly to the ROC. He
said the real reason for breaking ties is the civil war plaguing the
nation, adding that Macedonia wants to get the support of mainland
China in the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces to the civil
war-torn nation.</P>
      <P>He said that he would report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND AFFAIRS OFFICIAL ADVISES CROSS-STRAIT INVESTORS TO BE WARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 27 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency, Teng said that
mainland China is an important part of the world economy and one
which cannot be ignored. He said that Taiwan businessmen's activities
in China are bound to increase.</P>
      <P>"Currently there are no less than 50,000 Taiwanese companies
operating on the mainland and they have recruited some 500,000 staff
members, mostly of the executive levels, from Taiwan," Teng said.</P>
      <P>"As a matter of fact, the figures are very likely underestimated,
because no official records are kept," he added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's media have been enthusiastic in reporting on the
positive side of mainland China's developments and have very often
failed to provide a more complete picture," Teng pointed out, adding
that Taiwan businessmen should study the market more thoroughly and
must not be overwhelmed just by a glimpse of the skyscrapers in
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's domestic market can no longer sustain the growth
of the business and industrial sectors, internationalization is the
only alternative, and in recent years many Taiwanese businessmen have
tried their luck in a market with a more familiar cultural
background, according to Teng.</P>
      <P>But even with similar cultural backgrounds, the different
political and economic systems and mentalities between Taiwan and
China can be challenging. "Taiwan businessmen are taking a risk when
they deal with ambiguous laws and regulations and unpredictable human
factors in law enforcement while investing there," Teng said.</P>
      <P>He said that personal safety and investment guarantees are the
major concern of investors in every part of the world. However,
Taiwan businessmen are guaranteed none of these in mainland China.
Even when both Beijing and Taipei are admitted into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), no guarantees are assured, according to Teng.</P>
      <P>Teng foresees that Taiwan businessmen's participation in mainland
China's economic activities will continue to rise in view of the fact
that people there are becoming more affluent. Mainland China's
membership in the WTO will also mean that the market will open even
further, he said.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Mainland Affairs Council show that in
the first five months of this year, Taiwanese investments in mainland
China amounted to US$1,068.4 million, a 33.18 percent year-on-year
growth. In 2000, Taiwanese businessmen poured US$2,607 million in
that market. Investments in mainland China account for 40 percent of
Taiwan's overall overseas investments.</P>
      <P>In order to lure more high-technology and capital-intensive
industries to invest there, authorities in mainland China are
offering investors from abroad favorable treatment, such as tax
holidays, convenient land acquisition and advantages to market
access.</P>
      <P>Teng said that the offers are tempting, but investors are advised
to take the security factor into consideration. Direct investments in
mainland China are not permitted by Taiwan's authorities yet,
partially because Taiwan businessmen's safety and interest are not
legally guaranteed by Beijing authorities, he added.</P>
      <P>The lure of cross-strait exchanges and investment is strong, but
it must not endanger Taiwan's interests, according to Teng.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan companies seeking more opportunities across
the Strait should keep corporate ethics and social obligations in
mind. Any moves to China must not result in large numbers of jobless
workers in Taiwan and the deterioration of the upstream or downstream
sectors of the industries involved.</P>
      <P>Most of the Taiwanese investments in mainland China are
concentrated in the coastal provinces of higher development,
including Kiangsu, Kwangtung, Fukien, Hopei, and Chekiang.</P>
      <P>Teng said that rapid development in these regions undoubtedly
have impressed not only businessmen but also tourists from Taiwan.
Last year, Taiwanese tourists made over 3 million visits to mainland
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP LABOR AFFAIRS OFFICIAL SAYS ROTC WILL HELP EASE UNEMPLOYMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An increasing number of college graduates
are opting to enter the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), a
situation that should ease the jobless situation, Taiwan's top labor
affairs official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA), said she welcomed the record number of openings in the
ROTC program now offered by the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
for college-level men.</P>
      <P>The ROTC, a legal framework for recruiting domestic civilian
college students for training as reserve officers, is more than
welcome now at a time when the country's unemployment has shot up to
an annual rate of 4.22, a 20-year high, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Of those currently unemployed, she said, more than 80,000 of them
are between the ages of 20 and 24. Nearly 60,000 people between 25
and 29 are not working or looking for a job.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the Executive Yuan Wednesday
marking the ROTC recruitment campaign, Minister of National Defense
Wu Shih-wen welcomed young men with college-level education to join
the ROTC program, which was originally designed to help relieve an
acute shortage of low-ranking military officers.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu Chao-li, an executive officer of the Armed
Forces Recruitment Center, the ROTC program has a record-high 8,373
openings this year. Of the total, 545 openings have already been
filled.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the remaining 7,828 openings are available to young men
aged between 18 and 27. The current ROTC program has three levels,
available for young men aged between 18 and 25 who are college
graduates, those who are master degree holders and aged between 20
and 27, and those who are high school graduates and aged between 18
and 24.</P>
      <P>The ROC Army will offer each trainee at least NT$10,000 (US$290)
a month in tuition aid and living allowance until their graduation
after a service of three to five years, depending on their service
requirements in the ROTC, Chiu noted. The ROTC trainees are also
entitled to a retirement pension when they leave the military, he
added.</P>
      <P>The ROTC system, patterned after the one in use in the United
States, has been successful there and in South Korea. Several noted
American generals, including the current U.S. Secretary of State
Colin Powell, entered the military through an ROTC program.</P>
      <P>Trainees must serve in the military for at least three years.
They can either continue to serve in the military or retire after
they finish their ROTC term and mandatory military training, which
generally lasts for two to three years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN LIEN CHAN RETURNS FROM OVERSEAS TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chen, chairman of the largest
opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), said Wednesday that it would
be "immoral" if someone wanted to create rivalry among the people of
Taiwan by using religion, ethnicity or issues relating to unification
(with mainland China) or Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Lien was responding to reports that someone from the KMT is
trying to establish a new political group. He made the comments while
presiding over the first KMT Central Standing Committee meeting since
his return from an overseas trip early Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>Huang Chu-wen, a former interior minister, recently said that he
was working to form a political group, and his words came at a
sensitive time because observers have said former ROC president and
former KMT chairman Lee Teng-hui would help President Chen Shui-bian
of the Democratic Progressive Party to control more than half of the
legislative seats in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Lien said that although the Constitution guarantees the right of
the people to form political parties or groups, the proposed group
needs to clearly state its ideals and its direction.</P>
      <P>Lien said that if someone is trying to use religion, ethnicity or
gender issues to splinter the people of Taiwan for his own political
ends, it would be an "immoral" act as the island is small and cannot
afford rivalry.</P>
      <P>Lien also said democracy is about party politics and the ruling
party has to shoulder its own responsibilities, while the opposition
party has the responsibility for checks and balances.</P>
      <P>Lien criticized some of the current rhetoric that said the new
government should be given more time to learn, adding that running
the nation requires minute-to-minute attention, and there is no time
to waste in sitting idly by.</P>
      <P>If the party is ready to rule the country, it will have to point
out its policy and implement it, but Lien said he wondered where the
government that has been in office for the past year is leading the
country.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Lien was welcomed by his four deputies, including Wang
Jin-pyng, Wu Poh-hsiung, Chiang Chung-lin, and Helen C.C. Lin, KMT
legislators Chen Horng-chi, Kao Yu-jen, Chu Fong-chi and James Chen
and hundreds of KMT supporters when he flew into the CKS
International Airport from the United States.</P>
      <P>Lien, left Taiwan June 10 to visit London, Paris, and New York
and Denver, said that those he met on his trip were concerned about
the development of the ROC over the past year.</P>
      <P>During his interview with the U.S. media, Lien said he was asked
why the ratings for President Chen Shui-bian were falling. He said
that the reason is a combination of factors -- Taiwan's sluggish
economy, stalled cross-strait relations and a constitutional crisis.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that many have expressed the idea that the KMT,
because of its sound policies, its ample talent pool and broad
vision, is the mainstream party of the Republic of China.</P>

      <P>The business leaders announced their resolve after a meeting
Tuesday with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan during a
U.N. Special Session on AIDS.</P>
      <P>"HIV/AIDS sets unique challenges for society, but business has

challenges," said Bill Roedy, President of MTV Networks International
and chair of the Global Business Council on HIV and AIDS (GBC) ,an
international group of companies spear-heading the business response
to match the ingenuity and innovation that some have already shown.</P>
      <P>Roedy unveiled the GBC's blueprint for business action on AIDS,

epidemic by their own companies. Illustrated with case studies from
companies leading the business response to the epidemic, including
MAC Cosmetics, Unilever and Standard Chartered Bank, the blueprint
calls for businesses to implement workplace policies and program,
harness business strengths to solve the problems created by the

KAOHSIUNG OFFICIAL DENIES HONG KONG GAVE VISA TO MAYOR HSIEH</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, June 27 (CNA) An official with the Kaohsiung City Hall
denied Wednesday that the Hong Kong authorities have granted an entry
visa to Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, saying that some local newspaper
reports have been "too optimistic."</P>
      <P>Hung Fu-feng, director of the Research, Evaluation and
Development Committee under the Kaohsiung City Government, said he is
leaving for Hong Kong Wednesday afternoon to gain a better
understanding of the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was planning to join Kaohsiung municipal government
officials in charge of development, construction, mass rapid transit
(MRT), news and research and evaluation affairs, on a three-day
fact-finding trip to Hong Kong scheduled from June 29 to July 1.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung officials hope to familiarize themselves with Hong
Kong's development, particularly the MRT systems and harbor
development projects.</P>
      <P>All Kaohsiung city officials who applied to visit Hong Kong
obtained their visas by June 20, except for the mayor, according to
Hung.</P>
      <P>Hung denied recent local reports saying that Hsieh is ready to go
to Hong Kong as he has obtained a visa from the Hong Kong authorities
for entry. As a matter of fact, he noted, a visa for Hsieh was still
nowhere in sight as of Wednesday noon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Hung, Hsieh, a stalwart of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, plans to visit Hong
Kong in his capacity as the mayor of Kaohsiung. He refuses to land at
the airport in Hong Kong, however, and then apply for a landing visa,
Hung added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORT AGAINST BREAST SELF-EXAMS CAUSING CONTROVERSY IN CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  26  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A major medical report advising against
teaching breast self-exams to women aged 40 to 69 is causing
controversy in Canada.</P>
      <P>A study in Tuesday's issue of the Canadian Medical Association
Journal said teaching women how to do breast self-exams causes more
harm than good.</P>
      <P>Dr. Nancy Baxter and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health
Care conclude, "Because there is fair evidence of no benefit, and
good evidence of harm," routine breast self-exams shouldn't be
recommended.</P>
      <P>The major downsides include unnecessary anxiety for women and
money spent on biopsies on benign lumps caused by suspicious
self-examiners.</P>
      <P>That money will be better spent by more effective screening
measures like mammography and breast exams done by medical
professionals, the study suggested.</P>
      <P>But the Canadian Breast Cancer Network urged doctors to ignore
the "flawed" report and keep teaching women how to examine their
breasts for lumps.</P>
      <P>The network cited a woman who lost her mother to breast cancer
and started to get mammograms when she reached 40. Since then, the
woman has twice found cancerous lumps that didn't show up on
mammograms.</P>
      <P>Over the last 30 years, the self-exam has been recommended by
leading cancer organizations, such as the National Cancer Institute.</P>
      <P>Dr. Cornelia Baines, professor of public health sciences at the
University of Toronto and a specialist in breast cancer screening,
wrote a scathing review of the article in the Canadian Medical
Association Journal before it was published.</P>
      <P>To start with, she said the study uses data from groups of women
in mainland China and Russia, where the level of medical treatment
and public information is much inferior to that in Canada.</P>
      <P>Baines said false alarms are inevitable with other screening
methods as well as breast self-exams. The real problem is that all
available screening methods have flaws, and it's counter-productive
to single out breast self-exams, she stressed.</P>
      <P>The one thing that Baines agreed with in the study is that doing
self-exams may cause anxiety to some women, while not doing such
exams may make them feel guilty.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Cancer Society said it's still a good idea for women
to know their own breasts and report any changes to their doctors.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in Canadian
women. Breast self-exams have helped some women detect lumps earlier.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A purge of errant publications and
editors has been ordered in a Chinese Communist Party document issued
to tighten mainland censorship in the run-up to the 16th Party
Congress in autumn next year, the South China Morning Post reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the key document, which spells out curbs
on politically incorrect articles and rules on other media
restrictions and ownership, is scheduled to come into effect on
Sunday, but the measures have already begun, with the closure or
temporary suspension of eight publications this month.</P>
      <P>"Leaders were alarmed about 'active thinking' among intellectuals
recently and feared that critical essays, especially those calling
for political reform at the 16th party plenum, would muddle the minds
of cadres and the public," a senior official of the Central Publicity

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui returned Tuesday to his alma mater, Cornell
University, to a welcome from nearly 1,000 overseas Chinese
supporters.</P>
      <P>The primary event on his Ithaca itinerary is the dedication of a
research center named after him. A ground-breaking ceremony for the
Lee Teng-hui Institute for Scientific Research -- to be dedicated to
nano-technology research -- was scheduled to be held on campus
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee earned a Ph.D. in agricultural economics at Cornell in 1968.
He last visited the campus in June 1995 when he was ROC president and
delivered a resounding speech.</P>
      <P>At an evening reception Tuesday, Lee delivered a 50-minute speech
to approximately 700 guests, who frequently interrupted him with warm
applause.</P>
      <P>Lee said that there is "nothing bad" about letting the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) rule the Republic of China after the
Kuomintang (KMT) has ruled it for the past 50 years.</P>
      <P>Lee, who until last year was the KMT chairman, added that "for
the good of the nation, of course it is okay" to have another
political party in power.</P>
      <P>He also urged the people to give the DPP administration some time
to adjust because it lacks experience.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that he will "never" help the DPP -- as
others claim he is doing -- because to do so would be "disloyal" to
the KMT.</P>
      <P>Cornell President Hunter R. Rawlings III was scheduled to host a
dinner in Lee's honor Wednesday. Lee is slated to fly to Los Angeles
from Ithaca Thursday and testify his belief in Christianity there at
a gathering of his overseas Chinese supporters before concluding his
visit July 1 and returning to Taipei July 3.</P>
      <P>Lee, who originally planned to visit his alma mater in early May,
postponed his trip because he went to Japan to have minor heart

    <HEADLINE>VICE ECONOMICS MINISTER COURTING INVESTMENT IN NEW YORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Economic Affairs
Minister Lin Yi-fu presided over an investment symposium Tuesday in
New York in which he strongly recommended Taiwan as "the best"
stronghold for U.S. firms seeking globalization.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as located "at the junction of Northeast Asia
and South Asia," Lin said Taiwan's economic clout and abundant
capital, as well as its hi-tech manpower and upgraded industrial
levels, make the island an ideal investment site for U.S. companies.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while introducing Taiwan's investment
climate to more than 70 representatives of U.S. enterprises,
including Vision System, X-Ray, Optical System, Prime Mediate
International and Sprint Investment Corp. at the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in New York.</P>
      <P>Lin told CNA following the event that the Taiwan government will
fully back the development of local hi-tech industries, which have a
much greater potential than traditional industries. He said his
ministry has adopted the strategy of first contacting those local
firms interested in expanding into Taiwan and than focusing on
convincing them that Taiwan is worthy of their investments.</P>
      <P>The vice economic affairs minister further pointed out that his
ministry will cooperate with other government agencies and joint
venture companies to sponsor similar activities in North America,
Europe and Japan in search of greater investment in Taiwan by foreign
hi-tech companies.</P>
      <P>In response to the question of how Taiwan will tackle the
situation in the face of increased foreign capital pouring into
mainland China, Lin claimed that Taiwan's advantages such as
innovation and marketing ability will not be matched by mainland
China in the short term. He stressed that the government should do
its best to tell foreign investors about this.</P>
      <P>Lin was scheduled to proceed to Boston later that day, where he
was slated to hold an investment symposium and visit three hi-tech
companies.</P>
      <P>He paid a visit a day earlier to the Long Island-based Symbol
Technologies -- the world's largest maker of bar code scanners, whose
business turnover totaled US$1.5 billion in 2000, up 27.3 percent
over the 1999 level.</P>
      <P>A Symbol executive told Lin that his company has a high interest
in setting up a branch and a technology center in Taiwan in the
future.</P>
      <P>Symbol currently has two agents and several outsourced
contractors in Taiwan for its production of optical fiber for bar
code scanners and connectors.</P>
      <P>Later the same day, Lin also called at the New York-based eMagin,
which is an OLED maker. Although eMagin said it has no plans to
invest in Taiwan at present, it will send company officials to visit
Taiwan next month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE FAIL TOTAL QUALITIES AVERAGE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average Taiwanese person has a total
quality management (TQM) score of just 47 points on a scale of 100,
according to the results of a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Open Weekly magazine from June 1-2
by telephone, found that the Taiwanese population as a whole has a
TQM of 47 points, compared with an even lower 41 points for Taiwan's
legislators, 55 points for mayors and magistrates, and 61 points for
ministerial-level officials.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,088 adults islandwide -- divided into the general
public, legislators, mayors, magistrates and ministerial-level
officials -- found that the Taiwan public gave themselves a flunk
score of 47.7 points, using a score of 60 as a pass, while
legislators gave themselves the lowest rating among the various
sectors of local society.</P>
      <P>Based on the criteria of five indicators -- innovation, altruism,
legality, participation and effectiveness, Taiwan's lawmakers scored
particularly low because most of them are considered unable to avoid
possible conflicts of interest, have been mired in too many
political, financial and sexual scandals and have screened and
legislated too few bills, according to the pollsters.</P>
      <P>On the issue of altruism, 34.7 percent of the Taiwan public said
most passengers on domestic transportation systems would yield their
seat to the elderly, pregnant women or little children, while 37.7
percent said this virtue is not prevalent at all.</P>
      <P>On the legality aspect, 64.2 percent of the survey respondents
said running red lights is the norm on Taiwan streets, while 29.3
percent disagreed. 73.9 percent said buying fake goods is the norm,
while only 11.4 percent disagreed.</P>
      <P>According to the pollsters, the ministerial-level officials gave
themselves a scrape-through pass of 61 points because those officials
are not popularly elected, have generally higher educational
backgrounds and they are from the "same team" -- all of them are
appointed by the Democratic Progressive Party-governed administration
-- leading them to evaluate each other more highly.</P>

      <P>Affected by a slumping international
economy, Taiwan exports to mainland China in April fell by 3.8
percent from a year ago, a rare decline for that month since 1998,
government tallies show.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released Wednesday by the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT), Taiwan shipped US$2.74 billion-worth of
products and services to mainland China in April, down 3.8 percent
from the year-earlier level. During the same month, Taiwan imported
US$566 million-worth of mainland Chinese goods, up 2.2 percent over
the 2000 level.</P>
      <P>Although BOFT estimates indicate that cross-Taiwan Strait trade
is unlikely to improve in the near term, the board said slashing of
customs duties by mainland Chinese authorities on 3,462 items,
ranging from 16.4 percent to 15.3 percent, should help boost local
demand for foreign products, including those from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade with mainland China totaled US$9.55 billion during
the first four months of this year, a 0.7 percent increase over the
corresponding period of last year, leaving Taiwan with a trade

      <P>Rosa Leocadia Da Silva Ergui, the
grandmother of the Chinese Brazilian orphan Iruan Ergui, left sadly
for home Wednesday after failing to resolve the custody issue over
the five-year-old child.</P>
      <P>Ergui, accompanied by her son-in-law, arrived in Taiwan four days
ago in an attempt to regain custody over the child from his Taiwanese
uncle.</P>
      <P>Prior to her departure, Ergui told local reporters at Chiang

in accordance with Republic of China law to get back the boy, over
whom she has had official guardianship since her daughter's death
three years ago.</P>
      <P>The boy was brought to Taiwan to visit his local relatives in
March this year by his father, Wu Ding-shu, the captain of a fishing
vessel.</P>
      <P>However, Wu died 11 days later in Taiwan and his brother, Wu
Hou-yen now claims it was his brother's wish that the boy be raised

Ergui.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the boy's registration for permanent residence in
Taiwan was completed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S LEADING ECONOMIC INDEX CONTINUES TO DIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading economic index continued
to drop for the 16th consecutive month in May to its lowest level
since September 1985, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As the leading index reflects the economic situation in the
coming three to six months, it means that the chances of a recovery
in the third quarter of this year are very slim.</P>
      <P>Like last month, the island's economy flashed a "blue" light in
May, representing a recession based on the country's official rating
system.</P>
      <P>In the CEPD-devised rating system, a "red" light means the
economy is overheated, "yellow-red" indicates the economy is heating
up, "green" reflects steady growth, "yellow-blue" signals economic
sluggishness and "blue" represents recession.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, told reporters that if the leading economic index
continues to slip in the coming months, it will be very difficult for
Taiwan to achieve even a 4 percent real growth rate this year.</P>
      <P>As the second quarter is going to end soon, he said that it seems
unlikely that a 3.26 percent growth rate will be attained for the
second quarter as had been predicted by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>He said that the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research has
predicted that the island's growth for the second quarter will be
around 1 percent, far lower than the prediction made by the DGBAS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT ADVOCATES EASING LIMITATIONS ON TRADE WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) official
advocated Wednesday a significant easing of limitations on trade with
and investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, who served as vice chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council between 1991-1997, also criticized the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for failing to show leadership in its policy
toward Beijing since taking power last year.</P>
      <P>The DPP government was forced to tinker with the policy it
inherited from the KMT, but never revamped it in perspective, despite
the considerable changes in the political situation, according to
Kao.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Chen Shui-bian promised during his
presidential campaign to phase out limitations on economic exchanges
with mainland China during his first year in office, Kao said the
promise has proved to be "just another rubber check" which cannot be
paid.</P>
      <P>As to the idea floated by DPP economic officials of levying a
"national security tax" on firms investing in mainland China after
the prohibition is lifted, Kao said such a move would be no less than
a punishment for Taiwan businessmen who are forced to venture into
the mainland Chinese market in order to survive.</P>
      <P>He criticized the government's proposal to limit the island's
investment in mainland China to a fixed percentage of its gross
national product as "unfeasible."</P>
      <P>The government should also take into account the forthcoming
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) by both Taiwan and
mainland China while charting its new policy toward Beijing, he went
on.</P>
      <P>Kao said the National Policy Foundation -- a KMT think tank --
has just finished a thorough review of the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area
and suggested to change 12 articles to the following effect:</P>
      <P>-- Getting rid of the current legal limitations on trade with and
investment in mainland China, as the unnecessary prohibition on the
fields in which local businessmen may invest in mainland China only
dampens their competitiveness against their foreign counterparts;</P>
      <P>-- Opening direct trade with and investment in mainland China,
without which, strategic business alliances forged between local
firms and foreign counterparts with the purpose of developing the
mainland market will be useless;</P>
      <P>-- Allowing financial and insurance companies to invest in
mainland China to permit them to stay close to and thus retain their
customers who have flocked to do business there;</P>
      <P>-- Opening the local market to investment from mainland China as
part of the island's efforts to attract foreign investment in line
with WTO regulations;</P>
      <P>-- Allowing ships flying flags of convenience to ply directly
between Taiwan and mainland China ports, which would ease the
pressure on local material and component manufacturing firms to
relocate to mainland China and promote the competitiveness of
Taiwan's Kaohsiung Harbor;</P>
      <P>-- Improving Taiwan's investment climate to attract the inflow of
overseas capital, which entails the infrastructure construction of
waterways, electrical generation and transmission, as well as the use
of the government's power to dispose of illegal obstructions to
investment projects;</P>
      <P>-- Forming a vertical division of labor between Taiwan and
mainland China, which would serve the interests of both sides by
getting rid of the competition and confrontation between the two
sides that leads to the waste of resources;</P>
      <P>-- Making the island an Asia-Pacific regional operations center
on the strength of its geographic position, which would require the
island's thorough globalization, including the disposal of the
current limitations on economic exchanges with mainland China; and</P>
      <P>-- Shifting the emphasis of development away from the
manufacturing industry, which is withering under the competition from
mainland China, to the hi-tech industries such as information,
optical-electrical industry and biotech industry.</P>
      <P>The above proposals were referred to the KMT policy committee,
which will ask party legislators to initiate changes to regulations
to allow their translation into government policy.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made a pitch for
the island's business environment Wednesday to a gathering of local
businessmen who operate in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the gathering, Chen reiterated his promise to make
"Taiwan's interest, economic development and encouraging investment"
his government's top priorities.</P>
      <P>He also restated the four directions his government is pressing
ahead with at full steam, namely "all-out efforts to woo business,
solicit investment, revitalize the economy, and create jobs."</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes Taiwan and mainland China will firmly
anchor the region to prosperity and stability so long as the
governments and people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can arrange
exchanges on the basis of "sincere reconciliation, aggressive
cooperation and eternal peace."</P>
      <P>Noting that it is the duty of the government to take care of
Taiwan businessmen in mainland China, Chen said his government will
set up Taiwanese primary and junior high schools in mainland China to
educate the children of mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and is
seriously considering a proposal to set up senior high schools there.</P>
      <P>He also promised to properly address Taiwan businessmen's demands
for the import of products made in mainland China by Taiwan firms,
direct shipment of personnel and cargo across the Taiwan Strait via
Kinmen and Matsu, allowing Taiwan businessmen's mainland Chinese
spouses to work in Taiwan and be covered by the national
health insurance program and relaxation of the restrictions on the
introduction of skilled hi-tech workers from mainland China.</P>

Department under the Taipei city government met Wednesday with Taiwan
businessmen in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai affirmed the businessmen's courage in exploring a
new life in the booming mainland Chinese city, but several of the
businessmen complained about the Taiwan government's restrictions on
investing in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lung told them that business competition is borderless and added
that it is natural for Taiwan businessmen to seek business
opportunities in mainland China.</P>
      <P>She said that the issue regarding "one China" or "two
Chinas" should be resolved by the governments of both sides and
should not become a burden for businessmen.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Lung expressed her hope that the businessmen
will be able to play a positive role in the promotion of cultural
exchanges between Taipei and Shanghai, which the businessmen said
that they are willing to do.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WIFE OF TAIWAN BUSINESSMAN KIDNAPPED, FREED AFTER PAYING RANSOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama, June 27 (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung &amp; Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan businessman's wife in Honduras who
was kidnapped at the end of May was released June 24 after her family
paid a US$20,000 ransom, sources with the Republic of China embassy
in Honduras said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After her release, the hostage, identified only as Mrs. Chan, was
rushed to a hospital for checkup. She had suffered a slight cut on
her ear, caused when the kidnappers sliced off a "small piece of skin
and muscle" and mailed it to her husband.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwanese community in Honduras said that Mrs.
Chan, her husband and a secretary were abducted on their way to their
textile factory on the eve of ROC President Chen Shui-bian's visit to
Honduras late last month.</P>
      <P>Her husband and the secretary were released shortly afterward to
allow them to collect the ransom. The businessman had twice been
kidnapped on the same route in the past.</P>
      <P>The ROC embassy in Tegucigalpa is helping Chan's family by
pressing Honduras police authorities to solve the case and it also
asked the Taiwan reporters covering Chen's Latin American trip not to
break the news before the hostage was released.</P>
      <P>The abductors originally asked for a ransom of US$1 million, but
after one month of negotiations, agreed to lower the sum to
US$20,000.</P>
      <P>The Honduras police were reported to be searching for the
kidnappers, who apparently were from several neighboring countries,
the sources said, while Mrs. Chan is returning to Taiwan with her
children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOXIC CHEMICAL SPILLS INTO SEA AFTER TWO SHIPS COLLIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hazardous chemicals were released into
the ocean after a Republic of China naval ship collided with a
Panamanian vessel offshore near Tainan City in southern Taiwan early
Thursday morning, sources from the Navy Fleets Command reported.</P>
      <P>The 8,840-ton navy ship, the "Chung Cheng," was on a routine
training mission in the waters off Tainan City's Anping port when it
collided with the 3,668-ton Panama-registered freighter the "Golden
Chemical."</P>
      <P>No one aboard either ship was injured but an estimated 96 cubic
meters of poisonous P-Xylene leaked from the chemical ship, which
still has some 3,000 tons of P-Xylene in its hold, officials from the
fleets command said.</P>
      <P>Neither of the two ships lost power. The "Chung Cheng" returned
to the Kaohsiung Naval Base at 6 a.m. while the chemical ship was
instructed to anchor offshore, pending an investigation.</P>
      <P>Since P-Xylene is hazardous to both humans and sea life,
officials from the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) have rushed to Kaohsiung to find out the extent
of the damage and what help they may be able to render.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng Hsien-jung, director of the EPA's Water
Quality Protection Bureau, P-Xylene is a flammable and poisonous
substance which is harmful to humans through contact with the skin or
by inhaling the vapors of the chemical. Excessive exposure can cause
liver and kidney damage, and adversely affect the central nerve
system.</P>
      <P>A light substance which does not dissolve in water, the P-Xylene
is expected to float on the water. Cheng said the spill, although
small, is expected to pollute the area about 12 nautical miles
northwest of Kaohsiung Harbor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-ROC SPY BARRED FROM LEAVING COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former Taiwan spy who worked in mainland
China and has accused former President Lee Teng-hui of sabotaging his
work was barred Thursday from leaving Taiwan, according to the Public
Prosecutors Office of the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors office issued an order Thursday restricting Chang
Chih-peng from leaving the country because it is feared that he may
give over state secrets and leak military information that could
threaten national security.</P>
      <P>When the 80-year-old Chang heard of the order he broke down,
saying that he was committed to his "contacts" on the mainland and
that he would go there even if he had to make the trip illegally.</P>
      <P>Chang said Tuesday at a new conference that he booked a flight
for Thursday afternoon to Beijing, where he had planned to turn
himself in to the mainland military authorities in a trade for a
reduced prison term for Yao Chia-chen, a business manager at Chang's
Hong Kong office, who has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a
mainland court which held that she had close relations with Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang, who worked for the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB)
under the Ministry of National Defense for six years under his code
name "001," said he has suffered greatly after former President Lee
spoke publicly on secret intelligence information that ultimately led
to the execution of two men.</P>
      <P>Chang said he appealed to the MIB in April for NT$100 million
(US$2.9 million) in compensation because Lee's "loose remarks" had
led to the discovery of a spy ring that Chang had been running. The
MIB has not acted on Chang's claim.</P>
      <P>At a news conference in March 2000 in Taipei, Chang called on the
government to help him because, according to Chang, two mainland
Chinese military officers had been executed and a manager of his had
been arrested as a result of Lee's remarks.</P>
      <P>Chang filed a lawsuit in December against Lee alleging that his
careless talk had allowed Beijing to break a major espionage ring.</P>
      <P>He claimed that a comment by Lee during the 1996 Taiwan Strait
missile crisis had resulted in some spies being arrested and his own
factories in the mainland confiscated, forcing him to flee to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang's spy ring discovered in early 1996 that the ballistic
missiles to be fired into the sea north of Taiwan in a military
exercise would only be "dummies," -- missiles without warheads.</P>
      <P>Chang said he quickly provided the MIB authorities with this
crucial information.</P>
      <P>However, according to Chang, Lee made public the secret in a
speech when he was running for his second term for president. Lee
called for the people of Taiwan to stay calm in the face of Beijing's
attempt at intimidation since "the missiles carry only dummy
warheads."</P>
      <P>Lee's public disclosure of the confidential information
immediately aroused Beijing's suspicion and led to a massive
investigation that cracked the spy ring in 1999.</P>
      <P>Two People's Liberation Army officers -- Major General Liu
Liankun and Colonel Shao Zhengzhung, his key mainland contacts, were
tracked down and executed in August 1999, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>The MIB authorities have kept mum on the entire accusation,
saying only that the MIB's position is that it will not comment on
any operations involving intelligence work in consideration of
national security and for the safety of its personnel.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, hours before Chang's scheduled departure for
Beijing, People First Party legislator Lee Ching-hua called for the
government to demonstrate its crisis management skills to keep Chang
from heading to the mainland, where he would most likely be arrested
and would not be allowed the chance to speak.</P>
      <P>Lee, meanwhile, called for the MIB to be fair to Chang since
Chang has made a major contribution to the nation's security. The
former MIB director, Yin Tsung-wen, once gave Chang a medal for his
intelligence work.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISA DENIAL COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO BEIJING'S UNIFICATION SCHEME: MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Taiwan, June 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said
Thursday mainland China's decision to reject his application for a
Hong Kong visa is counterproductive to its own "one country, two
systems" unification scheme.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who concurrently serves as chairman of the Republic of
China's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made the remarks
after the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) under mainland China's State
Council denied that Beijing has agreed to grant Hsieh a visa to visit
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Kaohsiung City Government had applied for Hong
Kong visas for him and several other senior municipal officials out
of its belief that Beijing really meant to implement its "one
country, two systems" formula in Hong Kong for 50 years.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hong Kong and Beijing have rights to determine
whether to approve their visa applications, Hsieh said the event also
offered Taiwan an opportunity to evaluate mainland China's policy on
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Beijing used the "one country, two systems" formula after
regaining sovereignty over Hong Kong from Britain in July 1997 and
has since been advocating the use of this same scheme for
cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that Beijing's rejection of his Hong Kong visa
application was "negative teaching material" for its much-hyped
unification scheme as it would remind the people of Taiwan that
Beijing didn't honor its own promise to give Hong Kong full autonomy.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was originally scheduled to head a delegation of Kaohsiung
City Government officials to visit Hong Kong June 16-18 or June
29-July 1 to learn from Hong Kong's experience in mass rapid transit
system management and harbor affairs modernization.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong authorities have issued visas to all senior Kaohsiung
officials, except Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Some people have suggested that Hsieh visit Hong Kong via a
72-hour landing visa. However, Hsieh rejected the advice, insisting
that he would visit Hong Kong only when Hong Kong authorities
formally approves his entry application in his capacity as mayor of
Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest sea port and second largest city.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's TAO spokesman, Zhang Mingqin, told a news
conference in Beijing Thursday that Hsieh's visa application would be
handled in line with regulations governing civilian exchanges between
Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as the current state of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Zhang further said mainland China would consider relations with
the DPP so long as the party accepts Beijing's "one China" principle
and the so-called "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>The ROC government has said it cannot agree to Beijing's "one
China" principle because it downgrades the ROC to a local-level
government under the "People's Republic of China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE ON TOURISM PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung  County,  central  Taiwan,  June  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung called for a quick resumption of cross-strait dialogue
Thursday to allow tourism exchanges between Taiwan and mainland China
to begin as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is ready for cross-strait tourism exchanges,
Chang said, authorities from both sides need to "sit and talk over"
technical issues surrounding the plan.</P>
      <P>Issues involved in the tourism initiation, including scenarios
where mainland Chinese tourists overstay their entry visas and
"disappear" in Taiwan, should be tackled first in the cross-strait
dialogue, he added. Chang also said the possibility of mainland China
barring its citizens from traveling to Taiwan needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a ceremony marking the
establishment of the Taichung Harbor Administration Committee, under
which a passenger and tourist service center has also been
inaugurated.</P>
      <P>Both facilities are considered measures paving the way for the
Taichung Harbor to become the "gateway" to Taiwan and a key
destination for holiday-makers from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taichung Harbor, with its updated facilities and
geographical convenience, has great potential to become one of the
most important international harbors on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang announced last Oct. 20 that visitors from mainland China
will be able to take leisure trips to Taiwan beginning June 2001 as
part of the ROC government's efforts to address the cross-strait
political impasse.</P>
      <P>The plan, nevertheless, has not been implemented and it remains
unknown when it will begin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EIGHT MAINLAND CHINESE AIRPLANE HIJACKERS REPATRIATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has repatriated eight
mainland Chinese who were convicted of airplane hijacking in
accordance with the bilateral Kinmen Agreement, the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Four of them -- Qi Daquan, Gao Jun, Han Shuxuye and She Yuehpo --
were repatriated early Thursday from the ROC's frontline island of
Matsu via a mainland boat under the escort of staff members of the
Red Cross Society in the southeastern mainland province of Fujian,
MAC officials said.</P>
      <P>Four other mainland hijackers -- Zhang Hai, Zhang Wenlung, Yuan
Bin and Xu Mei -- were repatriated in the same way Wednesday,
according to MAC sources.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, kept
a low-profile toward the repatriation of the mainland hijackers to
avoid any possible unexpected developments.</P>
      <P>Noting that aircraft hijacking is a universal crime, the MAC said
all the eight mainland hijackers have served jail terms and have been
released on parole in accordance with ROC law.</P>
      <P>Based on the principles of humanitarianism, safety, convenience
and a consensus reached between the Red Cross Society on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, the MAC said it authorized the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to handle the mainland hijacker
repatriation issue earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The eight mainland hijackers were sent to Matsu under the escort
of police officers as well as SEF and Red Cross Society staff members
earlier this week for repatriation.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 mainland people were involved in hijacking 13
mainland commercial aircraft to Taiwan between 1993 and 1998. Two
mainland hijackers -- Huang Shugang and Han Fengying -- were
repatriated in October 1998 after they were released on parole.</P>
      <P>In February 2000, the MAC again authorized the SEF to repatriate
four other mainland hijackers. One of them, Yang Mingde injured SEF
Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng on the flight from Taipei to
Matsu for repatriation.</P>
      <P>The incident caused a suspension of repatriating mainland
hijackers for more than a year. After extensive discussions with
relevant authorities, the MAC decided to resume repatriation. Because
mainland China declines to recognize Taiwan's judicial authority,
mainland hijackers must stand trial again after their return to the
Chiense mainland. As a result, some mainland hijackers reportedly
were unwilling to go home.</P>
      <P>"Police officers and SEF staff have exercised great prudence in
handling repatriation of the two batches of mainland hijackers in the
past two days," said an MAC official.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Honduras police authorities have arrested
seven suspects involved in the kidnapping of a Taiwanese
businessman's wife in late May, the Republic of China Embassy in
Honduras said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Quoting the Honduras national police administration, the embassy
said the suspected kidnappers came from a cross-border criminal
ring.</P>
      <P>Two of the suspects hailed from other Central American countries,
the embassy said, adding that one was from Guatemala and the other
from El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Honduras police authorities are contacting relevant countries to
obtain further information about the suspects, the embassy said.</P>
      <P>According to the embassy, the Taiwan businessman, identified
only by his family name Chan had kept close contacts with Honduras
police and public security authorities since his wife was kidnapped
on the eve of ROC President Chen Shui-bian's visit to the Central
american country at the end of May.</P>
      <P>Chan asked Honduras law enforcement authorities to do their
utmost to handle the case under the top principle of
ensuring his wife's personal safety.</P>
      <P>The kidnappers originally asked for a ransom of US$1 million,
but after one month of negotiations agreed to cut the sum to
US$20,000.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Chan was released June 24 after her husband paid the
ransom. The Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce in Honduras had helped
Chan raised money for the release of his wife. Mrs. Chan endured
torture during her captivity. Her abductors sliced off a "small
piece of skin and muscle" of her right ear and mailed it to her
husband. The kidnappers also used cigarettes to burn her. Mrs Chan
is returning to Taiwan with her children.</P>
      <P>The ROC embassy said Honduras law enforcement authorities had
mobilized large police forces and used highly advanced communications
equipment to search for kidnapping suspects after the hostage was
relased.</P>
      <P>Embassy sources said Chan, his wife and a secretary were
abducted on their way to their textile factory in suburban
Tegucigalpa, the Honduras capital, at the end of May. Chan and the
secretary were released shortly afterward to allow them to collect
the ransom.</P>

(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States continues to insist
on a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan Strait situation while
adhering to the "one China" principle, the U.S. ambassador-designate
to Beijing said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"As the president has plainly articulated," said Clark T. Randt,
Jr., "we insist on a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and do
not support a declaration of independence by Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"Our consistent position, based on the Taiwan Relations Act and
the three communiques (signed with Beijing), is that there is but one
China," he said while delivering a testimony before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>"It must be clear that we will honor our commitments under the
Taiwan Relations Act," Randt added. He was speaking as one of three
ambassdorial nominees testifying at their confirmation hearing.</P>
      <P>Randt pledged that if confirmed, he would "always stand squarely
for American interests and American values" when dealing with
mainland China, adding that he would approach mutual differences
"with a spirit of respect."</P>
      <P>Calling the crackdown on religious freedom in mainland China "a
disturbing reality," he said that one of his highest priorities as
ambassador to Beijing would be to convey Bush's concern to the
mainland leaders.</P>
      <P>Randt also promised to work for the release of Chinese American
scholars and Chinese scholars that are permanent U.S. residents
detained under suspicious charges by the mainland authorities, a
pledge he repeated when he met briefly after the hearing with the
wife and daughter of Li Shao-ming, one of the detainees.</P>
      <P>Randt, 56, has been a trade lawyer with an international law firm
in Hong Kong. He was formerly first secretary and commercial attache
at the U.S. embassy in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The nominee is best known, however, for his personal ties to
Bush. The two were classmates at Yale University.</P>

      <P>Cornell University President
Hunter R. Rawlings III formally announced Wednesday that a new
research center to be completed in 2004 will be named after former
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui, a Cornell alumnus.</P>
      <P>The Lee Teng-hui Institute for Scientific Research will be
dedicated to nanotechnology research.</P>
      <P>Rawlings made the announcement at a private welcoming banquet,
where Lee had the opportunity to do a walk-through of the research
center on a computerized virtual reality model.</P>
      <P>Lee, who arrived at his alma mater Tuesday, also toured the
campus, which he last visited in June 1995 while he was still ROC
president.</P>
      <P>He earned a Ph.D. in agricultural economics at Cornell in 1968.</P>
      <P>Lee briefly met with American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman
Richard Bush. AIT represents American interests in Taiwan in the
absence of diplomatic ties. Bush, however, would not comment on the
details of their 50-minute meeting.</P>
      <P>A group of mainland Chinese students at Cornell and nearby
universities organized a protest on campus to denounce what they said
was Lee's pro-Taiwan independence stance, while a New York-based
group of pro-unification supporters also joined in the protest.</P>
      <P>A Lee supporter observing the demonstration questioned whether
the students from mainland China -- who have been raised under
communist rule -- truly understand democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>Lee was slated to fly back to Los Angeles Thursday after a
nine-hole round of golf. His U.S. visit is scheduled to wrap up July
1.</P>
      <P>Lee had originally planned to visit his alma mater in early May,
but he postponed his trip because he went to Japan to have minor
heart surgery in late April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG MAYOR CANCELS HK TRAVEL PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Taiwan, June 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said
Thursday he has decided to cancel a visit to Hong Kong planned for
Friday because as of Thursday noon, he had not yet received a Hong
Kong visa.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who concurrently serves as chairman of the Republic of
China's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), also expressed his
doubts as to whether Beijing "really meant to implement" the
so-called "one country, two systems" scheme in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"If the `one country, two systems' were for real, it would be the
Hong Kong government, not the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) under
mainland China's State Council, that would decide whether to grant me
a visa," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician made the remarks after TAO spokesman
Zhang Mingqin denied at a news conference in Beijing Thursday that
Hsieh had been granted a visa to visit Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"Since Beijing has repeatedly promised to allow Hong Kong to keep
its own political system and lifestyle for 50 years, why has the TAO
meddled in my Hong Kong visa application case?" Hsieh asked.</P>
      <P>"I simply cannot understand why the TAO has skirted the Hong Kong
government and announced on its own its denial of my visa
application," Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>In his view, Hsieh said, Beijing's denial of his Hong Kong visa
application is counterproductive to its own "one country, two
systems" unification scheme.</P>
      <P>Beijing used the "one country, two systems" formula after
regaining sovereignty over Hong Kong from Britain in July 1997 and
has since been advocating the use of the same scheme for cross-Taiwan
Strait unification.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that Beijing's rejection of his Hong Kong visa
application was "negative teaching material" for its much-hyped
unification scheme as it would remind the people of Taiwan that
Beijing has not honored its own promise to give Hong Kong full
autonomy.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was originally scheduled to head a delegation of Kaohsiung
city government officials on a visit to Hong Kong June 16-18 or June
29-July 1 to learn from Hong Kong's experience in mass rapid transit
system management and harbor affairs modernization.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong authorities issued visas to all the senior
Kaohsiung officials in the delegation except Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Some people had suggested that Hsieh visit Hong Kong on a 72-hour
landing visa, but Hsieh rejected the advice, insisting that he would
visit Hong Kong only when Hong Kong authorities formally approve his
entry application in his capacity as mayor of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's
largest sea port and second-largest city.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the city government had followed three principles in
handling the Hong Kong travel plan:</P>
      <P>-- The visit was mainly aimed at looking into Hong Kong municipal
affairs as part of Kaohsiung's efforts to promote city-to-city
exchanges;</P>
      <P>-- The delegation would respect Hong Kong's stance and keep its
itinerary transparent; and</P>
      <P>-- The delegation would not accept any political conditions since
the visit was purely for learning about Hong Kong's experience in
city administration and construction.</P>
      <P>Zhang said Thursday that the TAO would handle Hsieh's visa
application based on the current state of cross-strait relations and
regulations government Taiwan-Hong Kong civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Zhang further said Beijing would consider relations with the DPP
only after the party accepts Beijing's "one China" principle and the
so-called "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>The ROC government has said it cannot agree to Beijing's "one
China" principle because it downgrades the ROC to a local-level
government under the "People's Republic of China."</P>

      <P>Mainland China should refrain from
commenting on Taiwan's domestic political developments or general
situation, a senior negotiator with mainland China said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman of the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and secretary-general, was responding to
comments made by Zhang Mingqin, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs
Office (TAO) under mainland China's State Council, at a news

      <P>Shi said the Republic of China has consistently refrained from
making concrete comments on mainland China's domestic political
affairs based on the principle of mutual respect.</P>
      <P>In contrast to mainland China's frequent verbal attacks on
incumbent and former ROC presidents, Shi said Taiwan has seldom
criticized mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Zhang's criticism of former ROC President Lee

      <P>"Even the United States has said that no prerequisite is needed
for cross-strait dialogue," Shi noted.</P>
      <P>Shi said mainland China's reluctance to resume talks with Taiwan
has hindered expansion of the direct "mini three links" between the
ROC's frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's
Xiamen and Mawei.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Shi said, mainland China refusal to cross-strait
consultations has also hampered Taiwan's plan to open its door to
prospective mainland Chinese tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCIAL  GROUPS  READY TO TRANSFORM INTO FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading financial groups with
multiple operations are ready to transform into financial holding
companies and the monetary market is expecting a series of mergers
and acquisitions in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved the Financial Holding Company Law
late Wednesday at an extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>The new law opens the door for financial groups to transform into
financial holding companies with their operations covering banking,
stocks and securities, futures, credit cards, trust, insurance, and
venture capital.</P>
      <P>The Fubon Commercial Bank under the Fubon Group, the Grand
Commercial Bank under the President Group, the E. Sun Commercial Bank
under the Cathay Group and the Far Eastern International Bank under
the Far Eastern Group had begun the deployment work long before the
bill was approved.</P>
      <P>Commercial banks, such as the First Commercial Bank and Bank
SinoPac, and stock and securities firms like Polaris, Core Pacific
and Jih Sun are seeking opportunities for mergers or acquisitions to
facilitate the transformation.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the transformation, a financial institution must
keep its capital adequacy ratio below 8 percent, according to
Vice Finance Minister Chen Chun.</P>
      <P>As financial institutions are facing the challenges of making
choices or becoming choices of their rivals, the monetary market will
undoubtedly experience a period of turbulence. It is hoped that the
transformation will help local financial institutions to streamline
their operations in the long run and improve their international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Since the new law allows foreign financial companies to wholly
own Taiwan banks, foreign investors may have higher interest in
Taiwan's monetary market.</P>
      <P>The new law will not go into force until Nov. 1, while a majority
of lawmakers insist that a draft bill regarding controlling interest
in a financial holding company should be screened and approved before
the end of October.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) said Thursday that the company has
no plans to shut down any of its plants, despite the current economic
slump sweeping semiconductor contractors.</P>
      <P>TSMC is not planning salary cuts or layoffs and salary raises
were implemented as scheduled in April, the spokesman said,
dismissing market speculation that TSMC may resort to plant closures
or layoffs to ride out the present difficulties.</P>
      <P>"In the face of the economic slowdown, the only thing that the
company has done is to adjust its capital spending from US$3.8
billion to US$2.2 billion," the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>The declaration had already been set forth in an e-mail message
sent by TSMC Chairman Morris Chang a day earlier to the company's
14,000 workers, which claimed that the company will be challenged
with its severest task to date as a result of declining business.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the company's production utility rate has fallen
to less than 40 percent at present, which is in stark contrast to 120
percent and 45 percent increases in 2000 and 1999 business turnover,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Calling on workers to cherish the company's intention to take
care of them even in hard times, the TSMC chief called on company
employees to do their best to help boost company operations by
seeking technology upgrades and strengthening services to customers
as a means of preparing for the coming next boom.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, United Micro Electronics Corporation (UMC) said on the
same day that all the firm's silicon wafer plants are operating
normally despite the fact that the production utility rate of its
plants dipped to 45 percent in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>A UMC spokesman said he had not heard of any company plans to
shut down plants or lay off workers and would not comment on rumors
in this regard.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New policy guidelines featuring a
"confederation" with Beijing and a "double economic triangle"
covering Taipei were unveiled Thursday by an opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) think tank.</P>
      <P>The guidelines worked out by the National Policy Foundation are
an attempt to flesh out the idea of a "confederation" proposed by
party head Lien Chan as a formula for ultimate reunification with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>It calls for the pursuit of a friendly win-win situation with
Beijing in compliance with the existing Guidelines for National
Unification.</P>
      <P>In practice, the guidelines preach stable ties with Beijing on
the basis of the so-called "1992 consensus" said by the KMT to have
been reached between Taipei and Beijing that there is only "one
China," with Taiwan and the mainland free to interpret the meaning of
the phrase as they see fit.</P>
      <P>It also advocates the establishment of a "Taiwan Strait peace
zone" through a military trust-building mechanism with Beijing, which
would lead to the eventual confederation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The current limitations on direct trade and shipping with the
mainland should be relaxed to set the stage for two economic "golden
triangles," one of which would have Silicon Valley, Taipei and
Shanghai as its apexes, while the other would have Tokyo, Taipei and
Shanghai as its apexes, according to the document.</P>
      <P>The policy guidelines are seen as an attempt by Lien to put his
own stamp on party policy and an assertion of his leadership within
the party.</P>
      <P>Lien reportedly tried to made his "confederation" scheme a vital
part of his platform in his disastrous 2000 presidential campaign,
but withdrew it "grudgingly" because of disapproval from then-KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui, who claimed in 1999 that Taipei-Beijing ties
are a "special state-to-state" relationship.</P>
      <P>The guidelines were referred to the party's policy making
committee for review before being presented to the party congress for
approval.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ EXPRESSES `DOUBT' OVER LOW CLEANLINESS RANKING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the Republic of China Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) cast doubt Thursday on the nation's low government
cleanliness ranking released by the anti-corruption organization
Transparency International (TI).</P>
      <P>The officials maintained that during the last year, the MOJ's
efforts to curb corruption and sweep away "black gold," or the ilegal
connections among political figures, gangsters and businessmen, are
well known to local people and claimed they could not imagine why
Taiwan obtained a such low ranking in TI's Corruption Perceptions
Index (CPI).</P>
      <P>However, earlier news reports had been very clear in reporting
that the TI survey data was compiled over the previous three years,
long before the MOJ crackdown.</P>
      <P>TI, the world's leading non-governmental organization that
monitors both international and national corruption, evaluates the
CPI according to interviews with business people, academics and
country analysts.</P>
      <P>In its latest annual survey of 91 countries around the world,
Taiwan got a score of 5.9 out of a "maximum cleanliness" score of 10,
and was ranked 27th on the CPI 2001 list.</P>
      <P>Finland led the list with an index of 9.9, followed by Denmark
with 9.5, New Zealand with 9.4 and Iceland and Singapore tied at 9.2.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong led its Asian neighbors with an index of 7.9 in 14th
place, followed by Japan with 7.1 in 21st place, and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland China scored 3.5, tying with Argentina in 57th place.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey show that some of the richest countries
in the world - Finland, Denmark, New Zealand, Iceland, Singapore and
Sweden - scored nine or higher out of a clean score of 10 in the new
CPI, indicating very low levels of perceived corruption. But 55
countries - many of which are among the world's poorest - scored less
than five, suggesting high levels of perceived corruption in
government and public administration.</P>
      <P>The countries with a score of two or less are Azerbaijan,
Bolivia, Cameroon, Kenya, Indonesia, Uganda, Nigeria and Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>Anti-corruption efforts have been among the most applauded
achievements of the Chen Shui-bian administration during the last
year. MOJ officials indicated that the ministry is aiming to
establish an anti-corruption administration in an attempt to create a
"clean" political environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNCERTAINTY OVER ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN SECOND HALF: CBC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no sign that Taiwan's sagging
economy will turn around in the second half of this year, despite the
government's "soft" monetary policy and measures to stimulate growth,
a Central Bank of China (CBC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a report presented at a meeting of CBC councilors and
monitors, Shih Yen, director-general of the CBC's Economic Research
Department, said all statistics in the first five months of this year
suggest gloomy prospects for the near future.</P>
      <P>The abrupt plunge in the world economy, especially the sharp
slide in demand for electrical and information products, has taken a
heavy toll on Taiwan's international trade, which has seen a 9.5
plummet in exports, a 15.2 percent plunge in imports and a petty
trade surplus of US$4.89 billion in the January-May period, said
Shih.</P>
      <P>A similar downward trend has been seen in industrial output, with
the Industrial Production Index posting a growth rate of minus 5.29
percent in the first five months of this year, she went on.</P>
      <P>The downsizing or relocation of local firms overseas has driven
up the unemployment rate to 3.83 percent in the period, or 1.03
percentage points up over the corresponding period of the previous
year, Shih continued.</P>
      <P>Inflation was tame, thanks to a slump of international commodity
prices and a slide in the price of local agricultural and livestock
products, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>The consumption price registered a modest annual growth of 0.4
percent and the core consumption price a growth of 0.64 percent, she
added.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said after the meeting that there is
still a long way to go before the economy can reverse its fall in the
second half of this year.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local leading entrepreneur called
Thursday on the authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
sign accords on tax and investment protection as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Hsu Sheng-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers Association (TEEMA) said the issue causes
deep concern among Taiwanese businessmen working in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks at a press conference before publishing the
results of the 2001 mainland China investment climate and risk
survey.</P>
      <P>The survey results indicate that the Yangtze River delta offered
the best investment climate in mainland China, while Bo Hai bay
retained the lowest investment risk.</P>
      <P>TEEMA recommended the best three mainland cities for Taiwanese
investors as Suzhou, Kunshan and Wujiang and the three worst areas as
the mainland's southeastern coast, Shenzhen and Dongguan -- the three
areas with the highest concentration of Taiwanese investors.</P>
      <P>The cities with the highest investment risk were named in the
survey as Shantou, Haikou and Dongguan.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that TEEMA will submit the survey results to the
relevant government agencies and will also provide copies to those
planning to invest in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Noting that signing tax and investment protection accords is a
must for Taiwanese investors in the mainland, Hsu called on the
Beijing authorities to set up a "Taiwan Businessmen Special Court" to
deal with business disputes.</P>
      <P>Prof. Lin Tzu-chia of National Cheng Chi University, a chief
planner for the survey, said that about 29 percent of Taiwanese
businessmen have suffered trade disputes in the mainland. Of them, 36
percent sought resolution through legal means and 34 percent were
resolved through private channels.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that about 59 percent of the
respondents were dissatisfied with the results of the resolutions, no
matter whether through legal or private channels. About 32 percent of
the respondents agreed that a special court should be set up to deal
with trade disputes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was quoted as
saying Thursday that problems between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait are the fault of the mainland Chinese side for its lack of
sincerity in wishing to resolve bilateral disputes.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers Chien Hsi-chieh and Tang Pi-o of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party quoted the president's remarks to reporters
following a meeting with him.</P>
      <P>Chien and Tang, quoting Chen, said the Republic of China
government stands firm on its "active opening and efficient
management" stance when touching on the "no haste, be patient" policy
regulating mainland-bound investment by local businessmen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has displayed a great deal of goodwill in establishing
direct trade, transport and postal links -- the "mini three links" --
between ROC-held frontline Kinmen and Matsu islands and two ports in
the mainland's Fujian Province. It has also reiterated its
willingness to reopen dialogue with the mainland with no conditions
attached, Chen was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The president further pointed out that mainland China, however,
has given no response to Taiwan's moves and that the mainland should
be held responsible for the current impasse between the two sides,
according to the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Chien and Tang also mentioned that Chen believes that the United
States is fully aware of Taiwan's "open and active" stance and that
it has been adopted without pressure from Washington, but laments
that Beijing has not budged on its own ideas and concepts and
continues to politicize things every step of the way.</P>
      <P>Tang also quoted Chen as saying that certain media outlets have
"overly embellished" mainland China. In the eyes of the ROC
president, the mainland is faced with many problems in the areas of
social security, the wealth gap and the financial situation, Tang
noted.</P>
      <P>She added that the president also encouraged the people of Taiwan
to have faith in the government and never to fall into the trap of
thinking that mainland China presents the only survival route for
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Former Minister of the Interior Huang
Chu-wen said in an interview with a local magazine that a new
political group he plans to form next month will cooperate with the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government to stabilize the
political situation.</P>
      <P>"The new group will play the role of the `middle way' power to
support the new government in stabilizing the political situation,
based on the consideration of the country's interests," he noted.</P>
      <P>Huang, a former member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said
that former President Lee Teng-hui "completely supports the new
political group" and added that Lee has promised to help campaign for
members of the group during December's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"I believe the new group will be able to garner 10 percent of the
votes in the upcoming legislative elections," Huang remarked.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the emergence of the new political group will
thwart the expansion of the People First Party headed by former
Taiwan Governor James Soong and will also affect the performance of
the KMT in the elections.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he declined to return to the KMT because the
party "has gradually departed from the `Taiwanization' route and has
inclined more toward the mainland" since the presidential election of
March 2000, during which the KMT lost its 55-year grip on power to
the DPP.</P>
      <P>He said the failure of the opposition parties to play an
appropriate opposition role in the past year prompted him to decide
to form the new political group aimed at helping the government

    <HEADLINE>ROC  PRESIDENT'S MIDDLE WAY APPROACH `IMPROVES CROSS-STRAIT TIES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  June 28 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Government Information
Office Director-General Su Tzen-ping claimed Thursday that President
Chen Shui-Bian's "middle way approach" has improved cross-Taiwan
Strait ties since the inauguration of the new administration.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the Center for European Policy Studies in
Brussels, Su pointed out that the peaceful transition of political
power last year in Taiwan was highly significant to political
scientists and observers and that no matter how people wish to
describe Taiwan's political development, one thing is clear: Taiwan
is a genuine, full-fledged "liberal democracy."</P>
      <P>Despite the tense situation between Taiwan and mainland China in
the immediate post-election period last year, he said: "In fact,
cross-strait relations have improved to a certain degree since the
inauguration of the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) government"
and the main reason lies in Chen's "middle way" approach.</P>
      <P>He told the audience, which included officials from the
European Union Commission, members of the European Parliament,
journalists, diplomats, scholars and members of Association of
Taiwanese in Belgium, that there is a solid majority in Taiwan that
supports the "middle way" on the cross-strait issue and that the DPP
and Chen have to take the majority view into consideration in
managing cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The ROC government spokesman said: "In his inauguration address,
President Chen announced that as long as China has no intention of
attacking Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan independence. The
declaration received overwhelming approval from the Taiwan public,
because it forfeited China's excuse of attacking Taiwan militarily
and this was in accordance with the majority view."</P>
      <P>Su added that stable public opinion in Taiwan can lay the most
important foundation for stabilizing cross-strait relations and in
turn, cross-strait stability can become an important source of
security and stability in East Asia. He said: "Maintaining the status
quo and preventing military conflict by avoiding any extreme measures
is indeed a middle way, a successful way to make the people of Taiwan
feel safe and secure without having to worry about a war with China."</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out in his speech titled "Taiwan's New Middle
Way" that the DPP government understands the complexity and
difficulty of the cross-strait issue and making announcement that the
Taiwan government will not pursue any policy that is likely to
trigger a cross-strait military conflict is not enough to bring
long-term peace to the region. The real issue, he said, is a rising
China that is dissatisfied with its regional role.</P>
      <P>Su added that mainland China's economy has been growing rapidly
over the last decade but parallel to the economic growth is the rise
of its military power. "With several hundred missiles aimed at Taiwan
at all times, we do not have the luxury of trial and error. In fact,
Chen's administration has to make an extra effort to improve
cross-strait ties," Su said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the "mini three links" and other cross-strait
policies currently under review, Su said: "Taiwan's policy objective
is that through frequent and extensive exchanges of all kinds, people
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait may gradually eliminate their
distrust and hostility toward each other."</P>
      <P>Su also expressed Taiwan's wholehearted support of the mainland's
accession to the Word Trade Organization (WTO).</P>

freedom, democracy and the chance to develop.</P>
      <P>Lee, who arrived in Ithaca, New York, Tuesday for a three-day

think it is a strong country simply because of its huge area and
population, while ignoring that democracy and freedom are "goals of
global value."</P>
      <P>He made the comment in response to a demonstration staged by a
group of pro-Beijing students against his visit to Cornell, saying
that he would like to tell the students, who were mainly from
mainland China, to go back to the mainland and tell the Beijing
authorities to give its people some freedom.</P>
      <P>He said the student protesters were barking up the wrong tree and
should turn on their own government and demand freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>Lee canceled a golf game Thursday after two hectic days and took

    <HEADLINE>'CONFEDERATION' CONDUCIVE TO CLEARING CONFUSION: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cross-strait "confederation" idea
proposed by opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan is conducive to
peaceful reconciliation between Taiwan and mainland China and can
bridge the gap between supporters of independence and unification, a
KMT official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee Cheng-tsung, a KMT party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said
it remains to be seen whether the cross-strait confederation proposal
will be made part of the KMT platform, but he is sure that the
concept is capable of serving as a bridgehead for leaders from both
sides of the Taiwan Strait to overcome the current political impasse.</P>
      <P>The confederation proposal can also help clarify disputes and
controversies in Taiwan surrounding the issues of independence and
unification, Lee added.</P>
      <P>The guidelines, featuring a confederation with Beijing and a
"double economic triangle" covering Taipei, were unveiled by the
KMT's National Policy Foundation Thursday.</P>
      <P>The guidelines are an attempt to flesh out the idea of a
confederation which was proposed by Lien as a formula for unification
with mainland China. They call for the pursuit of a friendly win-win
situation with Beijing in compliance with the existing Guidelines for
National Unification.</P>
      <P>Part of the groundwork is based on the concept that ties with
Beijing should be built on the basis of the so-called "1992
consensus," whereby Taipei and Beijing agreed that there is only "one
China," with Taiwan and the mainland free to interpret the meaning of
the term as they see fit.</P>
      <P>The confederation framework also advocates the establishment of a
"Taiwan Strait peace zone" through a military trust-building
mechanism with Beijing, which would lead to the eventual
confederation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>On Friday, P.K. Chiang, executive director of the KMT National
Policy Foundation, said: "It will still take some time and effort" to
know whether the confederation formula will be incorporated into the
KMT's party platform.</P>
      <P>The issue will have to be discussed first by the KMT Central
Advisory Council, the Central Committee and receive the blessing of
the 16th Party Congress before it has a chance to be made part of the
party's platform, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official of the opposition People First Party (PFP)
said Friday that the PFP shares common perceptions about the reality
of cross-strait relations with the KMT, but that does not mean that
the PFP supports KMT Chairman Lien Chan's cross-strait confederation
proposal.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's Policy Research Center,
said although the PFP has much in common with the KMT on many issues
related to the development of cross-strait relations, the PFP is
skeptical that the confederation concept will be workable or will be
acceptable to Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the PFP's position supports a three-stage
approach toward the development of cross-strait relations: beginning
with economic exchanges, gradually expanding and deepening to social
exchanges between people from both sides and eventually entering the
level of political negotiation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CONFEDERATION' CONCEPT SNUBBED BY MAINLAND SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cross-strait "confederation" idea
proposed by opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan was snubbed
Friday as "unrealistic" by a mainland Chinese scholar who is
currently in Taipei for an academic symposium.</P>
      <P>Zhou Jianming, director of the Asian-Pacific studies of the
Shanghai Institute for Social Sciences, said confederation is a new
nation formed by two sovereign states and that this is not applicable
to Taiwan and mainland China because Taiwan is not a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Zhou, who spoke and presented a paper Friday at the roundtable
forum on cross-strait relations sponsored by the National Policy
Foundation, a KMT think-tank, said he does not think that Lien's
cross-strait confederation concept would be acceptable to the leaders
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Both sides may agree that Taiwan and mainland China will
eventually unify, but how and when will be a point of discussion for
a long time, Zhou noted.</P>
      <P>Zhou suggested that negotiators from both sides should reopen
cross-strait dialogue based on Taiwan's Guidelines for National
Reunfication and the so-called "1992 consensus," whereby Taipei and
Beijing agreed that there is only "one China," with Taiwan and the
mainland free to interpret the meaning of the term as they see fit.</P>
      <P>Currently, there is still no concrete basis on which both sides
of the Taiwan Strait can talk about unification, Zhou said, adding
that "even if the KMT advocates the confederation framework, it won't
be achieved in a short five or 10 years."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT FREIGHTER SHIPMENT OF GRAVEL REFUSED BY MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The direct "mini three links" suffered a
setback earlier this week when mainland China banned a Taiwan
freighter from shipping gravel directly from a mainland port to
Taiwan via Kinmen, sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The 777-ton Kaohsiung-based cargo ship "Ho Peng No. 1" was hired
by a local company to transport 300 tons of gravel from mainland
China's Weitou Port in Fujian province to the southern Taiwan port of
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>It was the first Taiwan-registered freighter approved by the
Republic of China government to sail directly across the Taiwan
Strait to mainland China via Kinmen since the direct "mini three
links" was launched early this year.</P>
      <P>The "Ho Peng No. 1" sailed from Kinmen's Liaolo Port Tuesday noon
and reached waters off Weitou Port about two hours later. Mainland
China's public security authorities, however, blocked the ship from
entering the port, saying that exporting sundry goods was not
permitted from the port.</P>
      <P>The "Ho Peng" crew then moored the vessel off Weitou Port. Over
the past two days, the ship owner has negotiated with mainland
authorities by phone, but to no avail. The freighter finally gave up
and sailed back to Kinmen Friday morning.</P>
      <P>Observers have speculated that mainland China's entry ban on the
gravel ship was prompted by Taiwan's premature announcement of the
event for alleged publicity purposes.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Government officials said if that were true, the
prospects for the Taiwan-initiated "mini three links" would be
gloomy.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to forge rapprochement with mainland
China, the ROC government opened its two frontline islands of Kinmen
and Matsu for direct trade, mail and shipping with mainland China's
Xiamen and Mawei ports in Fujian province, commonly known as the
"mini three links," at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's reluctance to fully support the program, it
has yet to make much headway. Mainland China approves direct
Kinmen-Xiamen or Matsu-Mawei voyages only on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>According to county government tallies, 51 direct voyages from
Kinmen to mainland China's Xiamen Port have been made since Jan. 1,
with 3,949 passengers making the trip. During the same period, only
two voyages from Xiamen to Kinmen were made, with a total of 153
mainland residents on board.</P>
      <P>As for cargo shipments, mainland freighters have so far made five
direct voyages to Kinmen, transporting a total of 7,141 tons of
gravel.</P>
      <P>Under the "mini three links," only Kinmen and Matsu residents and
freighters are allowed to make direct voyages to mainland China. The
"Ho Peng No. 1" was the first Taiwan cargo vessel allowed to make the
direct passage via Kinmen as part of the ROC government's efforts to
expand the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>The Kinmen County Government expressed regret over mainland
China's refusal of the first Taiwan-registered ship's participation
in direct cross-strait shipping services via Kinmen.</P>
      <P>County government officials said they will negotiate with
mainland authorities through proper channels to remove unnecessary
obstacles to the "mini three links" on a reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>The "Ho Peng No. 1," with an 11-man crew on board, left Kaohsiung
June 16. It is now berthing at Kinmen's Liaolo Port and awaiting
further instructions from its owners.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the renowned Taoist Hsing
Tien Temple in Taipei may have taken the expression that charity
begins at home a little too seriously.</P>
      <P>Huang Chung-chen and his wife were arrested Thursday on charges
of embezzlement and money laundering -- a day before the government
recognized the temple as an example of social responsibility because
of its cash donations to charities over the last year -- the most
generous of all religious organizations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony Friday presided over by Minister of the Interior
Chang Po-ya, the ministry cited 137 religious organizations for their
contributions to Taiwan society. The same morning, Huang and his
wife, Wei Hui-chun, were being released on bail of NT$1 million and
NT$100,000 bail, respectively.</P>
      <P>According to ministry figures, religious groups reportedly made
donations totaling NT$4.024 billion (US$118 million) in cash last
year. Of that total, NT$595 million (US$17.5 million) was contributed
by the Hsing Tien Temple.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said
Huang and his wife are suspected of stealing huge sums of cash from
the temple group's coffers and then laundering the money through six
banks in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The couple were interrogated overnight Thursday and made bail on
Friday, but investigators have barred them from leaving the country.
Huang currently holds a United States passport.</P>
      <P>The Hsing Tien Temple, dedicated to Kuan Yu, a legendary hero of
the ancient Chinese Three Kingdoms period from A.D. 222 to A.D. 265,

influences, could only have been produced by fear."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO BANKING REFORM, CROSS-STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed the
Republic of China government's commitment Friday to promoting
financial reforms and normalization of trade and economic relations
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation while meeting with Ewald Kist,
chairman of the Netherlands-based ING Group.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan needs globalization and liberalization to
sustain its trade and economic growth, Chen said the ROC's
Legislative Yuan has recently passed six bills to facilitate the
island's financial reforms.</P>
      <P>"The passage of the six financial reform bills marks a good
beginning for our market restructuring task," Chen told his guest,
adding that the new bills are designed to upgrade Taiwan's financial
service quality, ensure market stability and avert any possible
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that his administration has consistently
attached great importance to the development of relations across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing early resumption of
regular cross-strait dialogue and normalization of bilateral
relations, particularly normalization of trade and economic ties,"
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He further said the ROC is willing to adopt an open-door policy
on cross-strait commercial exchanges under the principles of market
economy and no hurt to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>"Active openness and effective management are our guiding
principles for cross-strait trade and economic exchanges," Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>The president also said opening direct cross-strait trade, mail
and transportation links, commonly known as "three links," is a
trend and a necessity.</P>
      <P>"We are more than willing to discuss this issue with mainland
China. However, mainland China has consistently imposed political
conditions to hinder resumption of cross-strait dialogue and
stall talks on the 'three links' issue," Chen regretted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said he remains optimistic about future
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait would
sooner or later resume talks on various topics and issues of mutual
concern since we share same cultural and historical backgrounds and
have a common language," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he hopes more Taiwan companies can forge
strategic alliances with multinational firms to jointly tap the vast
mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kist said the ING Group has set up a foothold in
Taiwan for 16 years. "We regard Taiwan as one of our major long-term
investment destinations," he noted.</P>
      <P>To signify Taiwan's importance in the ING Group's global
investment plan, Kist said, the group has especially chosen Taipei
as the venue for its board meeting this year. "By so doing, we hope
our board members can get a better understanding of Taiwan's general
investment climate," he added.</P>
      <P>Kist told President Chen that the Netherlands began sweeping
financial reforms 10 years ago. He suggested that Taiwan learn from
the Dutch experience in liberalizing its banking and financial
system.</P>
      <P>Kist further suggested that Taiwan tighten management of its
banking, insurance and other relevant financial service industries
to prevent irregularities.</P>
      <P>In his view, Kist said the Taiwan legislature's passage of a
financial holding company law will enhance the island's appeal to
foreign investors.</P>
      <P>"With its strategic location and outstanding manpower resources,
Taiwan has long been an attractive investment destination for
foreign entrepreneurs," Kist said, adding that more multinational
groups would be willing to invest in Taiwan if the island further
liberalize its financial services to meet international standards.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan can serve as a springboard to the vast
mainland market, Kist said closer cross-strait trade and economic
ties would be conducive to luring more foreign investors to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ILLEGAL ALUMINUM SMELTERS IN TAINAN DEMOLISHED BY ORDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An operation mounted by the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) to forcibly demolish illegal
aluminum smelters along the Erhjen River in Tainan proceeded smoothly
Friday.</P>
      <P>Some 450 policemen were mobilized against the possibility of
disturbances by protesters, but no drastic resistance was reported,
although some operators voiced bitter complaints.</P>
      <P>Sixty-eight illegal smelters were targeted in the two-day
operation, the largest government move to evict polluters. In three
previous operations, 55 smelters were forcibly demolished.</P>
      <P>EPA Administrator Hau Lung-pin, who inspected the operation, told
reporters that the Erhjen River has been among the worst-contaminated
rivers in Taiwan for more than 10 years because of the existence of
the illegal smelters.</P>
      <P>He said the operation was aimed at destroying only the actual
buildings at the sites, while operators would be allowed to remove
their machinery and other equipment. He added that the Industrial
Development Bureau will help a dozen of the illegal operators to move
to nearby industrial zones.</P>
      <P>The EPA chief noted that the government is determined to
implement the policy of evicting the illegal aluminum smelters along
the river.</P>
      <P>In April and May, when he last inspected the scene, he stated
that all illegal smelting operations along the river would be removed
by June 30. Since then, a dozen operators have moved voluntarily.</P>

      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui concluded a three-day visit to his alma mater, Cornell
University in Ithaca, New York Thursday and flew to Los Angeles for a
transit stop before his scheduled return to Taipei July 3.</P>
      <P>A devout Christian, Lee was slated to preside over a testifying
service at a Presbyterian church in upscale Bel Air July 1 at the
invitation of overseas Taiwanese Presbyterians in the area.</P>
      <P>Lee and his wife visited Cornell to visit their granddaughter,
who is studying there, and to take part in an official ceremony
marking the establishment of a scientific research center named in
Lee's honor.</P>
      <P>To be completed in two years, the Lee Teng-hui Institute for
Scientific Research will be dedicated to nanotechnology and materials
science research. Lee received a Ph.D. in agricultural economics at
Cornell in 1968.</P>
      <P>In marked contrast to his previous visit to Cornell in June 1995
when he was still ROC president, his just-concluded trip was more
private and leisurely in nature and he brushed aside most questions
on sensitive political issues.</P>
      <P>Lee had originally planned to visit his alma mater in early May,
but he postponed his trip because he went to Japan to have minor
heart surgery in late April.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei temperatures set a new record high
of the year Friday, reaching 37.8 degrees Celsius, mainly due to the
effects of urbanization, weather forecasters said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said the highest temperature in
Taipei was recorded Friday noon, while other areas of Taiwan did not
register more than 35 degrees.</P>
      <P>The CWB officials attributed the high Taipei temperature to the
effects of high-level urbanization, the city's location in a basin
and overpopulation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the CWB went on, areas of low pressure in the South
China Sea and the eastern Philippines exacerbated the local weather
conditions. The forecasters said there is a slight possibility that
the low pressure area in the South China Sea will develop into a
typhoon, although it was too early to say whether the Philippine low
will become a typhoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, PRC NOT SUBJECT TO EACH OTHER: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and the People's
Republic of China are not subject to each other, a senior mainland
affairs official noted Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), made the remarks after the Taiwan Affairs
Office under mainland China's State Council reiterated Thursday that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume talks only after Taiwan
accepts the "one China" principle. The MAC charts Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>"As the ROC is an independent sovereign democratic state, it is
not subordinate to the communist-led PRC," Lin explained, adding that
Beijing's "one China" principle is unacceptable because it downgrades
the ROC to a local-level government under the PRC.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed regret over mainalnd China's consistent strategy of
highlighting political disputes to hinder cross-strait interaction
and rapprochement.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's resistance to shelving political disputes and its
insistence on imposing political prerequisites (as the basis for
negotiation) have formed the biggest obstacle to normalization of
cross-strait relations," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that peaceful solution to all disputes and the
consent of the people of Taiwan remain the ROC's basic stance on
handling cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Lin urged mainland China to resume dialogue with Taiwan to forge
mutual trust, pave the way for normalization of bilateral relations
and jointly deal with the issue of a "future one China."</P>
      <P>Touching on Beijing's recent denial of a Hong Kong visa for
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, Lin said it is regrettable that Beijing
got involved in the issue.</P>
      <P>"If Hsieh had been allowed to visit Hong Kong, it would have
contributed to exchanges and cooperation between Taiwan and Hong
Kong," Lin said, adding that Beijing's involvement in Hsieh's Hong
Kong travel plans will only make the people of Taiwan even more
suspicious of Beijing's "one country, two systems" unification
scheme.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin refrained from commenting on the opposition
Kuomintang's plan to enshrine into its party platform the proposal
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait form a confederation, saying
only that whether the "confederation" formula is feasible will depend
on Beijing's attitude.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO EASE MAINLAND CHINA INVESTMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should adjust its current
"no haste, be patient" mainland China investment policy to help local
firms accomplish globalization as a way to boost Taiwan's economy, a
well-known economist said Friday.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, secretary-general of the opposition
Kuomintang-affiliated National Policy Foundation, made the call in a
speech delivered at the opening of a two-day seminar sponsored by the
KMT on cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the Bush administration's
policy toward Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Peaceful co-existence and jointly shared prosperity have always
been the mainstay public opinion in Taiwan regarding cross-strait
ties and the KMT strongly believes that only through smooth and
orderly trade and economic activities and exchanges of viewpoints can
Taiwan and mainland China resolve their current impasse, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He said it is lamentable that relations between Taiwan and the
mainland have been deteriorating since the transfer of power last
year and that regular negotiation channels have also been cut since
then.</P>
      <P>"Worse yet, the clear course to boost bilateral trade and
economic activities and two-way exchange mechanisms started by the
KMT while it was the ruling party are also being lost because of the
current government's vacillating policies," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chiang suggested that the government ease the "no haste, be
patient" policy on Taiwan investment in the mainland based on
"industrial competitiveness." He contended that competitive local
businesses should not be allowed to invest there, while those without
a competitive edge should actually be helped to set up in the
mainland or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As for those businesses which are still competitive but whose
mainland investments can help fuel Taiwan's economy, he urged the
government to gauge their investment applications on a "case-by-case
basis" and to review industries' competitiveness swiftly to tackle
all changes across the strait to secure national security.</P>
      <P>In the face of the long-awaited entry by Taiwan and mainland
China to the World Trade Organization, expected by the end of this
year, Chiang said the two sides will face a new juncture in bilateral
trade ties under the principles of mutual benefit and reciprocity. He
further voiced his hope that two-way relations in other fields will
also be normalized gradually.</P>

      <P>From July 2, a new U.S. law will require
that both parents sign passport applications for children under the
age of 14, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) announced recently
in a press release.</P>
      <P>The new law requires that when only one parent is available to
sign the application, that parent must provide AIT with documentary
evidence demonstrating that he or she has sole legal custody of the
child or has the written consent of the other parent to the issuance

      <P>Exceptions to this requirement may be made in special family

    <HEADLINE>HSINCHU INDUSTRIAL PARK UNDERGOES STRUCTURAL TRANSITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty years after its establishment, the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park has become a center for
Taiwan's high-technology industries, but "Taiwan's Silicon Valley"
needs to undergo a structural transition if it wants to advance.</P>
      <P>The integrated circuit (IC), computer/peripherals,
telecommunication and optoelectronic industries have been major
foreign exchange earners in the park. However, in the first four
months of this year, sales of the IC industry grew by only 1.4
percent over the same period of last year, while the optoelectronics
industry registered a sales growth of 5.3 percent and sales in the
computer/peripherals sector declined by 16.9 percent.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the precision machinery, telecommunication and
biotechnology sectors in the park in the January-April period all
registered impressive sales growth.</P>
      <P>Despite the sluggish international economic climate, the
precision machinery manufacturers in the park attained a 47.2 percent
growth in sales in the first four months of this year as compared
with the same period of last year, while the biotechnology sector
enjoyed growth of 35 percent and the telecommunications sector, 31.8
percent.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of sales of different sectors in the park in the
January-April period shows that the IC-related sector grossed a sales
revenue amounting to NT$151.53 billion, followed by
computers/peripherals, with NT$59.58 billion, optoelectronics, with
NT25.69 billion, telecommunications, with NT$18.68 billion, precision
machinery. with NT$1.79 billion and biotechnology, with NT$350
million.</P>
      <P>With United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) and Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) topping the list, there are 129 IC
manufacturers among the 330 companies in the park. IC-related
companies account for the lion's share of the overall sales and their
revenue also registered the highest growth in the past 10 years,
growing nearly 24-fold in 10 years, from NT$23.3 billion in 1991 to
NT$575.7 billion in 2000.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's upstream electronics industry is following in the
footsteps of downstream manufacturers in seeking opportunities
overseas, the Hsinchu park administration hopes that the industrial
structure in the park can be transformed from concentrating on
manufacturing to emphasizing research and innovation.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are only 58 telecommunications companies, 25
biotechnology-related companies and 11 precision machinery
manufacturers in the park.</P>
      <P>When the government chose Hsinchu as the location of the
science-based industrial park in the late 1970s, research environment
was a major concern. Located close to the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI), National Tsing Hua University and National
Chiao Tung University, the science park has the advantages of easy
recruitment of qualified human resources and obtaining newly
developed technologies from the academic sector.</P>
      <P>The ITRI in the past 20 years has created more than 30 spin-off
companies in the park. To advance the structure of the industrial
park, the research institutes will continue to play important roles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE LEAKAGE OF MIRAGE SECRETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang lawmaker presented
a written interpellation to the Cabinet Saturday expressing his
concern about possible leakage of classified information concerning
French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent French newspaper report, Legislator Kuo
Jung-chen said a French engineer had already leaked classified
information about Lafayette-class stealth frigates to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the Republic of China Navy's purchase of six
Lafayette-class frigates and 980 medium-range MICA missiles from
France in the early 1990s was mediated by Thomson-CSF, the French
manufacturer of the RDY multi-mode radar installed on Mirage 2000-5
fighters.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Kuo said in his interpellation that he is
worried French engineering experts might have also leaked to mainland
China critical Mirage-related information, regarding in particular
the various electronics warfare weapons installed on the fighters.</P>
      <P>The ROC has purchased 60 Mirages, which together with the 150
U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters and 130 home-made Indigenous Defense
Fighters form the backbone of Taiwan's second-generation airborne
defense arsenal.</P>
      <P>Kuo asked the Ministry of National Defense (MND) to study how to

contractor of the Mirage fighters, ensure the safety of all
Mirage-related secret information.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Kuo said, the MND should demand that Dassault

Technology and Aerospace Industry Development Corp. in adjusting the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO TAKE ON CHALLENGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday at a
workshop for senior government officials that they must face the
challenges ahead by taking on their responsibilities to support and
serve society.</P>
      <P>Chen told the Executive Yuan officials that Taiwan is facing the
challenge of a "deconstruction" of political and economic systems,
challenges in its democratic order, challenges in national security
and other challenges to society.</P>
      <P>He added that mainland China's refusal to give up the option of
using force against Taiwan and its "magnetic effect" on Taiwan
capital has made national security an issue of primary concern.</P>
      <P>To take on these challenges, Chen continued, the government
should clearly understand its responsibilities by clarifying its
role, understanding public opinion, accepting the responsibility for
its policy-making and asserting its leadership.</P>
      <P>Listing the goals for government reform, Chen said that the
government must reduce its size, increase its ability to solve
problems, rid itself of corruption, establish partnerships and
alliances, and reorganize.</P>
      <P>He criticized the organization of the Executive Yuan for being
too weak on policy-making and recommended a large-scale merger of
"functional-oriented" departments.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested cutting the total number of ministries and
agencies by a third, while establishing a few independent "special"
politically oriented committees to improve the Executive Yuan's
policy planning, coordination and leadership abilities.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that the reorganization is not aimed at
benefiting certain political parties but rather because it is
necessary.</P>
      <P>The two-day workshop -- the first of a series of seminars for a
total of 127 officials from the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan,
Control Yuan, Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan -- was organized to
let government officials come together to achieve a common vision in
policy-making.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM OFFERS MORE BENEFITS TO ELDERLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New regulations for the National Health
Insurance program offer senior citizens more benefits, while people
with high incomes are required to pay higher premiums, the Bureau of
National Health Insurance (BNHI) announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>From July 1, citizens aged over 65 need not pay if they make
fewer than 48 visits to hospitals or clinics in a year. They will be
required to pay NT$50 per visit for the 49th to 156th visits and
NT$100 each time for more visits.</P>
      <P>An earlier regulation ruled that only the first 24 visits to
hospital would be fully covered by the health insurance program,
after which NT$50 would have to be paid.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the health insurance authorities shows that
senior citizens in Taiwan make 20 to 25 visits to hospital a year on
average.</P>
      <P>Since the National Health Insurance program came into effect in
March 1995, the highest coverage has been NT$57,800. In view of the
fact that more than 3 percent of those belonging to high-income tier
are under-insured, the health insurance authorities decided to raise
the premium by setting the ceiling at NT$60,800, effective August 1.</P>
      <P>The health insurance authorities in the past years have suffered
heavy losses due to large pay-outs. To avoid waste in this regard,
the bureau has ruled that patients must pay for prescriptions worth
over NT$100, although they will not have to pay more than NT$200.</P>
      <P>Last year, the people of Taiwan made 280 million National Health
Insurance claims, while prescriptions were worth NT$340 billion,
according to the bureau.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LONG-RANGE FRAMEWORK WILL ACHIEVE REAL CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A long-range framework agreed upon by
Taipei and Beijing will achieve real long-term cross-Taiwan Strait
peace and stability, a researcher on European and American affairs
claimed Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-yi, director of the Institute of European and American
Studies under Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest academic research
organization, made the remark in a report on preliminary research of
U.S. President George Bush's policies toward both sides of the Taiwan
Strait presented at a seminar on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The seminar was sponsored by the National Policy Research
Foundation, an opposition Kuomintang think tank.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the Bush administration has taken a more
intransigent attitude toward mainland China, while adopting a more
supportive attitude toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The attitude is characterized by the close watch on the promotion
of the mainland Chinese power structure and its effects on the
security of the United States, Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that although the United States does not
intend to act as an intermediary between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, it might be forced to get involved in cross-strait affairs if
the tension escalates.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that the United States will guarantee to mainland
China that Taiwan will not seek independence, while pledging to
Taiwan that it will not allow mainland China to use force against
Taiwan. This, he said, means that as long as Taipei and Beijing reach
peaceful agreement, the United States will support the agreement.</P>
      <P>Lin said in the report that Bush's remarks on arms sales to
Taiwan and the joint defense of Taiwan have also effectively conveyed
the United States' message to Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the United States' friendly gesture will
not necessarily guarantee real long-term cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>He concluded that cross-strait peace and stability will hinge on
the formation of a long-range framework that can be accepted by both
Taipei and Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC OFFICIAL EXPLAINS  TRADE POLICY TOWARD MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior trade official from the
Republic of China briefed an investment symposium held at Silicon
Valley on the ROC's trade policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin I-fu arrived the previous day at the
head of a 13-member ROC delegation trying to lure more U.S. high-tech
manufacturers to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regarding private sector investment in mainland China, Lin said
that the government has "adopted a stage-by-stage opening up policy"
although he added that core industries and high-technology industries
must stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in response to questions raised by the
participants on the ROC government's attitude toward Wang Yung-ching,
president of the Formosa Plastics Group, who asked the government to
relax its "no haste, be patient" policy which puts a ceiling on
Taiwan's investment in mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that the government and the industrial sector
have gradually reached a consensus that some high-tech industries,
excluding the semi-conductor industry, can receive orders and conduct
research and development in Taiwan, with manufacturing to be carried
out overseas or on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The government will decide on a case-by-case basis what kind of
high-tech industries can invest in the mainland, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin told the seminar participants that both the ruling and
opposition political parties in Taiwan have gradually been reaching a
consensus that priority should be placed on economic development.</P>
      <P>In addition to improving Taiwan's investment climate, the
government has been trying to lure more foreign investment and
introduce updated high technology into Taiwan so as to reshape the

said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO TRIM EXECUTIVE BRANCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged Saturday
to complete government restructuring over the next three years in
order to cut government expenditure and upgrade overall national
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chen made the vow in a speech delivered at the opening of a
workshop for senior government officials.</P>
      <P>Outlining five goals for government rejuvenation, Chen said the
government must slim down, reorganize, upgrade its ability to solve
problems and wipe out official corruption, as well as forge
partnerships and alliances between central and local governments and
among various government agencies.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that each Republic of China national has to spend
more than NT$100,000 (US$2,941) per year supporting the operations of
governments at various levels.</P>
      <P>"It's a very heavy burden for our people. We can't find any
convincing reason to continue this costly way of administration,"
Chen said, adding that Taiwan should trim its bureaucracy and
establish a small but highly efficient government.</P>
      <P>Chen said he fully understands the difficulties in trimming the
government work force. "Nevertheless, we must still learn from other
countries' experiences and set a clear goal for gradually slashing
the total number of civil servants, including administrative staff at
public schools, over the next few years.</P>
      <P>Government agencies, Chen went on, can work out various kinds of
incentives to encourage early retirement to facilitate personnel
restructuring.</P>
      <P>For the moment, he said the Executive Yuan, or the Cabinet,
should give the top priority to its own organizational restructuring.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Executive Yuan is burdened with too many
functionally oriented departments while lacking in policy research
and planning staff, Chen said the executive branch much undergo a
sweeping structural reform to enhance its capabilities in policy
planning, coordination and leadership.</P>
      <P>As to how the Cabinet should be restructured, Chen outlined four
directions -- a massive-scale merger of functionally oriented
departments; setting up a limited number of independent supervisory
and control commissions as well as politically motivated special
commissions; cutting the number of Cabinet ministries and councils by
at least one-third; fundamentally changing the Executive Yuan's
structure by opening several major policy planning units and
legislating a new law governing the role, duty and functions of
political appointees.</P>
      <P>Chen said one major purpose of the Executive Yuan restructuring
is to prevent it from becoming a bureaucratic body dominated by civil
servants.</P>
      <P>The president complained that the government restructuring and
rejuvenation have been delayed for too long. "I hope that a new bill
on the Executive Yuan organization can be drafted soon," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he stressed the importance of establishing a clean
government. "We can learn from foreign experiences in setting up an
independent organization to crack down on political graft and
corruption," he suggested, adding that the government can consider
appointing prosecutors to head government ethics departments and
encouraging ethics departments to maintain close contacts with the
watchdog auditing authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN: ONLY KMT CAN GIVE TAIWAN `REBIRTH'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan claimed Saturday at a meeting of party representatives that
Taiwan can only be "reborn" if the KMT regains power.</P>
      <P>He told the KMT's Taipei Committee members and its eight Taipei
candidates for the year-end legislative elections that the party must
reassess what it did wrong in the past and retain its legislative
majority by winning the elections.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the nation has "changed beyond recognition" over
the past year under the rule of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration, and "major foreign academic groups and their
media organizations" have been asking, "What happened in Taiwan?" "Is
Taiwan sick?" "Where is Taiwan headed?"</P>
      <P>He criticized the DPP for blaming its difficulties in policy
promotion on the KMT, claiming that the KMT has been "cooperative and
supportive" in helping to pass bills in the Legislative Yuan, even
when an extraordinary session had to be convened to approve major
financial reform bills.</P>
      <P>In contrast, he alleged, the DPP "opposed for the sake of
opposition" in the legislature before it came into power.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the DPP for blaming the current political and
economic quagmire on the legislature, the opposition parties and the
media.</P>
      <P>At the same meeting, KMT Central Standing Committee member Ma
Ying-jeou, who serves concurrently as Taipei mayor, said that Lien's
idea of establishing a "confederation" between the Republic of China
and mainland China can be taken as a "transitory concept" to serve as
an alternative model to Beijing's "one country, two systems" model
that can be discussed during future negotiations.</P>
      <P>However, Ma added that related measures must be taken to make the
idea feasible because the ROC Constitution and the Guidelines for
National Unification do not mention the concept of a confederation.</P>
      <P>The ultimate, permanent goal for both sides of the Taiwan Strait
is unification, he added.</P>

      <P>The prestigious Taiwan-based Hsiao Hsi
Yuan Puppet Troupe arrived in Panama City Friday on the first stop of
a three-nation tour.</P>
      <P>The 12-member group, led by Chinese Folk Art Foundation Chairman
Tseng Yung-yi and troupe director Hsu Wang, is scheduled to put on
two performances in Panama before traveling on to Costa Rica and
Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>For those who do not understand the Taiwanese dialect, the troupe
plans to project dialogue and story summaries in Spanish onto a
screen during its performances.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1913, the puppetry troupe has toured abroad more than
30 times in the past 10 years, traveling to France, Sweden, Holland,
Germany, the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Japan,
Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Up until the 1960s -- before television arrived in Taiwan --
puppet shows were one of the primary forms of entertainment on the
island and nearly any festive occasion called for a puppet
performance.</P>
      <P>In glove puppetry, the stage design features intricate gilded
carvings that resemble the entrance to a traditional Chinese temple.
The elaborate setting is ideal for presenting the finely embroidered
costumes, exquisite headdresses and delicately carved faces of the
puppets, which stand nearly a foot high.</P>
      <P>As in Chinese opera, many of the stories used in puppet shows are
adapted from classical literature or ancient legend. Some popular
examples are The Tale of the White Serpent and Journey to the West.
Live music always accompanies traditional puppet performances.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS 14% TAIPEI VOTERS WOULD BACK CANDIDATES OF `LEE GROUPING'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taipei citizens are aware
that former President Lee Teng-hui is planning to form a new
political grouping, but less than 15 percent of them are willing to
vote for its candidates in the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>These were the findings of a public opinion poll released
Saturday. The telephone survey of 1,085 adult residents in Taipei was
conducted from June 22-24 by the Taipei City chapter of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The poll results show that 77 percent of the respondents said
they were aware that Lee intends to organize a new political group to
take part in the legislative elections to be held in December.</P>
      <P>But only 14 percent said they would vote for candidates to be
nominated by the group, while nearly 50 percent said they would snub
candidates recommended by the new grouping.</P>
      <P>As for the possible impact of the Lee grouping on Taiwan's future
political landscape, 29 percent said they think that the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) would bear the brunt of the adverse
impact. Lee served as KMT chairman for 12 years until after the party
suffered an embarrassing defeat in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 25 percent said they think that the Lee group would
sway voters away from DPP candidates; 1.5 percent said they think
that it would affect the opposition People First Party's (PFP's)
support rate in the year-end elections; 0.7 percent said they think
that it would affect independent candidates' support rating; and a
mere 0.1 percent said they think that it would influence the voting
behavior of New Party followers.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, Chin Heng-wei, editor-in-chief of
the Contemporary Magazine, said it remains premature to make any
survey or judgment on the results of the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chin said, Lee's involvement in the year-end
elections and his meddling in relevant campaign activities will
certainly affect the electoral outcome.</P>
      <P>The same survey also found that 19.3 percent of those interviewed
said they would vote for DPP candidates in the year-end legislative
elections; 18.9 percent said they would opt for PFP nominees; 10.6
percent said they would throw support behind KMT standard bearers;
1.8 percent said they would cast their ballots for New Party
stalwarts; and 1.3 percent said they would vote for independent
hopefuls.</P>
      <P>Asked about their views on the "joint campaign" strategy, 84
percent said they look forward to seeing political parties or groups
adopt a "joint campaign" strategy for their candidates; but 13.3
percent said they do not support such a tactic.</P>
      <P>While 31 percent said they would vote for the candidates
recommended by their party headquarters under a joint campaign
strategy, 51 percent said they would vote in accordance with their
own free choice.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China government has been
trimming its work force since the mid-1990s and is set to reduce the
total number of its administrative staff by 15,000 next year, the
country's top personnel administrator said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chu Wu-hsien, director-general of the Central Personnel
Administration (CPA), made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian
listed government downsizing as the top goal of his administration's
government restructuring policy.</P>
      <P>Addressing a workshop for senior government officials, Chen also
said he hopes that his administration can score outstanding
achievements in government restructuring and rejuvenation over the
next three years.</P>
      <P>In response, Chu said the government has slashed 3.73 percent of
its workforce since 1996. In the current fiscal year, he went on, the
government has so far rid itself of several thousand employees.</P>
      <P>As several state-owned enterprises are scheduled to be gradually
privatized or downsized and the government's total administrative
staff will be further reduced, Chu said, the government workforce is
expected to shrink by an estimated 15,000 in 2001.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's complaint that the Cabinet should have
organized a workshop for senior government officials much earlier,
Chu said he sincerely accepted Chen's criticism.</P>
      <P>He added that the CPA will continue to organize similar workshops
in the future to brief all senior government officials on major
policy guidelines and facilitate the cultivation of esprit de corps

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan called Saturday on "those" who intend to
form a new political group to tell the public clearly of its purpose
and direction.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in Tainan County when he called on local
KMT county magistrate and legislative candidates for the year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that although Lee had denied organizing the
so-called Lee Grouping, "some" have insisted that the group will be
formed.</P>
      <P>"If you want stability for Taiwan, please do not create ethnic
hostility," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that the "confederation" idea proposed by him
corresponds with the KMT's "middle road" policy. He stressed,
however, that the scope of such a confederation between Taiwan and
mainland China should be negotiated by the two sides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen, widely
regarded as the driving force behind the new grouping, rebutted
Lien's remarks, saying that organizing a political party or group is
a normal thing to do in a democratic nation and pointing out that if
the KMT were capable, there would be no need to establish a new
political group.</P>
      <P>He further said that the new group will be formally set up in
August.</P>
