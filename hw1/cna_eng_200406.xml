(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen should diversify their
overseas investments, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said that
Taiwan's overseas investment has tilted too much toward mainland
China, which accounts for 57 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Given that cross-Taiwan Strait interaction is not stable, he
claimed that it remains very risky for Taiwan businessmen to do
business on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while commenting on Beijing's recent
vilification of Chi Mei Corp. founder Hsu Wen-long as "a shameless
anti-Chinese bigot" and claims that the mainland does not welcome
"this kind of Taiwanese businessman."</P>
      <P>In tune with the trend of increasing globalization and the
regional economic and trade integration, Chen suggested that Taiwan
businessmen should pay more attention to emerging markets around the
world and global deployment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen should not limit their vision to the mainland
market, where, he claimed, its capacity to absorb investment is
nearly full.</P>
      <P>It is an established government policy to help Taiwan businessmen
diversify their investments around the world, the vice minister
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A member of the Central Election Commission
(CEC) disputed before the court Tuesday claims made by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) that it was illegal to
hold the referendum and presidential election together on March 20.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hung said in the trial of a lawsuit brought by the KMT
and PFP seeking to annul the March 20 presidential election that the
CEC was ordered by the Executive Yuan to carry out the referendum
along with the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Neither of the two opposition parties in the case at no point
prior to the election took issue with the Executive Yuan's decision
to hold the referendum in conjunction with the presidential election.
Now, he said, they cast doubt on the results of the election simply
because they lost and want to overthrow it altogether.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the legality of the referendum has nothing to do
with the presidential election.</P>
      <P>However, a lawyer for the two opposition parties argued that the
Referendum Law forbids a defensive referendum to be held along with
the presidential election.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that the government's emergency measures after
the assassination attempt against President Chen Shui-bian on the eve
of election day stripped many military personnel and policemen of the
right to vote.</P>
      <P>He asked the court to subpoena documents relating to the March 19
shooting and the emergency measures taken by the government from the
National Security Council, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of
National Defense.</P>
      <P>The five judges hearing the case ordered the plaintiffs lawyer to
present evidence at the next hearing slated for June 25 to

      <P>Beijing should ensure legal protection for
Taiwan investors and refrain from "unreasonable political
interference" with their normal business activities in mainland
China, Taiwan's top mainland policy planner said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the

mainland does not welcome Taiwanese businessmen who use profits made
on the mainland to finance the pro-independence movement in Taiwan,
"such as Chi Mei Group Chairman Hsu Wen-lung."</P>
      <P>"I think everyone knows that if the mainland Chinese government
tries to suppress Taiwan internationally and intimidate Taiwanese
businesses and people, it will only drive the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait farther and father apart, " Wu said. "This is something
mainland Chinese leaders should think about carefully."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that the
government will prioritize promotion of convenient cargo
transportation across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Yu made the promise while delivering an administrative report to
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The premier said the government will continue to promote
cross-strait commercial exchanges and give priority to boosting
easier and more convenient cross-strait cargo transportation
services.</P>
      <P>In addition to Kaohsiung, Yu said, the government has opened two
additional ports -- Taichung and Keelung -- for offshore direct
cross-strait transshipment services, as part of its efforts to
realize the government's goal.</P>
      <P>Yu further said in his report that the government will step up
efforts to negotiate free trade agreements with the United States and
other countries to beef up Taiwan's trade competitiveness in the face
of mainland China's continued diplomatic embargo.</P>
      <P>"Signing free trade agreements (FTAs) is one of our priority
tasks for the coming four years, " Yu told lawmakers. "Since efforts
to expand our diplomatic relations are always blocked by Beijing, and
economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Strait are not normalized,
we must adjust our strategic positioning in international trade."</P>
      <P>In order to break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic embargo, Yu
said, Taiwan needs to sign FTAs with the United States and other
countries to connect to the world and avoid becoming overly reliant
on the mainland market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan signed its first-ever FTA with Panama last year and is now
seeking to sign similar agreements with the United States, Japan,
Singapore, New Zealand and many other major countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>With the mainland's rise as a major economic power, Yu said,
Taiwan must endeavor to achieve a balance so that the ever-growing
cross-strait economic ties will not lead to the nation's
over-reliance on the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST-PHASE WATER RESTRICTIONS REMOVED FOR NORTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first of a four-phase water restriction
plan put in place in northern Taiwan over the past year was removed
Tuesday thanks to this year's plentiful rainfall, a spokesman for the
Water Resources Agency (WRA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made during a national meeting called by an
anti-drought task force set up in March last year under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs to tackle the water shortage problem, the WRA
official said.</P>
      <P>The restriction -- a reduction in water pressure during off-peak
hours imposed since May last year in Taipei City, Taipei County,
Keelung City, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County -- was
lifted from Tuesday, the official said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to abundant rainfall since the beginning of this year,
including recent monsoon rain, major reservoirs in northern Taiwan
have taken in considerable quantities of water, the official said,
adding that the decision was made as typhoon season is approaching.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the shortage in southern Taiwan remains serious as a
result of scarce rainfall since November last year, which he said
might lead to the second crop on the Chianan Plain -- Taiwan's main
granary -- lying fallow. The first crop earlier this spring was also
halted for the same reason.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the water levels of the Tsengwen and Wushantou
reservoirs in Tainan County have fallen to very dangerously low
levels.</P>
      <P>However, the official said that the anti-drought task force did
not discuss issues related to stopping irrigation for the second crop
in southern Taiwan, which is slated to start in late June, because
more monsoon rain is likely to come before that time.</P>
      <P>The anti-drought task force will hold a meeting later this month
to decide whether the planned irrigation program will be halted, he
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been hit hard by a continued dry spree over the past
two years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMCHAM URGES ECONOMIC TIES WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(AmCham) makes economic ties with mainland China top priority in its
2004 Taiwan White Paper, released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The AmCham report emphasizes three major areas of concern in the
Taiwan-based U.S. business community: cross-Taiwan Strait,
cross-agency, and cross-party issues.</P>
      <P>This year, the six themes are the same as those presented last
year: improve Taiwan's public health and health care environment;
insist on world-class infrastructure; tighten intellectual property
rights protection; reduce government involvement in business hiring
decisions; complete essential financial reforms; and strengthen the
battle against corruption.</P>
      <P>However, a seventh item was added and placed at the top of the
list -- encourage economic ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>AmCham President Andrea Wu said that without direct cross-strait
transportation, Taiwan's plan to develop itself into a regional hub
is in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and the mainland are geographically close, Wu
said that Taiwan should see this proximity as an economic strength to
be embraced, not guarded against as a political risk.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that direct cross-strait trade, postal and
transportation links are improvements everyone engaged in business in
Taiwan hopes to see, not just U.S.-based business groups.</P>
      <P>She said that the mainland is a vast market and that a lot of
companies in Taiwan have set up footholds there. Doubling the length
of what should be a short trip between the two sides because of
political factors has a big impact on Taiwan's plan to become a
regional hub, she added.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that multinational enterprises encounter various
difficulties because of the indirect cross-strait transportation
situation.</P>
      <P>Looking over the past year, she said, Taiwan has made
"significant progress" regarding financial reforms and the protection
of intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>She further noted that there have been recent appointments of
several economic and financial heads, such as Economic Affairs
Minister Ho Mei-yueh, who have experience of close cooperation with
foreign businesses.</P>
      <P>Following the release of the white paper, Wu will lead an AmCham
delegation to Washington, D.C. from June 13-16. This annual
"Washington doorknocking" trip will involve calls on leading members
of Congress, key executive-branch agencies involved with economic
relations with Taiwan, as well as think tanks. Both before and after
the trip, AmCham will brief high-level officials in Taiwan on the
situation.</P>

four major tasks -- fostering a national identity, establishing a
failsafe security network, building a clean political environment and
forging strategic alliances -- in a report Tuesday to the legislative
Yuan on the policy of his administration.</P>
      <P>Yu reaffirmed the government's determination to establish a

emphasis on harmony between national pluralistic ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>He also vowed to do everything possible to protect the collective

spouses, including those from mainland China.</P>
      <P>With respect to the establishment of a failsafe security network,
Yu outlined a government plan to develop criminal investigation
know-how and renew all equipment with a view to preventing organized
crime.</P>
      <P>As for building a clean political environment, Yu reiterated the
government's determination to continue to intensify the political
donation management system and to set up an anti-corruption
mechanism.</P>
      <P>He also called on the legislature to speed up screening of
several major draft bills on political reforms, including a draft
political party law, a draft lobbying law and a draft law governing
the disposal of ill-gotten party assets.</P>
      <P>Touching on forging strategic alliances, the premier said his
administration will seek to sign free trade agreements with other
major nations so that the country will not be marginalized in the
face of global economic integration, while continuing to upgrade
Taiwan's global competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In the face of a new cross-Taiwan Strait situation following the
March 20 presidential election, the premier pledged that the
government will continue to devote itself to stabilizing relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and expanding bilateral
trade and economic exchanges under the basic principles of "Taiwan
first, reciprocity and risk management."</P>
      <P>The premier was expected to deliver his report Tuesday morning
but was delayed to the afternoon because of the interruption of
lawmakers from the Kuomintang and the People First Party who
protested against what they claimed to be the government's refusal to
find the truth behind the March 20 presidential election that they
claim was "unfair."</P>

    <TEXT>The Times: Britain aims to lift arms ban on
China.

Tony Blair is planning to ditch the 15-year-old embargo on
selling arms to China imposed after the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Britain is expected to side with France and Germany in arguing
that it is time for the EU ban to be lifted.

The Times understands that Mr Blair hopes that a decision could
be linked to improving human rights in China.

But resistance is so strong in America that Colin Powell, the
Secretary of State, has said that any European country lifting the
ban would be denied access to US military technology.

Financial Times: M&amp;S wields axe on top tier as &#xC2;&#xA3;10bn Green bid
looms.

Marks and Spencer, the iconic British retailer, on Monday night
threw out its chairman and chief executive in a dramatic attempt to
fend off an expected &#xC2;&#xA3;10bn (? 15bn) takeover bid from Philip Green,
the flamboyant retailing entrepreneur.

Preparing itself for what is set to be one of Europe's biggest
corporate power struggles this year, M&amp;S said Luc Vandevelde, the
Belgian who was already due to depart as chairman, and Roger Holmes,
chief executive for less than two years, would leave the ailing
company with immediate effect.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MND CLOSELY MONITORING PLA ACTIVITIES: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Tuesday it has so far not detected obvious signs showing that
mainland China will conduct military exercises in the near future.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng was responding to
media reports that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will conduct
combined services military drills on Dongshan Island in the Taiwan
Strait that separates Taiwan from the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Huang said the PLA has usually conducted routine military
exercises in the Dongshan area between May and August because the
weather and the Taiwan Strait wave situation during the period are
suitable for military training drills.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Huang said, the MND doesn't rule out the possibility
of the PLA conducting training exercises in the Dongshan area off the
southeastern mainland coast opposite Taiwan in the coming months.</P>
      <P>"But so far, we have not detected signs of major PLA movements or
deployments, " Huang said, adding that in any event, the MND will
continue to monitor PLA activities closely.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, mainland China is
preparing for a combined services war game aimed at "taking control of
the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>The reports said that up to 18,000 mainland troops will take part
in the training exercise to focus on a mock amphibious landing on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted a pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper as saying
that the war game would take place in June and July on Dongshan Island
off the southeastern mainland province of Fujian just 150 nautical
miles west of Taiwan's Penghu Island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER REFUTES ALLEGATIONS OF DEFECTIVE REACTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) -- builder and
operator of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant -- refuted
allegations Tuesday that the second of the two reactors for the plant
under construction is defective.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said that the newly built reactor -- expected
to be delivered from Japan before the end of June -- is safe and was
built under strict manufacturing standards. "There will be no safety
worries about the reactor since there is a full series of production
and test run records, plus accreditation certificates issued by a
number of relevant companies," Taipower officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that like the first one, the second reactor for the
Fourth Nuclear Power Plant was designed by General Electric (GE) and
co- built by Hitachi and Toshiba. Full documentation on the
production and test runs comply with the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Codes and Standards, and the reactors
have passed security and operational checks by engineers from GE and
Taipower as well, they added.</P>
      <P>The reactor, an Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) , is the
same model as the sixth and seventh ABWRs installed in the Tokyo
Power Company's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Japan's
Niigata prefecture.</P>
      <P>Japanese and Taiwanese anti-nuclear activists have threatened to
protest the delivery of the second ABWR from Japan to Taiwan, saying
that the ABWRs at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa facility had eight reactor
trips in the first three-and-a-half years of operations from 1996,
mostly as a result of cracks in fuel rods, a core and vital system of
the reactors.</P>
      <P>A reactor trip is an unscheduled shutdown to avoid overheating.
Causes of a reactor trip can vary from mechanical to human error to
acts of nature or a combination of all three.</P>
      <P>To avoid such problems, Taipower officials said that they have
seen to it that the designs, materials and manufacturing process of
the two ABWRs for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have all been
changed or modified.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials denied the postponement of the ABWR's delivery
from early June to the end of this month was the result of recent
announcements by Taiwanese and Japanese anti-nuclear groups that they
would protest the arrival of the second reactor on June 4 in
Kungliao, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The NoNuke Taiwan Union lodged a protest last Friday against the
delivery of the second ABWR, originally scheduled to arrive in Taiwan
June 4.</P>
      <P>NoNuke Taiwan Union Executive Director Ho Tsung-hsun said that
several environmental protection activist groups in Taiwan and Japan
will jointly launch protests and rallies in Taiwan and Japan,
beginning Tuesday to express their opposition to the usage of the
fault-ridden ABWRs.</P>
      <P>The GE-Hitachi-Toshiba-built ABWRs are notorious for their
frequent reactor trips over the past years of operation due to
mechanical defects, Ho said.</P>
      <P>A group of Japanese anti-nuclear environmentalists were also
scheduled to launch a series of protests on the seas near Yokosuka
Harbor Tuesday. The protests will be backed up by similar rallies to
be held on land in a few other Japanese cities, Ho said.</P>
      <P>He added that in Taiwan, environmental protection groups and
social and human rights activist groups will also launch
demonstrations at the Interchange Association, Taipei Office, which
is Japan's liaison office in Taiwan, and in Kungliao, Taipei County,
where the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant is located.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, Taiwan could become only the second country in
the world to use the ABWRs, which have proven to be unreliable.</P>
      <P>Ho lambasted the government and Taipower for insisting on
continuing construction on the controversial nuclear power plant and
on using the ABWRs, noting that even the Japanese authorities have
refused to endorse the safety of the core systems.</P>
      <P>Japanese legislators had questioned the regulations on export
permission for the ABWRs to Taiwan a couple of years ago, only
receiving a reply from Japanese administration officials that "Taiwan
should bear the full security responsibility for the import of the
ABWRs, and we [the government] have no plans to suspend the export, "
according to Ho.</P>
      <P>The first of the two reactors for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant
was unloaded June 20, 2003, despite protests from residents near the
construction site in Kungliao.</P>
      <P>Construction on the controversial Fourth Nuclear Power Plant has
only been half completed amid years of political wrangling over the
issue dating back to 2000.</P>
      <P>Construction was abruptly halted in October 2000 by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) just five months after it came to
power with the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian in May of
that year. The administration ordered a resumption of construction in
February 2001 after encountering an enormous backlash from the
opposition camp and the public.</P>
      <P>The government even planned to allow a referendum to be held in
Kungliao to enable the local residents to decide the future of the
plant, as a nuclear-free Taiwan has long been a top priority of the
DPP and was one of Chen's election promises. The referendum, however,
has never been held.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 32-member Taiwan delegation arrived in
Athens Tuesday to look over the venues for the upcoming summer
Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The delegation was warmly greeted by Hsieh Tung-liang, Taiwan's
representative to Greece, who also offered his views to the
delegation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if Taiwan's team can win its first-ever gold
medal -- something he said he was confident could be achieved -- it
would raise the profile of Taiwan in the eyes of the world.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that Athens won the right to host the Olympics Games
in 1997, but it started construction projects only after stalling for
three years, so that there are some small problems remaining on the
main stadium, the starting point for the marathon as well as the
swimming pools. The main stadium is scheduled to be complete on June
30, and workers are busy putting on the final touches.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Olympics Games are scattered around 17
regions, and that the soccer stadiums are in four regions, including
the more remote island of Crete, and that traffic among the venues of
the Games could be a serious problem.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reminded the delegation that in the marathon competition,
after 17 kilometers, there will be a stretch of 15 kilometers of
uphill roads, and that Taipei competitors will have to adjust their
physical conditions.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that Greece has recruited Greek-American
baseball players from the U.S. Major Leagues.</P>
      <P>The delegation also called on the Athens Olympics Organization
Committee to listen to their briefing Tuesday, and then went to the
venues for badminton, taekwondo, baseball and softball.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT PROPOSES NEW MODE FOR COOPERATION WITH EL SALVADOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Salvador,  May  31 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu said Monday she will try to persuade major Taiwan business
groups to cooperate with El Salvador in building new cities or rural
townships in the Central American country.</P>
      <P>Lu, who arrived in San Salvador Sunday evening to attend
Salvadoran President-elect Elias Antonio Saca's June 1 inauguration
on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian, made the remarks while
attending a cocktail reception hosted by ROC Ambassador to El Salvador
Hou Ping-fu in her honor.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Lu said Taiwan and El Salvador have
many things in common.</P>
      <P>"We have shared values in freedom, democracy and human rights.
Both of our countries were hit by devastating earthquakes several
years ago. In 2000, the people of Taiwan elected its youngest-ever
president, Chen Shui-bian, and its first-ever female vice president.
Earlier this year, Salvadoran voters elected a 39-year-old as their
new president, and Ana Vilma Albanez de Escobar, as their first-ever
female vice president," Lu said, adding that she believes El Salvador
will enter a new stage of accelerated national development under the
leadership of Saca.</P>
      <P>Lu told well-wishers that during a visit to a Tzu Chi community
in Chanmico City on the outskirts of San Salvador earlier in the day,
an idea occurred to her.</P>
      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, Taiwan's
largest charity, cooperated with the Chanmico City Government and the
Sacacoyo City Government in building a special residential community
each in the two cities in 2001 after two strong earthquakes wreaked
havoc in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi foundation's U.S. branch spent US$6.5 million on
building the two communities to accommodate displaced earthquake
refugees. In addition, the Tzu Chi Foundation has continued offering
free medical services, vocational training and basic computer
education programs in the areas to help improve their residents'
living conditions.</P>
      <P>Inspired by Tzu Chi's success story, Lu said she plans to
encourage Taiwan's elite business groups and agricultural experts to
cooperate with Salvadoran authorities in building new cities or
townships in the vicinity of San Salvador, El Salvador's capital, to
help boost the ROC diplomatic ally's economic development.</P>
      <P>Many Salvadoran government officials and social celebrities,
including the wife of outgoing Salvadoran President Francisco
Guillermo Flores Perez, Salvadoran Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
Eduardo Calix and National Assembly Speaker Ciro Cruz Zepeda.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lu delivered a speech on science, technology
and life at El Salvador's National Science and Technology University.
Elite members from El Salvador's various social quarters turned out
to listen to Lu's speech.</P>
      <P>Lu told the audience that Taiwan has come a long way in
transforming itself from authoritarian rule to a full democracy. In
2000, she said, Taiwan completed its first-ever transition of power
between different political parties in a peaceful, democratic manner.</P>
      <P>Over the past five decades, Lu said, Taiwan has also scored
outstanding achievements in economic development. Nowadays, she said,
Taiwan is the world's 15th largest economy, with per capital national
income of US$15,000 and the world's third-largest foreign exchange
reserves. At the moment, Taiwan ranks among the world's three largest
producers of 44 kinds of high-tech products and is the world's
No. 1 manufacturer of 17 kinds of information-technology products.
Moreover, 178 foreign business groups have set up regional operations
headquarters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan is now pursuing balanced national development,
with equal emphasis on economic growth, environmental protection,
social justice, human rights protection, gender equality and
narrowing the wealth gap.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said, Taiwan is scheduled to complete sweeping
constitutional reforms by 2008. Lu said she hopes the amended ROC
Constitution will include a provision stipulating that the number of
elected representatives of the same sex in the Legislative Yuan or
local councils should not fall below one-third of the total seats.</P>
      <P>Lu, who is the ROC's first-ever female vice president, said that
since President Chen took power in 2000, Taiwan has made progress in
recruiting more women into public service. "We now have a female vice
president and a female vice premier," she said proudly.</P>
      <P>As part of her effort to promote relations between Taiwan and El
Salvador, Lu said she will launch a campaign to encourage Taiwan's
university students to forge friendships by mail with their
counterparts at El Salvador's National Science and Technology
University.</P>
      <P>After a two-day transit stop in Las Vegas, Lu arrived in San
Salvador Sunday evening at the head of a large delegation to attend
Saca's inauguration.</P>
      <P>Members of Lu's entourage include Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General James Huang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang
Lung-yuan, and members of the Presidential Office's Science and
Technology Advisory Commission and its human rights advisory panel.</P>
      <P>Lu left Taipei Friday for her first overseas trip since she was
sworn in for a second four-year term May 20. In addition to El
Salvador, the 14-day diplomatic journey will also take Lu to Costa
Rica and Guatemala. On her way back to Taipei, Lu will make a transit
stop in San Francisco.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has donated US$150,000
each to Haiti and the Dominican Republic in the aftermath of
devastating flooding, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>James Wu, the foreign ministry's deputy director-general of the
Department of Central and South American Affairs, made the
announcement against the backdrop of wire reports that over 1,700
people along the south-central border of Haiti and the Dominican
Republic were killed after a week of torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Wu said that more help would be required in the form of tents,
clothing and food.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry will continue to coordinate with local
charitable and non-governmental organizations to seek donations to
help the two countries, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu also said that the prospects for Taiwan's entry
into the Organization of American States (OAS) is good.</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks came on the heels of the United States' support of
Taiwan's entry into the regional organization as an observer. The
proposal is now on the agenda for the next meeting.</P>
      <P>In addition, former Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez
is expected to assume the post of secretary-general of the OAS, and
the rotating chairmen in the third and fourth quarters will be served
by the representatives from Nicaragua and Panama, two of the ROC's
allies.</P>
      <P>He noted that the OAS is a major regional organization as is the
United Nations and that Taiwan has worked toward joining the OAS for
years. Through cooperative projects with American countries and
bilateral exchanges, American nations have begun to understand that
Taiwan is willing to contribute to the OAS, he added.</P>
      <P>The OAS was set up in 1948 to promote democracy, human rights,
peace, security and economic prosperity in central, south and north
America and in the Caribbean area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT VISITS TZU CHI VILLAGES IN EL SALVADOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Salvador,  May  31 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu praised Taiwan's Buddhist Compassionate Tzu Chi Society on
Monday for showing "great love" to people around the world.</P>
      <P>Lu, who is in El Salvador on an official visit, headed to a
residential community in Chanmico City on the outskirts of San
Salvador Monday morning. The community was one of the two "Tzu Chi"
villages built by Tzu Chi, Taiwan's largest charitable organization,
to accommodate displaced people after two devastating earthquakes
rocked El Salvador in 2001.</P>
      <P>Arriving to a warm welcome by the newly-moved-in residents of the
"Tzu Chi" village in Chanmico, who waved small ROC banners flags, Lu
said she was overwhelmed by the Salvadoran people's passion.</P>
      <P>"Tzu Chi is a source of pride for Taiwan and an example of the
fact that love has no borders," Lu said.</P>
      <P>The two deadly earthquakes that hit El Salvador in 2001 killed
more than 1,2000 people, injured more than 7,000 others, and
destroyed some 300,000 houses.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the earthquakes struck, members of the Tzu Chi
Chapter in the United States rushed to the disaster scene and
collaborated with the local governments on a plan to build 1,175
housing units at a cost of US$6.5 million.</P>
      <P>The two "Tzu Chi" villages are located in Chanmico City and
Sacacoyo City. In addition to houses, Tzu Chi has also worked to
build schools, clinics, police offices and bus stations in the two
cities.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian officiated at a ground-breaking ceremony
to mark the launch of the two "Tzu Chi" villages' development when
Chen visited El Salvador at the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>Two and a half years later, the two "Tzu Chi" communities are now
fully developed. The local residents were so enthusiastic about the
visit by Taiwan's vice president that some kindergartens even
suspended classes so that students could go onto the streets and
greet Lu.</P>
      <P>According to volunteers from the Tzu Chi Chapter in the United
States, despite the fact the two "Tzu Chi" villages have already been
built, the Tzu Chi members have continued to visit the two cities
frequently to offer free medical care, vocational training and
computer lessons to the local residents in a bid to help them to be
able to pull their own weight.</P>
      <P>At the "Tzu Chi" village, Lu said that Taiwan had also received
compassionate relief aid from around the world after a deadly
earthquake struck Sept. 21, 1999. From the "Tzu Chi" communities, Lu
said, she sees the fact that "love is without borders."</P>
      <P>Lu, who initiated a campaign in 2001 to encourage Taiwan citizens
to sponsor orphans in El Salvador, said she sees the Salvadoran
children as children of her own. After several years of financial
support, she said, the task now is to enable these children to
receive a good education.</P>
      <P>Lu, at the head of an ROC official delegation, arrived in El
Salvador's capital of San Salvador Sunday evening to attend
Salvadoran President-elect Elias Antonio Saca's June 1 inauguration
on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>More than 100 ROC expatriates turned out to welcome Lu in front
of the hotel where she will be staying. They waved ROC national flags
and chanted slogans to welcome Lu and show their patriotism.</P>
      <P>Lu left Taipei last Friday for her first overseas trip since she
was sworn in for a second four-year term May 20. In addition to El
Salvador, the 14-day journey will also take Lu to two other ROC
diplomatic allies in Central America, namely Costa Rica and
Guatemala. On her way back to Taipei, Lu will make a transit stop in
San Francisco for two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MILITARY BUILDUP DESTABILIZING: U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 1 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States considers the mainland
Chinese military buildup as destabilizing, according to the spokesman
for the U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>"We do see the military buildup and missile deployment (against
Taiwan) as destabilizing, " spokesman Richard Boucher said during a
regular press briefing Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We've said that publicly as well, because it's a situation that
is of importance to us and concern to us. We want to see peaceful
resolution, we don't want to see coercion. And we want to be quite
clear on that," Boucher noted.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon warned in a report May 28 that mainland China was
developing "credible military options" to prevent Taiwan from
achieving independence, including tools to discourage the United
States from coming to Taiwan's aid in the event of a cross-strait
conflict.</P>
      <P>Beijing on Tuesday defended its military buildup as essential to
"safeguarding national sovereignty" and brushed off the Pentagon
report as being hostile and based on a Cold War mentality.</P>
      <P>Boucher was asked during the press briefing how he can reconcile
the fact that the United States and mainland China are enjoying a
warmer relationship and better cooperation, like in Iraq, while the
United States at the same time still publicly treats China as a
threat.</P>
      <P>Boucher answered that he would not speak for the Pentagon report
or comment on the Chinese reaction to it, but he did say that "we
have had a very consistent policy of cooperating with China wherever
we can but also being clear about our differences."</P>
      <P>"And when it comes to the Taiwan Straits, I think we have a very
consistent policy supporting peaceful resolution. We have opposed the
use of force to settle the conflict in the Taiwan Straits, and we
view military coercion as counterproductive. So that's been a very
steady policy that we've enunciated before," Boucher said.</P>
      <P>As to reports that the United Kingdom is about to join France and
other E.U. members to lift the European Union ban on arms sales to
mainland China, Boucher answered that he hasn't heard anything from
the British on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, Boucher added that "we've been fairly consistent in our
talks with European Union members, making clear our view that it's
not time to lift the arms embargo on China that they have."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER YU TO MEET WITH AMCHAM EXECUTIVES ON CROSS-STRAIT LINKS ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun is willing to meet with
members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) to
exchange views on the opening of direct transportation links across
the Taiwan Strait, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after AmCham unveiled its 2004
Taiwan White Paper a day earlier which said Taiwan risks to
become irrelevant if direct cross-strait shipping and air
links cannot be opened soon.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan was admitted to the World Trade Organization in
2002, Chen said, Taiwan has continued to ease restrictions on
cross-strait trade, capital flow and visitor exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed to slow progress in opening direct
cross-strait shipping and air links mainly to Beijing's
refusal to resume cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, Taiwan still has made all what
it can do unilaterally to facilitate cross-strait transportation
services, such as opening direct shipping services between its two
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu as mainland China's Xiamen
and Mawei as well as opening three of its sea ports for direct
cross-strait transshipment services.</P>
      <P>As opening direct cross-strait shipping and air links
involve exercise of public authority and national security issues,
Chen said, the two sides must hold direct negotiations to work out
viable terms before such services can be launched.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC government hopes that the AmCham can correctly
understand Taiwan's efforts in this regard and convey Taiwan's
goodwill message to mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that AmCham can play a catalyst role in
helping push for resumption of cross-strait negotiations on
direct shipping and air links," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen also called on mainland authorities to make a
goodwill response to President Chen Shui-bian's innovative and
construction proposals outlined in his May 20 inauguration
address to cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>"Beijing should not impose political barriers to hinder
cross-strait commercial exchanges and transportation services," Chen
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL WISDOM URGED TO SETTLE CROSS-STRAIT RIFT FOR COMPANIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan authorities need political wisdom to
settle the cross-Taiwan Strait rift for mainland-based Taiwan
businesses to operate smoothly in the mainland, a lawmaker who owns a
computer company with mainland investments said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kao Yu-jen, a lawmaker from the main opposition Kuomintang and
chairman of Twinhead International Corp., made the comments after
former Chi Mei Group Chairman Shu Wen-long was attacked by the
Beijing-based People's Daily in its May 31 edition as reaping profits
in mainland China to back Taiwan independence at home.</P>
      <P>Expressing his hope that the two sides of the Strait can deal
with each other peacefully due to frequent and close trade and
economic exchanges, Kao urged the government to engage the mainland
with wisdom and do its best to set up the three direct links across
the Strait as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investments in mainland China are mutually beneficial for
the two sides, as Taiwan businesses create job opportunities and
prosperity for mainland people while the mainland serves as a cheap
manufacturing base for Taiwan enterprises to become more competitive,
he said.</P>
      <P>For instance, Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$38 billion
with mainland China in 2003, far sufficient to compensate the US$20
billion trade deficit that the country recorded with Japan, Kao
pointed out.</P>
      <P>"Talking business as a businessman, 'peace' is what we need
most," Kao stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOFT TO LEAD TAIWAN COMPANIES TO PROMOTE SALES IN WORLD MARKETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Elisha Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is planning to send eight trade
delegations to major global market destinations this year, with India
and South Korea as primary targets, BOFT officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The planned trade delegations will visit Latin America, Japan,
South Korea, Eastern Europe, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle
East and Africa, with the economics minister or the vice minister
leading the delegations, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>For example, the officials added, Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang embarked Wednesday on a trade promotion tour
to four Southeast Asian countries, with representatives from 46
companies participating, the largest group in the last few years.</P>
      <P>The officials went on that although mainland China has become
Taiwan's largest trading partner, the recent unfriendly words by
mainland Chinese officials toward Taiwan and its plan to cool down
the economy on the mainland have made Taiwanese companies hesitant
toward investing in the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>In order to help Taiwan enterprises reduce the risk for their
investments in mainland China, the BOFT has held several symposiums
to teach Taiwanese entrepreneurs how to evade risk and has,
therefore, planned eight trade promotion tours to other markets.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has South Korea as its main
target to promote trade to reduce the trade deficit, while India,
with a strong software industry, qualified high tech workers, as well
as cheap wages, has been considered as a promising production base
that can replace mainland China.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials stressed that although the trade campaign conforms
to part of the new economics minister's promise to help Taiwan
entrepreneurs reduce risk in their investments and scale down
investment in mainland China, it does not signify that Taiwanese
companies should abandon the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Instead, Taiwan companies should look to every market in the
world, and strengthen the island's economic power through global
resources, the officials noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMCHAM SUGGESTIONS WILL BE PASSED ON TO CABINET FOR REVIEW: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih
Yen-shiang said the ministry will relay foreign business people's
request for the establishment of direct transportation links with the
mainland to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from lawmakers, Shih, who attended the
legislative session for his superior, Minister Ho Mei-yueh, said that
for the time being the economics ministry will adhere to a three-step
plan laid down by President Chen Shui-bian for opening direct links
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>While this plan might not live up to the expectations of some
foreign businessmen, it does balance national security with the
country's economic development, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the vice economics minister said, the ministry
continues to encourage local business people to diversify their
overseas investments beyond mainland China. Brazil, Russia and India
are three markets with potential, Shih added.</P>
      <P>Shih pointed to the fact that Taiwan is already the biggest
foreign investor in Vietnam; however, he admitted that except for
India, there is no plan underway to promote investment in the other
two countries.</P>
      <P>Shih made the comments after the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei appealed for the rapid establishment of direct transportation
links with the mainland in its Taiwan White Paper 2004, which was
released the previous day. The report said that Taiwan is
marginalizing itself and losing competitiveness because of the lack
of direct links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers backed the conclusions in the White Paper
and called for the Executive Yuan to accept the suggestions of
foreign business people to open direct links with the mainland rather
than encouraging local businessmen to invest in places other than the
mainland.</P>
      <P>However, an official from the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications said that the current efforts to speed up the existing
transfer of goods across the Strait has gone nowhere since any
changes must be done with the cooperation of the mainland, and
Beijing remains intransigent.</P>
      <P>Beijing has refused to cooperate with Taiwan on this program,
claiming that it is a scheme by Taipei to create the facade of an
international shipping lane across the Strait, when, according to
Beijing, the lane would necessarily be a domestic route, given
Beijing's insistence on its "one-China" principle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR MILITARY PROCUREMENT AIMED AT SELF-DEFENSE: MND VICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major military procurement plans designed by
the Ministry of National Defense (MND) are aimed at bolstering
Taiwan's deterrent and self-defense capabilities, and do not
translate to an arm race with mainland China, Vice Defense Minister
Hou Shou-yeh said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hou made the remarks to reporters after the Executive Yuan
approved the ministry's special budget allocations for major military
procurement programs worth a total of NT$610.8 billion (about
US$18.23 billion).</P>
      <P>Military procurement has been a key segment of the government's
long-term military build-up policy to step up Taiwan's self-defense
clout, which should not be affected by other factors, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to the MND vice minister, the budget allocations put
forward by the ministry include spending on weapons such as
submarines, anti-missile systems and aircraft to hunt and destroy
enemy submarines and to provide surveillance of surface shipping --
all prime items listed in the 2001 procurement program.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan needs submarines very much to beef up its
defense capabilities and that the defense ministry will do its best
to promote the goal of building Taiwan's own submarines.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
will head a legislative delegation to visit the United States later
this month to discuss arms procurement budget issues, political
sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sources revealed the travel plan after the Cabinet passed a
Ministry of National Defense-proposed budget plan at its weekly
meeting to buy anti-missile defense systems, anti-submarine aircraft
and diesel-powered submarines from the United States.</P>
      <P>The NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) budget proposal needs the
opposition-controlled legislature's approval. Against this backdrop,
the sources said, the United States has invited Wang to head a
legislative delegation to visit Washington, D.C. as part of its
efforts to lobby Taiwan lawmakers' support for the budget plan.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wang, the delegation will be composed of a
representative from the legislative caucus of each political party as
well as the three conveners of the Legislative Yuan's Defense
Committee.</P>
      <P>The delegation is scheduled to leave Taipei June 17 or June 18,
the sources said, adding that the itinerary has yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>The sources said the delegation has yet to decide whether to
visit Washington, D.C. first and then travel to Hawaii on the way
back to Taipei or to visit Hawaii first and then travel to the U.S.
capital. Hawaii is the seat of the U.S. Pacific Command. The visit
will take about 10 days, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The proposed budget would cover six sets of Patriot Advanced
Capability III anti-missile systems, eight conventional submarines
and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Taiwan's defense spending has
dropped in recent years because of overall government budget cuts,
which could weaken the island's defenses in the face of mounting
military threats from mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Beijing has continued to boost it military spending in recent
years, and we are worried about it," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet proposed raising the needed funds by issuing bonds or
selling government-owned stocks and land, Chen said.</P>
      <P>U.S. officials have complained that Taiwan has been taking too
long to finalize the weapons procurement deals.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Patriot missiles would cost NT$145 billion (US$4.3
billion) , the submarines NT$412 billion (US$12.3 billion) and the
anti-submarine aircraft NT$53 billion (US$1.5 billion).</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers have questioned if the Patriot missiles
could effectively knock down mainland China's ballistic or cruise
missiles, and have complained about the high costs of other weapons.</P>

      <P>Both sides of the Taiwan Strait should
resume talks as soon as possible to solve the problems resulting from
illegal immigrants sneaking into Taiwan from mainland China, Premier
Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a floor meeting of the
Executive Yuan in which he heard that a recent crackdown by the
authorities has nabbed more than 1,400 illegal mainland immigrants so
far.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan launched an inter-government agency project
Nov. 1 last year, dubbed Operation Snakehunt, to crack down on
illegal mainland immigrants that have strained the nation's financial
burden and caused "major social order problems."</P>
      <P>Statistics show that Taiwan has nabbed 1,437 illegal mainland
immigrants over the past six months and exposed 25 human smuggling or
syndicated crime rings.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the operation has borne fruit in exposing
smuggling and sex trade organizations, as well as tracking down
illegal mainland immigrants hidden in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But he also said that the root of the problem lies with Beijing
and that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should resume talks as soon
as possible to establish a crime-fighting mechanism.</P>
      <P>He asked the Mainland Affairs Council to coordinate with Beijing
in speeding up the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants and
supplying related information to mainland government agencies so as to
"cut the flow at the root."</P>

      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu Tuesday asked Florida Governor Jeb Bush, brother of United
States President George W. Bush, to convey greetings to the U.S.
president.</P>
      <P>Lu, who sat beside the Florida governor at a national banquet
given by El Salvador President Elias Antonio Saca, asked Bush to
convey her appreciation to President Bush for his long-term support
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Knowing of Jeb Bush's friendship with Therese Shaheen, former
chairperson of the American Institute in Taiwan, which is in charge
of dealing with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties between
Taipei and Washington, Lu also asked him to convey her greetings to
Shaheen.</P>
      <P>They also talked about increasing trade exchanges between Taiwan
and Florida. Bush said that he has visited Taiwan four times, with
the last visit in 1991. Lu invited him to visit the island again, and
Bush said he would consider this. In turn, the Florida governor also
invited Lu to visit his state.</P>
      <P>Lu also spoke about the impact on the world brought about by
severe acute respiratory syndrome, adding that if Taiwan were allowed
to join the World Health Organization, it would able to contribute
its experience in fighting the disease.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Lu attended the inauguration of Saca and Vice President
Ana Vilma Albanez de Escorbar.</P>
      <P>Although she has not completely recovered from the leg wound she
received during the March 19 election-eve shooting, she did not use
crutches.</P>
      <P>She also refused wheelchairs prepared by her entourage for the
trip, preferring crutches, although they have caused bruising to her
left hand because of her busy schedule during her two-day transit stay
in Las Vegas.</P>
      <P>Since arriving in El Salvador Sunday evening, she kept the use of
crutches to a minimum, but her schedule was even tighter.</P>
      <P>On Monday, she called on El Salvador's president and vice
president, as well as the president-elect and vice president-elect.
She also delivered a speech at El Salvador's University of Technology
and visited a residential community in Chanmico City on
the outskirts of San Salvador, which was build in 2001 by Taiwan's
largest charity group -- The Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation -- after two strong earthquakes wreaked havoc there.</P>
      <P>During the inauguration Tuesday, Lu walked about 70 meters
without crutches to the grandstand to the warm applause of all
participants.</P>
      <P>She said afterwards that "as a representative of my country, I
think I have performed well."</P>
      <P>Lu will attend a banquet given by overseas Chinese residing in El
Salvador in her honor Tuesday night and will hold an international
press conference Wednesday before continuing her trip to Costa Rica,
the second leg of her Central American trip.</P>
      <P>Despite her leg wound and tight schedule, she said that "with
will, I will complete the trip."</P>
      <P>The vice president left Taipei Friday for her first overseas trip
since being sworn in for a second four-year term May 20. In addition
to El Salvador and Costa Rica, her 14-day diplomatic visit will also
take her to Guatemala. On her way back to Taipei, she will make a

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING HAS YET TO UNIFY BASIC TAIWAN POLICY TONE: NSB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mainland Chinese authorities have yet to
unify their basic policy tone toward Taiwan, a senior national
security official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>National Security Bureau (NSB) Deputy Director Huang Lai made the
remarks at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>During the session, opposition lawmakers asked about Huang's
views on Beijing's recent saber-rattling against Taiwanese investors
in the mainland. Earlier this week, Chinese Communist Party
mouthpiece the People's Daily ran an editorial saying that Beijing
does not welcome pro-independence Taiwanese businessmen. The
editorial even accused Hsu Wen-lung, founder of the Chi Mei Group, of
making money on the mainland to fund Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and publicly calling for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>In response, Huang said the verbal attack is part of the
mainland's "psychological warfare" ploy. Beijing used a similar
strategic in 2000 when the DPP came to power for the first time,
Huang recalled.</P>
      <P>Quoting intelligence reports, Huang said that the mainland has
yet to set its basic Taiwan policy tone after President Chen
Shui-bian's May 20 inauguration for a second four-year term.</P>
      <P>He said the NSB has continued to keep a close eye on developments
in Beijing's Taiwan policy formulation. Moreover, he said, the bureau
has been conducting long-term research of cross-Taiwan Strait
economic exchanges and relevant issues.</P>
      <P>"We are also studying the background of Beijing's current round
of saber-rattling against Taiwan businessmen with interests in
mainland China, " Huang said, adding that the mainland fingerpointing
at Taiwan businessmen marks a violation of its own promise not to
politicize business issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has said on numerous occasions that it would
not politicize trade issues, Huang said it should abide by its words
and protect Taiwan businessmen's investments on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Given Beijing's fickleness and capriciousness, Huang said, Taiwan
businessmen should understand that investing in the mainland is very
risky.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that the mainland is gearing up
preparations for combined services war games on Dongshan Island off
the southeastern mainland province of Fujian just 150 nautical miles
west of Taiwan's Penghu Island, Huang said it has become routine for
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to conduct training drills in the
Dongshan area.</P>
      <P>"For the past five to six years, the PLA has conducted a series
of training exercises on Dongshan Island between July and August
annually, " Huang said, adding that the training drills have usually
focused on mock amphibious landing exercises.</P>
      <P>According to a pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper, up to 18,000
mainland troops will take part in the Dongshan Island drills from
June to July with the aim of practicing strategies and tactics for
taking control of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Huang said attacking Taiwan is the PLA's long-term goal.
"Beijing has consistently been preparing to take Taiwan by force.
But so far, we have not yet detected obvious signs of
large-scale mainland military movements or deployments," Huang
said, adding that the NSB will continue monitoring
the PLA's activities in order to work out suitable response
measures to protect Taiwan's national security.</P>

    <TEXT>: New York Times: Iraq's New Government
Faces Bargaining Over Its Power.

The new caretaker government in Iraq was hailed Tuesday by
President Bush as ready to assume "full sovereignty" after June 30.
But its first job, according to American officials, will be to
negotiate sharp limits on that sovereignty in many vital areas,
particularly security matters.

Less than a month before the scheduled transfer of power, it
remains unclear exactly how much power will be transferred.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Rules on residence applications by Taiwan
people's mainland Chinese spouses have been eased after the Bureau of
Immigration under the Ministry of the Interior agreed to simplify the
process, a bureau spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the future, undisputed applications submitted by mainland
spouses to reside in Taiwan will be immediately approved after being
examined by the bureau, the spokesman said, adding that qualified
documents do not have to be further processed in a joint screening
meeting and neither do applicants from the mainland have to go
through an interview with immigration officials, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the first joint screening meeting was
held May 18 to scrutinize a total of 704 applications. Except for a
very small number of disputed cases due to the background of the
applicants, who were found to be either Chinese Communist Party
members or to have criminal records, the vast majority of the
applications were approved in the meeting, he noted.</P>
      <P>In a related development, representatives of a cross-Taiwan
Strait marriage promotion association kicked off an endorsement
campaign outside the Bureau of Immigration Tuesday in protest against
what they claim is the government's "unfair treatment" of mainland
husbands and wives in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG, MACAU URGED TO SET UP REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) is hoping that the special administrative regions of Hong Kong
and Macau can set up representative offices in Taiwan soon, an MAC
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yung-shan, director of the MAC's Department of Hong Kong
and Macau Affairs, noted that 3,073 students from Hong Kong and Macau
are studying in Taiwan, accounting for a third of the overseas
students presently on the island.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are also residents from the two regions coming
to live in Taiwan, Chang said. As neither Hong Kong nor Macau have
set up representative offices in Taiwan, they cannot help deal with
problems their residents face while living in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>In view of the situation, the department is studying measures to
take care of Hong Kong and Macau people living here, he said.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that "such a unilateral move will not be
comprehensive" and he expressed the hope that the two special
administrative regions will address the issue squarely and set up
offices here.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, Hong Kong has not responded positively or
showed any intention to set up a Taiwan office, despite having been
contacted by the MAC.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Macau people residing in Taiwan have exerted greater
pressure in the Macau Administrative Region, and as far as his
department understands, Macau has heeded their voices and is now
studying the issue, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang also spoke of the visa application of Pao Cheng-kang,
Taiwan's new representative to Hong Kong, expressing the hope that
Hong Kong will pragmatically address the importance of Taiwan-Hong
Kong affairs so as to grant the visa application speedily.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the review procedure of Pao's application
will be faster than that of his predecesor, Chang Liang-jen, who had
to wait for three months before getting his visa four years ago.</P>
      <P>He also said that both the MAC and Taiwan businessmen are
watching closely economic and political developments in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Saying that it has been three months since the signing of a
closer economic partnership arrangement (CEPA) between mainland China
and Hong Kong, he added that it will take six more months to see the
effect of the CEPA on Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>He also noted the greater restrictions placed on Hong Kong by the
mainland, despite the Hong Kong people's calls for more democratic
rights to select their leaders and legislators.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials and specialists from Taiwan and
Russia gathered in Moscow Monday for the 1st Taiwan-Russia Water
Resources Conference to exchange views on and experiences in
hydrology, fresh water resources management and related technologies.</P>
      <P>The participants struck an agreement upon the conclusion of the
conference that Taiwan and Russia will engage in bilateral exchanges
in water resources management and related technological fields on a
regular basis in the future.</P>
      <P>The 12-member Taiwan delegation, comprised of officials from the
Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
as well as academics from universities and representatives from the
private industrial sector, was led by WRA Director-General Chen
Shen-hsien.</P>
      <P>The Russian delegation, meanwhile, was comprised of scholars and
specialists from the water resources research institute under the
prestigious Russian Academy of Sciences.</P>
      <P>Russian expertise and research in water and ocean resources is
renowned worldwide. The Russian "water" researchers have long been
keenly interested in Taiwan's research in the same field.</P>
      <P>Most of the Russian participants said that they are amazed at the
depth and scope of Taiwan's research in hydrological sciences, water
resources management and related technologies, particularly in the
integration of public water utilities and related technologies. One
of the Russian participants said that he has gained unexpected
knowledge about his particular field after coming in contact with
Taiwan's research.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking part in the water conference, the Taiwan
delegation will also attend an international hydrology exposition --
ECWATECH-2004, the 6th International Trade Fair and Congress Water:
Ecology and Technology, slated to open in Moscow this week.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between the Republic of
China and Paraguay remain firm and solid, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) spokesman Richard Shih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shih was responding to media reports that mainland China has been
lobbying Brazil to pressure Paraguay to switch its diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Shih said the reports were speculative. As a matter of fact, Shih
said, Taiwan-Paraguay relations have been in good shape. For
instance, Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte just concluded a state
visit to Taiwan late last month during which he attended President
Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inauguration for a second four-year term.</P>
      <P>After his return to Asuncion, Shih said, Duarte told the
Paraguayan press that his Taiwan visit was very fruitful and that the
two countries will negotiate and sign a free trade agreement within a
year.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Paraguay is likely to yield to pressure from its
Southern Common Market allies to switch its diplomatic allegiance,
Shih said Duarte has reiterated on many public occasions that
Paraguay's diplomatic ties with the ROC have contributed much to the
country's economic development over the past decades.</P>
      <P>"All these events point to cordial and solid relations between
our two countries," Shih said.</P>
      <P>The Southern Common Market groups four South American countries,
namely Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Paraguay is the ROC's
only diplomatic ally in South Amercia.</P>

    <TEXT>Manila Bulletin: All boxes to

No end is in sight as far as determining the results
of the May 10 presidential and vice presidential
elections. Not wanting to trigger another
time-consuming debate with the minority, the Congress
leadership abandoned yesterday the proposal to tally
Certificates of Canvass (CoCs) and open ballot boxes
simultaneously to speed up the ongoing proceedings and
ensure the proclamation the winners by the end of
June.

CONGRESS has opened more than half of the 223 ballot
boxes containing votes for president and vice
president. As it ended its session on Wednesday at 9
p.m., the joint session, sitting as the National Board
of Canvassers, had examined the contents of 55 more
ballot boxes, making the total of opened ballot boxes
137 since Monday.

Financial Times: Spitzer hits GSK with drug lawsuit.

GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical giant, was accused on
Wednesday of fraudulently suppressing research that suggested its

The civil suit, filed in New York by Eliot Spitzer, the state's

of communications between pharmaceutical sales forces and doctors.

The suit alleges that studies by GSK found a possible link between
use of Paxil and "an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and acts in

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT AGREES WITH AMCHAM ON MAINLAND CHINA LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
his administration fully agrees with the views of the American
Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei about the urgency of opening
direct transportation links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Two days after AmCham warned in its 2004 white paper that Taiwan
is marginalizing itself and putting in jeopardy its plan to develop
itself into a regional business hub because of the lack of direct
transportation links with the mainland, the president said the
responsibility does not rest solely upon Taiwan, which has already
done its best to bring about such links.</P>
      <P>If Beijing would put its differences with Taiwan into perspective
and face up to issues in a pragmatic way, it would certainly be
conducive to the establishment of a relationship beneficial to both
sides and would narrow the gap between them, Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, the president took comfort from the white paper's
affirmation of the country's achievements in his first four-year term
and the high expectations it holds for his second term.</P>
      <P>As to the white paper's criticism of the lack of coordination
between government organizations, especially between the executive,
judiciary and legislative branches, the president ascribed this to
the ruling party's failure to control the legislature over the last
four years and he expressed hope that this will be addressed if his
Democratic Progressive Party wins a majority at the legislature in
the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>At that time, the president said, the persistent political
struggle between the legislature and the Executive Yuan will stop and
the pace of reform will be accelerated.</P>
      <P>Chen said he shares the white paper's points of view that Taiwan
has been consumed with political concerns in the past year and that
competing political parties need to cooperate, compromise and
communicate in civil fashion for the sake of the overriding national
interest.</P>
      <P>Noting that friends who are blunt, considerate and informed are
most valuable, the president thanked AmCham for its opinions about
the country's business climate and promised to take the white paper
seriously while laying down policy in the future.</P>
      <P>The president made the comment while receiving a group of
distinguished engineers at the Presidential Office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND ISSUES POSITION PAPER ON ARMS PROCUREMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
issued a position paper Thursday to solicit public support for its
three important arms procurement projects which will cost an
estimated NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion).</P>
      <P>This marked the first time in recent memory that the MND has ever
issued a position paper to enlist public support for the its weaponry
purchase plans.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the position paper after many lawmakers from
across the political spectrum questioned the high cost of the
procurement projects.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet passed the MND-proposed budget plan for purchasing
anti-missile defense systems, anti-submarine aircraft and
diesel-powered submarines from the United States. The US$18.23
billion budget proposal needs the opposition-controlled legislature's
approval.</P>
      <P>The MND said in its position paper that in the face of mainland
China's mounting military threat, the military needs those new
weapons to beef up its defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>The proposed budget would cover six sets of Patriot Advanced
Capability III anti-missile systems, eight conventional submarines
and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>The Patriot missiles would cost NT$145 billion (US$4.3 billion) ,
the MND position paper said, adding that this purchase project will be
carried out from 2005 to 2012. Installation of the new Patriot
anti-missile defense systems will help deter mainland Chinese missile
attacks, the MND said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MND position paper said, the procurement of eight
conventional submarines will cost NT$412 billion (US$12.3 billion) to
be carried out from 2005 to 2019, and the purchase of 12
anti-submarine aircraft will need NT$53 billion (US$1.5 billion) to
be carried out from 2005 to 2011.</P>
      <P>These purchase projects will help enhance the armed forced
combined services combat capabilities and as well as their maritime
and aerial monitoring and reconnaissance abilities.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai said
Thursday that Taiwan should raise its military expenditures amid
mainland China's increasing military buildup, in terms of both
quality and quantity.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks the day after the Cabinet passed a special
budget plan for arms procurement from the United States. The budget
plan, worth NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion), will be sent to the
Legislative Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>Chen revealed that this year's U.S. report on the mainland's
military power contains much criticism of Taiwan's defense budget and
that the U.S. government is also worried that Beijing's arms
purchases have seen double-digit growth in recent years, with its
annual military expenditure oscillating between US$50 billion and
US$70 billion.</P>
      <P>Amid the increasing military imbalance between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan needs to raise its military expenditure to
ensure its anti-missile capability, Chen added.</P>
      <P>He added that the mainland has strengthened the combat capability
of its joint forces and the accuracy of its long-range missiles since
the U.S.-led war in Iraq, so it is of tremendous importance that
Taiwan purchase anti-missile Patriot defense systems, among others.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORENSIC REPORT ON MARCH 19 SHOOTING TO BE COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Connecticut,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A comprehensive forensic report on the
March 19 shooting of Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu will be completed in September at the
earliest, Dr. Henry Lee, a world-renowned Chinese-American forensic
expert, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee, who traveled to Taiwan in April to examine evidence and
scene of the election-eve shooting in the southern city of Tainan,
made the remarks before attending a cocktail reception marking the
world premiere of a new TV drama series featuring criminal
investigations, with Lee himself as the leading actor.</P>
      <P>Lee said he has kept in close contact with Taiwan's Criminal
Investigation Bureau and other relevant agencies since his April trip
to the island.</P>
      <P>"I know they will simulate the March 19 shooting later this
month, including a bullet test-firing, to determine the trajectory of
the bullets that hit Chen and Lu. When the test-firing is completed,
they will fax the results to me. I'll then analyze the test results
and come up with a comprehensive report on the forensic evidence, "
Lee said.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Lee said, the report can be finalized in
September. He stressed that he is only responsible for forensic
examination of the evidence, not for the criminal investigation or a
solution of the case.</P>
      <P>Lee further said he will determine whether to come to Taiwan
again after he receives the trajectory test report.</P>
      <P>As to why the CIB has not conducted a mock shooting earlier, Lee
said the delay mainly resulted from difficulties in creating a
home-made toy gun and bullets similar to those used in the shooting.
"It takes time to complete these difficult tasks," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said he has taken part in forensic examinations of
assassinations of top leaders and politicians in many countries
around the world. "But I have never seen a country's president and
vice president shot simultaneously, " he said, adding that if the
crime scene had been preserved well, it would have been much easier
to solve the case.</P>
      <P>One bullet grazed Chen's stomach and another hit Lu's knee while
they were parading in an open-topped jeep past crowds of flag-waving
supporters in Tainan on the eve of the bitterly fought March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The shooting has given rise to a wide range of increasingly
bizarre conspiracy theories, including allegations by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) that the president staged the attack to win sympathy
votes in the election, which he won by a narrow margin.</P>
      <P>The opposition has said it cannot accept Chen's re-election
victory until the election-eve shooting has been solved.</P>
      <P>Although police have not announced any solid leads or suspects,
the "pan-blue alliance" has not found any compelling evidence that
the shooting was faked. Lee and several other U.S.
forensics experts have analyzed Chen's and Lu's injuries and
concluded that they were genuine gunshot wounds caused by bullets
fired from outside the jeep, not from inside, as has been claimed by
opposition lawmakers.</P>

      <P>A planned new party to be formed by

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan deported Thursday a Japanese citizen
allegedly involved in Japan's largest-ever cross-border money
laundering case.</P>
      <P>Takashi Yamane, 35, was deported under the escort of three
Japanese police officers via a Japan Asia Airways flight Thursday
afternoon, a Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) official said.</P>
      <P>Yamane, the top financial manager of Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's
largest yakuza group -- or organized crime syndicate -- is accused of
masterminding Japan's largest-ever cross-border money laundering
case, which was uncovered in March 2003. He fled Japan and traveled
around Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Japanese police sought the CIB's assistance in tracking Yamane
down in late April. Initial investigations showed that Yamane
entered Taiwan April 25 via a Cathay Pacific Airways flight.
However, the CIB could not find out where he was staying.</P>
      <P>As Yamane's visa-free stay expired May 24, the joint task force
formed by Taiwan and Japanese police authorities carefully
scrutinized ticket reservation lists of various air carriers for the
period from May 20 through May 24. The task force then discovered
that Yamane had booked a seat on a May 21 Air Macau flight bound for
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>CIB agents did not arrest Yamane until after he had entered the
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport's control area and he was then
sent to a foreigners detention center on the outskirts of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Japanese police authorities in charge of organized crime sent
staff members to Taipei May 27 to discuss the time and formula for
deporting Yamane.</P>
      <P>Both the Japanese Interchange Association -- the de facto
Japanese embassy in Taipei -- and the Republic of China's
representative office in Japan sent officials to oversee Thursday's
deportation procedure.</P>
      <P>According to CIB agents, Yamane is a graduate of a prestigious
Japanese university. As he was versed in financial transactions, he
quickly emerged as the most powerful financial manager in
Yamaguchi-gumi, a legally registered underworld syndicate.</P>
      <P>Yamane is accused of having laundered the yakuza syndicate's
illegal profits worth more than 46 billion yen (US$418.18 million) in
Hong Kong and several Southeast Asian countries. A total of 43
suspects involved in the case, including Yamane, have been arrested
so far.</P>
      <P>According to newly revised Japanese law, Yamane could face a maximum
five-year prison term plus a fine of up to 100 million yen.</P>
      <P>Local media reports said Yamaguchi-gumi maintains close ties with
major Taiwan criminal rings, particularly the Four Seas gang. CIB
sources said they believe that local underworld rings provided
shelter for Yamane during his stay in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Thursday that his ministry has discussed setting up

      <P>Chen was responding to reports that said Mongolia is planning to

      <P>Chen said that since both sides reached agreement on setting up
bilateral representative offices, the ministry has never talked about
anything concerning loans.</P>
      <P>But if domestic businesses are willing to provide loans to
Mongolia, then they are not related to the ministry, he continued.</P>
      <P>Chen also denied reports that quoted him as saying that former

has been designated to serve as the new representative to the United

      <P>Chen dismissed the reports, saying that with the experience and

was not clear which one that might be.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Chen's appointment will only be published after
Lee, the current ROC representative to the EU, receives formal
approval from the United States to serve as the ROC's representative

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) welcomes
any recommendation that can boost reconciliation or rapprochement
across the Taiwan Strait, a senior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san made the remarks after James
Kelly, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the
Pacific, said at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Asia and the
Pacific of the House Committee on International Relations a day
earlier that the United States strongly supports "track two"
unofficial or quasi-official talks among Taiwan, mainland Chinese and
American representatives.</P>
      <P>Kelly said unofficial or quasi-official contacts are a good way
for testing various initiatives to break the current cross-strait
impasse.</P>
      <P>"We share Kelly's view, " Chiu said, adding that the MAC always
welcomes any proposal that can contribute to positive developments in
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Chiu said, President Chen Shui-bian has on
many occasions suggested that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
exchange representative offices to facilitate direct dialogue and
avoid misunderstandings and misjudgments.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the biggest difficulty for the moment lies in Beijing's
reluctance to resume cross-strait dialogue. Beijing unilaterally shut
the dialogue channel between the two quasi-official intermediary
bodies -- Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- in July
1999 over then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui's describing cross-strait
ties as a special "state-to-state" relationship.</P>
      <P>Just last week, Chiu said, MAC Chairman Joseph Wu invited ARATS
President Wang Daohan, the top mainland Chinese negotiator with
Taiwan, to visit Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We hope Beijing can make a goodwill response to our invitation
and resume the long-stalled SEF-ARATS dialogue, " Chiu said, adding
that so long as the two sides can sit down to talk, any dispute or
topic can be discussed.</P>
      <P>In the past two days, two major foreign trade associations -- the
American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei and the European
Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) -- issued recommendations that
Taiwan take immediate steps to open direct cross-strait
transportation links. The two trade groups warned that Taiwan might
risk becoming irrelevant if it drags its feet on opening direct
shipping and air links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate their recommendations. But direct cross-strait
transportation links involve many complicated issues that must be
addressed through bilateral consultations. We have drawn up many
complementary measures. Mainland China should also do its part in
preparations. We hope AmCham and the ECCT can help persuade Beijing
not to impose too many prerequisites or political barriers and to
resume dialogue with Taiwan as soon as possible," Chiu said, adding
that the two sides should resume contacts and increase engagements
steadily to forge a consensus to resolve sensitive disputes
in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER AVRDC PRESIDENT BESTOWED DECORATION FOR EXCELLENT CONTRIBUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  3 (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China's Representative in
Britain Tien Hung-mao bestowed a decoration Wednesday upon the former
president of the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center
(AVRDC), Declan J. Walton, for his contribution in elevating Taiwan's
status in agricultural research.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the ROC government, Tien conferred the Order of
Brilliant Star with Violet Grand Cordon to Walton, an Irishman who
served as president of the AVRDC, headquartered in Tainan, southern
Taiwan, from 2000 to 2003.</P>
      <P>The AVRDC is an internationally known center for agricultural
research and development aimed at reducing poverty and malnutrition
in developing countries through improved production and consumption
of vegetables.</P>
      <P>Established in 1971 by the ROC, the United States, Japan, South
Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and the Asian Development
Bank, the AVRDC is one of the few international organizations of
which Taiwan is a member.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that Walton's leadership has strengthened the
operations of the AVRDC and elevated Taiwan's status in agricultural
research.</P>
      <P>Walton's contributions to the AVRDC and to Taiwan are quite
significant at a time when Beijing is using every means to squeeze
Taiwan's space in the international community, including blocking the
operations of the AVRDC, Tien stressed.</P>
      <P>Walton revealed two difficulties he had encountered when serving
as AVRDC president: Some donor countries were hesitant in making
donations for fear of offending mainland China, and the
organization's limited budget.</P>
      <P>However, Walton added, ROC government's generous financial
support has largely resolved the organization's budget problems.</P>
      <P>The former AVRDC president also suggested that the organization
extend the scale of its operations and do more to help backward
areas of the world to reduce poverty.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang
Yung-chin is currently visiting mainland China and is probably
inspecting a petrochemical zone that the group invests in, in
southeastern China, an executive with the group said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang's trip comes at a sensitive time with mainland China
stepping up verbal attacks on Taiwan businessmen. The People's Daily,
the Beijing's mouthpiece newspaper, said in a front-page
editorial Monday that it does not welcome Taiwanese businessmen who
use profits made on the mainland to finance the pro-independence
movement back in Taiwan. The article singled out Chi Mei Group
Chairman Hsu Wen-lung for specific scorn.</P>
      <P>Wang maintains a low profile during his trip to the mainland and
does not publicize his itinerary.</P>
      <P>The executive said that Wang is probably inspecting the
petrochemical zone in Ningpo, Zhejiang province, and could also visit
some friends on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that Wang might donate a sum of money to an
elementary school on the mainland, the executive said that if this is
the case, then it is Wang's own wish and has nothing to do with the
group's operations.</P>
      <P>The executive said that Wang usually stays no more than one week
during each trip to the mainland, mainly because of his advanced age.
The 87-year-old tycoon, who departed Wednesday, is expected to
return to Taiwan for work next Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WILL NOT SEEK OR WELCOME TAIWAN TROOPS IN IRAQ: U.S OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will not seek or
welcome Taiwan sending troops to Iraq, U.S. Assistant Secretary of
States for East Asian and Pacific Affairs James Kelly said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kelly made the remarks when he was testifying at a hearing on
U.S. policy in East Asia and the Pacific at the U.S. House
Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific under the Committee on
International Relations.</P>
      <P>Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Ca.) -- the co-chairman of a
pro-Taiwan group, Taiwan Caucus, who proposed last week that the U.S.
government ask Taiwan to send 5,000 marines to fight alongside the
U.S.-led coalition in Iraq -- asked Kelly if the Bush administration
would be amenable to Taiwan offering to send troops to help in Iraq.</P>
      <P>In response, Kelly said that Taiwan has "helped out in Iraq with
humanitarian and tangible items for use in construction. I do not
believe that we would seek or welcome the advent of Taiwan troops,
because that would require a degree of cooperation that might help
things in Iraq, but it would raise tensions significantly in East
Asia."</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher said that the United States would certainly not want
to provoke any confrontation while its troops are engaged in Iraq;
however, he added: " Sending 5,000 troops from Taiwan, a
democratically-elected government, to help establish a democracy in
Iraq would be a good thing, and it is so sad that we are afraid to
anger a dictatorial regime in Beijing, and that's why we are not
willing to look at that alternative."</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher and Jim Ryan (R-Kan.) introduced a proposal to the
House Committee on International Relations May 20 suggesting that
Taiwan send troops to fight alongside U.S.-led coalition forces to
signify their shared values of promoting democracy and opposing
terrorism.</P>
      <P>The proposal has sparked heated debate and concerns among Taiwan
society, although both U.S. and Taiwan government officials have
denied that the two sides have ever discussed the issue.</P>

      <P>Between 1990 and 2000, the population of

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT CONFERRED HUMAN RIGHTS MEDAL IN COSTA RICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Jose,  Costa  Rica,  June  2 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu received a human rights medal from the
University of Costa Rica (UCR) Wednesday for her life-long efforts in
promoting democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in Costa Rica at around noon Wednesday after a
three-day official visit to neighboring El Salvador where she
attended the inauguration of new Salvadoran President Elias Antonio
Saca on behalf of ROC President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Shortly after her arrival, Lu kicked off a hectic visit schedule.
In the afternoon, she delivered a speech on the new vision for the
21st century at the prestigious University of Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>Lu lauded Costa Rica as a beautiful country which rejects both
war and armed forces while upholding peace as its ultimate national
goal.</P>
      <P>"I have traveled halfway around the globe to Costa Rica from the
other side of the Pacific Ocean with the hope of promoting bilateral
cooperation in creating a new democratic Pacific alliance to work for
the well-being of humankind," Lu said.</P>
      <P>While Costa Rica has long been reputed as a "Switzerland in the
Americas, " Lu said, the ROC government is now endeavoring to build
Taiwan into a "Switzerland in Asia."</P>
      <P>"Our two countries have ample room for cooperation to realize our
common goals of peace, freedom, democracy and prosperity," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that democracy, peace and prosperity are the universal
values of the new Pacific century, Lu said Taiwan and Cost Rica
should jointly push for the formation of a new alliance of all
democratic Pacific countries and glorify the "soft power" values of
freedom, democracy, science, technology, love and peace.</P>
      <P>Lu's speech drew a capacity audience at the UCR auditorium. The
audience included UCR faculty and students as well as elite members
from Costa Rica's various social quarters.</P>
      <P>At the end of the speech, the university presented the "best
human rights fighter" medal to Lu in recognition of her contributions
to promoting democracy and human rights over the past decades.</P>
      <P>Lu was imprisoned for more than six years for her pro-democracy
campaign during Taiwan's martial law era. Lu, who has a master's
degree in law from Harvard University, had been a lawmaker and a
local government chief before becoming the ROC's first-ever female
vice president in 2000.</P>
      <P>After her arrival in San Jose, Lu was greeted by Costa Rican Vice
President Lineth Saborio at the airport. She first paid a visit to
Costa Rican President Abel Pacheco de la Espriella and then held
talks with Saborio. Both Pacheco and Saborio expressed their gratitude
for the ROC's longstanding assistance to their national development
and assured Lu of Costa Rica's continued support for Taiwan's cause,
including its bid to join the United Nations and other major
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lu visited the Costa Rican National Assembly
where she attended a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the ROC and Costa Rica.
The two countries signed an amity agreement in 1944 on forging
"lasting peace and friendship."</P>
      <P>A congratulatory message celebrating the two countries'
60-year-old diplomatic relationship was read at the ceremony. Costa
Rican National Assembly Speaker Gerardo Gonzalez and scores of
lawmakers joined Lu in wtinessing the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica is the second leg of Lu's current 14-day diplomatic
tour, which will also take her to Guatemala.</P>
      <P>This is Lu's first overseas trip since she was sworn in for a
second four-year term on May 20. She made a two-day transit stop in
Las Vegas en route to El Salvador and will also make a transit stop
in San Francisco on her way back home.</P>
      <P>Members of Lu's entourage include Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General James Huang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang
Lung-yuan, and members of the Presidential Office's Science and
Technology Advisory Commission and its human rights advisory panel.</P>

Affairs Department, says that the 1989 crackdown on the unarmed
pro-democracy students in Beijing's Tiananmen Square is a major

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three kinds of errors to
which men are liable when in the presence of their superiors. First,
to speak out when one is not called upon to speak: that is called
being forward. Second, to keep silent when called upon to speak: that
is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak out without taking into
consideration the expression in the eyes of the person spoken to:
that is called blindness."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>LU TO STICK TO ITINERARY OF OFFICIAL VISIT DESPITE PHYSICAL PAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Jose,  Costa  Rica,  June  3 (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu has insisted that the itinerary of her official
visit in Costa Rica will be followed without interruption despite her
checking into a hospital in San Jose briefly Thursday due to pain in
her limbs.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in Costa Rica Wednesday after a three-day official
visit to neighboring El Salvador where she attended the inauguration
of new Salvadoran President Elias Antonio Saca on behalf of ROC
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese doctor Chen Yao-chang said the vice president has been
suffering from a muscle fracture to her left arm and a slight
dislocation in her left thumb and left elbow as well as from the
injury to her left knee sustained in the March 19 assassination
attempt. He said the vice president's hectic schedule over the past
week in the United States and Central America has aggravated the
injuries.</P>
      <P>Lu had declined to use a wheelchair or even a walking cane over
the past several days to avoid creating a "negative image" for the
ROC as she visits overseas in her capacity as vice president of the
country.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Dr. Chen fitted the vice president's arm with a
sling on Wednesday and advised her to use a walking stick to prevent
a further aggravation of her injuries.</P>
      <P>Continuing with her original itinerary, Lu visited the POAS
volcanic national park in a suburb of San Jose Thursday morning and
attended a luncheon at the Hotel Fiesta hosted by ROC Ambassador to
Costa Rica Wu Tzu-dan.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Lu received a human rights medal from the
University of Costa Rica in recognition of her contributions to
promoting democracy and human rights over the past decades.</P>
      <P>She met with Costa Rican President Abel Pacheco de la Espriella
around noon Wednesday. Pacheco expressed his gratitude for the ROC's
longstanding assistance to Costa Rica's national development and
assured Lu of his country's continued support for Taiwan's cause,
including its bid to join the United Nations and other major
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Later that day, Lu visited the Costa Rican National Assembly
where she attended a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the ROC and Costa Rica.
The two countries signed an amity agreement in 1944 on forging
"lasting peace and friendship."</P>
      <P>Asked by Taiwan reporters about recent reports that Taiwan's
monetary aid to Costa Rica was used to pay the salaries of Costa
Rican Foreign Ministry officials, Lu said monetary aid to the ROC's
diplomatic allies should continue despite untrue allegations.</P>
      <P>Lu said extending monetary aid to diplomatic allies is the set
policy of the ROC as one of the means of consolidating bilateral
ties. Meanwhile, she said, it is the duty of the members of the ROC
Legislature to strengthen their supervision over Taiwan's diplomatic
expenses.</P>
      <P>She added that the legislators can visit more of the country's
diplomatic allies, instead of countries that maintain no formal
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, to examine how and where the money has
been used.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica is the second leg of Lu's current 14-day diplomatic
tour, which will also take her to Guatemala.</P>
      <P>This is Lu's first overseas trip since she was sworn in for a

      <P>The Legislative Yuan should call an
extraordinary session in July or August to examine the NT$610.8
billion (US$18.2 billion) special budget over 15 years for arms
purchases, Premier Yu Shyi-kun was quoted as saying Friday.</P>

arms-purchase budget meets the country's urgent requirements and
should enjoy the support of different parties.</P>
      <P>The chance that the special budget for arms purchases will be
discussed at the legislature soon is slim in light of the fact that
the current legislative session is supposed to end by June 11. The
premier is eager to cinch the deal for 388 patriot missiles, eight

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second Taiwan-Japan NGO Forum began
Friday at National Chengchi University in Taipei to strengthen
exchanges among the non-governmental organizations (NGO) in Asia.</P>
      <P>The forum was organized by the NGO Affairs Committee of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Center for the Third Sector of
Chengchi University, and the Japan-based NGO BHN.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ming-hsiu, director of Chengchi University's Center for
the Third Sector, noted that the Third Sector, similar to NGOs, has
played an active role in the development of modern Asian society.</P>
      <P>The concept of the Third Sector originates especially in those
fields where private and public sectors are reluctant to get
involved, and the emergence of the Third Sector is to fill the gap to
ensure public interests are met, particularly those of minority
groups.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Taiwan and Japan are geographically close and have
similar religions, society types and cultures; therefore, the
exchanges of the Third Sector between the two countries, especially
in disaster rescue experiences, are of tremendous importance.</P>
      <P>Lu Ching-lung, deputy director of MOFA's NGO Affairs Committee,
encouraged Taiwan's civil organizations to propose cooperation plans
to their Japanese counterparts to let their Japanese friends know
Taiwan people's determination to contribute to the world community.</P>
      <P>Iwahito Asahara, president of the BHN, said he was pleased to see
that NGOs from Taiwan and Japan can work more closely through the

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An executive of a hi-tech company in
Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, was questioned Friday by prosecutors under
suspicion of having exported hi-tech equipment to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shih Kuei-chung, general manager of the Queenning Hi-Tech Corp.
in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, was referred to the
Prosecutors' Office of the Hsinchu District Court for investigation
by agents from the Investigation Bureau.</P>
      <P>An investigator said Shih's company, which engages in the
production of infrared cameras and components, was suspected of
selling infrared thermal imaging systems to mainland customers since
1998.</P>
      <P>Besides medical applications, these infrared thermal imaging
systems can also be used on night vision equipment for tanks, jet
fighters and missiles and were, therefore, forbidden to export to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Shih Kuei-chung's brother, Shih Kuei-shong, who serves as the
company's vice general manager, was arrested in San Francisco on May
23 by FBI agents, which tipped off local law enforcement officials on
Queening's potentially illegal deals.</P>
      <P>An anonymous military official said the infrared thermal imaging
systems are widely used by the military in equipment used to detect

    <HEADLINE>MND ELABORATES ON BUDGET ALLOCATIONS FOR MAJOR MILITARY PROCUREMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
called a news conference Friday to elaborate on its budget
allocations worth NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) for major
military procurement programs amid grave public concern over the
issue.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister Hu Chen-pu chaired the news conference, with
ranking representatives from the army and navy explaining and
detailing the contents, timetables and purposes of their military
build-up programs for the years to come in conjunction with the
United States.</P>
      <P>Yang Tien-shiao, a lieutenant-general and chief of the general
staff of the Army General Headquarters, said the army plans to
purchase six batteries of Patriot PAC-3 missiles for an eight-year
period from 2005 to 2012, with a price tag of NT$144.92 billion.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, the installation of the advanced missiles in
northern, central and southern Taiwan will effectively help the
military protect at least 70 percent of the civilian population and
more than 60 percent of the country's industries, a noticeable
improvement from the current levels of 25 percent and 8 percent.</P>
      <P>At present, the army only has three Patriot PAC-2 missile
batteries in northern Taiwan, making it unable to provide
comprehensive protection for the whole island by countering
multi-headed missiles or those carrying biochemical agents, he
explained.</P>
      <P>Lee Tung-hai, chief of the general staff of the Navy General
Headquarters, said the navy aims to purchase submarines with
effective deterrent capabilities in an effort to strike a balance and
even achieve naval supremacy in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The navy is intent on buying eight diesel-fueled submarines, with
the delivery for the first unit slated for 2013 and for the last unit
in 2019, Lee said, adding that the total spending, including
ammunition and relevant facilities, is estimated at NT$412.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Turning to the navy's need for 12 P-3C anti-submarine airplanes,
Lee said that NT$53.4 billion has been allocated for that
expenditure, he said.</P>
      <P>While the establishment of the squadron will take seven years,
deliveries for the first seven units and the remaining five are
scheduled for 2009 and 2011, respectively, he said.</P>
      <P>The navy's current squadron composed of 26 S-2T anti-submarine
airplanes has fallen short of its goal of serving as an adequately
combat force.</P>
      <P>All the budget appropriations have been approved by the Executive
Yuan and are awaiting the final green light from the Legislative
Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CONDEMNS MAINLAND SCHOLARS OVER ANTI-TAIWAN RHETORIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) condemned a handful of mainland Chinese scholars Friday over
their irresponsible remarks against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The council also urged mainland Chinese authorities to prevent
their scholars or commentators from issuing irresponsible anti-Taiwan
comments.</P>
      <P>The council was responding to certain mainland scholars' recent
claims that Beijing authorities will impose economic sanctions
against Taiwan due to its current Democratic Progressive Party
administration's allegedly pro-independence policy line. However,
Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office,
said a day earlier that Beijing doesn't have such a plan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu
Tai-san said mainland academics' irresponsible, thoughtless remarks
have not set well with the people of Taiwan
and will hinder interactions and rapprochement between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Mainland authorities should prohibit their scholars or political
observers from making unnecessary 'psychological harassments' against
the people of Taiwan. Otherwise, such moves would cause harm to
Taiwan people and hamper cross-strait engagements," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Rumors of mainland trade sanctions against Taiwan, such as some
form of punishment of Taiwan investors in mainland China, have caused
the Taiwan Stock Exchange to drop substantially over the past few
days.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Chiu said, both Taiwan and mainland China
have benefited from ever-increasing cross-strait relations.
"Cross-strait economic exchanges have been reciprocal. If Beijing
imposes trade sanctions on Taiwan investors in mainland China simply
for political reasons, both Taiwan and the mainland itself will be
hurt," he warned.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Chiu said, mainland China now has more than 50,000
Taiwan-funded companies that employ at least 10 million mainland
workers.</P>
      <P>"If mainland authorities adopt unfair measures against them, they
will reconsider their future investment projects and may even
relocate their operations to other destinations. Should that be
the case, it will have a significant impact on the mainland economy,"
Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chiu said, the two sides have developed a vertical
division of labor system in exporting products to the United States
and other major countries around the world. Unnecessary restrictions
on Taiwan-funded companies on the mainland will deal a severe blow to
mainland China's export industries, he added.</P>
      <P>In the future, Chiu said the MAC will refer to mainland scholars'
remarks while screening their applications to visit Taiwan. "We
may not necessarily reject their visits, but we'll ask them to
explain to some extent their unfriendly statements about Taiwan, " he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY STILLBORN IN CHINA, RETARDED IN HONG KONG: TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democracy was stillborn on the mainland, is
retarded in Hong Kong, but well-developed in Taiwan, Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a seminar held in Taipei to observe the 15th anniversary of
the Tiananmen pro-democracy demonstration, Ma urged mainland
intelligentsia not to lose confidence in democracy because of the
disputes following the March 20 presidential election in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan is a society with the capacity of self-examination
and can better its democracy as time goes on, and the allegations
brought by the losing candidate about the results of the election
will eventually be resolved through legal processes.</P>
      <P>The mayor, who has marked each anniversary since the Tiananmen
Massacre in 1989, urged the Beijing authorities to admit its error in
ordering the Chinese military to storm the square in Beijing and put
an end to a student-led pro-democracy demonstration, in the same way
that Taiwan authorities admitted its error in handling the Feb. 28,
1947 Incident.</P>
      <P>In addition to speaking out for democratic activists in the
seminar, Ma also wrote a public letter to intelligentsia on the
mainland, urging them to keep pursuing democracy -- the common choice
of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The letter was published in several Chinese-language newspapers
in Taipei, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and North America on the
same day.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the seminar in Taipei was Wang Min, the chairman
of the California-based Chinese Democratic United Frontline. He
warned the public not to trust the Chinese Communists, since they
have never backed down from cracking down on political dissents since
1989 despite the country's stunning economic growth.</P>
      <P>He urged the people of Taiwan to back mainland Chinese people's
struggle with the Chinese Communists for democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STOCK MARKET LACKS MOMENTUM DESPITE REBOUND: ANALYSTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan stock market is expected to hover
around its current level next week because of a lack of sufficient
momentum despite short-term rebounds, analysts said Friday.</P>
      <P>Uncertainties over cross-Taiwan Strait ties will remain the main
factor affecting the performance of the domestic bourse next week
after the effects of increasing oil prices and forthcoming U.S.
interest hikes have gradually faded, analysts said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the key barometer of the Taiwan Stock
Exchange (TAIEX), rose by 53.44 points to close at 5,724.89 Friday on
a slim turnover of NT$70.489 billion (about US$2.1 billion) .
Construction and steel shares posted the largest increases of 5.1
percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The rebound was a result of buying by the government's National
Stabilization Fund to sustain the market after a plummet of 204
points a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell by more than 200 points, or 3.5 percent,
Thursday following mainland media reports that Beijing might impose a
trade embargo on Taiwan in two months.</P>
      <P>The rumor was denied by Beijing officials earlier Friday and they
dismissed that mainland-based Taiwan businesses not engaged in
pro-Taiwan independence activities will not be affected.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lin Chuan said he is confident that the
domestic stock market will undoubtedly move up once uncertainties
surrounding both the home market and those abroad are removed.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed his belief that the bourse will perform better in
the third and fourth quarters, judging from the country's economic
fundamentals. So long as international markets rebound, the strongly
pegged domestic bourse will also rebound quickly, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, an assistant manager at JIH SUN Securities
Consulting Co., Ltd., said that the recent bullish sentiment has
given way noticeably in the stock market and he predicted that the
weighted index will hinge around the 5,500 mark over the next week.</P>
      <P>Noting that this week's market turnover totaled only a little
more than NT$350 billion, a new low for recent weeks, Hsu said that
bearishness is likely to prevail in the market in the short term and
that low priced shares of traditional businesses are more likely to
advance.</P>
      <P>A fund manager at Jardine Fleming Funds (Taiwan) said that Taiwan
shares are at a low level and are a good buy for investors, should no
further foreign capital and large hedge funds put out of the domestic
stock market and if mainland China refrains from saber-rattling.</P>
      <P>Heavy selling pressure resulting from Beijing's comments should
be temporary and the long-term prospects of Asian shares, including
Taiwan stocks, remains positive because of their good economic
fundamentals, he said.</P>
      <P>Since mainland China's announcement of its decision to cool its
overheated economy, Taiwan share prices have dropped by an average 11
percent.</P>
      <P>An analyst at Hsbcgsset Management (Taiwan) Ltd. called on
investors to remain calm since continued falls in recent weeks will
help clean up the market and that it will quickly rebound once it
hits bottom.</P>
      <P>Stressing that non-economic elements will only have a short-term
impact on the bourse, he urged investors not to miss the present good
opportunity for investment.</P>
      <P>Douglas Hsu, chairman of the Far Eastern Group, contended that
mainland China is unlikely to impose trade sanctions on Taiwan and
will not boycott future investments by Taiwan businesses in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>In the face of a series of stock market plunges, Hsu encouraged
investors to buy Taiwan shares now, as their EPS (earning per share)
are at such a low level, providing an extremely good chance to
invest.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei customs officials on Friday seized
765 kilograms of betel nuts at CKS International Airport that were
apparently being smuggled into the country illegally from Thailand,
but the alleged smuggler may not be punished as officials confiscated
the betel nuts before anyone had even declared the cargo.</P>
      <P>Customs officials said that since the supply of betel nuts in
Taiwan is not stable during the period between April and June, some
individuals try to bring in betel nuts illegally to cash in on the
higher prices.</P>
      <P>The officials said that betel nuts can be imported legally from
Thailand, but a quota system is in place whereby taxes are small for
a certain amount of betel nuts and higher for imports over this
limit.</P>
      <P>The excess tariff is NT$810 (US$24) per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the betel nuts were from a China Airlines
flight and were in cargo marked as containing garments. The owner of
the shipment, a company called Min Shung, could avoid punishment by
simply not claiming the cargo.</P>
      <P>The betel nuts are now in the custody of the Council of

(By S.J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Costa Rican President Abel
Pacheco de la Espriella decorated visiting Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu Thursday with the nation's highest honor -- the
Juan Mora Fernandez en el Grado de Gran Cruz Placa de Plata.</P>
      <P>Pacheco said the decoration is in recognition of Lu's
contributions to promoting democracy, human rights and relations
between the ROC and Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>Lu said it is great honor for her to receive the decoration and
added that Costa Rica is her "dreamland, " as nearly all of her
life-long goals of gender equality, freedom, democracy, human rights
and lasting peace prevail there.</P>
      <P>Pacheco later hosted a state banquet in honor of Lu and her
entourage. At the end of the banquet, all the Costa Rican dignitaries
sand "Happy Birthday to You" in Spanish to wish Lu many happy returns
of the day -- Lu will turn 60 on June 6. Lu kissed Pacheco's cheek to
express her gratitude for her host's surprise arrangement. She then
cut a birthday cake to share with all the well-wishers.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in Costa Rica Wednesday after a three-day official
visit to neighboring El Salvador, where she attended the inauguration
of new Salvadoran President Elias Antonio Saca on behalf of ROC
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Over the past two days, she has met with nearly all influential
Costa Rican politicians to discuss measures to further boost
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Lu said she has reached a preliminary agreement with Costa Rica's
women's affairs minister on promoting exchanges of visits by
outstanding women from both countries. After her return to Taiwan, Lu
said, she will organize a delegation composed of female politicians
to visit Costa Rica and other ROC diplomatic allies. Costa Rica will
also send a delegation of women leaders in various fields to visit
Taiwan in the near future, Lu said.</P>
      <P>During her talks with senior Costa Rican political leaders,
including Pacheco, Vice President Lineth Saborio, National Assembly
Speaker Gerardo Gonzalez and former President Oscar Arias Sanchez,
who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Lu said they agreed to further
boost bilateral and multilateral cooperation in human rights and
other fields in order to enhance Taiwan's international profile.</P>
      <P>Lu checked into a local hospital briefly Thursday due to pain in
her limbs.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Yao-chang, who is accompanying Lu on her diplomatic
tour, said she was suffering a torn muscle in her left arm and a

visit to El Salvador have aggravated the injuries, the doctor said.</P>
      <P>Lu received treatment at a Costa Rican hospital and was later
seen with her arm in a sling and walking with a cane.</P>
      <P>Despite her physical pain, Lu insisted on adhering to her busy
itinerary. She visited the POAS volcanic national park on the
outskirts of San Jose Thursday morning and attended a luncheon hosted
by ROC Ambassador to Costa Rica Wu Tzu-dan.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Lu delivered a speech on new visions for the 21st
Century at the University of Costa Rica, which presented a human
rights medal to Lu in recognition of her contributions to promoting
democracy and human rights. Later that day, she attended a ceremony
marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the ROC and Costa Rica. The two countries signed an
amity agreement in 1944 on forging "lasting peace and friendship."</P>
      <P>Costa Rica is the second leg of Lu's 14-day diplomatic tour,
which will also take her to Guatemala.</P>
      <P>This is her first overseas trip since she was sworn in for a
second four-year term May 20. She made a two-day transit stop in Las
Vegas en route to El Salvador and will also make a transit stop in
San Francisco on her way home.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine law enforcement authorities, in
collaboration with their counterparts from Taiwan, busted a
cross-border firearms trafficking operation Thursday that was
masterminded by a prominent Yamaguch-gumi figure.</P>
      <P>Akire Nemoto, believed to be the right-hand man of Yamaguchi-gumi
leader Yasuo Takagi, was arrested by Philippine police Thursday at
his luxury residence in a suburb of Manila, together with a haul of
firearms, including a U.S.-made KG99 assault rifle, two mini pistols
and numerous rounds of ammunition, according to officials from
Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the Ministry of
Justice.</P>
      <P>Tipped off by CIB authorities, some 40 Manila police and
investigators raided Nemoto -- who has the nickname of "overseas
arsenal" -- early Wednesday morning in an anti-narcotics and
anti-firearms operation that lasted until Friday morning, said
officials from the CIB's International Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>CIB investigators discovered in January that members of Taiwan's
Bamboo Union gang had traveled to Manila to meet with Nemoto and his
ring members for transactions involving illicit drugs, firearms
smuggling and cross-border money laundering.</P>
      <P>CIB officials discovered that the Bamboo Union and other
Taiwanese gangland operators had already placed orders worth more
than US$100,000 with Nemoto for firearms.</P>
      <P>They believe that more than 100 state-of-the-art firearms and
unknown amounts of heroin and amphetamines have been smuggled into
Taiwan via fishing boats through this channel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CIB Chief Secretary Kao Cheng-sheng denied
categorically that a retired senior police officer from Taiwan was a
"Taiwan connection" in another cross-border money laundering
operation involving major Yamaguchi-gumi member Yamane Takashi, who
was expelled from Taiwan to Japan Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kao said there is no evidence to show that a retired senior
Taiwan police officer was involved in Yamaguchi-gumi money laundering
operations, which are believed to have laundered some 4.6 billion yen
(US$41.8 million) illegally earned by the criminal syndicate last
year.</P>
      <P>Takashi was escorted back to Japan Thursday by three Japanese
police officers after being arrested at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport May 21 as he was trying to leave on a flight to Macau.</P>
      <P>Kao said Takashi was in Taiwan for one month -- his first-ever
visit to Taiwan -- that he was under full-scale surveillance during
his stay and that he had not been found to have made contact with any
Taiwan policemen, retired or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan also discounted reports
that a Taiwan policeman was involved in yakuza money laundering
operations.</P>
      <P>Su said no Taiwan policemen, incumbent or retired, have been
found to have extended assistance to Yamaguchi-gumi in cross-border
money laundering.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE APPROVES NEW EXAMINATION YUAN DEPUTY CHIEF APPOINTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
approved Friday President Chen Shui-bian's nomination of Wu Rong-ming
as vice president of the Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu was originally minister of the civil service, which is
responsible for the nation's civil service system, including
examination, qualification screening, security of tenure, scale of
salaries, promotion, transfer, retirement of civil servants and
related matters.</P>
      <P>The legislature approved Wu's new assignment by a vote of 175-11,
with six invalid ballots.</P>
      <P>Wu said afterward that the number of "yes" votes far exceeded his
expectations. "Before the vote, I didn't think I would receive so
many ballots," a grateful Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu, a former deputy governor of the now-marginalized Taiwan
provincial government, said he appreciates the president's nomination
and the legislators' support for his new assignment.</P>
      <P>As many legislators from across the political spectrum had
presented valuable recommendations for improving the nation's civil
service system in the process of screening his qualifications, Wu
said he will convey these opinions at future Examination Yuan
meetings for discussion and possible adoption.</P>
      <P>"After assuming my new post, I'll do my utmost to assist
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen in updating the nation's
civil service system," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office also issued a statement expressing its
gratitude for legislative support for Wu as the post has been vacant
for quite some time. Due to a boycott by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) ,
Chen's previous nomination for the post -- Chang Po-ya, a former
interior minister -- failed to clear the legislative floor last year.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union, as well as the
Independent Lawmakers Alliance, mobilized their members to support
Wu's new assignment in Friday's vote, while the KMT and the PFP
allowed their lawmakers to decide whether to endorse Wu's appointment
on their own.</P>
      <P>Still, many hawkish PFP lawmakers either voted against the
nomination or chose to absent themselves from the vote as a way to
protest what they claim is Chen's alleged reluctance to solve the
mysterious election-eve shooting that slightly wounded himself and
Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Wu once resigned from his post as a minister-without-portfolio to
campaign for PFP Chairman James Soong in the run-up to the 2000
presidential election. At that time, Soong ran for the presidency as
an independent and narrowly lost to Chen.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, Soong served as KMT Chairman
Lien Chan's running mate and the Lien-Soong ticket lost to the
incumbent Chen-Lu ticket by a razor-thin margin. Lien has filed two
lawsuits to challenge Chen's re-election victory and has called for a
new election.</P>
      <P>A full-scale judicial vote recount has been concluded and the
Taiwan High Court is required to mete out rulings on whether to
overturn Chen's re-election victory or call a new election within six
months. No evidence has so far been found to back up the "pan-blue
alliance's" allegations that the March 20 presidential election was
rigged and that the March 19 shooting was fake.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although some PFP lawmakers did not support his new
assignment, he still wanted to thank them and added that Soong had
congratulated him by phone. "I appreciate my former superior's
blessing," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, June 4 (CAN) The government will handle the issue of
mainland Chinese pro-democracy activists wishing to enter
Taiwan according to set procedures, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san made the remarks following reports
that mainland pro-democracy activist Yen Peng from Qindao, Shandong
Province, had arrived in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the government will first confirm his identity and will
then "respect the wishes of each individual and act in line with
international protocol in its follow-up moves."</P>
      <P>He claimed that anyone who is in pursuit of democracy, whether
they are from other countries or are pro-democracy activists from the
mainland, is welcome in Taiwan and that there is no reason to reject
them.</P>
      <P>The MAC also welcomes people pursuing democracy to come to Taiwan
to exchange experiences, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiu noted that pro-democracy activist Hsu Po came to Taiwan
early this year and that the government has already arranged for him
to travel to the Marshall Islands in line with international practice
and out of respect for his wishes.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Yen Peng boarded a Xiamen fishing boat, jumped
overboard 100 meters from Tatang islet near the outlying island of
Kinmen, and then swam to the islet.</P>
      <P>Kinmen coast guard personnel took him from Kinmen to a detention
center for illegal mainland immigrants in Ilan, eastern Taiwan,
Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in remembrance on the 15th anniversary of the
Tiananmen square massacre, Chiu noted that 15 years have passed
since the tragic event but he lamented the gap between the mainland's
democratic reforms and its economic performance.</P>
      <P>"The experience of Taiwan going from authoritarian rule to
democracy can serve as a reference for the world and also for the
mainland authorities, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that in terms of press freedom, religious freedom,
economy and human rights, the mainland still has ample room for
improvement.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan hopes to offer its experience in implementing democratic
elections, the pursuit of freedom and human rights protection to the
mainland for reference, and is willing to provide assistance, " Chiu
said.</P>

      <P>For the time being, more than 600 elementary schools in the five

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government hopes that
mainland China can move toward democracy and would welcome mainland
representatives coming to Taiwan to observe the year-end legislative
elections, Cabinet Spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks on the 15th anniversary of Beijing's bloody
crushing of a pro-democracy movement on the mainland -- the Tiananmen
massacre of 1989.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government is willing to help the mainland
establish an election system and nurture talent to lay a solid basis
for democracy and achieve its goal of becoming a rising power in a
peaceful way.</P>
      <P>He noted that during the 1989 pro-democracy protests and the June
4 massacre that brought them to an end, Beijing suppressed and
arrested pro-democracy activists and has since restricted the flow of
information on the Internet.</P>
      <P>"This totalitarian way of controlling the nation is still
ingrained in the minds of the world's people, and the freedom and
democracy aspired to by the mainland people have yet to be achieved,"
Chen said, lamenting that "the human rights record in mainland China
has yet to show an obvious improvement."</P>
      <P>He said that the government hopes the Beijing authorities will
give due respect and protection to basic freedom of speech and right
of assembly.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun has urged the international community to
continue to be concerned about the democratic and human rights
conditions on the mainland so that mainland people can enjoy the
universal values of democracy, plurality and freedom as do the people
of Taiwan, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He said the truth of history will come out and that democracy
should become the core of Chinese culture, saying that the
much-touted "Taiwan values" are based on this.</P>
      <P>"A pluralistic, democratic and open society would apply well to
the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," he added.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can
base their relations on "goodwill reconciliation, active cooperation
and lasting peace" as espoused by President Chen Shui-bian and the
establishment of a cross-strait peace and stable exchange mechanism
in his inaugural speech so as to promote the wellbeing of the peoples
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and meet the expectations of the
international community.</P>

should beware of in the three stages of his life. In youth, when the
constitution of his body is not yet formed, he should beware of lust.
In manhood, when his physical powers are in full vigor, he should
beware of strife. In old age, when the physical powers are in decay,
he should beware of greed."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DIVERSIFY FROM CHINA MARKET TO PROTECT INVESTMENT: TAIWAN THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businesses should not put all their
overseas investments in mainland China given Beijing's recent
comments that could restrict investment and increase risk, the
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) warned Sunday.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers said the economic interdependence of Taiwan and
mainland China has reached an unprecedented level in recent months as
a result of increased interactions between the private sectors of the
two sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses also face ever-increasing risks on the mainland
because of Chinese authorities' sudden announcement of clamp-down
policies on Taiwanese investment, CIER researchers said.</P>
      <P>CIER is calling for mainland China-based Taiwan business people
to hedge their investments against mainland China's policy
about-face and consider seeking other investment locations beyond the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs commissioned CIER to conduct a
public opinion poll recently to look into investment barriers and
incentives that Taiwanese investors have faced or enjoyed regarding
their overseas investments.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 75 percent of the Taiwanese companies that
have made investments overseas focused their overseas business
operations on the Chinese mainland (including Hong Kong), followed by
Southeast Asia -- constituting about 15 percent -- and the United
States and other areas, in that order.</P>
      <P>More than 70 percent of the responding companies said barriers to
investing on the mainland include restrictions on fund outflows and
restrictions on product distribution on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the high risks of investing in mainland China,
former Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan
businesses should maintain a "double-base" investment strategy when
relocating business operations overseas to help lower investment
risks. The government, meanwhile, should accelerate the signing of
bilateral or multilateral free trade accords with countries that
maintain close trade ties with Taiwan, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)
Secretary-General Lee Yi-an said the government has long stressed the
importance of market diversification. The Bureau of Foreign Trade and
TAITRA, for example, have actively encouraged Taiwan companies to
shift their overseas investment fronts from mainland China to Russia,
the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, India and Eastern Europe, in addition
to Southeast Asia, to help lower investment risks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IN ECONOMICS WILL HURT BOTH SIDES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  6  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's political interference in
economics will seriously hurt both Taiwan and mainland China in view
of their close and frequent two-way exchanges, a government official
in charge of trade and economics said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investments in mainland China over the past 14 years have
increased rapidly, with the ratio of mainland-bound investments to
the country's overall outbound investments growing from 9.5 percent
in 1991 to 53.7 percent in 2003, according to statistics compiled by
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis in 1997 could be viewed as a turning
point when Taiwan businesses shifted from Southeast Asian countries
to mainland China in search of profitable investment destinations
overseas.</P>
      <P>In 2000, mainland China opened up its market to foreign
competition following its entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO) , providing another opportunity for Taiwan companies to jockey
for a position in the mainland market.</P>
      <P>According to the tallies compiled by the Investment Commission
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan enterprises channeled
US$2.61 billion in to their mainland investment projects in 2000,
double the 1999 level.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan investors funneled US$4.06 billion into
mainland China, accounting for 53.7 percent of Taiwan's overall
outbound investment.</P>
      <P>During the first four months of this year, mainland-bound
investment reached US$1.74 billion, making up 65.7 percent of the
country's total outgoing investment, the commission tallies showed.</P>
      <P>After both Taiwan and mainland China joined the WTO, investments
by Taiwan companies in the mainland are projected with a long-term
market deployment strategy as part of their efforts to compete
against world-class organizations, such as Intel, Nokia and Samsung,
the official said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan investments in mainland China are mutually beneficial
to both, the mainland Chinese authorities should realize that
political meddling in mainland-based Taiwan businesses is unfair to
Taiwan investors, as they have created many job opportunities for
mainland people, the official pointed out.</P>
      <P>Beijing responded last week to President Chen Shui-bian's second
inaugural address on May 20 that mainland China does not welcome
Taiwan businesses which reap profits in the mainland to back
pro-Taiwan independence at home and singled out former Chi Mei Group
Chairman Shu Wen-long as an example.</P>
      <P>Beijing's unexpected rhetoric sent Taiwan's stock market
plummeting by 204 points that same day and has provoked grave
concerns among Taiwan businessmen with investments in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities have called on Beijing in recent days to
separate politics from economics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TTV AND CTS TO BE DONATED BY GOVERNMENT TO PUBLIC TELEVISION SYSTEM</HEADLINE>

      <P>Two government-owned terrestrial television
companies, Taiwan Television Enterprise Ltd (TTV) , and Chinese

Cultural Development Foundation, under a plan to be discussed by the
Executive Yuan this week.</P>
      <P>The plan will be examined by a panel headed by

      <P>Under the plan worked out by the Government Information Office

    <HEADLINE>NEW ANTI-FORGERY ID CARDS RESERVE SPACE FOR FINGERPRINT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New ROC ID cards will contain anti-forgery
features and contain a space reserved for the owner's fingerprint,
despite activists claims that such a requirement violates the
cardholder's human rights.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior announced Sunday that the new ID
cards will be designed using horizontal left-to-right Chinese writing
to follow legislation passed in early May mandating that all official
documents and related paperwork in Taiwan should be changed to the
horizontal left-to-right format from the current vertical
right-to-left format, ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>The vertical, top-to-bottom characters and right-to-left columns
writing format has been the main style used by the Chinese for
thousands of years.</P>
      <P>As with the existing ones, the new ID cards will carry the
cardholder's name, gender and address, as well as his or her parents'
names and the name of his or her spouse. The new ID card, however,
will not carry the cardholder's original domicile, but only the place
of birth.</P>
      <P>A space will be reserved on the bottom right of the ID card's
reverse for the cardholder's fingerprint, despite the fact that some
human rights activist groups have said that they are firmly opposed
to such a design, saying that mandatory fingerprinting is a violation
of the public's human rights.</P>
      <P>The new cards will have 20 markers to discourage counterfeiting,
including hidden lines, fluorescent paint and embossing, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The new ID cards are expected to be circulated nationwide next
year at the latest, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE DECLINES AMONG TEENAGERS AND YOUNG MEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The labor force participation rate among
people aged between 15 and 24 declined to 33.8 percent in 2003, or
1.38 percent less than the previous year, according to statistics
compiled by the Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>The labor force participation rate represents the ratio of the
workforce to the overall population of a certain age group</P>
      <P>The council's statistics show that 1,144,000 people aged between
15 and 24 entered the workforce in 2003, 70,000 fewer people than the
previous year.</P>
      <P>Officials from the council said the decline continues a 10-year
trend which has seen an accumulated decrease of 14.63 percent in the
last decade in inverse proportion to a 10-year 12.2 percent increase
in the number of people of this age group attending schools.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the booming economy, officials said Taiwan's
unemployment rate of people in the age group has declined by 0.47
percent in 2003 to 11.44 percent, although it is still the highest
jobless rates of all age groups because of lack of work experience
among teenagers and young men has limited their chances of landing
jobs and the frequent changes of jobs among them.</P>
      <P>In the age group between 15 and 19, the labor force participation
rate is less than 20 percent in most countries, except for the United
States, which registered a rate of 44.5 percent in 2003.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan this rate increased to 44.5 percent in the age group of
20 to 24, which is lower than the 57 percent in South Korea, and is
far behind that of Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, said officials at

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS GOOD MODEL FOR MAINLAND IN DEMOCRATIZATION: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, June 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Lin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democracy and freedom are universal values
for the whole world, and Taiwan has set a good example for mainland
China in this regard, Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , said Saturday in New
York.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks in a seminar held in New York to
commemorate the 15th anniversary of the student-led June 4 Tiananman
Massacre in 1989, in which scholars from around the world and
mainland Chinese pro-democracy activists also took part, including
Feng Congde, a prominent student leader in the June 4 pro-democracy
movement in Beijing, who now lives in exile overseas.</P>
      <P>Expressing his admiration for the sacrifice that the students and
people made for the movement, Chiu said that 15 years later, amid
changing times, Taiwan's democratization has caught up with the
mainstream trends of the international community, while the whole
world is paying more heed to democratic developments in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>If greater democratization in mainland China can help reduce
tensions and differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
Taiwan's experiences in democratic developments in turn are good
examples for the mainland, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman urged the Beijing regime to study the
proposal raised by President Chen Shui-bian in his second inaugural
address on May 20 that Taiwan and mainland China should seek to
engage in improving bilateral ties based on dignity, reciprocity and
security.</P>
      <P>"The status quo must be fully respected and negotiations should
replace confrontation," Chiu quoted Chen as having said.</P>
      <P>Yu Jie, a scholar from Beijing, said the increasing popularity of
the Internet has provided a new space for the public and
intellectuals in mainland China to dedicate themselves to the
promotion of pro-democracy activities on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Feng attributed the failure of the bloody 1989 pro-democracy
movement to unsuccessful organization and the way the activity was
handled by the students, which led to it being crushed by the
mainland Chinese military.</P>
      <P>Pan Qing, who has lived in exile in New Zealand since 1989,
called the Tiananman Massacre a vigorous reflection of the Beijing
regime's nature, one based and cemented by ignorance of human rights
and by authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>Chen Xiaoya, an historian, said that the Tiananman Massacre
brought to light the fact that the Beijing regime has maintained
power by the use of violence and cheating. She said she envisions
that a day will come when politics on the mainland is conducted on a
level playing field.</P>
      <P>Chiu arrived in New York June 4 for a weeklong visit.</P>

    <DATELINE>Guatemala  City,  June  5 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jong and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said
Saturday in Guatemala that her transit stop in San Francisco Saturday
will serve as a test of the relations between Taiwan and the United
States.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in Guatemala City at the end of a
three-nation Central American tour that also included El Salvador and
Costa Rica. She is prepared to leave for San Francisco and make a
stopover there on her way back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While in San Francisco, she will receive a human rights award
from Representative Tom Lantos at a gathering with overseas Republic
of China nationals in recognition of Taiwan's outstanding
achievements in this field and participate in a party hosted in Napa
Valley by California Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante in her
honor, the vice president said.</P>
      <P>In addition, she will also meet well-known scholars from the Bay
Area and take part in a seminar to recruit hi-tech talent based in
the United States.</P>
      <P>By that time, the public will be able to gauge Taiwan- U.S.
relations through her activities in San Francisco, she added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-U.S. ties hit a low point prior to Taiwan's March 20
presidential election because President Chen Shui-bian insisted on
holding a historic referendum on the same day as the presidential
election amid strong opposition from Beijing, which called it an
explicit time table to advocate Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The vice president also revealed her plans to forge fresh joint
ventures with the three Central American countries after returning to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Apart from inviting more artist groups from the region to visit
Taiwan to allow Taiwan people to gain a better understanding of Latin
American culture, Lu said she will push for closer cooperation in
human rights, peace and women affairs with Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>In cooperation with El Salvador, Lu said that efforts will focus
on agriculture by helping that country set up special fruit and
flower production facilities through technology transfers.</P>
      <P>As Guatemalan President Oscar Berger has called for Taiwan aid in
the medical field, Lu said that she will pay attention to this matter
and initiate a donation campaign to collect clothes for Guatemala's
aboriginal people living in mountainous regions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Globalization and liberalization will not
guarantee economic development, which depends more on the correct
industrial policy formulated by the government and Taiwan is a model
in this respect, according to a report issued here recently by the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).</P>
      <P>In the report, which explores the government's role in steering
economic development, UNCTAD said Taiwan is an example of the
importance of government policy in stimulating economic growth.</P>
      <P>Instead of encouraging the formation of big business
conglomerates and stressing the development of heavy industries as in
South Korean, Taiwan has opted for fostering the development of
small- and medium-sized business and has built up a most advanced
system that supports the development of such businesses, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>The government in Taiwan has helped local small- and medium-sized
businesses to seek foreign partners whose technology and capital
helps promote their Taiwan counterparts, said the report.</P>
      <P>The government has also invested in complicated technology such
as semiconductors and the aeronautic industry, the report said.</P>

      <P>The U.S. Congressional Human Rights

President Annette Lu in San Francisco Sunday in recognition of her
contribution to the promotion of human rights over the decades.</P>
      <P>Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) , a co-chairman of the Congressional
Human Rights Caucus, bestowed the award on behalf of the caucus at a
dinner hosted by major Taiwanese associations in the Bay area in
honor of Lu and her entourage.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in San Francisco earlier in the day for a transit stop
on her way back to Taipei after a three-leg Central American tour
that took her to El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Addressing the award-presentation ceremony, Lantos said Taiwan
has made remarkable progress in promoting freedom, democracy, human
rights and peace over the decades and that he hopes President Chen
Shui-bian and Lu can visit Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>For her part, Lu said it is a great honor for her to receive the
award, adding that she will continue to dedicate herself to promoting
peace, democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Lu said she hopes both sides of the Taiwan Strait can use
innovative thinking to develop new cross-strait ties characterized by
peace and goodwill. "Let's forget the old confrontational
cross-strait ties and forge a new and constructive relationship," she
added.</P>
      <P>Touching on the lingering ethnic disharmony in Taiwan in the wake
of the bitterly fought March 20 presidential election, Lu said the
major source of disputes between Taiwan's two political camps lies in
their attitudes toward "Taiwan identity."</P>
      <P>To address this issue and promote ethnic harmony, Lu suggested
that the people of Taiwan can call their nation "Taiwan, the Republic
of China" in the future. "This is my personal view and I'll discuss
this proposal after returning to Taipei. I think this title can
satisfy both the demands of pro-independence activists and
pro-unification people in Taiwan," she added.</P>

      <P>Parents account for more than 80 percent of
the child abusers in Taiwan, a local private association dedicated to
promoting children's welfare said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Children's Welfare Alliance said it handled 8,013 child abuse
cases last year.</P>
      <P>Of these, 81.06 percent of the abusers were the victims' parents
and 6.92 percent were the victims' main guardians. In those cases, an
alliance spokesman said, the victims often felt helpless and did not
know how to protect themselves because the abuse came from their
parents or next of kin.</P>
      <P>According to the alliance's study, the main causes of abuse
included a lack of parenting knowledge (30.06 percent) , marriage
dysfunction (20.07 percent) , drug abuse (11.65 percent) , poverty
(10.9 percent) and unemployment (9.8 percent).</P>
      <P>The alliance said the government should assign more trained staff
and contribute more budget to help abused children. At the moment,
the government has only 250 full-time staff members responsible for

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan businessmen's dependence on the
mainland Chinese market is still high, the Bureau of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) Monday urged firms to diversify their export markets to avoid
risk.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released Monday by the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) , BOFT officials said that in the first five months of this
year, Taiwan's exports to the mainland, including Hong Kong,
increased by 40.2 percent over the same period of last year, a figure
representing 37 percent of Taiwan's total exports.</P>
      <P>To prevent domestic companies' overdependence on the mainland
market, BOFT officials said that the agency will conduct a study with
the Industrial Development Bureau and the Industrial Development and
Investment Center on ways to diversify local enterprises' investment
markets, and plans to send several trade delegations to major global
market destinations this year to increase export outlets.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, BOFT officials said, mainland imports from Taiwan in
the first four months increased by only 39.9 percent, far less than
the 57.6 percent growth registered in its imports from Australia,
52.1 percent growth from South Korea, and 43 percent growth from
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>In addition, the percentage of Taiwan-made products in the
mainland's total imported goods fell from last year's 11.72 percent
to 11.52 percent, indicating that Taiwanese firms have noticed the
risk of investing in the mainland, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials also predicted that Taiwan's foreign trade may
register double-digit growth in the second half of this year,
considering the strong global economy -- which apparently has not
been affected much by the rising international oil prices -- and the
island's healthy exports.</P>

relax regulations on loans by local banks' offshore banking units to
Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China, according to the
Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC) and the Ministry of Finance
(MOF).</P>
      <P>Officials at the CBC and the MOF denied unanimously local press

    <HEADLINE>EPA TO VERIFY DOCUMENTS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE OF TOXIC WASTE EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental protection agencies at central
and local levels will carefully verify all relevant documents to
prevent any recurrence of illegal toxic waste exports, a senior
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsiung-wen, director of the Solid Waste Management Bureau
under the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) , made the remarks after a local company allegedly shipped more
than 11,000 tons of toxic industrial waste to Malaysia last year
without proper authorization from the Kuala Lumpur government.</P>
      <P>Chen said the EPA revoked late last month its industrial waste
export permit to Hong You Co. after it found that the Malaysian
import permit only allowed for shipments of industrial waste, not
toxic materials.</P>
      <P>Chen said the EPA has asked international police organizations to
assist in probing whether the Taiwan firm's Malaysian partner forged
the Malaysian import permit to deceive Hong You or whether the two
companies colluded to use fake documents to dupe Taiwan and Malaysian
authorities.</P>
      <P>In the future, Chen said, the EPA and local environmental
protection offices will contact the recipient countries'
environmental protection authorities by fax or e-mail to verify
whether the import permits produced by local industrial waste
exporting firms are genuine.</P>
      <P>"We hope such prior document verification will help prevent a
recurrence of this," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The multilateral Basel Convention prohibits trans-boundary
movement of hazardous waste among signatory countries.</P>
      <P>Chen said the EPA has established channels with the United
States, Belgium, Germany, France and South Africa for verifying
industrial waste export documents. The recent incident has also
prompted the EPA to forge similar channels with Malaysia.</P>
      <P>As for the 11,000 tons of toxic waste that has already been sent
to the southern Malaysia state of Johor, Chen said the EPA will check
whether Hong You's Malaysian partner has the ability to treat the
waste. If it cannot dispose of the waste, Chen said, the EPA will
order the Taiwan firm to bring the waste home for disposal.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Corp. violated Cambodian law
by shipping mercury-laden waste to the Southeast Asian nation. The
company was later forced to ship the material back to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT LOCAL CHIEF HAILS TAIWAN-U.S. COOPERATION IN FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Douglas Paal, director-general of the Taipei
Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , said Monday that
Taiwan-U.S. cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking has
achieved admirable results.</P>
      <P>The de facto U.S. ambassador to Taipei made the remarks at the
opening of a training workshop for Taiwan's middle- and high-ranking
law enforcement personnel in charge of the war on contraband drugs.</P>
      <P>Paal headed a group of four staffers from the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) stationed in Hong Kong and Seoul to
attend the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Noting that the workshop will enable law enforcement officers
from both sides to share their experiences in the crackdown on drug
trafficking, Paal said that Taiwan-U.S. anti-drug cooperation has
paid off in recent years, with many cross-border drug trafficking
rings smashed.</P>
      <P>Paal even that said if his former superior, Ronald Reagan, were
still alive, the late U.S. president would have been proud of the
outcome of the bilateral cooperation in the campaign against drug
trafficking and abuse. Reagan died at his home in Simi Valley on the
outskirts of Los Angeles Saturday at the age of 93.</P>
      <P>The DEA began to send staff members to lecture on anti-drug
trafficking strategies and tactics in 2002. This year, the two sides
will exchange views and experiences in undercover investigations,
wiretapping practices and intelligence sharing.</P>
      <P>A total of 155 Taiwan law enforcement officers from the Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) , prosecutor's offices at
various levels, the National Police Administration, the Coast Guard
Administration, the Aviation Police Bureau and the Criminal
Investigation Bureau participated in the workshop.</P>
      <P>MJIB Director Yeh Mao-sheng, who presided over the opening
ceremony, noted that Taiwan seized 8,482 kg of contraband drugs last
year, the largest amount in a decade. The major drug trafficking
cases uncovered in 2003 with the cooperation between Taiwan-U.S. law
enforcement officers included the discovery of an amphetamine
production facility in the United States operated by a Taiwan citizen
and the seizure of 4.7 kg of cocaine that a Nigerian citizen had
attempted to smuggle into Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Although 49 percent of the respondents said their military
service expanded their horizons, 56 percent said it was a waste of
time and 77 percent said they will not return to the armed forces.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between May 21 and June 1, with a

    <HEADLINE>LOWER RELIANCE ON IMPORTED CRUDE OIL GOOD FOR CONSUMER PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's reliance on imported petroleum
has been lower recently than in the past and recent oil price hikes
have had only a modest effect on consumer prices, Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that compared with the energy crisis of
1980, the nation's reliance on imported crude oil has been lower, and
that consumer prices have seen only modest increases over the past
few months, which they said is favorable for economic growth.</P>
      <P>Although two domestic oil companies -- Chinese Petroleum Corp and
Formosa Petrochemical Corp -- have yet to adjust upward their prices,
the hike of international oil prices in recent months and the
dramatic hikes of international raw materials mean that domestic
consumer prices are poised to increase.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that imported crude used to account for a
large share of imports in past years, saying that in 1980, crude
imports accounted for 20.8 percent of the total imports, while the
ratio was 10.88 percent in 1989 and 7.52 percent in 2003.</P>
      <P>They said that with the reliance on imported crude lowered, its
effect on consumer prices has also dropped.</P>
      <P>They noted that if the price of domestic petroleum products rises
by 10 percent, it will increase wholesale prices by 0.53 percent and
consumer prices by 0.37 percent.</P>
      <P>They said that the consumer price index stood at 100.68 in May,
up a modest 0.89 percent from the same month of the previous year,</P>
      <P>The officials said that the increase was due mainly to the rise
in petroleum prices since last year, with fuel prices increasing by
11.61 percent.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index was 108.81 percent in May, up 6.76
percent from the same month of last year, mainly because of the high
prices of crude and steel, as well as related products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang said Monday that he foresees considerable
growth in trade between Taiwan and Thailand this year, as bilateral
trade in the first quarter has already registered double-digit
growth.</P>
      <P>Shih, who is in Bangkok heading a trade promotion tour to four
Southeast Asian countries, said at the opening of a seminar that
Taiwan's exports to Thailand in the first quarter increased 26
percent over the same period of the previous year, while its imports
from Thailand also registered a 21 percent growth over the same
period.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, as of the end of 2003, Taiwan businessmen have
poured some US$10.9 billion as investments in Thailand, becoming the
Southeast Asian country's third-largest foreign investor, behind only
Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>If adding in those investments not registered with the
government, Shih added, Taiwanese investments in Thailand may exceed
US$16 billion.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that as Thailand will become one of Taiwan
businessmen's major investment bases abroad, the two countries should
strengthen economic and trade ties, suggesting that the Taiwanese
Chamber of Commerce in Thailand play an active role in promoting
cooperation projects between enterprises of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Thai Premier Office's adviser Krasae Chanawongse, who was also
present at the opening, said that the Thai government attaches
great importance to Taiwanese businessmen's investments by offering
them many preferential investment conditions.</P>
      <P>In addition to Bangkok, the delegation comprised of
representatives from 46 Taiwan companies has visited the Philippines
and will head for Malaysia and Indonesia after finishing its current

    <DATELINE>San Francisco,  June 6 (CNA)
(By S. J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government unprecedentedly
allowed visiting Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu Sunday
to issue a public statement mourning late U.S. President Ronald
Reagan, who died a day earlier at the age of 93.</P>
      <P>Lu, who arrived in San Francisco earlier in the day for a transit
stop on her way back to Taipei after a three-leg diplomatic tour of
Central America, said she delivered the posthumous tribute to
Reagan on behalf of ROC President Chen Shui-bian and the 23
million Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>For fears of offending Beijing, the U.S. government has
traditionally banned senior ROC leaders from conducting public
activities or meeting the media during their transit stops.</P>
      <P>Lu said Reagan had made outstanding contributions to reviving the
U.S. economy and laying a solid foundation for world peace during his
two terms in office from 1981 to 1989. The popular, infectiously
optimistic late U.S. president devoted much energies to destroying
Soviet communism but later worked with Soviet leaders to negotiate
crucial arms control accords to defend world peace, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Reagan once visited Taiwan during his tenure as California State
governor to signify his support for the ROC's efforts to pursue
freedom and resist communism, Lu said, adding that Reagan's
friendship and support for Taiwan is memorable and cherished.</P>
      <P>Lu said she was deeply moved and impressed by Reagan's lifelong
achievements during her visit to the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library last August when she was making a transit stop in Los
Angeles.</P>
      <P>Lu further said Reagan's death is an immeasurable loss both to
the United States and to the world as a whole. She also extended her
sympathy and condolences to the Reagan family.</P>
      <P>This is Lu's first overseas trip since she was sworn in for a
second four-year term on May 20. She first visited El Salvador to
attend the country's presidential inauguration on behalf of President
Chen and then visited Costa Rica and Guatemala. On her way to El
Salvador, Lu and her entourage made a two-day transit stop in Las
Vegas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU URGES TAIWANESE BUSINESSMEN TO HALT INVESTMENT IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
on Monday urged the government and domestic businessmen to halt their
active investment policies toward mainland China amid the increasing
political interference that Beijing imposes on Taiwanese businessmen.</P>
      <P>Siew Kuan-yu, director of the TSU's Department of Social
Development, suggested that the government halt the opening of direct
trade, postal and transport links between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait following reports that mainland Chinese authorities began to
imposed stringent policies toward investment from Taiwanese
businessmen who Beijing believe are pro-Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and thus are supporters of Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Beijing has never hidden the fact that it does not welcome
pro-DPP Taiwanese businessmen with investments on the mainland,
accusing them of using profits gained on the mainland to finance the
independence movement in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Recently, the mainland government, through its official
mouthpiece -- the People's Daily -- named some of these businessmen,
among them Hsu Wen-lung, chairman of the well-known Chi Mei Group.</P>
      <P>According to mainland Chinese newspapers, the Chi Mei Group's
plant on the mainland was denied loans from local banks and its
investment project in Zhejiang province was halted by China's State
Council, although Chi Mei denied it.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing's use of political means to interfere in
economic affairs represents unfair treatment to Taiwanese
businessmen, Siew urged the government to take quick and necessary
reactions to prevent Taiwan businessmen from suffering more from
their investments on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Siew suggested that the government halt its approval of
investments of domestic eight-inch wafer manufacturers in mainland
China to avoid China from easily obtaining Taiwan's high technology
without making any efforts, stressing that it is necessary that the
lawmakers draw a high-tech protection bill to further protect the
country's high technology from flowing to unfriendly countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew also urged local businessmen interested in
investing in the mainland not to have too much "illusions" about
China, and called on local people to "boycott Chinese goods and use
local products" as a way of protesting against Beijing authorities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Mainland Affairs
Council Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san met with overseas Chinese living
in the greater New York area Sunday and talked about recent
developments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiu spoke of the recent re-count of more than 13 million
presidential election ballots, and the simultaneous holding of the
presidential election and a referendum on March 20.</P>
      <P>He said that the holding of the two polls was not without
precedence in the world, citing as an example that New York held a
mayoral election and a referendum in 1997.</P>
      <P>On the year-end legislative election, Chiu said that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's goal is to win more than half of the
seats, saying that nomination strategy and nominated candidates will
hold the key. As there are still several months before the elections,
both the ruling and the opposition parties cannot be overly
optimistic, he added.</P>
      <P>As for constitutional reforms, Chiu said that the proposal to cut
the number of the 225-seat Legislative Yuan in half must be weighed
carefully, and that there should be other measures or the chaotic
situation in the legislature could become worse.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-strait relations, Chiu said the basic
policy of mainland China is still to have political issues as the
premises for talks, which he said have become the hurdle for
cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, non-political exchanges have continued, citing
cultural and educational exchanges as an example, saying that there
were more than 300 cross-strait visits in March, and the number
increased to more than 500 visits in May.</P>
      <P>Chiu arrived in New York Friday night to attend a seminar on the
15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre the next day. He will call
on think tanks in New York Monday to exchange views on cross-strait

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER CALLS FOR ROC-MEXICO INVESTMENT GUARANTEE ACCORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh has said in Chile that she welcomed Mexico's
invitation to Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing plants to invest
in Mexico, but signing a bilateral investment guarantee agreement
would be a prerequisite.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the economics ministry, Ho met with
Mexico's secretary of economy, Fernando Canales Clariond, for talks
during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministerial
meeting held in Pucon, southern Chile June 4-5.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Clariond reportedly extended an invitation to
Taiwan's microchip foundries to relocate part of their semiconductor
processing operations to Mexico to take advantage of the country's
geographical proximity to North America as well as offering other
investment benefits.</P>
      <P>Mexico's invitation is welcome news for Taiwan authorities
because they have long been concerned that Taiwan's overseas foundry
investments have relied too much on mainland China, with about 60
percent of their products being churned out by the "Chinese factory."</P>
      <P>Relocating part of the processing operations to Mexico will not
only help Taiwan microchip foundries diversify manufacturing bases,
it will also help Taiwan make inroads into the much larger and more
mature markets in North America, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ho noted that since the semiconductor manufacturing
industry is a capital- and technology-intensive industry requiring at
least US$3 billion for one plant to become operational, the signing
of a bilateral investment guarantee agreement is thus crucial and
imperative.</P>
      <P>For his part, Clariond said that he will see to it that Mexico
seeks to conduct bilateral talks with Taiwan under legal frameworks
of both countries on the signing of an investment guarantee agreement
to facilitate the realization of Taiwan's semiconductor investment in
Mexico.</P>
      <P>Clariond also noted that Mexico -- whose two-way trade markets
have been focusing on North America as a result of NAFTA -- is keenly
interested in developing closer business and trade relations with
major economies in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Ho, who was sworn in as economics minister May 20, has also met
with her counterparts from Canada, Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea
and Japan for bilateral talks during the two-day ministerial meeting,
ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Ho and her ministry delegation are expected to return to Taipei
Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Reagan legacy looming
large over campaign.

U.S. President Bush and his political advisers embraced the
legacy of Ronald Reagan, suggesting that even in death, Mr. Reagan
had one more campaign in him -- this one at the side of Mr. Bush.

The Wall Street Journal: How Reagan recast debate on markets,
taxes -- and deficits.

The weekend death of Ronald Reagan brought an outpouring of
eulogies that agreed on many things the 40th president had been to
his country: a towering political figure, a slayer of Communism, and
a sunny optimist at a time when that's what Americans needed most.
However, even upon his death, no agreement could be reached on the
virtues and vices of the economic revolution he wrought -- or on how
much of it endures today.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>NEW POLITICAL PARTY TAKING SHAPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The preparatory committee of the
tentatively-named Nonpartisan Solidarity Union (NSU) was established
Monday, bringing the country a step closer to seeing the realization
of a new political party.</P>
      <P>Former Minister of the Interior Chang Po-ya said during a news
conference marking the committee's establishment that she does not
exclude the possibility of serving as chairwoman of the new party
when it is founded.</P>
      <P>Chang, who had also been a health minister during the latter part
of the era of Kuomintang rule, said the establishment of the NSU will
effectively offer a "third" or "middle-way" choice for the people of
Taiwan, who have long been divided into only two groups -- either
"pro-unification Blue" or "pro-independence Green."</P>
      <P>The new party's 40-odd founders include some well-known
politicians such as Chang, former Hsinchu Mayor Shih Hsin-chung, and
10 of the 13 independent legislators of the country who have grouped
under the banner of the existing Alliance of Independent Legislators.</P>
      <P>The NSU preparatory committee will file a list of its founders
Monday with the Ministry of the Interior in the first step toward
forming the new party, said Chiu Chuang-liang, one of the founders.</P>
      <P>Tsai Hao, one of the founders and head of the Alliance of
Independent Legislators, said the new party's goals include enabling
independent lawmakers to play a more useful role in the
party-dominated legislature and being committed to be the voice of
the country's underprivileged.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the NSU is expected to flex its muscles in the year-end
legislative elections and is determined to win more than 15 seats.
The party will name no more than one candidate in each constituency
in the legislative elections, in hopes of winning more than 5 percent
of the votes, which is the threshold for political parties seeking
government grants and at-large legislative seats, Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>He added that all 10 members of the Alliance of Independent
Legislators will stand for re-election in the legislative elections,
which should quell speculation that the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party is trying to win over the alliance's support in the legislature
by offering its members Cabinet positions or seats in the Control
Yuan.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, Tsai said, the NSU is expected to
convene its first party congress by Aug. 3 and the party will be
formally founded Sept. 30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER SCHEDULED TO VISIT EUROPE IN JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Shan Chen said
Monday he is scheduled to visit Europe in July as part of his efforts
to forge closer ties between the Republic of China and E.U. member
countries.</P>
      <P>Tan made the remarks while delivering a speech at a meeting of
the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee on the nation's
diplomatic situation in the wake of President Chen Shui-bian's May 20
inauguration for a second four-year term.</P>
      <P>During the session, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Sun Kuo-hua
said the European Union's vote against Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Assembly -- the World Health Organization's governing body --
in May indicated that Taiwan should devote more energy to boosting
substantive ties with the 25-member bloc.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
consistently given priority to forging closer ties with the European
Union. With the number of E.U. member states expanding from 15 to 25
in May, Chen said Taiwan must make even more efforts to promote
relations with the bloc.</P>
      <P>Barring unexpected developments, Chen said he will leave for a
European tour in July with a view to integrating the resources of ROC
representation offices in various European countries and working out
innovative measures to promote cooperative ties with the European
Union.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the MOFA has felt pressure from the United States
over the arms procurement budget issue, Chen said that "although our
diplomatic staff may talk about arms procurement plans with American
officials in private, the weaponry procurement issue is principally
handled by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) . The MOFA has not
so far felt any U.S. pressure over the arms procurement plan."</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers brought up the arms purchase issue because
the Cabinet passed an MND-proposed NT$610.8 billion budget plan last
week to buy six advanced Patriot anti-missile defense batteries, 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and eight conventional submarines from
the United States. Many opposition lawmakers have questioned the
wisdom of buying these weapons at allegedly exorbitant prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON CONSON LIKELY TO AFFECT TAIWAN: CWB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  May 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Conson, which formed Monday morning
from a low pressure system lurking near the South China Sea, is
likely to affect Taiwan in the following couple of days, the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) reported.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau will issue a sea warning Monday afternoon at
the earliest if the newly-developed typhoon continues to gain
momentum and keeps moving in a north-north-easterly direction, CWB
meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Conson, with a radius of 100 kilometers and packing
maximum sustained winds of up to 75 kilometers per hour, was centered
about 660 km south-southwest of Taiwan's southernmost tip of Hengchun
at 8 a.m. Monday, moving north-north-easterly toward Taiwan at a
speed of 10 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>Since the storm is located pretty near to Taiwan, the CWB
meteorologists said the bureau may first issue a sea warning for the
Bashi Channel and Dongsha Islands areas later Monday.</P>
      <P>Whether Typhoon Conson directly hits Taiwan depends on how a
stationary front from northern mainland China, which is moving
southward, interacts with the typhoon's moisture system in the
following days, the meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Conson is the fourth typhoon of the year in the Pacific area.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another low pressure system has been detected lurking
near Guam. The system was located about 2,000 kilometers from Taiwan
at 8 a.m. Monday, moving westward toward the island at a speed of 10
kilometers per hour, the CWB reported.</P>
      <P>The meteorologists said it is still too early to tell whether the
low pressure system will directly affect Taiwan.</P>

been turned over to the Ilan Prosecutor's Office for violation of the
Statue Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area

      <P>Coast guard official Chiang Chao-lin noted that since the Central
Weather Bureau issued a sea warning for Typhoon Conson Monday
afternoon, ships have flocked into the harbor to seek safe haven from
the inclement weather. Smuggling rings might see this as an opportune
time to carry out their illegal activities, he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that he has asked all coast guard forces to step up
their monitoring and crackdown on any illegal activities at sea.</P>
      <P>He said the coast guard had been tipped off earlier about the
Keelung-registered "Mingchunchia, " adding that officers boarded the
ship off Toucheng, Ilan, at around 2 a.m. Tuesday. They found no fish
haul or fishing equipment, and instead discovered the 21 illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants in the cabin of the boat.</P>
      <P>Captain Yeh said during his initial arraignment that he had
gotten into a quarrel with another ship days earlier and that because
he could not pay the compensation, he had agreed to smuggle the women
into Taiwan in lieu of the payment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO LEAD DPP TO VICTORY IN LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed Tuesday to
lead his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to a majority in the
year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chen, who doubles as DPP chairman, told a meeting of the DPP
Central Standing Committee that he has achieved two of the three
goals he outlined at the last DPP founding anniversary -- to carry
out the country's first national referendum and to win the 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Now, he said, it is time to complete the remaining goal -- to win
a majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>He urged DPP members to win public support by doing things that
meet the people's desires.</P>
      <P>As for ties with mainland China, Chen said the overall approach
was spelled out in his May 20 inaugural address and his
administration will do everything it can to resume dialogue with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Chen's national policy adviser, Juan Ming, gave a
speech at the meeting to counter Beijing's recent criticism of Shu
Wen-lung, founder of Taiwan's Chi Mei Group, for what it calls Shu's
support of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Juan said Shu's approach of considering the mainland a part of
Chi Mei's plan to venture into the global market is much better than
the approach of Morris Chang, founder of the Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., who wants to transfer Taiwan's advanced technology
to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Juan said Shu's approach is obviously much better for Taiwan and
is beneficial to the mainland as well. Direct transportation links
with the mainland opened on the basis of Shu's approach would benefit
both Taiwan and the mainland, he said.</P>
      <P>He also defended Chen's decision to seek Washington's opinion in
advance on the parts of his inaugural address concerning the
mainland, claiming that Taiwan's ties with the mainland are not a
domestic issue but an international issue, so it is only natural for
Chen to consult Washington.</P>
      <P>Beijing, for the same reason, told Washington in advance about
its May 17 lambasting of Chen, according to Juan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Interior Su Jia-chyuan inspected
the central disaster prevention center Tuesday and called on county
and city government chiefs to strengthen preparations against
approaching Typhoon Conson.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a land warning for
Typhoon Conson at around noon Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The typhoon, located about 230 km south-southwest of Oluanpi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, at 8: 30 p.m., was moving in a

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PURCHASES MUST CORRESPOND TO REAL NEEDS: LEGISLATURE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Tuesday that Taiwan's arms purchases from the United States
should correspond to the country's real needs and that the prices of
the weapons must be reasonable.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after hearing that the Executive Yuan's
arms purchase budget plan could not be included on the June 10 agenda
of the Legislative Yuan for screening due to differing opinions from
the opposition lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan presented a budget plan to the legislature
earlier this month worth NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) to buy
defense weapons from the United States</P>
      <P>At the same time, the United States also extended an invitation
to Wang to lead a legislative delegation on a visit to the United
States in order to obtain support for the arms procurement plan. The
delegation is expected to head for the United States in mid-June.</P>
      <P>Wang said it is more suitable that the Legislative Yuan should
deal with the issue after he returns from his 10-day visit.</P>
      <P>Concerning the prices of the weapons, Wang insisted that they
should be similar to international market prices, as there are doubts
that the prices offered to Taiwan are much higher than those offered
to other countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang also expressed the hope that the Cabinet's "Ten
Major Construction Plans" program can be approved by the Legislative
Yuan before its June 11 recess.</P>
      <P>He said he had instructed Legislative Yuan Vice President P.K.
Chiang to discuss the issue with the legislative caucus leaders of
the ruling and opposition parties to first reach a consensus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. EXPERT WARNS WASHINGTON AGAINST FAVORING BEIJING HARDLINERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi and Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A United States expert on China
suggested recently that President George W. Bush's administration
should guard against letting the China-Taiwan balance slip in favor
of Beijing's hardliners and away from the democratic leaders in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>John Tkacik, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said
in an article in the latest issue of DefenseNews Weekly that a Bush
administration tilt toward Beijing hardliners will only reward bad
behavior by the militarists, undermine Beijing's moderates, and
instruct China's leaders that the way to get American cooperation is
with military threats.</P>
      <P>He criticized the Bush administration's policy of "strategic
ambivalence" on cross-Taiwan Strait issues, which he said leaves both
Beijing and Taipei dangerously confused about American goals in East
Asia.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are moderates in China's leadership, Tkacik
cited President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao as examples. He said
that they focus on China's economic and social problems and probably
argue in internal circles that war in the Taiwan Strait would be a
disaster for China.</P>
      <P>The militarists led by Military Affairs Commission Chairman Jiang
Zemin and Vice President Zeng Qinghong, Jiang's man in the Politburo,
want to simply talk tough to Taiwan, the China expert pointed out.</P>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed in his
inaugural speech May 20 that his government "would not exclude any
possibility" in seeking a new relationship between Taiwan and China,
Tkacik said, adding that the U.S. State Department lauded the speech
as constructive.</P>
      <P>He shared the U.S. State Department's view that "the ball is
firmly in Beijing's court."</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNAXIS BEGINS CONSTRUCTION OF LCD PANEL RESEARCH CENTER IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unaxis, a Swiss-based high-tech company,
began the construction of an LCD panel research laboratory in the
Chunan Science-based Industrial Park in Miaoli County Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Once the LCD panel research laboratory and assembly center
completed in 2005, the center is expected to directly offer Taiwan's
LCD panel manufacturers the equipment and coating technology needed
for LCD panels.</P>
      <P>This is the largest investment Unaxis has ever made in Asia --
NT$1 billion (US$29.8 million).</P>
      <P>Having access to many areas of high technology, Unaxis makes
equipment for processing semiconductor wafers, assembling and
packaging finished microchips, and applying thin film coatings to
LCDs and flat-panel displays, and offers a wide variety of high-tech
optical components.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang, Unaxis CEO
Heinz Kundert, and several other high-ranking government officials
witnessed the ground-breaking ceremony in Miaoli, where officials of
Unaxis and the economics ministry also signed a letter of intent to
cooperate in developing the coating technology of LCD panels.</P>
      <P>Unaxis will also cooperate with nearby high-tech organizations
and universities, including the Industrial Technology Research
Institute, National Tsinghua University and National Chiao Tung
University to develop technology for producing equipment such as
PECVDs and PVDs.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that since the equipment to produce LCD panels are
increasingly bigger, almost beyond what a large truck can carry, it
is of tremendous importance that the LCD panels are produced in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The completion of Unaxis's factory in Taiwan in 2005 will make
the island's LCD panel industry more robust, Shih added.</P>
      <P>Unaxis, with 80 subsidiaries in 25 countries, employs some 6.500
workers around the world. Its investment in Taiwan is expected to
create some 200 jobs.</P>
      <P>The Swiss company also revealed that after the current center in
Taiwan, it plans to enlarge the scale of their investment on the
island, focusing on semiconductors and optical products in the
future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SPOONBILL SPECIALISTS STUDY RARE BIRDS IN KOREAN DMZ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan, June 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan wildlife conservation group entered
the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea in late
May to watch a natural sanctuary for the endangered migratory
black-faced spoonbill, a bird club in Tainan County said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The three-member Taiwan group -- comprised of Prof. Wang
Chien-ping from National Cheng Kung University and Wang Cheng-chi and
Huang Chun-hsien, two wildlife conservationists from the Tainan
County-based Wild Bird Society of Happy Family -- visited the Korean
DMZ May 31 to familiarize themselves with the breeding grounds of the
rare birds, most of which fly to Taiwan to overwinter and then return
to the Mt. Geumgangsan area near the Korean DMZ to breed in spring.</P>
      <P>The group became the first Taiwan group to visit the DMZ for
bird-watching.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, they feasted their eyes on the breathtaking
scenery in the DMZ and saw for the first time the breeding grounds of
the black-faced spoonbills, which they have watched every year in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the visit to the DMZ was part of the
International Symposium on Black-faced Spoonbills in North Asia, held
in Seoul May 26 - June 4.</P>
      <P>Delegates from Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam and host
South Korea took part in the symposium co-sponsored by South Korea's
ministry of environment and the Korean Federation of Environment
Movement, a non-profit environment-conscious body, according to
Huang.</P>
      <P>During the symposium, said Huang, Korean officials suggested that
Taiwan and South Korea sponsor workshops and activities every year
for the conservation of black-faced spoonbills, whose population is
no more than 1,500 worldwide, mainly in Asia.</P>
      <P>Korean officials suggested that South Korea host a black-faced
spoonbill conservation month in May every year, while Taiwan sponsor
a similar activity in November or December every year, according to
Huang.</P>
      <P>In addition, according to Huang, National Cheng Kung University
has maintained an academic exchange program with Korean University of
Education, South Korea, on studies of black-faced spoonbills.</P>
      <P>Of all the Asian countries where black-faced spoonbills have
regularly visited, the wetlands in the southern Taiwan county of
Tainan still boasts the world's largest number of black-faced
spoonbills with more than 700 of the rare migratory birds reportedly
having arrived there last year to overwinter.</P>
      <P>Black-faced spoonbills migrate from North Asia to the warm
wetlands in Taiwan and other Asian lower-latitudinal countries
between late September and early December every year to spend the
winter and avoid their cold northern breeding grounds. The birds then
return north around April or May of the following year.</P>
      <P>The Tainan wetlands are not just an ideal habitat for black-faced
spoonbills alone as there were many other kinds of migratory wild
birds overwintering around Tsengwenchi River, and the Chiku and
Sitsao areas, making the southern wetlands a haven for Asian
migratory feathered species.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANDATORY SEPARATION OF GARBAGE TO BEGIN  NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will start to promote its "compulsory garbage separation" plan
next year in seven cities and will then spread the program to the
rest of the cities and counties around Taiwan in 2006, EPA officials
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that since the administration promoted
resource recycling and kitchen waste recycling, the amount of
recycled waste has continued to climb and garbage continued to drop
over the years.</P>
      <P>They said that after Taipei imposed garbage fees by requiring the
purchase of special garbage bags, it has achieved the goal of
reducing garbage. The compulsory garbage separation program in
Keelung, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung have also borne good results.</P>
      <P>To achieve the goal of reducing garbage by 25 percent by 2007,
the EPA will still divide garbage into three categories: recyclable
garbage -- including cans and bottles, kitchen waste and general
garbage in the first stage.</P>
      <P>In the first stage which begins Jan. 1, 2005, the three kinds of
garbage will be collected in the two municipalities of Taipei and
Kaohsiung and the five cities of Keeling, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi
and Tainan.</P>
      <P>The second stage will begin Jan. 1, 2006 in those villages and
townships that have yet to implement the plan to impose garbage
collection fees with special garbage bags.</P>
      <P>On whether to impose punishment if the public cannot act along
with the regulations of the garbage division plan, the officials said
that if public support for the garbage division plan is over 70
percent, then the punishment will be the major way to handle such
violations.</P>

      <P>Taipei, June 8 (CAN) A spokesman for the Executive Yuan on
Tuesday dismissed a Hong Kong newspaper report that said mainland
China might consider withdrawing its missiles deployed along its
southeast coast opposite Taiwan if the United States does not sell
advanced weapons to the island.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai made the remarks in response to a report by Wen Wei
Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Cabinet has reminded the public that for a
long time, mainland China's military deployment has only increased
instead of decreased in quality and quantity against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that Wen Wei Pao's report has not been substantiated by
the Beijing authorities and should be considered to be rumor. In
addition, the military expenditure by mainland China over the past
two years has grown at a double digit rate of between US$50 billion
and US$70 billion.</P>
      <P>"The quality and quantity have been upgraded, posing a serious
threat to the security in the Taiwan Strait," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed to Beijing's May 17 statement regarding building
military mutual trust between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, as
well as the establishment of a peaceful and stable exchange
framework, as being the "same language" used by Taiwan about
establishing a peaceful and stable exchange mechanism.</P>
      <P>Instead of speaking through the media, Chen urged Beijing to
create an environment conducive to reducing military expansion,
establishing a way to ensure mutual trust and resuming negotiations

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE PASSES RESOLUTION TO SUSPEND SALE OF CHINA STEEL SHARES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Tuesday passed a
resolution demanding that the government suspend the release of
shares of the China Steel Corporation and continue to hold at least
20 percent of the shares.</P>
      <P>The legislature discussed the proposal by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang and People First
Party. Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng afterwards announced
the results.</P>
      <P>Since the privatization of China Steel in 1995, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs still held 40 percent of the shares, but the
ministry started to release its shares since last year, and the
ministry - meaning the government -- is still the biggest shareholder
with about 23 percent of the shares.</P>
      <P>Worried that the government's release of shares could undermine
the rights of employees, the company's workers' union staged several
rallies in front of the legislature.</P>
      <P>After learning of the news, an economics ministry official said
that he would respect the decision by the legislature, although the
ministry has listed the release of China Steel shares in the budgets
of the years between 2000 and 2002, and the budgets have already
passed legislative review.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said that the
ministry now owns 23.52 percent of China Steel's shares, but that if
the corporation had adhered to its earlier sell-off plan it would now
only hold 9. 34 percent of the shares. The reason that the economics
ministry still has as many shares as it does is because of
fluctuations in share prices that made sales occasionally slow.</P>
      <P>Chen was pointing out that if not for the slow release of shares
due to market forces, the ministry would have fewer shares than what
the legislature had just said was an acceptable minimum. He wondered
if the ministry ought to continue with the government-approved
sell-off or the new instructions to halt at 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although China Steel has completed privatization,
it still shoulders the responsibility of the policy of the nation. He
said the sell-off was only slowed by legislators themselves because
they had imposed a minimum price for the sale of the shares.</P>
      <P>"The urgent task now will be to step up communications with the
Legislative Yuan," he said, as well as "set the priority on Tuesday's
resolution and the review passed on the budget earlier."</P>
      <P>In addition to continuing communications, Chen also said that the
ministry will study how many retained shares would best benefit the
country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Department of Treasury under the
Ministry of Finance said that to retain the nation's financial
integrity and for it to conform to established systems, the budgets
that passed legislative review should be carried out.</P>
      <P>Regarding the claims by some that the suspension of the release
of China Steel shares would help prop up its own share prices, the
officials said that the government also released China Steel shares
last year, but share prices of the corporation continued to climb,
showing that the more shares that were offered, the higher the price
paid for them.</P>
      <P>The share price of China Steel closed at NT$30.6 (US$0.91)
on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNA OPENS WEB SITE FOR TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central News Agency (CNA) launched a new
Web site Tuesday that will cater to the needs of Taiwan business
people operating in mainland China, commonly known as "taishang."</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu said he looks forward to seeing the new CNA
"taishang" Web site serve as a conduit between the government and the
business community by offering "taishang" with updated and convenient
information services and by helping them increase their understanding
of the risks and pitfalls of doing business on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wu said commercial exchanges have become the most important part
of cross-Taiwan Strait relations. Cross-strait trade amounted to
US$46.3 billion last year. Moreover, unofficial tallies showed that
Taiwanese business people have poured more than US$70 billion into
mainland China for various investment projects and that there are
more than 500,000 "taishang, " their employees and dependents now
living in the mainland.</P>
      <P>As the mainland economic environment has been changing rapidly
and cross-strait interactions have been increasing steadily, Wu said
"taishang" face many problems. Before mainland China's legal system
becomes healthier and more modernized and cross-strait dialogue is
resumed, Wu said providing "taishang" with full and updated
information and helping them better understand the risks of investing
in the mainland are some of the MAC's most important tasks.</P>
      <P>Since April 1996, Wu said, the MAC has joined forces with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Straits Exchange Foundation and the
Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) in
operating a centralized "taishang service counter" to offer
"taishang" needed assistance and services.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said, the MAC has operated a "taishang trade net"
Web site since January 1997. More than one million Internet users
have so far browsed the Web site, indicating that "taishang" need
"real time" trade information.</P>
      <P>Noting that CNA is Taiwan's oldest and largest national news
agency, Wu said he is very glad to see CNA inaugurate a new Web site
to satisfy "taishang's" need for up-to-the-minute and diversified
market information.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, CNFI Chairman Hou Chen-hsiung said
CNA has consistently provided Taiwan business people, including those
with businesses in mainland China, with diverse commercial
information for the past decades.</P>
      <P>"We hope the inauguration of the new CNA "taishang" Web site will
provide correct, updated and even more detailed business information
to Taiwanese business people operating in mainland China where
information remains relatively scant," Hou said.</P>
      <P>CNA Chairman Su Tzen-ping said the new CNA Web site is aimed at
keeping Taiwan businessmen on the mainland informed of world news,
giving them access to air their views and provide them with a
platform to exchange opinions.</P>
      <P>In addition to breaking news, the Web site will also supply
viewers with customized information through columns such as the

    <HEADLINE>MAC VICE CHAIRMAN MEETS WITH U.S. THINK TANK SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Chiu Tai-san met with noted U.S. think tank scholars in the
New York area Monday for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Andrew L. Y. Hsia, representative of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in New York, Chiu met with Dr. Donald
Zagoria, director of the National Committee on American Foreign
Policy's Project U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations, and representatives
from several other think tanks.</P>
      <P>Chiu told Taiwan journalists stationed in the New York area after
the closed-door meeting that U.S. scholars generally recognized
President Chen Shui-bian's May 20 second inaugural address as
"constructive" to the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, they are more concerned about which concrete
measures President Chen will take to break the current cross-strait
impasse," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chiu said, the U.S. side kept a low profile about
cross-strait relations before Taiwan's bitterly fought March 20
presidential election. After the election, Chiu said, the United
States now holds positive expectations of seeing a breakthrough in
deadlocked cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he has briefed American academics on the ROC
government's determination on promoting non-political cross-strait
exchanges in cultural, educational, trade and economic fields. As to
the much-anticipated opening of direct cross-strait shipping and air
links, Chiu said it takes bilateral negotiations to work out viable
terms because such direct links involve many complicated security
issues.</P>
      <P>Chiu arrived in New York last Friday to attend a seminar
sponsored by exiled mainland Chinese pro-democracy activists to mark
the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre. He will travel to
Boston to meet with American scholars and Taiwanese expatriates
there. He is scheduled to return to Taipei May 12.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE SURROUNDED BY CIGARETTE ADS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People in Taiwan are never far away from ads
by cigarette manufacturers, a communications professor said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Liang-wen, director of the Institute of Communication Studies
of Chiao Tung University, said at a press conference on media
literacy on cigarette ads that cigarette manufacturers are willing to
spend big money on advertising and that they are omnipresent in
Taiwan, although the average person may not be aware of their
presence.</P>
      <P>He said that according to figures provided by AC Nielsen, a
leading marketing information company, cigarette manufacturers spent
more than NT$200 million (US$5.97 million) between January 2003 and
March 2004 on ads in 126 domestic and foreign magazines in Taiwan,
with the United States and Japanese cigarette brands accounting for
the lion's share of the spending.</P>
      <P>The Japanese brand Mild Seven Super Lights topped the list at
NT$28.84 million during the 15-month period, followed by another
Japanese brand Mine at NT$25.06 million. The top nine spenders on ads
were all foreign brands, with the Long Life Gentle series from
Taiwan's Tobacco &amp; Wine Corp. coming in 10th place with spending of
NT$7.92 million during the period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey on media literacy unveiled Tuesday showed
that teenagers received only 70 points in a 100-point score rating.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Health Promotion under the Department of Health
unveiled the survey conducted on students from all levels of schools
in Taiwan starting from elementary school through to colleges between
May 11 and 21.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,290 valid samples were collected in the survey,
which is said to have a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage
point.</P>
      <P>Huang Tung-yi, associate professor of Shih Hsin University who
conducted the survey at the commission of the Bureau of Health
Promotion, said that more than 70 percent of the children and
teenagers in Taiwan are not aware of the marketing of cigarette
manufacturers under the cover of other activities.</P>
      <P>When asked if they are aware that cigarette manufactures are
actually trying to promote their products through sponsoring such
activities as ball games or concerts, most said they aren't.</P>
      <P>Those who have a higher education, such as college or university
students, are unable to read into cigarette ads that try to lure them
for a puff, but unfortunately, their determination to resist the
tobacco hazard tends to be the weakest, Huang said.</P>
      <P>In terms of channels for cigarette advertising, convenience
stores topped the list, followed by the Internet, magazines and
advertising boards on roadsides, movies, and newspapers, in that
order.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, youngsters receive the most anti-smoking
messages, from awareness campaigns at their schools.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the trend is that the smoking
population is getting younger, with 17 percent of males and 4.1
percent of females aged between 15 and 17 smoking.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CWB ISSUES LAND WARNING FOR TYPHOON CONSON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a
land warning for Typhoon Conson at around noon Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Conson, which developed from a low pressure system in the South
China Sea only a day earlier, is expected to affect Taiwan with
torrential rains and gusty winds in the following couple of days, CWB
meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>The tropical storm, with a radius of 150 kilometers and maximum
sustained winds of up to 100 kilometers per hour, was centered about
350 km south-southwest of Taiwan's southernmost tip of Hengchun at
11: 30 a.m. Tuesday, moving north-north-easterly toward Taiwan at a
speed of 11 kilometers per hour, the CWB reported.</P>
      <P>The Hengchun Peninsula is expected to come under Conson's
onslaught beginning early Wednesday morning, the CWB meteorologists
said.</P>
      <P>Boats plying the Bashi Channel or waters near the Tungsha
(Pratas) Islands and the southern part of the Taiwan Strait, as well
as Taiwan's southeastern offshore areas, should be on high alert
against gusty winds and torrential rains to be triggered by Typhoon
Concon -- the fourth typhoon of the year in the Pacific area, the CWB
said.</P>
      <P>People in the Hengchun Peninsula, Orchid Island, Green Island,
southern Taiwan and southeastern Taiwan should be on guard against
possible torrential rains, floods, and mud and rock slides that may
be triggered by the typhoon, the meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>They said that between late Wednesday and Thursday noon -- when
Typhoon Conson will be about 110 kilometers southwest of Oluanpi --
will be the crucial period for determining whether the typhoon
directly hits Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Authorities from Kaohsiung Harbor, southern Taiwan, announced a
suspension of ferry services between Kaohsiung and Penghu Island in
the Taiwan Strait for Tuesday and Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>""TAIWAN R.O.C."" PROPOSAL NOT RELATED TO CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu's proposal of
using "Taiwan Republic of China" as the country's official name has
nothing to do with issues related to proposed constitutional reform,
a statement by the Public Affairs Office of the Presidential Office
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The statement also said that Lu was not trying to use the
proposal to express her stance on constitutional reform since her and
President Chen Shui-bian's positions regarding such reform are
totally the same.</P>
      <P>The statement, which was made under Lu's instruction, was a
response to various media reports that have played up the proposal
that the vice president made Sunday evening at a gathering organized
by Taiwan expatriates in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Lu and her entourage arrived in San Francisco earlier in the day
for a stopover on her way back to Taiwan after a 14-day visit to ROC
diplomatic allies in Central America.</P>
      <P>Lu made the proposal because she feels that the disputes between
"the pan-blue alliance" and "the pan-green camp" after the March 20
presidential election and the instability in Taiwan's internal
political situation are not due to ethnic divisions, the statement
said, adding that the vice president also thinks that the real
problem is divergence over historical feelings between those who
prefer to identify with the Republic of China and those who prefer to
identify with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In order to resolve the dispute and divergence as soon as
possible and to further consolidate harmony and unity in Taiwan
society, the vice president therefore suggested that both the camps
make a concession and call the nation "Taiwan Republic of China," the
statement added.

important influence over the government of the time.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Men who, when they see what is
good and honest, try to act up to it, and when they see what is bad
and dishonest try to avoid it as if avoiding scalding water: Such men
I have known and the expressions of such principle I have heard."
"But men who live in retirement in order to study their aims and who
practice righteousness in order to carry out their principles: The
expression of such principles I have heard, but I have not seen such
men."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REITERATES ITS SUPPORT FOR DOHA ROUND TRADE TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June 8 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's chief delegate to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on Monday reiterated the island's stance in
support of the Doha Round trade talks.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, the ROC's permanent representative to the WTO,
voiced Taiwan's support for the talks at a private meeting with
Shotaro Oshima, chairman of the WTO General Council, the
decision-making body of the organization.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Oshima, also Japanese ambassador to the
global trade regulatory body, briefed Yen on the planned mechanism of
the "July Package" that tries to push WTO members to make efforts to
reach agreement by July on the key issues that will provide a clear
way forward for the stalled Doha Round trade negotiations. He also
asked Yen about Taiwan's stance on the new round of trade talks.</P>
      <P>The Doha Round trade talks are at a turning point, and the
question of whether the WTO's 142 member states will reach an
agreement related to the "July Package" mechanism by the end of next
month is crucial to the development of the talks.</P>
      <P>Talking about the nine-point mechanism of the "July Package," the
ambassador said that he hopes to know Taiwan's viewpoint regarding
certain WTO members' stance in support of first talking only on the
trade facilitation issue of the so-called "Singapore Issues" and not
putting the rest of the issues -- namely investment, transparency in
government procurement, and competition policy -- on the agenda of
the new round trade negotiations.</P>
      <P>In response to Oshima's request, Yen said that he had made a
report to President Chen Shui-bian as well as other high-ranking
officials of the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan regarding the
development of the Doha Round trade talks during his recent
consultation trip to Taiwan and reiterated the ROC's government's
support for the trade talks.</P>
      <P>He also said that the smooth passage of the "July Package" is
very important to the future progress of the trade talks.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing Taiwan's support for the mechanism of the "July
Package" in principle, Yen however expressed the hope that the WTO
member states will not repeat the mistakes they made at the WTO
ministerial meeting held last year in Cancun, Mexico.</P>
      <P>Those talks collapsed after a dispute between developing and
industrialized states over richer states' farming subsidies and
tariffs imposed on agricultural imports from developing countries as
well as differences related to the "Singapore Issues".</P>
      <P>Taiwan is in favor of holding only talks on the trade
facilitation topics of the "Singapore Issues" since such talks could
facilitate quicker customs clearance procedures and reduce customs
clearance costs, Yen said, adding that the island also suggests that
the other issues contained in the "Singapore Issues" should also be
included in the agenda of the Doha Round trade talks without being
discussed by the WTO members at the present time.</P>
      <P>He noted that if the WTO members are unable to reach a consensus
on what order the issues contained in the "Singapore Issues" should
be tackled, then he is not optimistic about the future development of
the new round of trade talks.</P>

the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported.</P>
      <P>Although Typhoon Conson is not likely to make landfall in Taiwan,
the weather bureau still warned people on the island to be on high
alert against gusty winds and torrential rains that could be
triggered by the storm.</P>
      <P>Conson, with a radius of 150 kilometers and maximum sustained
winds of up to 120 kilometers per hour, was centered about 60
kilometers south-southeast of Orchid Island located off southeast
Taiwan at 11 a.m. Wednesday, moving northeastward at a speed of 17-15
kilometers per hour, the CWB reported.</P>
      <P>With the typhoon's course shifting slightly eastward and its
speed reducing, Conson's outer edge is expected to move off Taiwan by
nightfall as the typhoon sweeps through the ocean corridor to
Taiwan's east, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Despite this good news, the bureau has expanded the area for its
land warning against gusty winds and torrential rains, from the Bashi
Channel, the Tungsha (Pratas) Islands, Taiwan's southeastern offshore
areas, including Orchid Island and Green Island, to the south,
southeastern, eastern and northeastern parts of Taiwan, until late
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Residents in these areas should particularly be on guard against
possible flash-floods and mud or rock slides that could be triggered
by the typhoon, the meteorologists said, adding that people in
low-lying areas should also be on watch against sudden inundations of
sea water.</P>
      <P>The typhoon has partially disrupted highway traffic as well as
air and sea transportation in south and southeastern Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed Wednesday to
make a suitable, feasible and updated constitution for Taiwan in the
coming four years.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a dinner party he hosted to entertain lawyers
representing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the
presidential election vote re-count in northern Taiwan, Chen said
that constitutional reform is one of the most important tasks to be
undertaken during his second four-year term.</P>
      <P>"We need a suitable, feasible and updated constitution, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said that there exist different views and
expectations on how to achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>The existing Republic of China Constitution poses a certain
restriction on constitutional reform, Chen noted, adding that it is
necessary to make a breakthrough while taking current realities into
consideration.</P>
      <P>Chen did not elaborate on the content of the constitutional
reform. Nevertheless, he said in his May 20 inaugural speech that
there are many problems in the nation's current Constitution that
need to be tackled, among which the more immediate and obvious
include whether to have a three-branch or five-branch separation of
power, whether to adopt a presidential or parliamentary system of
government, whether the president should be elected by a relative
majority or an absolute majority, reform of the national legislature
and relevant articles, the role of the National Assembly and its
retainment versus abolishment, and whether to suspend or abolish the
provincial government.</P>
      <P>He also noted in the speech that it is not appropriate to include
the issues of sovereignty, territory and the subject of Taiwan's
independence or unification with mainland China in the scope of his
proposed constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>During the campaign for his re-election, Chen promised that a new
constitution would be written and vetted through a referendum by 2006
and then put into effect in 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu has set a good model for future transit stops by senior
Taiwan leaders in the United States, a spokesman for the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in San Francisco Sunday for a four-day transit stop on
her way back to Taipei after a three-leg diplomatic tour that took
her to El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>During her stay in San Francisco, many influential U.S.
politicians, including House Democratic Party Leader Nancy Pelosi,
telephoned Lu to express their welcome for Lu's visit and
congratulate her on her re-election.</P>
      <P>California Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante also hosted a
reception at California's noted Napa winery in Lu's honor. Many
Californian political figures and social celebrities attended the
reception to welcome Lu.</P>
      <P>The U.S. authorities also unprecedentedly allowed Lu to issue a
public statement mourning the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who
died Saturday at the age of 93.</P>
      <P>Lu visited the University of California at Berkley and Stanford
University Monday. Lu held closed-door meetings with scholars at the
two universities versed in China and Taiwan affairs. They exchanged
views on Taiwan-U.S.-mainland China relations.</P>
      <P>Lu also attended a Taiwan-U.S. high-tech seminar aimed at
attracting U.S. high-tech firms to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu left Taipei May 28 at the head of a large entourage to

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
will improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations and maintain regional
stability with wisdom, patience and perseverance.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a dinner hosted by him in honor of
hundreds of attorneys who volunteered their services in helping
re-count votes cast in the March 20 presidential election in northern
Taiwan constituencies.</P>
      <P>Chen said it's no easy task to break the current cross-strait
impasse. Even though Chen has again extended an olive branch and
softened his tone on Taiwan's constitutional reform plans in his May
20 inauguration address, Beijing has still declined to make any
goodwill response.</P>
      <P>"We know Beijing will not be satisfied unless we yield to its
'one China' and 'one country, two systems' unification terms. But
those conditions are unacceptable to us. Nevertheless, we should not
be daunted by any difficulties or challenges that lie ahead. We must
overcome all obstacles with wisdom, patience and perseverance. We
should make every possible effort to improve cross-strait ties and
maintain peace in the region," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen won re-election by a slim margin. His sole challenger,
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, declined to concede defeat
and has filed two lawsuits to nullify Chen's re-election victory and
even the entire election so that a new one can be held.</P>
      <P>With Chen's consent, all of the 13 million ballots cast in the
bitterly fought election have been retallied. The Taiwan High Court
is expected to mete out a final ruling in six months. No solid
evidence has so far been found in the re-count and a thorough
scrutiny of voter rosters to back up the opposition camp's claims
that the election was rigged has been undertaken.</P>

      <P>The assets and wealth of Taiwan families
have steadily increased over the past 10 years, with the total
swelling to US$809 billion at the end of 2003, according to a report
released Wednesday by the Citibank Group.</P>
      <P>The figure marks a 10-year high and 2.6-fold of the level of
Taiwan's gross domestic product, a Citibank Taiwan executive said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan families still prefer to hold cash and deposits in banks
as their major means of financial management, which account for 54
percent of their wealth, he said, adding that some 16 percent and
15.2 percent of their wealth is invested in stock markets and used
for buying insurance, respectively.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan families spend 10.9 percent of their
economic means to purchase mutual funds, a relatively high ratio as
compared to that in other Asian countries, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan people have increasingly become accustomed to
having professional managers handle their assets and wealth, he
claimed that the 28 percent figure still lags the United States' 54
percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>Financial assets possessed by families in the four Asian "little
dragon" countries have steadily increased by more than 8 percent each
year over the past decade, an executive of the group in charge of
investment affairs in the Asia-Pacific region said.</P>
      <P>Asian families now spend an average 48 percent of their economic
resources in investment, the same level of 10 years ago and a marked
difference compared to the United States' 82 percent, he said, adding

      <P>The Control Yuan, the nation's supreme
watchdog body, decided Wednesday to impeach three former senior staff
members at the Tokyo branch of the state-owned Bank of Taiwan (BOT)
due to the branch's violations of Japanese financial regulations.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan said Lin Hsin-hung, a former manager at the
BOT's Tokyo branch, Peng Meng-hung, a former deputy manager at the
branch, and Wu Hung-teh, a former section chief at the branch should
be held responsible for Japan's slapping of a 350 million yen
(US$3.18 million) fine on the BOT's Tokyo branch late last year.</P>
      <P>According to the Control Yuan impeachment notice, Japanese
financial authorities discovered in May 2003 that the BOT Tokyo
branch had illegally listed non-OBU (official banking units) accounts
as OBU accounts for five years. Worse still, Japanese financial
authorities found that the BOT Tokyo branch had on several occasions
violated Japan's interest income tax regulations for OBU deposits.</P>
      <P>Japanese authorities have since put the BOT Tokyo branch on its

    <HEADLINE>CONDOLENCE BOOK AVAILABLE AT AIT CULTURAL CENTER FOR REAGAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A condolence book will be available at the
American Cultural Center for signing in memory of the late U.S.
President Ronald Reagan, the Taipei office of the American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The center, located at the International Trade Building on
Keelung Road in Taipei, will be open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. June
10 and June 14 for those who wish to sign the condolence book, the
AIT said in a news release.</P>
      <P>The center will be closed Friday, June 11, which the U.S.
government has declared as a national day of mourning, said the AIT,
which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Reagan, 93, died last Saturday at his home in Simi Valley,
California following a 10-year battle with Alzheimer's disease.
According to foreign wire service reports, tens of thousands of
Americans paid non-stop personal tributes Tuesday to the popular,
infectiously optimistic late president, queuing for up to seven hours
for a chance to file past his coffin ahead of a state funeral on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The flood of people overwhelmed staff at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library, which stayed open throughout the night to allow
the snaking lines of admirers to bid farewell to the 1980s "Cold War
Warrior," the reports said, adding that more than 70,000 people were
expected to pass the coffin after the viewing hours were extended by
four hours Tuesday when the line of well-wishers reached a length of
around 1.6 kilometers (one mile).</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT EXPECTS TO NOMINATE 62-68 CANDIDATES FOR LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has
decided to nominate between 62 and 68 candidates for the legislative
elections slated to take place in December, a KMT official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liao Fung-te, head of the KMT's Department of Organization
Development, made the announcement after the proposal was approved
during the weekly meeting of the party's policy-making Central
Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>However, the number does not include those for the constituencies
of Penghu, Hualien, Kinmen and Lienchiang counties, Liao said, adding
that KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng, who is also speaker of the
Legislative Yuan, has instructed party officials to coordinate the
issue with the opposition People First Party (PFP) and the New Party
(NP).</P>
      <P>Once the exact nomination number has been fixed, the KMT will
immediately begin making arrangements for party's primaries that will
be decided by a composite outcome of a public opinion survey, from
July 3-16, and a party member vote July 18.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" has reached consensus to
impose a quota for nominations for the year-end legislative polls in
a joint effort to maintain control of the legislature so as to form
an effective method of checks and balances for the administration led
by President Chen Shui-bian of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The KMT, PFP and NP formed the "pan-blue alliance" to compete
against the "pan-green camp" composed of the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union in the March 20 presidential election, in which KMT
Chairman Lien Chan was defeated by Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen narrowly won the election, which has been described as
"unfair" and "fraudulent" by the opposition due to a series of
incidents, including an abortive election-eve assassination attempt
on Chen that prompted the activation of the so-called "national
security mechanism" by the government that the opposition believes
prevented "tens of thousands of military and police personnel" from
casting their ballots.</P>
      <P>Lien has filed two lawsuits to get a vote recount and a new
election. The recount has been completed and a final verdict by the
Taiwan High Court is due in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WARNING SHOWS NEEDS OF CROSS-STRAIT MILITARY BALANCE: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pentagon's latest warning that mainland
China is likely to launch an attack against Taiwan, probably in 2006,
underlines the crucial importance of seeking military balance across
the Taiwan Strait, a legislator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-liang, a ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) whip at the Legislative Yuan, said the Pentagon warning
has strengthened the imperative of accelerating Taiwan's military
buildup.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged legislators from across the political spectrum to
support the passage of a Cabinet-approved special military budget of
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) for the purchase of advanced
weaponry amid the mounting mainland military threat.</P>
      <P>The draft budget calls for the procurement of eight submarines, a
modified version of the Patriot PAC-III anti-missile system and a
fleet of 12 P3-C anti-submarine aircraft over a 15-year period
starting in 2005. The United States offered to sell the military
hardware to Taiwan in 2001 as part of its most comprehensive arms
package to the island since 1992.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan's National Defense
Committee Wednesday, Vice Minister of National Defense Tsai
Ming-hsien quoted the latest Pentagon report as indicating that the
mainland threat to the Asia-Pacific and Taiwan Strait security has
increased steadily and that the mainland is likely to launch a
small-scale attack or take some military action against Taiwan in the
near future, either in 2006 or 2008.</P>
      <P>As the United States has extensive intelligence concerning the
mainland's military strength, Tsai said, the Pentagon forecast was
based on its evaluation of the mainland's increasing air and naval
superiority over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has formulated
various response measures to cope with new developments.
Nevertheless, he went on, self-defense and establishing an elite
deterrent force remain the MND's top military buildup goals.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S. weekly "DefenseNews, " the U.S. Department
of Defense furnished Congress with a 54-page mainland military
strength evaluation report May 28 that said the mainland's military
modernization is gradually eroding Taiwan's air superiority and other
advantages and that the cross-Taiwan Strait military balance is
steadily tilting in favor of the mainland.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the Pentagon report, DPP Legislator Lee
Wen-chung, one of the members of the legislative National Defense
Committee, said the Pentagon report is a professional assessment from
a purely military rather than political perspective.</P>
      <P>Echoing the report, Lee said the increasing imbalance in combat
power across the Taiwan Strait and the erosion of Taiwan's military
capabilities will ignite a mainland attempt to launch an attack
against Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CUSTOM OFFICIALS SEIZE BETEL NUTS SMUGGLED FROM THAILAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Custom officials reported Wednesday
that they had intercepted 3,775 kg of smuggled betel nuts that
arrived from Thailand at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>Custom officials said that the betel nuts arrived at the airport
disguised as a shipment of cotton fiber Tuesday night on a China
Airlines plane and were sent to a warehouse for re-export.</P>
      <P>The officials said they believe the sender might try to switch
the betel nuts with old electronic pianos at the airport and added
that they were trying to trace the sender, in addition to seizing the
betel nuts.</P>
      <P>They said that as the supply of local betel nuts has been unable
to meet demand recently, smuggling the nuts from Thailand is seen as
a lucrative option.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that betel nuts can be imported legally from
Thailand, but a quota system is in place whereby taxes are small for
a certain amount of betel nuts and much higher -- NT$810 (US$24) per
kilogram -- over this limit.</P>
      <P>It was the second time in a week that customs officials had
seized smuggled betel nuts from Thailand. Customs officials seized
765 kg last Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PITCHES FOR CULTIVATION OF NEW DIPLOMATIC STAFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan Wednesday to pass organic
rules for a new diplomacy research institute as early as possible so
that Taiwan can train more new-style diplomatic personnel.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the inauguration ceremony for a new
building for the Foreign Service Institute under the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Noting that upgrading the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) to a
full-fledged diplomacy research institute was one of his diplomatic
policy initiatives during his first presidential campaign back in
2000, Chen said his administration presented a draft bill on the
organization of the new diplomacy institute to the legislature for
deliberation and approval in March 2001.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the draft bill has yet to clear the
legislative floor, he is still glad to see the completion of the new
FSI building.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, Chen said,
the Republic of China has not absented itself from the global war on
terrorism and nearly all major international humanitarian aid
projects.</P>
      <P>"We must make every possible effort and use innovative thinking
to break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation and play an active
and constructive role in the international arena, " Chen said, adding
that realizing this goal needs the devoted efforts of all of the
nation's diplomatic staff.</P>
      <P>Amid the current wave of globalization, Chen went on, traditional
diplomatic staff who usually majored in political science or
international relations during their college years, need training in
new professional fields because international relations now face many
new complicated problems, such as economics, environmental
protection, public health and immigration.</P>
      <P>"In the future, we need many qualified professionals from diverse
fields to join the diplomatic corps, including promotion of bilateral
or multilateral economic cooperation and international publicity. And
this trend further signifies the importance of manpower training and
the need to upgrade the FSI into a full-fledged diplomacy institute,"
Chen said, adding that he hopes the legislature will pass the draft
organic bill at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen also stressed that diplomatic work should
transcend partisan stances and interests.</P>
      <P>"National interests or the common interests of all of the 23
million Taiwan people should be the only consideration in our
diplomatic work. There is no room for partisan consideration in the
diplomatic domain. We have only one country. All diplomatic staff
should work for our national cause, protect our national sovereign
status, safeguard our national dignity and secure our 'living space'
in the international community," he added.</P>
      <P>The FSI now offers training courses for newly recruited
diplomatic and consular staff. The proposed new diplomacy institute
will even offer advanced study courses for career diplomats and
organize research programs to help with diplomatic policy
formulation.</P>
      <P>Many well-wishers attended the new FSI building inauguration
ceremony, including Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen, Control
Yuan President Fredrick Chien and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan San
Chen, as well as members of the diplomatic corps. Douglas Paal,
director-general of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in
Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties, was also present at the ceremony.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The national coffers took in NT$258.8
billion (US$7.75 billion) worth of tax revenues in May, an increase
of NT$67 billion, or up by 34.9 percent, over the year-earlier level,
a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Income tax revenue rose by NT$53.2 billion last month, posting an
annual growth rate of 70.5 percent compared to other sources of tax,
said Hsu Kuo-chung, head of the MOF's Department of Statistics. He
attributed the expansion to delays in collecting some taxes that
should have been collected last year.</P>
      <P>Corporate tax turnover reached NT$104.5 billion, up by NT$50.4
billion year-on-year, or a 93 percent rise, while composite taxes
totaled NT$24.1 billion, up by NT$2.8 billion, or 13.1 percent, over
the previous year's level.</P>
      <P>In addition, total trading volume on the listed market hit
NT$1.88 trillion in May, translating into a daily average of
NT$89.579 billion and resulting in stock transaction taxes worth NT$
7.1 billion, which is up by NT$3.9 billion over the level of a year
ago and represents a 122.1 percent growth.</P>
      <P>In the January-May period, the national coffers collected taxes
amounting to NT$644.2 billion, a jump of NT$137.9 billion over the
2003 level, or a 27.2 percent expansion. The nation's tax income for
the first five months accounted for 48.3 percent of the government's
annual target for 2004, an improvement from last year's 36.9 percent,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TOBACCO, LIQUOR CORP. CRITICIZED FOR IMPROPER EXPENDITURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) claimed Wednesday that the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp.
(TTLC) incurs improper expenditure of NT$1.2 billion (US$35.82
million) annually.</P>
      <P>Legislator Apollo Chen held a press conference at the legislative
Yuan together with representatives of the TTLC's labor union in which
they urged the company to stop the practice of purchasing tobacco
leaves improperly.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau --
the predecessor of the TTLC -- after scrapping its monopoly system in
anticipation of the the nation's entry into the World Trade
Organization in 2002, terminated its contracts with tobacco growers
by compensating them to the tune of NT$1.05 million (US$31,343) per
hectare.</P>
      <P>The company also commissioned the Council of Agriculture to help
the tobacco growers plant other crops.</P>
      <P>The union alleged that some of the tobacco growers, after
receiving compensation, have continued to grow tobacco and have
pressured the company through elected officials to purchase their
crops.</P>
      <P>This has caused the company to spend NT$900 million on purchasing
the tobacco leaves and between NT$300 million and NT$400 million in
processing them. In total, the improper spending is NT$1.2 billion
annually, which they said has resulted in an imbalance in supply and
demand, with tobacco sold cheaply or left to rot.</P>
      <P>The union alleged that there are still over 20 million kilograms
of tobacco leaves with a market value of NT$7 billion stockpiled in
the company's warehouses, which they claimed will not be used up for
five years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 100,000 PERSONAL BANK CODES FEARED TO HAVE BEEN HACKED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 100,000 personal secret codes of
Internet banking clients in Taiwan are feared to have been stolen by
hackers from across the Taiwan Strait, leaving the Taiwan public in
panic.</P>
      <P>Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) officials said Wednesday that
a Taiwan man surnamed Chen had been arrested in Hualien City, eastern
Taiwan, together with a haul of confidential data, including 45
million bank account numbers and corresponding personal secret codes.</P>
      <P>CIB officials urged the public to change their bank codes
immediately to avoid losing their money.</P>
      <P>CIB investigators found that Chen, 30, has been collaborating
with hackers from mainland China since February this year to steal
Internet bank codes by planting "shell" or "revised" versions of
"Trojan horse" programs into the computer systems of Taiwan's bank
institutions that operate Internet banking services.</P>
      <P>Using these "shell" versions -- which were provided by the
mainland hackers -- Chen managed to gain access to the banking
systems as well as many other organizations, even those with

according to CIB investigators, who added that the bank accounts

      <P>The investigators quoted Chen as confessing that after the ring
obtained the bank account numbers and codes, the hackers transferred
the money to figurehead bank accounts in Taiwan and then drew the
cash from mainland ATMs.</P>
      <P>Describing this type of Internet crime as "secretive, shapeless,
borderless, anonymous and without restrictions of distance, " CIB
officials said that the fallout of the latest cross-strait hacking
operation has yet to be revealed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON REPORT DOES NOT SUGGEST THREE GORGES DAM TARGETED: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Tsai Ming-hsien said
Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Defense has never suggested
that Taiwan should aim missiles at mainland China's Three Gorges dam
as a way to deter any possible mainland invasion.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Defense Committee, where opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator
Chiang Chi-wen asked about Tsai's view on a U.S. media report that
the Pentagon has suggested that Taiwan consider aiming missiles at
certain large mainland infrastructure projects, such as the Three
Gorges dam, with a view to deterring any possible mainland attack.</P>
      <P>The U.S. weekly "DefenseNews" reported in its latest issue that
the Pentagon furnished Congress with a 54-page mainland military
strength evaluation report May 28 that said the mainland's military
modernization is gradually eroding Taiwan's air superiority and other
advantages and that the cross-Taiwan Strait military balance is
steadily tilting in favor of the mainland. Against this backdrop, the
weekly said, the Pentagon came up with the "targeting the Three
Gorges dam" proposal.</P>
      <P>Tsai told lawmakers that the U.S. weekly report is incorrect and
that the Pentagon report made no such suggestion.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the Pentagon report mentioned that the
mainland threat to the Asia-Pacific and Taiwan Strait security has
increased steadily and that the mainland is likely to launch a
small-scale attack or take some military action against Taiwan in the
near future, either in 2006 or 2008.</P>
      <P>As the United States has extensive intelligence concerning the
mainland's military strength, Tsai said, the Pentagon forecast was
based on its evaluation of the mainland's increasing air and naval
superiority over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has formulated
various response measures to cope with new developments.
Nevertheless, he went on, self-defense and establishing an elite
deterrent force remain the MND's top military build-up goals.</P>
      <P>"We'll never take any action to provoke China. We'll adopt
appropriate countermeasures only after China launches the first
strike against Taiwan," Tsai said, adding that Taiwan's armed forces
will launch counterattacks primarily on mainland military facilities
or the base from where a first strike against Taiwan is launched. In
any event, Tsai said, the Three Gorges dam is not Taiwan's target.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has approved a special military budget of NT$610.8
billion (US$18.2 billion) for the purchase of advanced weaponry amid
the mounting mainland military threat.</P>
      <P>The draft budget calls for the procurement of eight submarines, a
modified version of the Patriot PAC-III anti-missile system and a
fleet of 12 P3-C anti-submarine aircraft over a 15-year period
starting in 2005. The United States offered to sell the military
hardware to Taiwan in 2001 as part of its most comprehensive arms
package to the island since 1992.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tan San Chen said earlier in the day he
thinks the large military procurement plan can to some extent serve
as a bargaining chip or diplomatic clout for Taiwan in promoting
substantive relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>Tsai's comments on the Pentagon report drew mixed reactions from
legislators of different political stripes. While ruling Democratic
Progressive Party lawmakers said legislators from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP)
should support the special arms procurement budget plan in view of
ever-mounting mainland military threat, opposition lawmakers said
they doubt the correctness of the Pentagon prediction of a
"small-scale mainland attack on Taiwan" in 2006 or 2008.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chin Hui-chu said she believes that so long as
President Chen Shui-bian does not push for the enactment of a new
constitution for Taiwan or take other pro-independence moves, Beijing
is not likely to attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chiang Chi-wen said if the Pentagon assessment is
correct, Taiwan should study the feasibility of pruchasing some
offensive weapons from the United States in order to more
effectively protect its security.</P>
      <P>Chiang's colleague, Lu Hsiu-yen, said the MND should not quote
the Pentagon report to intimidate the people of Taiwan and to
force the legislature to approve the huge arms procurement budget
plan. In her view, it's already too late for Taiwan to propose this
15-year arms procurement plan should the Pentagon prediction is truly
correct.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE POSTPONES SCREENING OF ARTIFICIAL REPRODUCTION BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators decided Wednesday to postpone
the screening of a draft bill on artificial reproduction after
failing to reach any sort of consensus.</P>
      <P>Members from the Legislative Yuan Committee of Health,
Environment and Social Welfare remained divided mainly over the fact
that the draft bill -- authored by Legislator Lai Ching-teh from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and independent Legislator
Chiu Chuang-liang -- lacks a corresponding version from the Executive
Yuan as an administrative support.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung was the most vocal opponent,
arguing that the Legislative Yuan should not go ahead with the bill
without an Executive Yuan version as a support.</P>
      <P>Shen, who claims to be the first lawmaker to initiate legislation
on the issue of surrogate motherhood, said there must be reasons why
the Department of Health has delayed in producing an Executive Yuan
version of the bill dealing with artificial reproduction and related
matters.</P>
      <P>Shen added that if the Department of Health has doubts about the
bill, then the Legislative Yuan should by no means go forward on its
own by passing the bill.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Legislative Yuan's decision to postpone
screening of the bill, Health Minister Chen Chien-jen said that
considering the strong need for legislation on artificial
reproduction and related technologies, the Department of Health has
been working to delink artificial reproduction from surrogate
motherhood and considering to complete an artificial reproduction
draft bill first.</P>
      <P>On the controversial issue of surrogate motherhood, Chen said a
government policy will not be formulated until after National Taiwan
University studies the matter and holds meetings to arrive at some
sort of public consensus on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT RETURNS HOME AFTER FRUITFUL TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu returned to
Taiwan Thursday morning after a 14-day official visit to Republic
China allies in Central America that included transit stops in the
United States on her way to and from the region.</P>
      <P>Lu, in a brief statement delivered at CKS International Airport
upon her arrival, said that she was accorded the highest level of
respect and dignified treatment by all the countries she visited
regardless of the presence or absence of official diplomatic ties with
the ROC.</P>
      <P>During her trip which she termed "fruitful, " the vice president
attended the inauguration of Salvadoran President Elias Antonio Saca
on behalf of ROC President Chen Shui-bian, and then visited Costa
Rica and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she received an honorary doctoral degree from the
University of San Carolos in Guatemala and was awarded a human rights
medal in Costa Rica, adding that she received a human rights award
presented by U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) , co-chairman of the
Congressional Human Rights Caucus, during her stopover in San
Francisco on her way back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"All this shows that the concerted efforts of the Taiwan people
have helped build up the nation's reputation and have won it high
recognition from the international community," she said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that although the post-election situation in Taiwan
may have left some people feeling uncertain about the future of the
nation, Lu said she was "deeply touched" to see the recognition and
love shown toward Taiwan by its allies abroad.</P>
      <P>The vice president also mentioned that the United States treated
her based on the principles of "dignity, safety, convenience and
comfort" during her transit stops in Las Vegas and San Francisco. Lu
said this made her realize that bilateral relations between the two
countries, which she said were strained prior to the March 20
presidential election because of President Chen's insistence on
holding a referendum and his advocacy of writing a new constitution
for Taiwan and putting it to a referendum by 2006, are now in a good
state.</P>
      <P>Lu also spoke about her visit to the sites where the U.N. Charter
and the San Francisco Peace Treaty were signed, adding that the
Fairmont Hotel where she stayed while in San Francisco raised the
flags of both the United States and the Republic of China, which she
said signified that relations between the two countries will flourish
based on the common belief in the universal values of democracy,
freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>Those greeting Lu at CKS Airport included Presidential Office
Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang, Democratic Progressive Party
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung and Foreign Affairs Minister Tan
Sun Chen. Also present were Burkina Faso Ambassador to the ROC
Jacques Sawadogo who concurrently serves as the head of the
diplomatic corps in the ROC, Costa Rican Ambassador Oscar Alvarez
Araya and Guatemalan Ambassador Manuel Ernesto Galvez.</P>
      <P>The vice president, who led a 50-odd entourage on the trip which
kicked off May 28, also said that normalizing cross-strait relations
is crucial.</P>
      <P>She will speak about her trip and her thoughts about cross-strait
relations in a press conference Friday.</P>

      <P>With one day to go before the recess of the
Legislative Yuan Friday, there are still around 30 bills awaiting
debate, only a few of which seem likely to be passed on the last day

Friday.</P>
      <P>However, another bill, which stipulates the fundamental organic
principles of central government, is surrounded by uncertainty, as
the Executive Yuan will not agree with the opposition's demand to

lawyers to see if it is possible to claim damages against the U.S.
government.</P>
      <P>Lai Hsiu-luang claimed that she lost more than NT$20 million
(US$599,975) because her fishing ship, the Kuaile No. 366, was
impounded by U.S. law enforcement officials in San Francisco from
October 2002 to April 2004.</P>
      <P>The losses included NT$900,000 in legal fees during the
investigation of the ship, NT$4 million for fuel and supplies during
the 20 months and NT$16 million in loss of fishing income.</P>
      <P>If it is possible to win a damages claim, Lai said she will not
rule out a lawsuit against the United States government.</P>
      <P>The Kuaile No. 366 was commandeered by its 10 mainland Chinese
crew, who overpowered the ship's Taiwanese captain and first
engineer, sailed it into waters near San Francisco and sneaked into
the United States.</P>
      <P>The ship was then detained by U.S. law enforcement officials
under suspicion of carrying Chinese illegal immigrants into the
United States.</P>
      <P>U.S. prosecutors determined not to indict the captain and first
engineer in March, 2004 and released the ship in April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU URGES GOVERNMENT TO HALT MAINLAND INVESTMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
Chairman Huang Chu-wen urged the government Thursday to halt its
investment policy toward mainland China amid the increasing political
intimidation from Beijing of Taiwanese doing business there.</P>
      <P>Huang made the suggestion at a banquet hosted by President Chen
Shui-bian at the Presidential Office in honor of TSU lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the TSU firmly opposes the proposal of "bold
westward march" (toward the mainland) and he suggested that Chen
readjust his mainland policy of "active opening, efficient
management" as a protest against Beijing's intimidation.</P>
      <P>Huang's suggestion came after the mainland authorities began to
impose stringent policies toward investment from Taiwanese
businessmen who Beijing believes are pro-ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and thus supporters of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Beijing has never hidden the fact that it does not welcome
pro-DPP Taiwanese businessmen with investments on the mainland,
accusing them of using profits gained on the mainland to finance the
independence movement in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Beijing authorities, through its official
mouthpiece -- the People's Daily -- named some of these businessmen,
among them Hsu Wen-lung, founder of the well-known Chi Mei Group.</P>
      <P>According to mainland newspapers, a Chi Mei plant on the mainland
was denied loans from local banks and its investment project in
Zhejiang Province was halted by China's State Council, although Chi
Mei denied this.</P>
      <P>Other DPP supporters with investments on the mainland also
claimed that they were victims of "political interference" from the
mainland authorities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A planned move by the Japan-based Sharp
Corp. against the Taiwan-based TECO Electric &amp; Machinery Co., Ltd. is
viewed here as a business tactic arising from fierce competition, a
government official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-i, director-general of the Industrial Development
Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the comment after
a Japanese daily reported that Sharp is planning to file a lawsuit
against TECO, which is accused by the Japanese home appliance maker
of having infringed upon its intellectual property rights by using
TFF-LCDs made by Taiwan-based AU Optronics (AUO) Corp.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, bureau officials have contacted the AUO
authorities over the issue and have suggested that Sharp's planned
court action might just be a business tactic aimed at blocking the
fast-growing AUO.</P>
      <P>Chen urged Sharp not to seek to put on pressure on its Taiwan
competitor through such indirect means, as it will strip Japanese
consumers of their right to use cheaper and fine-quality Taiwan-made
products.</P>
      <P>Four years ago, Sharp lodged lawsuits in Taiwan, Japan and the
United States against various Taiwan-based TFT-LCD makers, including
AUO, demanding that they pay royalties for infringing upon its
technology.</P>

      <P>The 2004 Austronesian Cultural Festival
will begin Aug. 1 in Taitung, eastern Taiwan, Taitung county
government officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taitung County Magistrate Hsu Ching-yuan noted that the
organization of Taitung's Austronesian Cultural Festival has been so
successful in previous years that the Ministry of Transportations and
Communications has designated it as one of Taiwan's 12 major folk
festivals.</P>
      <P>This year's festival will be held in conjunction with the harvest
rituals of various aboriginal tribes in the Taitung area, focusing on
the myths of indigenous people.</P>
      <P>The Austronesian race consists of people who speak what linguists
call Austronesian languages, whose family reaches from the island of
Madagascar off the east coast of Africa to tiny, isolated Easter
Island off the west coast of South America, and extending to Taiwan,
Vietnam, Northern Australia, New Zealand and most of the Melanesian

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES LEGISLATIVE BACKING FOR MILITARY PROCUREMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian asked Thursday for
legislative support for a major military procurement program put
forward by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) for the sake of the
country's long-term defense capabilities, according to lawmakers of
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>TSU lawmakers made the revelation following an informal gathering
with Chen in which TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen, ranking officials of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) such as DPP
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung and his deputy, Lee Ying-yuan, as
well as Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Su Tseng-chang,
also took part.</P>
      <P>Chen was cited as pointing to the planned purchase of submarines
-- the most disputed item on the MND's procurement list -- as an
example by calling on the legislature to approve the ministry's
budget allocations as soon as possible on the grounds that the
administration of U.S. President George W. Bush has been friendly in
agreeing to provide the procurement opportunity to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the procurement of the eight diesel-fueled submarines has been
procrastinated over for three years since the Bush Administration
gave its permission for the sale, the Legislative Yuan should give a
green light as quickly as possible as part of the government's
efforts to display its resolve to safeguard Taiwan, the president was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is still unable to build submarines on its own, the
government remains firm on its decision to buy them from the United
States, Chen said, according to the TSU lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to urge the legislature to cooperate in giving its
nod quickly now that the issue also has gained some public support,
they said.</P>
      <P>Chen also stressed that the price asked by the United States can
be discussed, but he added that the budget appropriations must be
approved in time so as to secure U.S. willingness to construct the
vessels for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president gave its assurances that the MND's military buildup
program spanning the next 15 years will not cause a financial burden
on the government and he expressed his hope that the budget
allocations will clear the legislature as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The MND called a news conference last Friday to detail their
budget allocations worth NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) for the
program in conjunction with the United States amid grave public
concern over the huge spending amount.</P>
      <P>Top navy brass said that they are intent on purchasing eight
conventional submarines and 12 P-3C anti-submarine planes, while
their army counterparts said that they project to acquire six
batteries of Patriotic PAC-3 missiles and relevant facilities.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian hosted a luncheon
Thursday in honor of senior executives and lawmakers of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>The TSU, which advocates a separate Taiwan identity and respects
former President Lee Teng-hui as its spiritual leader, controls 12
seats in the Legislative Yuan. It is usually seen as an ally of the
Chen's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen and Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia
led the party's 12 lawmakers to attend the luncheon at the
Presidential Office. Su Tzen-chang, President Chen's chief of staff,
DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung and Deputy Secretary-General
Lee Ying-yuan were also present at the occasion.</P>
      <P>During the luncheon, Chen first thanked the TSU executives and
lawmakers for their support for hie re-election bid. He then asked
the TSU legislative caucus to support the Cabinet-proposed NT$610.8
billion (US$18.2 billion) budget bill for procurement of advanced
weapons from the United States amid mounting mainland Chinese
military threats.</P>
      <P>The draft budget bill calls for the procurement of eight
submarines, a modified version of the Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
system and a squadron of 12 P3-C anti-submarine aircraft over a
15-year period starting in 2005. The United States offered to sell
the military hardware to Taiwan in 2001 as part of its most
comprehensive arms package to the island since 1992.</P>
      <P>The special budget bill is now pending approval of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance"-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislators Ho Min-hao quoted Chen as having said during
the luncheon that three years have passed since the Bush
administration agreed to sell those weapons to Taiwan. As the United
States will hold a presidential election in November, Chen said if
President George W. Bush fails to win re-election, the U.S. arms
sale plans may become uncertain. Against this backdrop, Chen said, he
hopes the legislature can pass the budget bill as early as
possible so that the Ministry of National Defense can strike deals
with the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen told TSU lawmakers that there is room for price
negotiations for the eight submarines if Taiwan doesn't insist
on U.S. technology transfer for Taiwan's state-own China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) to take part in construction of the eight
submarines.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the insistence on CSBC participation in
submarine construction will increase cost by NT$80 billion. Chen
further said Taiwan took the initiative to purchase the submarines in
the face of mainland China's mounting military threat. The United
States has never pressured Taiwan to buy submarines, Chen was quoted
as saying.</P>
      <P>Chen also assured TSU lawmakers that the 15-year arms procurement
plan will not result in the government's financial straits.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan fishing ship returned to Suao,
Ilan, in eastern Taiwan Thursday after being detained in the United
States for 20 months because the captain was accused of smuggling
mainland Chinese fishermen into the U.S.</P>
      <P>Chen Lai-fa and Lin Tsung-hsien, captain and chief
engineer of the Suao-registered ship, "kuaile" (Happy) No. 366, were
happily reunited with their family members upon their return.</P>
      <P>In line with Taiwanese tradition, officials from Suao Fishermen's
Association prepared pork feet rice noodles for the two to remove
all the bad luck because of the incident.</P>
      <P>Recalling the incident, Captain Chen said that the 10 mainland
Chinese fishermen first united to have a strike and then put him in
the cabin of the ship. Lin was compelled by the mainland fishermen to
follow their order to sail toward waters near San Francisco before
they snuck into the U.S.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he was ready to admit his bad luck and sail the
ship back, but the U.S. considered him guilty of smuggling in
mainland Chinese fishermen because of past occurrences involving
Taiwan fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Convinced that he was not guilty, he said he accepted the
U.S. investigation, but never thought he would have to stay in the
U.S. for 20 months.</P>
      <P>During his detainment, he said that he was unfairly treated and
subjected to high suspicion by U.S. prosecutors. Thanks to
the assistance of the government, he was able to return safely home.
The "kuaile" No. 366 sailed out from Nanfangao, Ilan, on Aug. 16,
2002 with the 10 mainland fishermen aboard to operate in the east
Pacific and Captain Chen had contacted his family daily. On Oct. 9,
2002, Chen told another Taiwan fishing boat operating in the same
Mexico sea that mainland fishermen were striking and afterwards the
ship lost contact.
The Taiwan government learned from a Keeling-registered fishing
boat that the "kuaile" No. 366 had been commandeered by mainland
Chinese fishermen in waters near San Francisco, and that the fishermen
later used life rafts to sneak off the boat. Chen later broke out
of his bindings and repaired the radio to call for help.</P>
      <P>Chen followed instruction to sail into San Francisco harbor, but
was detained by U.S. prosecutors and his ship was impounded for
assisting in the mainland fishermen smuggling operation.</P>
      <P>Chen and his first engineer were released after U.S. prosecutors
announced that they would forfeit prosecution in March 2004, but they
were arrested again by the U.S. immigration and naturalization
authorities for illegal entry and turned over to the immigration
court, which overturned the charges in April and returned them to
the ship.</P>

      <P>The output value of Taiwan's IC industry,
including the IC design and manufacturing sectors, is estimated to
grow to NT$496.4 billion (US$14.9 billion) in the first half of 2004,
a spokesman for the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wu-tung, a senior researcher and manager at the ITRI's
Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center, said the figure will
represent a 39 percent growth over the year-earlier level amid an
encouraging economic revival around the world.</P>
      <P>Chen made the forecast based on the fact that the domestic
industry's first-quarter output value hit NT$240.2 billion, a 42.4
percent expansion year-on-year.</P>
      <P>He warned that rising oil prices and the threat of terrorist
attacks will remain as big a factor affecting the world's economic
development and thus the industry, but pointed out that many Taiwan
companies in the industry still hold an optimistic view about the
overall outlook.</P>
      <P>In terms of the IC design sector, output value in the first
six-month period will reach NT$122.1 billion, up by 46.5 percent from
a year ago, while in terms of the IC manufacturing sector, output
value will hit NT$282.5 billion for the first six-month period,
marking an annual growth rate of 37.8 percent. IC foundries are
expected to contribute NT$182.7 billion to that value, a 32.2 percent
increase.</P>
      <P>The packaging and testing sector will also see growth of 28.8
percent and 45 percent, respectively, in their first-half production
value, which will amount to NT$67.1 billion and NT$24.7 billion,

      <P>The agroeconomist-turned-politician noted that Taiwan identity
and agricultural problems have been important issues in his life but
that given the pressing issues in the past of the lifting of martial
law, the creation and legalization of political parties and bringing
more openness to the media, he had not paid as much attention to
agricultural issues as he would have liked.</P>
      <P>However, he said that he was now happy to see that since
President Chen Shui-bian assumed office, the government has attached
great importance to the lives of farmers.</P>
      <P>Chen's administration earmarked NT$100 billion (US$2.98 billion)
for the agriculture sector to soften the impact of Taiwan's entry
into the World Trade Organization in 2002.</P>
      <P>The former president was particularly dismayed that the public
only understood the width and breadth of the agriculture sector by
looking at its contribution to the nation's gross national product
(GNP). This view of the sector as nothing more than two percentage
has lead the people to feel that it is an unimportant aspect of
society.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the production value of the agriculture sector
should include tourism, leisure farms, and fishery and agricultural
product processing, saying that if all these were added together, the
production value of the agriculture sector would reach about 10
percent of the nation's GNP.</P>
      <P>On how to develop agriculture and build up the countryside, Lee
said that sound grassroots agricultural financial institutions are
crucial.</P>
      <P>He said that he was gratified to see the agriculture finance law
finally pass the legislature, but he also said that only with a
large-scale bank exclusively serving farmers will there be healthy
development of the agricultural financial system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON CONSON BRINGS NO RELIEF TO PARCHED SOUTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Conson failed to bring rain for
much of the parched south of Taiwan as was expected, as the typhoon
slowly veered away from the island a day earlier, officials said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Yueh-hsi, general-secretary of the Water Resources Agency
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that he was pinning his
hopes on Typhoon Conson to bring precipitation to the southern Tainan
and Chiayi regions, but since the typhoon did not make landfall on
the west coast as had been forecast by the Central Weather Bureau,
reservoirs were barely affected.</P>
      <P>Taking the Tsengwen Reservoir in Tainan County as an example, Wu
said, "Conson hardly produced any rainfall in the region, leaving
prime reservoirs in the area still facing serious water shortages."</P>
      <P>The Tsengwen Reservoir and the nearby Wushantou Reservoir
currently hold a combined 45 million tons of water, while the Nanhua
Reservoir holds some 47 million tons.</P>
      <P>The total amount of some 92 million tons of water is expected to
supply normal civic and industrial use for two more months, Wu said,
but pointed out that water for irrigating rice paddies in the region
will be insufficient.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the planned irrigation for the second crop of
about 18,000 hectares of farmland on the Chianan Plain -- Taiwan's
leading granary -- will need approximately 300 million tons of water.</P>
      <P>For the time being, the Chianan Irrigation Association has
divided the farmland under its charge into eight groups, and
irrigation will be carried out alternately pending future rainfall,
he noted.</P>
      <P>In the past, the amount of rainfall in June in the catchment area
of the Tsengwen Reservoir averaged 500 millimeters. It rained 800
millimeters in June last year.</P>
      <P>Different regions in Taiwan have in recent years been troubled by
water shortages as a result of a steep decrease in rainfall.</P>
      <P>In 2002 and 2003, Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu in the north were
hit hard by an acute dry spell, forcing a national anti-drought task
force to impose water conservation measures on local residents.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian Commerce and Industry Office
(ACIO) in Taipei completed the refurbishment Thursday of its office
and will upgrade its visa services due to the increasing number of
Taiwanese tourists and students visiting Australia.</P>
      <P>The ACIO issued some 76,000 visas for Taiwan people last year,

applied for Australian visas, an increase of 33 percent over the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>Expecting a flood of visa applications this summer, the ACIO will
now offer more convenient visa services, which will allow applicants
to collect information or apply for visas via the Internet.</P>

      <P>Chen Chun, section chief in charge of visa services of the ACIO,
noted that they are planning to issue "e-visas" within 24 hours in
collaboration with 46 local tourist agencies, and allow students who
have already obtained entrance permits to get their visas through the
Internet.</P>

parents wishing to accompany their children under 18 to study in
Australia, and are studying issuing visas for young part-timer

imprisonment or a minimum penalty of five-years imprisonment;

chief of the Kuomintang's (KMT) Business Management Committee between
1993 and 2000, which made him the virtual treasurer of the party and

    <HEADLINE>TWO SIDES OF TAIWAN STRAIT SHOULD ESTABLISH MUTUAL MILITARY TRUST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
establish a mechanism of mutual military trust, Taiwan's top mainland
policy planner said Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that keeping the peace in the Taiwan Strait is a common
responsibility for both sides, Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council, said that it is necessary to establish a mechanism
for mutual military trust between them, which he said is part of
President Chen Shui-bian's proposal for establishing a stable
framework of peaceful cross-strait interactions.</P>
      <P>Wu said that his council will actively promote the realization of
this goal in the coming years, including informing each other in
advance about military drills, not designing military exercises with
the two sides as virtual targets, avoiding the possibility of
launching a first strike via military drills and setting up a
military hotline between the two sides.</P>
      <P>It is a given that the two sides inform each other in advance of
their military exercises, Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>Referring to how to make a breakthrough in the current
cross-strait stalemate, Wu said that Taiwan will make goodwill
gestures in an active manner to improve cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>He also call on Beijing not to inject political matters into
trade and economic exchanges between the two sides, or the opening of
direct cross-strait trade, postal services and transportation links.</P>
      <P>The opening of the so-called direct "three links" is an
established policy of Taiwan, Wu added.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bill providing for the basic framework of
the Central Government was passed by the Legislative Yuan Friday,
although the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) vowed to
revoke a provision inserted into the bill by opposition parties that
gives the legislature the power to approve the appointment of heads
of five independent agencies.</P>
      <P>The Basic Organic Law for the Central Government, passed on the
last day of the current legislative session, stipulates that the
Executive Yuan should have no more than 13 ministries, four
commissions and five independent agencies.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan, which now has eight ministries and 27
councils, commissions and administrations should come up with a
organic law in line with the new legislation within three months.</P>
      <P>The ministries, councils and independent agencies under the
Executive Yuan, if reorganized, should come up with their individual
organic laws one year after the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan is
revised and promulgated.</P>
      <P>The chiefs and deputy chiefs of the five independent agencies,
namely Taiwan's Central Bank of China, the Central Election
Commission, the Fair Trade Commission, and the two proposed
commissions of financial supervision and communications should be
named by the premier and approved by the Legislative Yuan, according
to a provision railroaded through by the two major opposition parties
of the Kuomintang and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>The premier's nominees should first be reviewed by relevant
committees in the Legislative Yuan before being referring to the
whole floor for a vote, according to a resolution of the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As the provision was not contemplated by the Executive Yuan, the
ruling DPP condemned it as an infringement on the power of the
executive branch and claimed it is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers said their party will do whatever it can to
strike this provision.</P>

out at Thaksin.

Thailand's rare soccer talent Kiattisak "Zico" Senamuang yesterday
became a rare political commodity too - a man who dares to stand up to
Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

Having led the national team in its humiliating 4-1 defeat by North
Korea in a World Cup qualifier in Bangkok on Wednesday night, and perhaps
bitter over the Liverpool episode, Kiattiasak exploded following the prime

    <HEADLINE>RTC FUND GETS LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL FOR ONE-YEAR EXTENSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) fund
was granted final approval Friday by the Legislative Yuan for a
one-year extension after lengthy negotiations amid the government's
intensive financial reform efforts.</P>
      <P>Under the original regulations, the RTC fund was to expire on
July 10 this year. The one-year extension, proposed by the Ministry
of Finance (MOF), will provide a platform for legislators to conduct
a comprehensive revision of the law before Oct. 19 -- a deadline
agreed upon by legislators of various political parties.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed upon that non-deposit debts of the poorly
managed banking and financial institutes that are under government
supervision before Jan. 15, 2005 will be fully secured with the
fund's extension should relevant rules be revised to that end before
the deadline.</P>
      <P>An additional resolution was also attached to the slated law
overhaul on the same day, the last working day of the current
legislative session, which requires the fund to clearly stipulate
that 20 percent of its amount will be used to cover losses and
repayments of the debt-ridden farmers and fishermen's associations --
Taiwan's grassroots financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Upon learning the news, Chang Ming-tao, director of the MOF's
Bureau of Monetary Affairs, thanked the Legislative Yuan's for its
cooperation, as he called the fund a vital element to the success of
the government's financial reform drive.</P>
      <P>The RTC fund was set up in June 2001 by the MOF under legislative
permission to help government financial reform efforts by granting
bailout packages to poorly-operated monetary institutions due to
bankruptcies, closures, mergers and consolidations.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan originally planed to raise only NT$ 40 billion
(US$1.19 billion) by imposing a 2 percent tax on business revenues of
monetary institutions during the period between 2001 and 2004, but it
proposed last year to boost the scale of the fund to NT$1.05 trillion
through the issuance of public bonds and extending its four-year
lifespan indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Reforming country's farmers and fishermen's associations are a
major task high on the government's agenda since President Chen
Shui-bian came to power in 2000.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
he hopes to visit Paraguay soon and sign a free trade agreement with
the South American country.</P>
      <P>Chen revealed his intention in a telephone call to Paraguayan
President Nicanor Duarte Frutos, in which he expressed gratitude to
Duarte for his attendance at Chen's second inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>According to a news release from the Presidential Office,
President Duarte said he was moved by the hospitality that the
Republic of China offered to him during his Taipei trip.</P>
      <P>Duarte stressed that the friendship between the ROC and Paraguay
is based on the same ideals and it will never be affected by
"economic manipulation" of Beijing authorities, refuting as untrue
some news reports that member countries of the South Common Market
(MERCOSUR) in South America have been lobbied by Beijing to pressure
Paraguay, a MERCOSUR member, to switch diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing, as this trade block hopes to sign a free trade
agreement with China.</P>
      <P>Other MERCOSUR members include Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay,
and Paraguay is the only member that maintains diplomatic ties with
the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that China has been using economic affairs to
undermine ROC-Paraguayan ties; however, Duarte's firm support of the
ROC moved him greatly, which also reflects the cordial relations
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Duarte also expressed hope that President Chen can visit Paraguay
soon to conclude a free trade agreement between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen told Duarte that he has instructed related agencies to
promote the signing of a free trade agreement with Paraguay, the only
diplomatic ally of the ROC in South America.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chen also telephoned Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso and thanked her for coming to his inauguration.</P>
      <P>After telephoning Moscoso and Duarte, Chen completed his
telephone thanks to all 15 foreign heads of states who visited Taiwan

      <P>It apparently took a gentle nudge from
President Chen Shui-bian to force Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Lin Chung-mou to backtrack Friday from his pledge to never
apologize for calling the chief of the American Institute in Taiwan a
" vicious dog."</P>
      <P>Lin said at a news conference that he was sorry for causing any
misunderstandings on the part of the United States by his rude
behavior, and in the interest of Taiwan and relations with the U.S.,
he apologized to Douglas Paal, director-general of the American
Institute in Taiwan's Taipei office, the de-facto U.S. ambassador to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin who is known for often using offensive language, scolded Paal
in the Legislative Yuan for what he claimed was his pushing Taiwan to
conclude an arms purchase contract with the U.S. that carried a
price tag of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion).</P>
      <P>Lin said he would not support the Executive Yuan's request for a
special budget to finance the deal "unless Washington withdrew Paal
first."</P>
      <P>Thursday, Lin said he would never apologize to Paal, but
apparently the matter caught the attention of President Chen
Shui-bian,</P>
      <P>Lin then said that he would hold a news conference Friday to
request that Washington recall Paal if the United States still wants
to sell arms to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The news conference was postponed for half an hour and was
changed to a new revenue at the Legislative Yuan. Lin finally showed
up with three DPP leaders at the Legislative Yuan in tow: Ker
Chien-ming, Tsai Huang-liang and Trong Chai and, to the surprise of
the media present, he apologized to Paal, although reluctantly.</P>
      <P>He left the news conference without answering journalists'

      <P>Electricity prices will remain stable for

global costs for coal, oil and natural gas, Taiwan Power Co.
(Taipower) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taipower President C. C. Lin noted that prices for coal, oil and
natural gas are increasing in international markets, with the current
price for coal being 130 percent higher than last year.</P>
      <P>Although Taipower purchased coal in advance last year, reducing
slightly the electricity generation cost for the company, it is
expected to spend NT$24.87 billion (US$742 million) on oil and
NT$34.08 billion for natural gas this year, far more than was
budgeted. The budgets were NT$18.68 billion for oil and NT$31.41
billion for natural gas.</P>
      <P>Lin added that Taipower will discuss the matter with the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and other agencies, taking into account the
reaction of the industrial sector and the public so that a consensus
on electricity prices can be reached.</P>
      <P>After that, Taipower will present the results to the Executive
Yuan for approval. Lin stressed that although he knows that his

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Economic Processing Zone
Administration (EPZA) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been
going all out to entice foreign investors by improving conditions in
nationwide economic processing zones (EPZs) , an administration
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>In line with an economics ministry drive to court potential
investors from India and countries in Southeast Asia late this month,
the official said that EPZs across Taiwan have been working on
upgrading their facilities and services to welcome new investors,
both foreign and overseas Chinese companies, and assist present
EPZ-based small and traditional businesses to seek industrial
upgrades.</P>
      <P>As personnel from Paraguay, Uruguay, Vietnam and mainland China
have recently concluded courses in learning Taiwan's EPZ operations
and management, future cooperation with those countries are in sight
to explore the world market jointly, he said.</P>
      <P>Once foreign-headquartered companies open plants in Taiwan's
EPZs, they will have effective access to logistics, capital and
information flows for their business expansion across the world,
benefits that they can use for technology transfers and value-added
processing for re-shipments.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's EPZs are also suitable for foreign-based Taiwan
companies to run their research and operations hubs, as the EPZA has
launched preparations to build adequate facilities for that purpose,
he said, adding that they can also set up distribution centers here
by taking advantage of Taiwan's location and high-quality manpower.</P>
      <P>Currently, a majority of companies operating in Taiwan's EPZs are
small- an medium-sized businesses of traditional industries, which
once were the major driving force behind the country's rapid economic
development in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>In recent years, those EPZs have sought to play a greater role in
the present knowledge-based era by attracting hi-tech businesses to
open plants in their complexes.</P>

      <P>The new terminal at the Hualien Airport has
been built to international standards, but the airport itself is not
an international one, even though it is open for international
charter flights, airport officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after complaints from some tour
operators who said that they were under the impression that since the
addition of the new terminal, Hualien Airport was to be considered an
international airport. The tour operators were disappointed to learn
that many foreign charter flights that were originally scheduled to
come in summer have been canceled because the airport is unable to
handle the waste from the chartered planes.</P>
      <P>The operators said this was a huge blow to the tourism industry
in Hualien.</P>
      <P>Airport officials said that although the new terminal was
constructed with an international design in mind, it has a long way
to go before becoming a truly international airport.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the number of passengers and inbound and
outbound cargo has yet to reach the level of an international
airport.</P>
      <P>Even if the new terminal had been installed with an incinerator
to handle charter planes' waste, officials said that they expected
that they would have been criticized for squandering the government's
money.</P>
      <P>At the present stage, they said that they could only ask the
charter planes to depart and carry away their own waste. If there is
stable growth of passengers and cargo in the future, the terminal
will have to ask for money from the central government to build
facilities to accommodate the increase.</P>
      <P>The tour operators also asked for the help of the Hualien County
Government, although county government officials said that the matter
is beyond their jurisdiction. Although they said that they will do

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PROCUREMENT FROM U.S. FAR TOO EXPENSIVE: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two more legislators on Friday criticized a
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) budget passed by the Executive
Yuan earlier this month for the purchase of weapons from the United
States as being "far too expensive."</P>
      <P>Legislator Ku Chung-lien of the opposition People First Party and
independent Legislator Su Ying-kuei said they support government arms
procurements from the United States, but they also claimed that the
deal is exorbitantly expensive.</P>
      <P>They said that not only should the Control Yuan -- the nation's
highest watchdog body -- conduct an investigation, but that the
legislature should also "keep the taxpayers' money in mind."</P>
      <P>Ku, who is a former navy commander-in-chief, said that the budget
will be mainly for the purchase of Patriot PAC III anti-missile
systems, diesel-powered submarines, and P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>But he said that the eight submarines have an estimated cost of
NT$400 billion, meaning that one such conventional submarine could
buy a nuclear-powered submarine in the United States, making the cost
of the diesel subs is "simply too high."</P>
      <P>Su said that cost is much higher than that charged for other
countries, noting the same price could buy an equal number of F-14
fighter planes.</P>
      <P>In addition, Su said that the defense area covered by the navy is
mainly the Taiwan Strait. He claimed that the depth of the
160-km-wide strait is insufficient for the deployment of submarines
and that he is afraid the submarines would be rendered useless in the
event of war.</P>
      <P>According to Executive Yuan's arms procurement draft budget bill,
Taiwan will purchase eight submarines, a modified version of the
Patriot PAC-III anti-missile system and a squadron of 12 P3-C
anti-submarine aircraft over a 15-year period starting in 2005.
The United States offered to sell the arms to Taiwan in 2001 as part
of its most comprehensive arms package to the island since 1992.</P>
      <P>The special budget bill is now pending approval of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance"-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOUTH-BREEDER RAISERS HOPING FOR GOVERNMENT HELP OVER OVERSUPPLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's production of mouth-breeders this
year is expected to reach 90,000 tons, a level that will far exceed
local demand, according to statistics compiled by the Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Hu Fu-hsiung reported at a recent legislative
committee meeting that the council is planning to purchase 1,000 tons
of mouth-breeders of inferior quality in the Yunlin, Chiayi and
Tainan areas to make fertilizer in an effort to help tackle the
oversupply problem. It has so far bought 660 tons, he noted.</P>
      <P>Fu also pointed out that the COA is not considering buying more
of the fish for that purpose and instead is mulling ways to help
raisers expand their exports.</P>
      <P>The COA is hoping to increase the amount of Taiwan outbound
shipments of mouth-breeders to 63,000 tons per year from the current
level of 53,000 tons, officials said.</P>
      <P>Affected by soaring commodity prices in the international market,
costs for local mouth-breeder raisers have also jumped. In the face
of the pressure from the overproduction and rising costs, they have
demanded that the government increase its purchase amount as a means
of helping them overcome their difficulties.</P>
      <P>Mouth-breeders, a typical and popular fish for Taiwan consumers,
are presently being sold at about NT$26 (US$0.776) per kilogram on
average on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>In response, Legislator Yu Cheng-tao voiced the hope that the COA
will also purchase the fish in the Pingtung and Kaohsiung areas and
his call was endorsed by colleagues Tsao Chi-hung and Ke Shu-min, who
asked the council to buy an additional 3,000 tons of mouth-breeders
in central and southern regions, where aquaculture ponds are
clustered.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Feng-shi, however, was opposed to the proposal,
claiming that making such large purchases will have an impact on the
market.</P>
      <P>He also questioned how the government plans to ensure the quality
of the mouth-breeders bought from local raisers, as some fish
exported to the European Union late last year were returned to Taiwan
after the buyers discovered they contained excessive amounts of
chemicals.</P>
      <P>For this reason, coupled with emerging price competition from
mainland China, Thailand and Vietnam, Taiwan-raised mouth-breeders
have hit a snag in exports, he pointed out.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Customs officials seized a large batch of
betel nuts smuggled into Taiwan from Thailand Friday.</P>
      <P>The seized betel nuts, weighing a total of 3,584 kg and packed in
128 cases, were airlifted to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport --
Taiwan's main gateway -- a day earlier. Customs officials said the
labels on the cases had been changed after their arrival at the
airport warehouse, indicating that there were local accomplices
involved in the smuggling operation.</P>
      <P>It was the third batch of smuggled betel nuts uncovered by
airport customs authorities in the past two weeks.</P>
      <P>As now is the off-season for betel nut harvesting in Taiwan and
the Council of Agriculture has banned imports of the product, there
has been a sharp hike in local betel nut retail prices.</P>
      <P>Customs officials said they suspect that local smuggling rings
have colluded with airport staff to change the labels of the betel
nuts from Thailand to facilitate the smuggling of the products into
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Customs officials urged airport police and criminal investigators
to tighten their monitoring of suspicious people who might change the
labels after the arrival of the betel nuts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT, PREMIER TO VISIT CENTRAL AMERICA: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Yu
Shyi-kun will visit Central America and the Caribbean in the near
future to boost the Republic of China's relations with its allies in
the two regions, Vice President Annette Lu said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at a news conference at the Presidential
Office on the achievements of her just-concluded 14-day diplomatic
tour that took her to El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala in
addition to two American cities -- Las Vegas and San Francisco -- for
transit stops.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that the ROC has 13 diplomatic allies in Central America
and the Caribbean. "This time I visited only three of those
countries. President Chen and Premier Yu will visit our other allies
in the two regions in the not-too-distant future," she added.</P>
      <P>Describing her fruitful visit as the result of a "diplomatic
symphony orchestra," Lu said she just played the role of conductor.
"I'm grateful for the devoted services of our diplomatic staff and
the members of my entourage. Their concerted efforts helped make
the journey a great success."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lu said she feels that some of the ROC diplomats
stationed in the three Central American countries are not qualified
to do their jobs. "I'll advise Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen
to designate an ambassador-at-large versed in the Spanish language
and Latin American affairs to strengthen supervision of diplomatic
work there," she said.</P>
      <P>Lu again called for a new vision and new perspective for the
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait. She urged Taiwan
businessmen to follow the prevailing trend of globalization in
establishing their business empires or footholds.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan businessmen should look east toward the Pacific Ocean
instead of looking west toward mainland China. There are many other
good overseas investment destinations outside the Chinese mainland, "
Lu said.</P>
      <P>During her visit to El Salvador, Lu said, she urged the
Salvadoran government to designate a large piece of land for Taiwan
investors. Lu said she will encourage Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest
in the farming and agricultural processing industries in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lu went on, Taiwan can assist Costa Rica in
digitalization and cooperate with Guatemala in restoring its cultural
and historic relics.</P>
      <P>Lu said she will launch a new publicity campaign to help local
people better understand the Central American allies' culture,
history and general political and social situations, including
encouraging local college students to forge friendships via mail with
their Central American counterparts, inviting performing arts groups
to perform in Taiwan, encouraging local travel agencies to organize
package tours to those countries and urging local people to sponsor
children from impoverished families in the region.</P>
      <P>She also noted that 50 percent of lawmakers and 40 percent of
Cabinet members in Costa Rica are female. "I plan to organize a
delegation of local female politicians and business executives to
visit Costa Rica to see for themselves Costa Rica's achievements in
promoting gender equality in political and other fields," she said</P>
      <P>Lu said she received the highest-level honors and dignified
treatment during her three-leg Central America visit and transit
stops in the two American cities. "It was a journey of honor and
dignity and the visit glorified our national dignity."</P>
      <P>Lu further said the unexpectedly high-level courtesy treatment
she received during her transit stops in Las Vegas and San Francisco
symbolized a thaw in substantive Taiwan-U.S. ties, which were
strained in the run-up to Taiwan's March 20 presidential election
over President Chen's insistence on holding a "defensive referendum"
that the Bush administration saw as provocative to Beijing.</P>
      <P>During her transit stop in San Francisco on her way back to
Taipei, Lu said she asked Chen by phone whether she could change her
schedule and travel to Washington, D.C. to represent the ROC
government at the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan's state funeral.</P>
      <P>"President Chen told me that we should respect the U.S. State
Department's opinion. ROC Representative Chen Chien-jen then
contacted the U.S. authorities over the issue. In consideration of my
busy schedule, the U.S. State Department unprecedentedly agreed to
let me read a public statement mourning Reagan's death," Lu recalled.</P>
      <P>Due to the absence of formal diplomatic ties with the United
States and Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, senior ROC
officials have traditionally been banned from issuing any public
statement during their rare transit stops on U.S. soil.</P>
      <P>However, Lu returned to Taipei Thursday as scheduled and Chen
designated Control Yuan President Fredrick Chien to attend Reagan's
funeral on his behalf.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Taiwan expatriates in San Francisco, Lu
also suggested that the nation be called "Taiwan Republic of China, "
an idea she thought would pacify domestic disputes over Taiwan's
identity. The proposal drew heavy fire in local society, but Lu
claimed that Chen fully understands her true intention.</P>
      <P>"My proposal was aimed at ending the domestic disputes and
promoting social harmony. It had nothing to do with constitutional
amendments or the sensitive national title change issue," she added.</P>
      <P>Heading a large entourage, Lu attended new Salvadoran President
Elias Antonio Saca's inauguration on Chen's behalf. Lu said Saca has
agreed to visit Taipei in August.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADVISER WARNS OF CROWD-OUT EFFECT OF SOARING MAINLAND-BOUND INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A national policy adviser to the
Presidential Office warned Friday that soaring Taiwan investments in
mainland China might have triggered a crowd-out effect on domestic
investment.</P>
      <P>National policy adviser Huang Tian-lin claimed at a round-table
discussion that Taiwan investments in the mainland have exceeded half
of Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP), a situation that might well
crowd out investment at home.</P>
      <P>Huang urged the government to look into the issue and encourage
Taiwan businessmen to relocate their investment operations from the
mainland to elsewhere, such as Southeast Asia, so that they can
provide a more useful and constructive influence on Taiwan's business
and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>To back up his argument, Huang said that by comparison, Japanese
investment in the mainland constitute only 0.6 percent of that
country's GDP, while South Korean investments there are equal to 2.7
percent of South Korea's GDP.</P>
      <P>Huang said that although the South Korean mainland investments
constitute only 2.7 percent of the country's GDP, South Korea's
exports to the mainland have grown remarkably to the tune of about
the same amount exported by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Taiwan's mainland-bound investments have actually
already crowded out domestic investments, pointing out that the
annual growth rate of domestic investments in recent years has been
lower than that of Japan, a nation that has suffered an economic
downturn for more than 10 years.</P>
      <P>Quoting a research report by the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
Huang said that only 26 percent of mainland-bound Taiwan investment
projects have used raw materials, parts and components from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By comparison, he said, counterparts in Southeast Asian countries
purchased 72 percent of their raw materials, parts and components
from Taiwan for their manufacturing overseas.</P>
      <P>Huang added that mainland-bound Taiwanese companies have reduced
their employment of Taiwanese employees by an average of 5 percent on
a year-on-year basis, while Southeast Asia-bound counterparts have
increased their employment rate in Taiwan by 5.6 percent.</P>
      <P>He said the government should do something positive before it is
too late given that the mainland has gradually and increasingly
reduced its reliance on Taiwan for economic expansion while
suppressing Taiwan businessmen via political means.</P>
      <P>However, Huang's theories were discounted by all the other
speakers at the round table meeting, including Tsai Hung-ming, deputy
secretary-general of the Chinese National Federation of Industries;
Hung Teh-sheng, vice president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research; and Lin Tzu-chia, an economics professor at National
Chengchi University, all of whom noted that mainland-bound Taiwanese
businessmen are just like all other investors elsewhere in the world
in that profits are their only concern.</P>
      <P>They argued that the most imperative thing that the government
should do now is to improve Taiwan's investment climate. If Taiwan
investors find that their investments in Taiwan will make money, they
will naturally direct their funds and technology back to Taiwan from
the mainland, the round-table participants pointed out.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that a free
trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the United States would be
in the interests of both countries and expressed the hope that the
American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei will help bring about
the signing of such an agreement.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when he met with AmCham President
Andrea Wu and other AmCham members at the Executive Yuan.
Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Hu
Sheng-cheng, Finance Minister Lin Chuan, Minister of Economic Affairs
Ho Mei-yueh, Public Construction Commission Chairwoman Kuo Yao-chi and
other related government officials were also present to exchange
views with AmCham members.</P>
      <P>The meeting came after AmCham published its 2004 Taiwan White
Paper June 1 in which it strongly urges the opening of direct
transportation links across the Taiwan Strait, saying that without
these, Taiwan's goal of becoming a regional hub will be in jeopardy
and the island risks being marginalized in the fiercely competitive
environment.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed his appreciation for the long-term support
of American businessmen and asked related government agency heads to
reflect upon the suggestions by the American enterprises, adding that
globalization and liberalization are established policies of the
administration.</P>
      <P>Yu also explained to them Taiwan's efforts in the liberalization
of the flow of talent and capital and on the crackdown on the
violation of intellectual property rights over the years.</P>
      <P>Noting that stable cross-strait relations are still the focus of
his administration, he also said that direct cross-strait
transportation links will involve discussion of government
authorities and will need judicial assistance. He expressed hope that
the United States will play the role of a mediator to bring about
such cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Yu also said that one of the major tasks of his administration is
to sign an FTA with the United States and he expressed the hope that
AmCham members will convey this back to Washington.</P>
      <P>Wu will lead an AmCham delegation to Washington, D.C. from June
13-16. The annual "Washington door-knocking" trip will involve calls
on leading members of Congress and key executive-branch agencies
involved with economic relations with Taiwan, as well as think tanks.</P>
      <P>Noting that American enterprises are increasing their investments
in Taiwan every year, the premier said a speeding-up of globalization
and liberalization will be in the interests of both Taiwan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan has demonstrated its utmost sincerity in
dealing with Beijing, citing as examples the expansion of offshore
transshipment centers and the more convenient cross-strait cargo
transportation.</P>
      <P>But he said that direct cross-strait transportation will require
consultations and that he hopes American businesses can play the role
of mediator to bring about such consultations.</P>
      <P>On AmCham's concern about the protection of pharmaceutical data
exclusivity, the premier promised that he would see to it that a
revision of the Law of Pharmaceutical Affairs will give a set of
clear-cut regulations.</P>

from Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China) growing by 3,557 over the
previous year's figure, according to the MOI statistics.</P>
      <P>In 2003, 3.4 percent of the bridegrooms in Taiwan were foreign or
mainland Chinese nationals, while 28 percent of the brides were. Of
the latter group, nearly 65 percent were mainland Chinese citizens,
and nearly 35 percent were nationals from Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the average age of the bridegrooms was 33.8 years old,
compared with 28.4 years old for the brides. A breakdown of the
brides' ages show that Taiwanese brides' average age was 28.3,
compared with 31.3 for mainland Chinese brides, and 23.6 for

    <HEADLINE>MOF APPRECIATES LEGISLATIVE PASSAGE OF RTC EXTENSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Friday
it appreciates the Legislative Yuan's passage of a draft package of
revisions to the Statute Governing the Financial Restructuring Fund
that will allow for a one-year extension of the fund.</P>
      <P>The ministry expressed its gratitude after the
opposition-controlled Legislature passed the amendment bill at a
plenary session earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Under the original law, the Financial Restructuring Fund, which
is patterned after the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) invented in
the United States in the 1980s to resolve bad loan issues created by
poorly-managed or bankrupt credit cooperatives, will be invalidated
July 10. The MOF has used business taxes paid by local banks and
other financial institutions to set up the Financial Restructuring
Fund.</P>
      <P>The MOF said the restructuring fund should be extended for one
year as it takes more time to resolve issues left by certain sloppily
managed financial institutions.</P>
      <P>"The restructuring fund has played a key role in the
implementation of our current financial reform projects, " said Chang
Ming-tao, director of the MOF's Bureau of Monetary Affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said he hopes the Legislature can pass certain
other regulations before Oct. 19 so that the scale of the
restructuring fund can be further expanded. If this goal can be
reached, Chang said, creditors of poorly managed banks or credit
departments of grass-roots farmers' and fishermen's associations that
are taken over by the MOF before Jan. 15, 2005, will be able to get
full repayment of their non-deposit investments.</P>

      <P>Late U.S. President Ronald Reagan was

while meeting with Taiwan media stationed in the U.S. capital.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
confirmed a newspaper report Saturday that it is reconsidering a
previous plan to either marginalize or cancel the army, navy and air
force general headquarters and to merge various military academies.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said Defense Minister
Lee Jye indeed told lawmakers during a recent closed-door meeting
that he has ordered a re-evaluation of the previous plan to
marginalize the three armed forces general headquarters and merge
relevant military academies.</P>
      <P>The "headquarters marginalization and military academies merger"
plan was initiated by former Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min as part
of his second-stage troops reduction project with an aim to establish
an elite deterrent force in the face of mainland China's military
threat.</P>
      <P>Tang intended to marginalize the army, navy and air force general
headquarters so that Taiwan's armed forces will become the "national
defense force" without clear division into three separate branches to
save resources and enhance operational efficiency. Against this
backdrop, Tang also pushed for a 10-year plan to merge existing army,
navy and air force academies and several other military schools into
an armed forces university and several professional military research
institutes.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Tang's plan had met lukewarm response
from Lee who was then chief of the General Staff. Lee reportedly
didn't think that the general headquarters of the three military
branches should be marginalized or canceled. Without the existence of
separate general headquarters to handle manpower training and
logistic support, Lee said, each military branch might not be able to
realize their missions smoothly.</P>
      <P>And consequently, Lee was quoted as having said, the army, navy
and air force academies should not be merged because different
military branch needs different school to train cadets to meet its
particular needs.</P>
      <P>Acting on Lee's instruction, MND spokesman Huang said the
ministry is now re-assessing whether to marginalize or remove
the army, navy and air force general headquarters and whether to
merge various military academies.</P>
      <P>"We are also working on a new military restructuring plan
with a view to trimming redundant military personnel and
units while beefing up our overall defense capabilities," Lee
said.</P>

      <P>The Health Department of Kaohsiung
County Government on Saturday seized vegetarian products suspected of
containing animal ingredients in raids on several vegetarian food
factories and markets around the county.</P>
      <P>Under orders from the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) ,
Kaohsiung County Government health officials carried out the raids to
investigate whether the products contained animal ingredients.</P>
      <P>The raids were made following a legislator's claim that 70
percent of 21 vegetarian products examined by the DOH were found to
contain animal ingredients.</P>
      <P>The health officials found in the raids that some
vegetarian-labeled products from a factory in Yenchao Village might
contain animal products. The owner of the factory admitted it at
first, but later denied it. The officials then took seven samples for
further tests.</P>
      <P>The officials said that if the vegetarian foods are found to
contain animal ingredients, the factory will be fined between
NT$40,000 (US$1,194) and NT$200,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUALIEN RESIDENT BAGS NT$600,000 FOR QUITTING SMOKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hualien County resident Chang Chien-kuo got
the sweetest taste of quitting smoking when he bagged the top prize
of NT$600,000 (US$17,910) in a 2004 "quit and win" contest Saturday.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, which sponsored the contest,
congratulated Chang and all the other participants in the contest for
their determination to bid farewell to cigarettes and move toward a
more healthy lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials said that 30,096 people took part in this
year's contest, with Chang being chosen as the luckiest winner in a
random computer draw.</P>
      <P>Chang, 33, a four-year-smoker who at one time puffed up to 50
cigarettes a day, said he made up his mind to quit after learning
that his wife was pregnant early this year. Encouraged and supported
by his wife, he said he was able to kick the habit.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Department of Health Chen Chien-jen, speaking on
the same occasion, noted that over 50 percent of people in Taiwan
start smoking before the age of 18 and that the number of deaths
resulting from smoking in Taiwan totals 18,000 a year.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the direct medical costs to Taiwan from
smoking totals NT$16 billion a year, with the indirect social costs
reaching as high as NT$50 billion.</P>
      <P>The nation's top health official said that quitting smoking is
not only an act of self-love, but also an act of love toward one's
family and friends.</P>
      <P>The successful quitters cited different reasons for wanting to
kick the tobacco habit, with one father saying that he decided to
quit after seeing his three-year-old son mimicking his puffing
manner. But all those who successfully quit said that they are happy
and want to share their happiness with their families and others
about taking on the "impossible mission."</P>
      <P>John Tung Foundation Chairman Lai Tung-ming, in handing out a
prize to one of the contest winners, Fu Hsueh-li, 58, who smoked for
30 years and is the cousin of Miaoli County Magistrate Fu Hsueh-peng,
urged Fu to relate his experience to the magistrate and encourage the
latter to participate in the contest next year.</P>
      <P>The "quit and win" contest was initiated in 1980 in the United
States, and under the support of the World Health Organization, an
international quit smoking contest was formally launched in 1994. By
2002, 670,000 people in 76 countries had taken part in the
international contest.</P>
      <P>Taiwan held the contest simultaneously with the international
community this year. According to the contest rules, each participant
must find a non-smoking witness to take part in the contest as their
partner during the four-week period of the contest, which ran from
May 2 to May 29 this year. The participants must also undergo tests
for nicotine and carbon monoxide during the four weeks, as well as
periodic testing for one year after the contest ends.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday that his
overseas travel plan has yet to take shape and that he will brief the
press on the itinerary when the planning work is finalized.</P>
      <P>Yu was responding to press inquiries about his view on Vice
President Annette Lu's remarks at a news conference a day earlier
that both President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Yu will visit the
Republic of China's diplomatic allies in Central America and the
Caribbean in the near future following her just-concluded, three-leg
Central American tour that took her to El Salvador, Costa Rica and
Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Yu said it is still in the planning stage whether he will take
advantage of the current legislative recess to make an overseas
journey to further cement Taiwan's relations with its diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>"If a concerted overseas travel plan takes shape, I'll certainly
brief the press on my itinerary," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan went into summer
recess after a grueling marathon session Friday.</P>
      <P>While expressing his gratitude for the Legislature's approval of
several critical reform bills on the final day of its fifth
legislative session, Yu said he feels regret over the fact that the
Legislature only approved 23 of the 149 "priority" bills initiated by
the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Yu said he hopes the Legislature can hold an extraordinary
session in the near future to screen over 300 bills that remain
stalled and are crucial to the government's various reform plans,
including the draft national pension bill, the four "sunshine" bills
designed to establish clean politics, and the packages of revisions
to three major existing labor laws.</P>
      <P>Addressing a commencement at National Taipei College of Nursing,
Yu encouraged new graduates to dedicate themselves to serving
patients and to continue pursuing professional expertise and
excellence.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan society is greying with the number of people aged over
65 increasing rapidly, Yu said he hopes all nursing college graduates
can support the government's policy of encouraging childbirth by
delivering more babies themselves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NSU TO BE FORMALLY INAUGURATED AS PARTY TUESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the planned Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union (NSU), a new political party initiated by
independent legislators, said Saturday the party will be formally
inaugurated next Tuesday as scheduled.</P>
      <P>NSU Secretary General Chen Chieh-ju made the remarks after a
review committee of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) raised
questions about using the term "non-partisan" in the name of the new
party.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the party has been in the planning for some time,
adding that if the MOI has any opinions about the NSU, the party is
willing to communicate with the ministry.</P>
      <P>The party will apply to and register with the MOI as scheduled,
adding that "there is no plan to change the name," he said.</P>
      <P>He said that the party has drafted a charter and is scheduled to
form a 21-member central standing committee, with current legislators
serving as the natural central standing committee members.</P>
      <P>As to when Chang Po-ya, chairwoman of the new party's preparatory
committee, will become the party's chairwoman, he said that the party
will not rule out the possibility of calling for an extraordinary
central standing committee meeting to nominate her for the post.</P>
      <P>Chang, a health minister during the latter part of the era of
Kuomintang (KMT) rule, mentioned earlier that the establishment of
the NSU will effectively offer a "third" or "middle-way" choice for
the people of Taiwan, who she said have long been divided into two
camps -- the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and its two splinter
parties, namely the People First Party and the New Party, and the
"pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>The new party's 40-odd founders include some well-known
politicians such as Chang, former Hsinchu Mayor Shih Hsin-chung, and
10 of the 13 independent lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan who have
grouped together under the Alliance of Independent Legislators
banner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER PROPOSES DISBANDING OF FACTIONS WITHIN THE PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday he will propose the disbanding
of factions within the party following President Chen Shui-bian's
announcement that party officials should step out from faction
operations.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Hsing-nan said that he will present his proposal,
which has already obtained the endorsement of more than 50 of the
party's lawmakers, to the DPP National Party Congress to be held in
July for more support.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that his proposal stipulates that DPP members should
not establish factions, including the forming of faction offices, the
recruiting of members, or the convening of policy meetings, and that
those who violate the rules should have their party membership rights
suspended for one to two years.</P>
      <P>Reaction to the proposal has been mixed, with some party members
saying that the DPP's faction problems are serious and should be
resolved immediately, and others considering factions to be a natural
thing.</P>
      <P>Mainstream faction lawmaker Trong Chai noted that although there
are factions when there are political parties, he opposes the
establishment of faction offices and the recruitment of faction
members, which he said would undermine the DPP's reputation.</P>
      <P>He stressed that party factions should not be institutionalized
as this would strengthen the power and interests of the factions. If
the trend continues, the interests of the factions will replace those
of the party or of the nation, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Former Taichung City Mayor Chang Wen-ying, who withdrew from the
DPP in order to campaign for re-election after the party didn't
nominate her, said that some DPP factions have been working eagerly
to grasp power, resulting in an imbalance in the party's development.</P>
      <P>If the faction problems are not properly handled, it will damage
the DPP's solidarity and operations in the future, Chang added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-liang, secretary-general of the Justice
Alliance faction, suggested that people "review" the factions instead
of dismissing them, noting that the factions in the DPP have played a
role as a stabilizing force in the party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD URGES MERGER OF OPPOSITION PARTIES TO FORM MIDDLE-WAY FORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Lien Chan of the opposition
Kuomintang kicked off his post-election, island-wide "thanksgiving"
journey in Keelung, northern Taiwan Saturday by calling for an
integration of the opposition parties to form a middle-way force.</P>
      <P>Lien lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian in the March 20
presidential election by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes out of
more than 13 million cast, but Lien has yet to concede defeat and has
filed two lawsuits to contest Chen's re-election victory and call for
the nullification of the election so that a new one can be held.</P>
      <P>Lien, accompanied by KMT Vice Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and KMT
Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng, came together with grass-roots KMT
cadres and elected representatives in Keelung in a meeting.</P>
      <P>Claiming that "democracy used to be the pride of Taiwan" but that
it is "now faced with an unprecedented crisis, " Lien said that the
process of the presidential election was not fair or just.</P>
      <P>He said that democracy cannot operate without a system of checks
and balances, adding that the KMT not only needs to unite itself, it
needs to invite those who share the same ideals to work toward the
goal of democracy.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT, the People First Party, the New Party and the
independents must move from cooperation toward merger, forming "a
middle-way, rational and plural" force.</P>
      <P>He said that the goal will be to integrate the opposition parties
to win more than half of the 225 seats in the Legislative Yuan in the
year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Ma, who presided over the meeting, noted that world renowned
Chinese-American forensic expert Henry Lee came to Taiwan to help
investigate the election-eve shooting of President Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Even though Lee confirmed that both suffered from gunshot wounds,
he pointed out the shooting was not a political assassination, Ma
said, adding that this is why the KMT and the PFP want an
investigation to get to the bottom of the incident, which they
believe unfairly swayed the bitterly contested election in Chen's
favor.</P>
      <P>Ma also talked about the defects and negligence uncovered in the
the vote recount process.</P>
      <P>He also spoke of the significance of a merger of the KMT and the
PFP, saying that democracy depends on a system of checks and balances
and that the system now hinges on the "pan-blue alliance " of the KMT
and its two splinter parties of the PFP and the New Party.</P>
      <P>But he also said that in addition to a merger, reforms are
needed, saying that the pace of reforms concerning party affairs,
party assets and intraparty democratization must be quick enough so
that it will be "felt by the general public."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POLITICIANS URGED TO PROMOTE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wise Taiwan politicians should take
effective measures to promote national reconciliation, Control Yuan
President Fredrick Chien said in Washington, D.C., Friday.</P>
      <P>Chien, who attended the state funeral of the late U.S. President
Ronald Reagan on behalf of ROC President Chen Shui-bian earlier in
the day, made the appeal while meeting with a group of Taiwan
journalists stationed in the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>Chien, a former career diplomat who served as the ROC's minister
of foreign affairs from 1990 through 1996, encountered a
demonstration launched by supporters of Taiwan's opposition "pan-blue
alliance" when he arrived in Washington on Thursday as President
Chen's special envoy to Reagan's funeral.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong lost to
incumbent President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu by a
razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes, or 0.228 percent of the more than
13 million ballots cast in the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong have so far refused to concede defeat and have
filed two lawsuits to challenge the Chen-Lu ticket's re-election
victory and to demand an annulment of the election so that a new one
can be held.</P>
      <P>With Chen's consent, a full-scale judicial recount of the ballots
cast in the bitterly fought election has been completed. No solid
evidence has been found to back up the alliance's claim that the
election was rigged. The Taiwan High Court has yet to mete out
rulings on the two law suits.</P>
      <P>Chien said the election outcome indicates that Taiwan society has
become polarized, a situation similar to that faced by Reagan during
the early days of his eight-year presidency. When Reagan took the
helm in January 1981, Chien said, U.S. society was still covered by
the shadows of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal of the
previous decade.</P>
      <P>In the face of a divided society, Chien said, it's imperative
that politicians use wisdom to promote national reconciliation and
heel the wounds and rifts.</P>
      <P>As the head of the nation's supreme watchdog body, Chien said he
is not in a position to talk about domestic political issues, such as
how to achieve national reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chien mentioned that President Chen had already
declared in his May 20 inaugural speech that he would not push for
changes to the national title and flag while carrying out
constitutional reforms during his second term to avoid provoking
mainland China which has threatened to attack Taiwan should the
island pursue de jure independence.</P>
      <P>During a meeting late last month with senior executives of
foreign financial groups with interests in Taiwan, Chien said,
President Chen had reaffirmed his commitment to no provocation to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>As to the post-election disputes, Chien said the Control Yuan has
formed a special task force to investigate why relevant government
authorities had failed to take effective measures to prevent the
occurrence of the March 19 shooting of President Chen and Vice
President Lu, whether there was a national security mechanism to be
activated in an emergency situation like the post-March 19 shooting,
and whether the simultaneous holding of a nationwide referendum on
the presidential election day had caused any problems to the
presidential election itself.</P>
      <P>Starting in July, Chien said, the Control Yuan team will publish
a series of comprehensive investigative reports on all those issues.</P>
      <P>As for the criminal investigations into the election-eve
shooting, Chien said it's none of the Control Yuan business. "It's up
to law enforcement authorities to investigate who was involved in the
criminal case," he added.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's government restructuring plan, Chien said
the Control Yuan should continue to exist to supervise the executive
branch's operations.</P>
      <P>"The Control Yuan's function is like that of an independent
director of a business corporation. It can supervise the Cabinet's
operations without any political interference," Chien said.</P>
      <P>In his view, he went on, such supervisory power should not be
delegated to the Legislative Yuan as some people have suggested
because the Legislature is a political body and cannot be free of
partisan influence in its operations.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the 2004 presidential election, President Chen
often assured voters that he wouldn't cave in to Beijing, and he
often questioned his sole challenger Lien Chan's willingness to stand
up to Beijing. Political and ethnic divisions have become more
serious after Taiwan-born Chen narrowly defeated mainland China-born
Lien.</P>
      <P>Except for a small group of aboriginal tribes, most of Taiwan's
23 million people are ethnic Chinese. But the population can be
divided into two sub-ethnic groups: the "mainlanders" whose families
fled to Taiwan when the Chinese Communists took over the mainland in
1949, and the "native Taiwanese" whose ancestors began arriving on
the island in the 17th century or earlier.</P>
      <P>The mainlanders, about 15 percent of the population, have largely
supported the "pan-blue alliance, " whose support base is in northern
Taiwan. The native Taiwanese tend to favor the "pan-green camp" of
Chen's Democratic Progressive Party and its smaller ally the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, whose support base is in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The mainlanders have traditionally supported eventual unification
with mainland China, while the native Taiwanese lean more toward
formal independence.</P>

according to the state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower).</P>
      <P>Although the public are worried that electricity consumption will
jump because of an improved economy, a Taipower official gave his
assurances over the weekend that supplies this summer will be
sufficient as the relevant agencies have made moves to tackle a
possible power shortage resulting from rising fuel prices in the
world market and a shortage of liquefied natural gas in the home
market.</P>
      <P>During the first five months of this year, the country's
electricity supplies increased by 7.8 percent, marking a noticeable
growth over the previous year's level of 3.2 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Taipower has asked Chinese Petroleum
Corp. to increase its purchases of liquefied natural gas, while four
newly opened power plants -- Chiahui, Kuokuang, Hsingchang and Fengte
-- are to join the ranks with Taipower to provide supplies for
industry.</P>
      <P>The four power plants have a combined a capacity of 2.62 million
kilowatts per month, which will help secure normal supplies in
various regions, the official noted, adding that together with
Taipower, a total of 35.38 million kilowatts of electricity will be
secured each month.</P>
      <P>Taipower estimates that single-month consumption in July and
August may peak at around 29.8 million kilowatts and that it may
break the 30 million kilowatt level -- a 15-year high.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT U.S.-TAIWAN FTA: BOFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is too early to talk about the signing
of a free trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the United States
as the stances on both sides on relevant concerns are still hugely
divided, a top trade official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that at present,
he does not see any intent on the part of the United States to begin
even assessing or talking about signing an FTA with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Trade officials were scheduled to meet in Taipei June 27-28 for
bilateral talks on issues of mutual concern. However, the meeting has
been sensationalized by the Taiwan media as a prelude paving the way
for the two countries to eventually sign an FTA.</P>
      <P>As a result, according to Huang, his U.S. counterparts informed
him recently that big differences between the U.S. and Taiwan stances
on many issues remain and that currently, the United States has not
yet assessed the possibility of signing an FTA with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. officials said the Taiwan media should not have
sensationalized the meeting so as to cause misunderstandings,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang said that officials from the two countries are expected to
exchange views during the June 27-28 meeting on issues including
intellectual property rights protection; Taiwan's rice imports;
pharmaceutical data exclusivity and pricing system and Taiwan's
opening of its fixed broadband infrastructure market. He added that
there is a possibility that the meeting may be postponed.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Taiwan and the United States had indeed made
attempts to make preparations for signing a bilateral FTA, which is
why the two countries began talks on a trade and investment framework
agreement (TIFA) . The TIFA was never signed and the Taiwan-U.S. TIFA
talks have stalled as a result of differences between the two sides
on many vital issues, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang noted, however, that although the United States has
stressed that it is not prepared to talk about a FTA with Taiwan, the
BOFT may formally ask the United States to resume the TIFA talks
first if the upcoming meeting is fruitful.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CNA reporter based in Geneva quoted the Bureau of
National Affairs (BNA) Inc. Sunday as having reported that although
the Executive Yuan has made signing an FTA with the United States a
top priority in efforts to bolster trade with friendly countries, the
United States suspects that Taiwan has political rather than economic
motives in pushing for the signing of an FTA.</P>
      <P>A reporter from the BNA -- the largest independent publisher in
the United States of specialized news and information for
professionals in business and government -- who visited Taiwan
recently, reported this week that the building of FTA relations
between Taiwan and the United States is entwined with complicated
political wrangling involving not only the two sides but also
mainland China.</P>
      <P>While the U.S. suspects that Taiwan's motives for an FTA are
political rather than economic, the Taiwan authorities have
complained that the U.S. has stalled TIFA and FTA talks with Taiwan
because of pressure from Beijing, the BNA report said.</P>
      <P>The report reiterated Washington's stance that before Taiwan
efficiently handles issues like opening its telecommunications
market, revising its copyright law, intellectual property rights
protection, pharmaceutical data exclusivity and pricing system and
rice imports, the United States will not consider engaging in FTA
talks with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei
President Andrea Wu and other AmCham members at the Executive Yuan
last Friday, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said that an FTA between Taiwan and
the United States would be in the interests of both countries and
expressed the hope that AmCham will help bring about the signing of
such an agreement.</P>

    <TEXT>Manila Bulletin: GMA appeals for unity

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo yesterday appealed for unity
and cooperation among freedom- loving Filipinos, urging all citizens
to put the tightly contested election behind them and work to
reconcile differences to be able to move on as a nation.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Macapagal provides fireworks on
rainy Independence Day MAYBE the rains were to blame. But
Independence Day celebrations Saturday were nearly as cheerless as
the weather, protests were small, and only President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo provided what little fire there was.

The Philippine Star: GMA: No more EDSAs for us

President Arroyo said yesterday the May 10 elections brought back
the power of the ballot to the Filipinos, who no longer need to take
to the streets to have the kind of leaders they want in office.

The Manila Times: GMA pins canvass delay on opposition President
Arroyo on Saturday assailed the opposition politicians for trying to
"derail our democratic process"by delaying the canvassing of the
votes of the presidential election.</TEXT>

applicants are in limbo

About 1,300 people in Singapore seeking to enrol at the National
University of Singapore or the Nanyang Technological University are
still wondering if they have been accepted at either.

The Lianhe Zaobao: The safe environment in Singapore is a key
selling point for attracting foreign investment here: says DPM Tony
Tan

In Singapore, not only the loyal, industrious and high-quality
labour force who satisfy all the foreign investors but also the safe
environment is a key selling point for attracting foreign investment
here, says Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan in Japan when
interviewed by Singapore's medias. Japanese companies are looking to
Singapore as more than a manufacturing hub, says Dr Tan.

Dr Tan, who led a delegation to Tokyo aiming to expand trade and
investment with Japan, found the world's second largest economy
positive about expanding their businesses in Singapore.

He found the atmosphere of the corporate sector much improved
compared to his visit 3 years ago, when Japan was still struggling to
come out of recession.

Dr Tan said: "There's a positive mood to Japan among Japanese
companies here. They're all doing well. They're talking about
expansion and establishing new plans."

During the last 5 years, new investments in Singapore were
between 1.2 billion to 1.8 billion dollars in fixed assets a year.

Trade between the two countries, during the period of January to
April rose 20 percent this year, compared to the same period last

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LEGISLATORS ATTACK FUEL SURCHARGES BY AIRLINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition legislators demanded Sunday that
to better protect passenger interests as the peak summer season
approaches, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications should
stop various airlines from charging fuel surcharges.</P>
      <P>People First Party legislators Liu Wen-hsiung, Lee Hong-chun and
Pan Chien-kuo made the call in a joint news conference.</P>
      <P>Complaining that the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under
the ministry approved fuel surcharge applications submitted by seven
carriers without detailed elaboration, they questioned the fairness
of the measure.</P>
      <P>As airplane ticket fees will soon surge for the peak summer
months, any additional price hikes will constitute a further burden
on travelers, they argued. They demanded that the CAA instruct the
airlines to make public their fuel costs to give a public explanation
for their planned surcharges.</P>
      <P>The CAA approved Friday the fuel surcharge applications submitted
by China Airlines (CAL) , EVA Airways Corp., Cathay Pacific Airways
Ltd., Singapore Airlines, Dragon Airlines Ltd., Malaysia Airlines and
Thai Airways International Ltd., allowing the carriers to impose a
surcharge ranging from US$5 to US$15 for each travel section between
two destinations from June 16.</P>
      <P>Aviation companies said that the fuel surcharge has been planned
to reflect rising operating costs as a result of soaring oil prices,
and they promised to cancel the surcharges as soon as international
oil prices drop. CAL and EVA Air -- Taiwan's two largest carriers --
have claimed that they will review their fuel surcharges in three
months.</P>
      <P>According to a CAA official, the surcharges are just a reflection
of rising airline costs, and they will be rescinded immediately once
oil prices slide to US$36 a barrel.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hong-jen, secretary-general of the non-profit Consumers'
Foundation, also expressed his dissatisfaction over the surcharge
plan.</P>
      <P>He called the proposed price hike a "double exploitation of
passengers " and pointed out that Taiwan travelers are already
charged more for airplane tickets than people in other countries.</P>
      <P>Accusing the carriers of damaging passengers' interests by
imposing fuel surcharges at an unappropriated time without
transparent information offered to the public, Cheng called for the
establishment of a mechanism under which aviation companies must
elaborate on their fuel costs as a basis for the public to gauge
their surcharges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION PARTIES CRY FOUL OVER NOMINEE FOR CHIEF ELECTION OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two major opposition parties cried foul
Sunday over the nomination of a controversial person for chief of
the Central Election Commission (CEC), saying unanimously that they
would ask the Council of Grand Justices to annul the nomination.</P>
      <P>One day after the Executive Yuan announced that Chang
Cheng-hsiung, a member of the CEC, will be promoted as chairman of
the commission, Legislator Huang Teh-fu, the deputy secretary of the
Kuomintang (KMT) caucus at the Legislative Yuan, said the nomination
is questionable not only because of its timing but also because of
the person chosen.</P>
      <P>According to the Basic Law for the Central Government
Organization that was passed by the Legislative Yuan before it went
into recess Friday, Huang said, the nominee for the CEC chairman
should be approved by the Legislative Yuan to ensure that the
commission will carry out national elections free from political
influence.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's decision to name a person to head the CEC
before the new law takes forces is obviously an attempt to sidestep
the legislature's supervision.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Huang said, the nomination is a blatant political
reward for Chang, who is known for vigorously defending the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's decision to hold a
referendum alongside the March 20 presidential election, although he
is not affiliated to any policial party.</P>
      <P>With a head heavily involved in politics, Huang said, the CEC
cannot be expected to carry out its job as an organization
independent of the Executive Yuan's influence. He adding that his
party could turn to the Council of Grand Justices for a ruling
against the nomination.</P>
      <P>His views were echoed by the KMT's political ally, the People
First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>PFP convener at the Legislative Yuan Liu Wen-hsiung said the
nomination is controversial as it runs against the newly enacted
Basic Law of Central Government Organization.</P>
      <P>As the national supreme representative organization, Liu said, it
is only natural for the Legislative Yuan to have a say in the
appointment of the CEC chief to ensure the commission is detached
from politics.</P>
      <P>If the CEC is controlled by the ruling party, no fair election is
possible. It is for this reason, Liu said, that his party is mulling
whether to ask the Council of Grand Justices to intervene by ruling
against Chang's nomination.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT TRANSPORT TALKS GATEWAY TO CROSS-STRAIT PEACE FRAMEWORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct transportation talks is a door to
building a cross-Taiwan Strait peace framework, former Mainland
Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen, currently a professor at National Taiwan University's
National Development Institute, said of the so-called "three direct
links" -- direct trade, transport and postal services between Taiwan
and mainland China -- that after the two sides entered the World
Trade Organization a couple of years ago, "two-and-a-half links" have
already opened, with deadlock remaining only in direct shipping and
air links.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a discussion on the prospects for direct cross-strait
links and security in the Taiwan Strait, Chen said the government has
been pragmatically pushing for direct air and shipping links across
the Taiwan Strait. The efforts include President Chen Shui-bian's
three-stage policy of "preparation, negotiation and gradual
realization."</P>
      <P>Noting that direct transportation links is the most challenging
and hard to achieve task among the three direct links because of
political implications, Chen said that if both sides could conquer
relevant problems, put aside political differences and return to
negotiating table to discuss the issue, then other cross-strait
affairs could be easily tackled.</P>
      <P>Chen added nevertheless that opening direct cross-strait air and
shipping links might not give Beijing a major economic gain, but
could help Beijing secure big political gains.</P>
      <P>Consequently, he warned, Taiwan should be extra careful when
dealing with Beijing in regard to opening direct cross-strait
transportation links.</P>
      <P>He warned that opening direct cross-strait air and shipping links
might have an adverse impact on Taiwan's defense security.
Such opening could also cause a hollowing-out of Taiwan's industrial
development and related needs, could cause Taiwan's unemployment rate
to rise and could increase bilateral private sector exchanges,
eventually blurring the Taiwan people's ability to tell who is the
enemy.</P>
      <P>Opening direct cross-strait transportation links is a two-edged
sword -- hostility and political deadlock would ease, lifting shares
and economic prospects but raising fears about Taiwan's defense --
and a responsible government should be able to "bring about good and
prevent bad" so as to seek workable solutions to the thorny issue, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL DESIGNATION SHOULD BE DECIDED BY ALL TAIWAN PEOPLE: ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's official designation should be
decided upon by all the 23 million people of the country, a
Presidential Office senior adviser said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a sovereign state and its official title and
constitution should be decided by all of its people in a process in
which the people agree, pass and support the title and the law, said
Koo Kuan-min, a pro-independence adviser to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a constitution rewriting forum, Koo brushed aside
notions such as "Taiwan Republic of China, " or "Republic of China
Taiwan" as unrealistic.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Taiwan expatriates in San Francisco early
last week, Vice President Annette Lu suggested that the nation be
called "Taiwan Republic of China, " an idea she thought would pacify
domestic disputes over Taiwan's identity.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the forum, academic Juan Ming, who is also a
national policy adviser to the Presidential Office, said he does not
support Lu's "Taiwan Republic of China" notion either.</P>
      <P>Juan said that except for the few diplomatic allies of the
Republic of China, no countries in the world call Taiwan by its
official designation of the ROC.</P>
      <P>"The entire world calls us 'Taiwan, ' the PRC calls us 'Taiwan'
and even the United States calls us 'Taiwan, '" Juan pointed out,
adding that it is meaningless to suggest that the nation be called
"Taiwan Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Juan stressed that Taiwan is Taiwan. In Taiwan, he went on,
everyone enjoys freedom of expression. Nevertheless, he said, if the
vice president wants to express her opinions about the nation's
official designation, she probably should have been more careful.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's three detention centers for
illegal immigrants from mainland China are overcrowded because of
Beijing's foot-dragging in taking back detainees, the chief of the
detention center in Hsinchu County said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lai Chie-yi said the Beijing authorities have stopped
repatriation operations since March 6, claiming that their only ship
assigned for this purpose was undergoing annual repairs.</P>
      <P>However, new illegal mainland immigrants continue to stream in
and the country's three detention centers in Hsinchu, Ilan and Matsu
are overflowing with a record high of 2,617 detainees, including
1,100 in the Hsinchu detention center alone, Lai said.</P>
      <P>As the summer is coming and the weather is getting warmer, the
endless wait for repatriation in the overcrowded centers has caused
unrest among the detainees, not to mention the approach of the Dragon
Boat Festival, a major Chinese festival for family reunions on the
fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Weeping is often heard among the homesick detainees during the
night and it spreads from one to the other, fueling the miserable
atmosphere at the Hsinchu center, Lai said.</P>
      <P>What is worse is the chilling of ties between Taiwan and the
mainland, which dampens the hope that the repatriation operation will
be resumed before the Dragon Boat Festival, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Lai said that all he and his crew can do is to explain the
situation to the detainees and encourage them to write or make phone
calls to their mainland families.</P>
      <P>He added that he and his staff are preparing a concert as well as
a feast for Dragon Boat Festival to try to ease the detainees'
homesickness. The hot weather also poses a severe challenge in terms
of maintaining hygiene at the overcrowded center, Lai said.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) refused to
name its representative to the Central Election Commission (CEC)
Monday to protest what it claimed is the Executive Yuan's getting
ahead of itself by naming a chief of the commission.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, deputy secretary of the KMT caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, said his party will not name a representative to
serve on the CEC as requested by the Executive Yuan, in order to
protest the Executive Yuan's appointment of Chang Cheng-hsiung as CEC
chairman before the CEC members were appointed.</P>
      <P>Huang said the CEC chairman should be elected by the CEC members,
not by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>As the Executive Yuan has made no attempt to conceal its
intention of controlling the CEC, Huang said, election problems are
sure to crop up in the year-end legislative elections, and the KMT
does not want a share of that blame by taking part in the CEC.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after the Executive Yuan, as widely
expected, named lawyer Chang Cheng-hsiung as the CEC head.</P>
      <P>The KMT opposes Chang's appointment to the politically sensitive
job, saying that Chang favors the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Also named by the Executive Yuan were ten CEC members, including
seven who are supposed to be political independents, and one each
representing the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior
and the DPP.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Executive Yuan asked the KMT, as well as
two other political parties at the legislature to each name a CEC
member.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG MAYOR SIGNS AGREEMENT ON HOSTING 8TH WORLD GAMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh signed an
agreement with the International World Games Association (IWGA)
Monday on hosting the eighth World Games in 2009.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time that Taiwan has obtained the right to
host an international multi-sports event. The World Games is the
world's second-largest multi-sports contest after the Olympic Games
and covers mainly sports that are not included in the Olympics.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports
(NCPFS) , the Kaohsiung city government, the Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee and various sports associations have made concerted efforts
over the past two years to secure the right to host the 8th World
Games.</P>
      <P>IWGA President Ron Froehlich and IWGA Secretary-General Co Korean
signed the agreement with Hsieh and NCPFS Chairman Chen Chuan-shou
in a ceremony held at the Kaohsiung city government offices in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, the 8th World Games will be held from
July 16-26, 2009, with contests in 34 sports, including billiards,
bodybuilding, bowling, boules, faustball, sports aerobics, gateball
and karate, plus three demonstration games -- croguet, Tchoukball and
dragon-boat racing.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the city government has formed a World Games
preparatory committee and is scheduled to form an organizing
committee June 1, 2005.</P>
      <P>When the 7th World Games are held in the German city of Duisburg
next summer, Hsieh said the city government will organize a
delegation to take part in a torch handover ceremony, symbolizing
Kaohsiung's formal acceptance of the mission to host the 2009 World
Games.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the central government will give full support in
assisting the city government to host the games, also known as the
"Little Olympics."</P>
      <P>The city government has designated a 6-hectare plot of land to
house a modern multi-functional stadium capable of accommodating
15,000 people. Construction of the stadium will begin this September,
Hsieh said, adding that athletes will live at I-Shou University and
National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology while
the games are taking place.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the city government will expand and renovate various
existing sporting facilities in addition to building the main
stadium. Some sporting events will be held in neighboring Kaohsiung
and Pingtung counties, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he feels proud and excited about Kaohsiung's success
in winning the right to host the games after Taipei City won the
right earlier this year to host the 2009 Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Froehlich said Taiwan has
performed well in previous World Games. After two years of careful
evaluation of Kaohsiung's general environment and infrastructure,
Froehlich said, the IWGA decided to grant the right to the city. "I'm
confident that Kaohsiung will be able to successfully host the
event," he added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Chen Shui-bian also hailed Kaohsiung
City's success in winning the right to host the 2009 World
Games, saying it will contribute to Taiwan's drive to play a more
active role in the world arena.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving Froehlich and Koren
at the Presidential Office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>After Froehlich told Chen that the IWGA has decided to grant the
right to Kaohsiung to host the 8th World Games, Chen said it is
encouraging news for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We are excited and grateful for being able to host the large
multi-sports event in 2009, " Chen said. "I wants to extend
my heartfelt thanks to the IWGA and the International Olympic
Committee (IOC)." The IWGA is under the patronage of the IOC.</P>
      <P>Noting that international sports meets provide a good platform
for forging friendships and promoting world peace, Chen said
bilateral and multilateral athletic exchanges should transcend
political barriers.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, Taiwan had often failed in its drive to host
international sporting events in the past simply because of mainland
China's opposition or boycott.</P>
      <P>"So we are very pleased to obtain the rights to host the 2009
World Games in Kaohsiung and the 2009 Deaflympics in Taipei. We
cherish these opportunities and will make every possible effort to
ensure that the events proceed smoothly," Chen assured his guests.</P>
      <P>The IWGA was founded in 1980 and the World Games is held once
every four years. Taiwan has consistently sent delegations to take
part in the World Games since its inception. In the 6th World Games
held in the Japanese city of Akita in 2001, Taiwan ranked 13th among
the 87 participating countries or areas in terms of medal count,
surpassing mainland China. Taiwan has so far won 18 gold, 13 silver
and 11 bronze medals in the previous six World Games.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIAT PLANS TO INCREASE PURCHASES OF TAIWAN-MADE AUTO PARTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-made car parts, components and
accessories have gained recognition from Italian car giant Fiat,
which has decided to increase its purchases of Taiwan-manufactured
products, an official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The official made the comment after Fiat informed the Milan
office of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) of its decision. The MOEA oversees TAITRA's operations.</P>
      <P>A delegation organized by TAITRA and composed of representatives
of 18 Taiwan companies visited nine leading automobile makers in
Europe in May in search of business opportunities.</P>
      <P>Fiat responded to the delegation's efforts by announcing that it
will start to increase its purchases of Taiwan-made car parts,
components and accessories from this year and that it will officially
include Taiwan companies in its global supply chain, the official
said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the delegation created a new image for
Taiwan manufacturers of auto parts and components among European
carmakers, who used to view Taiwan companies as only able to serve as
suppliers of repair and maintenance parts. Now, however, they see
that Taiwan makers are competitive enough to produce high quality
parts for compact vehicles, he noted.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of Taiwan by Fiat in its worldwide supply chain
will not only help Taiwan makers increase their profits, but will
also help push for technology transfers from Fiat, a TAITRA spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Fiat hopes to reduce production costs by purchasing Taiwan-made
parts and components, which are cheaper than goods produced by
Italian companies, the spokesman said, adding that the Italian
carmaker has suffered losses over the past two years and wishes to
become profitable by setting up cooperative ventures with Taiwan
suppliers.</P>
      <P>The Fiat group puts out about 2 million sedans annually and
employs 16,000 workers in 192 plants across the world. It recorded a
business turnover of 47 billion euros for 2003, with losses of 500
million euros as a result of its heavy reliance on Italian suppliers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC LAWMAKERS TO VISIT U.S. MILITARY BASES FOR ARMS PROCUREMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will arrange for a group
of Taiwan lawmakers to visit major U.S. military bases later this
week to seek their support for a huge budget for Taiwan's new arms
procurement projects, government sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to an itinerary revealed by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the legislative delegation will also meet with senior
officials of the U.S. National Security Council, the Department of
State and the Department of Defense, in addition to visiting a U.S.
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft base and a Patriot PAC-III
missile base.</P>
      <P>At the U.S. invitation, the 14-member delegation of lawmakers
from across the political spectrum, led by Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng, will leave for Hawaii Thursday.</P>
      <P>The delegation will first visit the U.S. Pacific Command in
Hawaii to receive a briefing on the general regional security
situation and visit a P-3C anti-submarine aircraft base.</P>
      <P>The delegation will then travel to Washington, D.C. via San
Francisco. In the company of ROC Representative to the United States
Chen Chien-Jen, the delegation will visit relevant U.S.
administrative departments June 21 and exchange views with their
senior officials on Taiwan's defense needs.</P>
      <P>On the following day, the delegation will be briefed on special
functions of the weaponry systems that the United States intends to
sell to Taiwan. The mission will also meet with U.S. congressmen
before leaving for Texas June 24 to visit a U.S. Patriot PAC-III
missile base. The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei June
28.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has approved a special military budget of NT$610.8
billion (US$18.2 billion) for the purchase of advanced weaponry from
the United States amid mounting mainland Chinese military threats.</P>
      <P>The draft budget calls for the procurement of eight submarines, a
modified version of the Patriot PAC-III anti-missile system and a
squadron of 12 P3-C anti-submarine aircraft over a 15-year period
starting in 2005. The United States offered to sell the military
hardware to Taiwan in 2001 as part of its most comprehensive arms
package to the island since 1992.</P>
      <P>The special budget bill is now pending approval of the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As many lawmakers have criticized the proposed submarine
procurement project as being too expensive, Defense Minister Lee Jye
met with Legislative Yuan President Wang Monday to brief him on a new
two-stage budget plan formula for the submarine deal.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes the legislature will pass the draft budget plan
for the eight submarines first, to allow the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) to negotiate detailed terms with the United States.</P>
      <P>The MND will furnish the legislature a more detailed budget plan
after it comes to a conclusion with the U.S. authorities on how the
eight submarines will be built, Lee said. There could be three
options for construction of the submarines -- U.S. contractors could
build them, they could cooperate with other foreign contractors, or
they could cooperate with Taiwan's China Shipbuilding Corporation
(CSBC) . It has been estimated that the cost will increase by NT$80
billion if Taiwan insists on the CSBC participating in the
construction.</P>
      <P>Wang said this two-stage budget plan formula might be more
acceptable to lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Members of Wang's mission will include three legislators
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, three from the
opposition Kuomintang, four from the opposition People First Party,
two from the Taiwan Solidarity Union and two independent lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The legislature went into summer recess last Friday and it
remains uncertain whether the legislature will call an extra session
to screen the draft arms procurement budget bill.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of the Taiwan Foundation
for Democracy marked a milestone in Taiwan's democratization and
represented Taiwan's ability to feed back to the international
community, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang, who chairs the foundation, made the remarks at a tea party
to celebrate the foundation's third anniversary and the inauguration
of its new office. The foundation, set up by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, is composed of 15 representatives from political parties,
non-government organizations and the academic, business and
government sectors.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen, foreign diplomats
stationed in Taiwan, and scores of foreign dignitaries, including
Carl Gershman, president of the United States-based National
Endowment for Democracy, and Charles Zorgbibe, head of the
international relations institute at Paris University, also took part
in the activity.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he feels deeply honored to chair the non-partisan,
non-profit foundation, which has over the past few years helped
promote Taiwan's exchanges with parliamentarians and political
parties of other countries.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the purpose of the foundation is to upgrade
Taiwan's democracy, economy and security -- key segments of the
country's overall national strategy -- and to create a transparent
and institutionalized mechanism based on national consensus to help
further strengthen human rights and democracy across the country and
around the world.</P>
      <P>Gershman hailed Taiwan's resolve to advocate democracy and said
that the United States views this as a very important trait of the
country.</P>
      <P>Zorgbibe said that Taiwan's success in democratization
underscores a lack of democracy in mainland China and he criticized
harshly the timidity displayed by various European countries in their
dealings with Taiwan, which has shown a great deal of new thinking in
universally recognized values and democracy.</P>
      <P>Pro-democracy activists in Europe have the responsibility to
correct this mindset by pushing European institutions to work with
Taiwan in the promotion of democracy around the world, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GROUP OF SCHOLARS OPPOSE ARMS PURCHASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of scholars spoke out Monday
against the government's plan to purchase NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) in arms from the United States.</P>
      <P>Lin Shen-ching, executive director of the Democracy Action
Alliance, said the huge price tag for the arms would certainly
squeeze out other government budgets and that the money could be
better used in places besides acquiring weapons.</P>
      <P>Lin said his group would support the armed forces' request to
maintain a significant capability to wage war, but would not agree to
finance this with a special budget that is not subject to legal
restrictions on the government's capability of raising money via
loans.</P>
      <P>Noting that rising tensions across the Taiwan Strait is
aproblem for the nation, Lin said instead of defusing the crisis,
arms purchases will add fuel to the fire and increase the likelihood
of a conflict, when this could be avoided through political
maneuvering.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ta-ling, a professor at National Chung Cheng University in
Chiayi and convener of the alliance, said the arms purchase betrays
President Chen Shui-bian's lack of trust in his own power and his
reliance on the protection of the United States.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he is pessimistic about the possibility that the
Legislative Yuan will strike down the budget, especially since Wang
Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative Yuan, is set to travel to the
United States at the head of a group of lawmakers. Wang and the
lawmakers are certainly going to be influenced by their American
hosts on the issue.</P>
      <P>The two said their alliance will hold a forum to discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of the purchases, and will protest the
purchases on June 20.</P>
      <P>The arms purchases, covering 388 PAC-III missiles, eight
submarines and 12 P-3C anti-submarine airplanes, will take 15 years
for delivery, if the deal is successfully concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEVELOPMENT OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June 13 (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar from a Taiwan think tank said
Sunday that he is optimistic about the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and that a new situation can emerge as a result of
positive exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, executive director of the Institute for National
Policy Research, made the remarks when he met with overseas Chinese
in London to discuss Taiwan's political situation and future
development.</P>
      <P>Lo, who is an associate professor at Soochow University in
Taipei, said that Beijing's present approach entails applying
pressure on Taiwan via the United States, and although it harbors
some hope in this regard, it knows it cannot depend on Washington.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen Shui-bian won a second term in the March 20
presidential election, he said, Beijing has started to think
seriously about Taiwan public opinion and he added that Taiwan should
also start to understand why Beijing continues to insist on its "one
China" principle.</P>
      <P>On the domestic situation in Taiwan, Lo said that although some
quarters played up the "ethnic issue" during the presidential
election campaign, politics in Taiwan have returned to normal.</P>
      <P>He noted that all the major political parties in Taiwan face the
problem of generational transfer and the integration of factions
within the various parties, and are bracing for the year-end
legislative elections, which he said shows that the democratic system
is still the best way to sort out problems in the country.</P>
      <P>Lai Yi-chung, a researcher at the Taiwan Thinktank, also said
that the political landscape will become much clearer after the
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, there are no national identity questions in
Taiwan's political parties and that the question now is the status of
Taiwan in the Asia-Pacific region and the values on which the nation
was founded.</P>
      <P>Tung Cheng-yuan, an associate researcher at the Institute of
International Relations of National Chengchi University, said that
while both sides of the Taiwan Strait have made some policy
concessions in the past, they have come to nothing because of a lack
of mutual trust.</P>
      <P>He predicted that there will be positive exchanges after six
months or one year and that economic exchanges will become even
closer.</P>
      <P>The three scholars, who came to London with Examination Yuan
President Yao Chia-wen, made the remarks after attending a workshop
jointly organized by the Asia Research Centre at the London School of
Economics and Political Science, Taiwan's Institute for National
Policy Research and the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER SPEAKS TO OVERSEAS CHINESE IN LOS ANGLES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, June 13 (CNA)
(By L. S. Chu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Justice
Chen Ding-nan on Sunday criticized a demand by opposition parties to
form acommittee within the Legislative Yuan to investigate the
election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in Los Angeles Sunday to take part in the 2004
conference of the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) ,
made the remarks when he spoke to overseas Chinese on the political
situation after the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>President Chen won the election by a small margin of 29,518 votes
out of the more than 13 million cast. The opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party has since
demanded a re-count of the ballots and the formation of a committee
to investigate the March 19 shooting, which it believes unfairly
swayed the bitterly contested election in Chen's favor. Both Chen and
Lu were slightly injured during the shooting while canvassing in
Tainan, a stronghold of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>He said that the demand for a committee to be formed within the
Legislative Yuan would not only encroach on the investigative rights
of the Control Yuan as stipulated in the ROC Constitution, but would
also interfere with the investigative rights of judicial authorities.
Police have few leads and no suspects in the shooting so far.</P>
      <P>He noted that the U.S. Congress has the right to conduct
investigations, but there are no such rights in Taiwan's Legislative
Yuan, because the Constitution gives this power to the Control Yuan.
The Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, has already
begun looking into possible lapses by civil servants, and parts of
the ongoing investigation will be announced soon.</P>
      <P>As for criminal responsibility, he said that the perpetrator of
the shooting is still at large, and whether there is negligence of
any civil servants is under investigation.</P>
      <P>Chen also talked about the legitimacy of holding the referendum
and presidential election on the same day, and explained the
activation of the heightened alert status due to the shooting.</P>
      <P>The opposition criticized the activation of the heightened alert,
saying that it had prevented many military and police personnel,
traditionally the supporters of the "pan-blue alliance," from leaving
their posts to vote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH DEPARTMENT DRAFTS 5-YEAR PLAN TO PREVENT SUICIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health has come up with a
five-year plan to reduce the incidence of suicide, which has become
one of Taiwan's top 10 causes of death, Minister Chen Chien-jen said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference where Chen unveiled Taiwan's top 10
killers for 2003, he said the five-year plan will call for an outlay
of NT$700 million for establishing mental health counseling centers
in various cities and counties and stepping up prevention and control
of depression.</P>
      <P>Chen said the health department has referred the five-year
suicide prevention and control plan to the Cabinet for approval.</P>
      <P>According to health department tallies, 3,195 local citizens
committed suicide in 2003, marking an increase of 142 people from a
year ago and making suicide the nation's ninth cause of death.</P>
      <P>It was the seventh consecutive year that suicide has made the top
10 killers list. An average of nine people killed themselves each day
in 2003 or one person committed suicide every two hours and 45
minutes.</P>
      <P>In terms of gender, men accounted for 67 percent of those who
died from suicide last year for an annual growth rate of 2.03
percent, and women accounting for the remaining 33 percent for a
major jump of 10.54 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>By age, those aged under 24 accounted for 7.53 percent of those
who killed themselves; those aged between 25 and 44 made up 39.86
percent; those in the age group of 45 to 64 accounted for 33.51
percent; and those aged 65 or over made up 23.75 percent.</P>
      <P>The suicide growth rate was the steepest among senior citizens
(aged over 65) at 6.9 percent; followed by 4.5 percent for the 45 to
64 age group, 3.7 percent for the 25 to 44 age group and 3.6 percent
for those aged under 24.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, suicide was the second-largest killer for those who
died young (15 to 24 years old) last year, the top three killer for
those who died between 25 and 44 years of age and the seventh killer
for those who died at the age of 45 to 64.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the continued rise in suicide to two major causes
-- progress in the suicide reporting system and the rising incidence
of depression.</P>
      <P>Noting that early discovery and proper counseling are important
work in suicide prevention, Chen said the health department hopes to
set up mental health counseling centers in each city and county to
facilitate necessary assistance to depression patients and curtail a
further rise in the suicide rate.</P>
      <P>"If the Cabinet approves our five-year plan, the health
department will invest up to NT$700 million over the next five years
to promote mental health and prevent depression and suicide, " Chen
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR GIVES SPEECH AT WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM MEETING IN SEOUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said that Asian
economies should seek to minimize the impact of non-economic factors
and that Taiwan should not be excluded from the region's economic
integration, according to a press release issued Monday by the Taipei
city government's Department of Information.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while giving a speech on the outlook for
Asian economies at a meeting held by the World Economic Forum (WEF)
in Seoul, the South Korean capital, the statement said. The meeting,
the Asia Strategic Insight Roundtable, opened late Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that the information industry plays a key role in
Asia's economic recovery and that it must be obtained through a full
economic integration in the region. That is the reason why Taiwan
should not be precluded from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum or any such integration in the region, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the development of Asian economies should not be
hindered by political or social uncertainties and that countries in
the region should do their best to minimize the adverse impact of
non-economic factors on this front.</P>
      <P>For the time being, the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula
are the leading flash points in the world, and peace in the two
regions constitutes the precondition for steady economic progress in
Asia, the Taipei mayor said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, President Chen Shui-bian's second inaugural
address on May 20 has helped reduce tensions across the Strait, but
the crisis has not be fully diluted. Asian countries should be happy
to see Taiwan and mainland China open constructive dialogue to settle
their disputes, he added.</P>
      <P>The two-day meeting -- a regional session of the WEF -- drew more
than 100 government officials and corporate executives from 21
countries to take part.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen will travel to the United States Wednesday to attend the
2004 World Forum in Colorado.</P>
      <P>Chen said he would attend the event while speaking at an informal
gathering for the first anniversary of the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy, an organization promoted by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and supported by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The World Forum is an annual conference of government officials,
legislators, business and financial leaders and academics, which is

      <P>Chen said that he was invited by U.S. Vice President Dick

      <P>Chen is expected to stay in the U.S. for a week before returning
home. Afterward, he plans to travel to Europe in July to chair a
meeting of the chiefs of Taiwan's representative offices in the
region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said on the same occasion that the ministry hopes
that the donations to Costa Rica will be put to their designated
purposes, although Taiwan respects the decisions of the Central
American nation.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to an AFP report that said five
conservative Costa Rican legislators have accused their foreign
minister, Roberto Tovar, of diverting funds donated by the Taiwanese
government for unauthorized uses.</P>
      <P>The report quoted the legislators as saying that the foreign
ministry had diverted some US$4.8 million in funds from Taiwan
intended to develop trade and tourism in Costa Rica to pay foreign
ministry salaries and bonuses.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan has always been clear about its financial
aid to other countries, and "soft assistance" plans are usually used
on such items as trade and tourism.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan respects the wishes of the recipients, it hopes
that they will not divert money randomly in such a way as to

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HAILS SUCCESS IN WINNING RIGHT TO HOST 2009 WORLD GAMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian hailed Kaohsiung
City's success Monday in winning the right to host the 2009 World
Games, saying it will contribute to Taiwan's drive to play a more
active role in the world arena.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving Ron Froehlich, president of
the International World Games Association (IWGA), and Co Koren, IWGA
secretary-general, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Froehlich and Koren told Chen that after two years of extensive
evaluations, the IWGA has decided to grant the right to Kaohsiung
to host the 8th World Games.</P>
      <P>"This is encouraging news for us, " Chen said. "We are excited
and grateful for being able to host the large multi-sports event
in 2009."</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Republic of China government and people, Chen
said, he wants to extend his heartfelt thanks to the IWGA and the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) . The IWGA is under the
patronage of the IOC.</P>
      <P>Noting that international sports meets provide a good platform
for forging friendships and promoting world peace, Chen said
bilateral and multilateral athletic exchanges should transcend
political barriers.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, Taiwan had often failed in its drive to host
international sporting events in the past simply because of mainland
China's opposition or boycott.</P>
      <P>"So we are very pleased to obtain the rights to host the 2009
World Games in Kaohsiung and the 2009 Deaflympics in Taipei. We
cherish these opportunities and will make every possible effort to
ensure that the events proceed smoothly," Chen assured his guests.</P>
      <P>The IWGA was founded in 1980 and the World Games is held once
every four years. It is now the world's second-largest international
sporting event after the Olympics. The World Games cover more than 30
sports that are not included in the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has consistently sent delegations to take part in the
World Games since its inception. In the 6th World Games held in
the Japanese city of Akita in 2001, Taiwan ranked 13th among
the 87 participating countries or areas in terms of medal count,
surpassing mainland China. The 7th World Games will be held in
Duisburg, Germany in 2005.</P>
      <P>Chen told the two IWGA executives that Kaohsiung, Taiwan's
largest commercial port and second-largest city, has modern sports
facilities. Moreover, he said, the southern Taiwan city's mass rapid
transit system will be completed by the time the 2009 World Games
take place.</P>

      <P>When it comes to getting an overseas
diploma, the Ministry of Education warned Monday that if it looks too
good to be true, it probably is.</P>
      <P>Education officials said that ads that falsely claim that degrees
can be obtained from overseas universities or institutes quicker than
usual are violating regulations governing consumer protection and
that the Consumers' Foundation has started investigating several
alleged instances of fraud.</P>
      <P>They urged those who want to study overseas be on guard to avoid
being duped, and reminded that those who sell diplomas or hold forged
documents will be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said that there are a number of methods of
obtaining a degree from an overseas institute or university that are
not recognized in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>First, degrees obtained via correspondence learning are not
recognized. Similarly, degrees are not accepted whereby the credits
from distance learning are greater than one-third of the total
credits earned from actual overseas attendance. Those who obtain
diplomas from a Taiwan branch of an overseas school where the branch
has not been officially recognized are not valid. Lastly, diplomas
from overseas schools that were received by taking classes
exclusively in Taiwan under the commission of a foreign institute are
not recognized.</P>
      <P>The officials urged Taiwan students overseas to have their
diplomas sent to a Republic of China embassy or representative
office for verification after their graduation so that the
documents can be verified.</P>
      <P>The officials made the appeal as thousands of new undergraduates
in Taiwan are mulling studying abroad this summer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME TO START SECOND PHASE OF BUILDING DEMOCRACY: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is time for Taiwan to begin the second
phase of building democracy now that the concept has firmly taken
root in the country, President Chen Shui-bian said Monday.</P>
      <P>The first wave of establishing democracy was to empower the
people with their rights as citizens and protect Taiwan's national
identity, President Chen said in his speech at a ceremony marking the
first anniversary of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>In the second wave -- assuring that democracy matures -- Chen
said the country should strive to build Taiwan into a society bound
by civil rights and a sense of national community.</P>
      <P>"How to enable Taiwan to build a partnership of values with the
international community will be the major task of the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen delivered the keynote speech at the ceremony, which also
marked the opening of the new building for the non-profit
organization initiated by the president in 2002.</P>
      <P>President Chen broached the idea of establishing such a
foundation to promote Taiwan's democratization experience and to
share democratic values with other countries during a high-level
meeting held in Sanchih, Taipei County Feb. 9, 2002.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy was formally established on
June 17, 2003, with Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng elected
chairman at the first joint meeting of the board of directors and
supervisors, while then-Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien was
elected as its vice chairman and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
Michael Y. M. Kau was appointed as its chief executive officer.</P>
      <P>In his speech delivered Monday, Chen said that the establishment
of the foundation represented a milestone in the country's democratic
development. The foundation is the first of its kind in Asia and the
fourth in the world, only after similar foundations were set up in
the United States, Great Britain and Germany, he noted.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan are obliged to other governments and peoples
around the world for their support and assistance rendered to Taiwan
when the country was proceeding with democratic reforms, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Today, democracy has become the core value of the people on
Taiwan and their source of pride, Chen said, adding that Taiwan will
increase exchanges with other democratic nations and share its
democratization experience with them through the foundation so that
"made-in-Taiwan" democracy and human rights ideals will be
disseminated to every corner around the world.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which has been financed by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and has been operated transparently and in a
supra-party cooperation form, has also made exceptional contributions
at home over the last year, including the nurturing of legislative
aides, the research of initiation and referendum mechanisms and
supporting democratization activities around the world, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST TAIWANESE GRADUATE OF USMA AT WEST POINT COMMISSIONED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first Taiwanese graduate of the United
States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point and three other
Taiwanese graduates of U.S. military academies were commissioned by
the Chinese Military Academy (CMA) in Fengshan, Kaohsiung Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Wu-ling, as well as Chang Ya-chin and Hsiung Ming-jung of
Norwich University, and Lee Pei-chun of Virginia Military Institute,
were commissioned as second lieutenants in the Republic of China Army
at a ceremony presided over by CMA President Yang Kuo-chiang.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, Lee expressed his appreciation for the
government's assistance, saying that he would do his utmost to serve
the country.</P>
      <P>Lee, 23, graduated from the USMA at West Point in May after
studying there for four years. He had studied in the CMA for one year
before passing the recruitment tests of the American Institute of
Taiwan (AIT) , which represents U.S. interests in the absence of
diplomatic ties, to attend the USMA.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he worked hard to overcome the language barrier at
first. He noted that studying at the USMA and at the CMA is basically
the same, although the facilities are different.</P>
      <P>He noted that perhaps because of cultural differences, the USMA
at West Point has a more lively approach, focusing on academic and
physical fitness education, while the CMA attaches greater importance
to military discipline.</P>
      <P>Lee and the other three graduates will now be sent to specialized
military schools, with Lee Wu-ling Chang and Hsiung studying in
artillery, and Lee Pei-chun specializing in communications.</P>
      <P>Twelve USMA cadets at West Point who came to the CMA at the end
of May, marking the first time USMA cadets have entered and lived on
the CMA campus, also attended the commission ceremony. They will
return to the United States after the CMA's 80th anniversary Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, CMA President Yang said that he is
honored to commission the students returning from U.S. military
academies this year, or the 80th anniversary of the CMA, which was
established in Whampoa, Guangzhou, in 1924, with the late president
Chiang Kai-shek as the inaugural president of the academy.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the CMA moved to Taiwan, 92 cadets of the
school have graduated from military academies in the United States or
other countries, and served in various departments, which he said
shows that the nurturing of young talent in the ROC Army is moving in
the right direction.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the four students will make good use
of their specialities, be modest and learn the needs of the army, and
never forget their duty, honor and country.</P>
      <P>Robert Van Horn, army program officer of the Taipei Office of the
AIT, conferred USMA admission to Chiang Chi-feng, whose mother
accepted it on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a freshman at the CMA, is scheduled to go to the USMA at
West Point this summer to follow in the footsteps of Lee and two
other CMA students, Wu Chi-ting and Hung Wan-ting, who are currently
studying at the academy and are set to graduate in 2006 and 2007,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Van Horn congratulated the students and their families during the
ceremony, saying that he himself was commissioned in the United
States 31 years ago. he also said that he felt honored to introduce
Taiwan students to the United States.</P>
      <P>With Lee graduating and Chiang following his footsteps, he said
that the USMA at West Point and the CMA are now studying exchanges
and cooperation in the future.</P>
      <P>The USMA began to recruit foreign students from Asia in 2000
through the United States' liaison offices aboard. The AIT has
conducted a serious of recruitment tests for the USMA 0 the CMA since
then.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are two CMA students studying at the USMA at
West Point, with another 11 students studying at other military
academies in the United States and one in Honduras.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Exports of fresh mangoes from Tainan
County, southern Taiwan are expected to grow twofold to threefold
this year, thanks to the establishment of a new anti-pest facility, a
local farmers' association reported Monday.</P>
      <P>A heat/steam facility -- an efficient and crucial design to
eliminate mango's natural killer, the fruit fry -- is scheduled to
become operational Wednesday, serving as a shot in the arm for mango
growers and exporters in Tainan County, which is the major mango
producing area in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The facility will not only help kill fruit fries, it will also
help extend the shelf life of mangoes and other fruits, an official
from the Tsuochen Farmers' Association said.</P>
      <P>The heat/steam facility -- built in a farmers' association
building in the rural township of Tsuochen, Tainan County with
financial support from Japan's Mitsubishi Group -- is expected to
help increase mango exports from Tainan County to Japan this year to
some 1,400 tons, an amount about three times that of previous years,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Tainan County as a whole is also expected to export 400-500 tons
of mangoes to South Korea this year, and several hundreds of tons to
Hong Kong and mainland China as well, the official said.</P>
      <P>The period between June 15 and the end of August is the major
mango harvest period.</P>
      <P>The amount designated for export will still only be a small
portion of the entire mongo production in Taiwan, according to the
farmers' association.</P>
      <P>Tainan County produces about 60 percent of all the mangoes in
Taiwan. Mangoes are also grown in the southern counties of Kaohsiung

    <HEADLINE>BUSH SIGNS BILL ON HELPING TAIWAN GAIN WHA OBSERVER STATUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George Bush signed into
law a Senate bill Monday aimed at pushing for observer status for
Taiwan in the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the policy-making body
of the World Health Organization -- according to White House
officials.</P>
      <P>Bush's signing of the bill, S 2092, passed unanimously by the
Senate May 6, makes support for Taiwan's WHO bid a long-term U.S.
policy, and is seen as a shot in the arm for Taiwan's longstanding
efforts to take part in the activities of the WHO.</P>
      <P>In a statement on the signing of the bill into law, President
Bush said that the United States fully supports the participation of
Taiwan in the work of the World Health Organization, including
observer status.</P>
      <P>"The United States has expressed publicly its firm support for
Taiwan's observer status and will continue to do so, " Bush said.</P>
      <P>Bush said in the statement that the U.S. government's "one China"
policy -- under which Washington supports eventually reunification of
Taiwan and China but opposes bringing about that outcome by force --
remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>The bill, initiated by Sen. George Ellen (R-Va.), authorizes the
Bush administration to support and assist Taiwan's bid to obtain
observer status at the annual conference of the WHA. Sen. Ellen is a
co-chairman of the U.S. Taiwan Caucus, which is a pro-Taiwan group in
Congress.</P>
      <P>The bill, introduced jointly by 13 senators for a vote by the
full Senate, was first approved by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee April 29.</P>
      <P>According to the bill, the U.S. secretary of state is required to
submit a non-confidential report to Congress before every April 1
detailing measures the U.S. government has taken to help Taiwan gain
observer status in the WHA.</P>
      <P>The bill also requests that the secretary of state submit an
unclassified report to Congress within 30 days after the passage of
the bill and before every April 1 describing the plans and measures
the U.S. administration has taken to help Taiwan gain observer status
in the WHA.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives on April 21 passed a
similar bill 416-0 to express its support for Taiwan joining the WHA
as an observer.</P>
      <P>The House bill calls on the secretary of state to report to
Congress annually on progress toward developing and implementing the
plan to help Taiwan enter the WHO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan tried for the eighth straight year to gain observer status
in the WHA at its annual gathering this past May but failed again,
despite an increasing number of nations publicly voicing their
support for Taiwan, including Japan and the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOBS, POLITICS WORRY ASIANS MORE THAN HEALTH: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   June  15  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Asian health survey covering
Thailand, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, peninsular Malaysia and Singapore
shows that jobs and politics worry Asians more than their health.</P>
      <P>The survey results, issued recently in Singapore, indicate that
rising levels of stress stemming from anxiety over growing regional
unemployment, political instability, criminal and juvenile violence
have resulted in citizens'putting health needs in the back seat.</P>
      <P>Keeping Asians awake at night was the fear of an economic
slowdown sweeping across the Asian region and the fear of
unemployment, mostly in Taiwan (78%) , China (64%) and Hong Kong
(61%).</P>
      <P>Health matters ranked seventh among priority concerns among
Asians surveyed in the six countries. Top of the list was
unemployment, rising crime rates, drug abuse and political
instability, followed by pollution and corruption.</P>
      <P>Highest stress levels were found in mainland China (53%), Taiwan
(51%), Singapore (43%) and Hong Kong (42%). Lowest stress levels were
in peninsular Malaysia and Thailand, with 30% of their populations
saying they were stressed. Workplace stress dominated in Hong Kong,
the mainland and Singapore while financial worries weighed down Thais
and Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Significantly, the survey found that 60% of students aged 15 to
20 experienced stress. Singapore, peninsular Malaysia and Thailand
chalked up the most stressed students -- Singapore (66%) peninsular
Malaysia (61%), Thailand (61%), the mainland (59%), Taiwan (58%) and
Hong Kong (52%) . Parents who suffered'child education stress'was
highest in the mainland (10%) , Singapore (9%) with Thailand and
peninsular Malaysia at the lowest, with 1%. Study stress experienced
by students was highest on the mainland and in Taiwan (7%), followed
by Singapore, peninsular Malaysia and Thailand, with 5% each.</P>
      <P>Child-related stress experienced by parents was highest in
Singapore (11%) followed by the mainland (6%) and Taiwan (5%). Family
problems rated highest in Thailand (17%) followed by Hong Kong (11%)
and Singapore/peninsular Malaysia (10%).</P>
      <P>An estimated 4,700 adults aged 15 and above from China, Hong
Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan participated in the
second BRAND's Asian Health Survey (BAHS II) , from late 2003 to
early 2004. The survey aims to understand the health concerns and
gauge the general well-being of Asians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR AMENDMENT TO LAW GIVING LEGISLATURE UNDUE POWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged lawmakers of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Executive Yuan
Tuesday to study a way to curtail the legislature's newly gained
power, which interferes with the Executive Yuan's right to name the
chiefs of five independent government agencies.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the DPP's Central Standing Committee,
the president said the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has
encroached on the power of the Executive Yuan by inserting a
provision into the Basic Law for the Organization of the Central
Government to give itself the power to approve the Executive Yuan's
nomination of chiefs to the Central Election Commission, the Central
Bank of China, the Fair Trade Commission, and the commissions for
financial supervision and for communications.</P>
      <P>Noting that the law is a milestone in his party's efforts to
reorganize the government, the president expressed regret that the
legislature expanded its power at the cost of the Executive Yuan
while enacting the law.</P>
      <P>Instead of asking the Executive Yuan to return the law passed
June 11 to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration, which is
tantamount to a veto of the whole legislation, Chen suggested that
DPP lawmakers and the Executive Yuan address this part through a
revision to the law.</P>
      <P>Vowing that his government will not compromise its goal of
reorganizing the central government, he urged the DPP, of which he is
chairman, to sort the issue out as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, Chen urged a group of chiefs of DPP branch offices
in various counties and cities to help the party win a majority at
the Legislative Yuan in the year-end legislative elections, to cement
the party's status as the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang
and People First Party failed to sway voters in the March 20
presidential election, in spite of its campaign promises that would
have cost the country a fortune to realize, Chen said his party will
win the legislative elections through its core values rather than
through empty promises.</P>
      <P>Having won the presidential election by a narrow majority, Chen
said he is confident that his party will ride on the coattails of his
success to also win a majority in the legislature.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The mass-circulation United Daily News was
cleared of a charge of slander Tuesday in a case brought against it
by Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court let stand a lower court decision to throw
out Hsieh's charge, despite Hsieh's appeal, and to close the whole
case.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed regret at the decision against him, claiming that
he respected the court's decision but adding that the United Daily
News should be ashamed of itself for what he claimed was "abusing
the freedom of the press."</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-mayor claimed that the newspaper was supported
by the opposition Kuomintang during that party's five-decade rule of
the country and has helped the party in its vain attempts to
suffocate the country's democratic campaign.</P>
      <P>Now, he claimed, the paper is carrying on its attacks against
former political dissidents who are now the leaders of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, which is far beyond the freedom of the
press, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh brought the case against the paper after it carried an
editorial in April last year questioning Hsieh's integrity and
lambasting prosecutors for not probing Hsieh's role in a financial
scandal involving one of his aides.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian stressed Tuesday
the importance of strengthening Taiwan's defense capability and the
necessity of buying such weapons as Patriot anti-missile systems,
submarines and anti-submarine planes from the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a meeting with Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng, who will lead a legislative delegation
Wednesday on a visit to the United States to discuss the arms
procurement plan with U.S. officials.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan presented a budget plan to the legislature
earlier this month worth NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) to buy
defense weapons from the United States. However, the budget plan was
not included on the June 10 agenda of the Legislative Yuan for
screening due to differing opinions from opposition lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Prior to his U.S. visit, Wang noted that the weapons procurement
plan is based on the interests of the nation and is not expected to
have anything to do with the re-election campaign of U.S. President
George W. Bush.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun called Tuesday for
revisions to relevant key laws in an extra legislative session in
order to pave the way for bilateral talks with the United States on
signing a free trade agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks to Ker Chien-ming, a whip of the legislative
caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, during a meeting
of the party's policy-making Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Yu, who heads an Executive Yuan task force aimed at pushing for
strategic alliances with friendly countries, told Ker that the
Cabinet is seeking to ink an FTA with the United States and he asked
for legislative support to include adjustments to several key laws on

    <TEXT>
      <P>After winning the right
to host the 8th World Games in 2009, the Kaohsiung city government
decided Tuesday to organize various sports competitions prior to
2009, as a warm up for the World Games.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lin Yung-chien made the announcement at a
preparatory meeting for the World Games a day after Kaohsiung Mayor
Frank Hsieh signed an agreement with International World Games
Association (IWGA) President Ron Froehlich to host the games.</P>
      <P>It is the first time Taiwan has obtained the right to host the
World Games, an international multi-sports event organized by the
International World Games Association (IWGA) under the patronage of
the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</P>
      <P>The World Games, held once every four years, consists of official
and invitational events selected from those not included in the
Olympic Games. Unlike the Olympics, participating athletes at the
World Games are representatives selected by the International
Federation of each sport, not by their countries.</P>
      <P>Lin, Froehlich, IWGA Secretary-General Co Koren, and officials
from the Cabinet-level National Council on Physical Fitness and
Sports (NCPFS), attended Tuesday's meeting.</P>
      <P>Froehlich said he was very impressed by the efficiency of the
Kaohsiung city government and the confidence it showed in its ability
to host the games.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lin also made quick and positive responses to
Froehlich's proposals, including the setting up of a Chinese-English
Web site for the games, the formation of a World Games office, and
the selection of sports executives to be in charge of the hardware
and software of stadiums.</P>
      <P>Lin added that the Kaohsiung city government will also allow the
public to gain a better understanding of the newest sports popular
around the world through various channels, and will hold "sports
carnivals" in Kaohsiung every summer prior to 2009.</P>
      <P>Froehlich also suggested that the city government send a
delegation to watch the 2005 World Games to be held in Duisburg,
Germany.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu urged Beijing Tuesday to sign an agreement with Taiwan
on the repatriation of illegal mainland Chinese immigrants detained
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu made the appeal after an inspection tour of the Hsinchu
illegal mainland immigrant detention center in northern Taiwan. It
was Wu's first visit to the center since he became Taiwan's top
mainland policy planner a month ago.</P>
      <P>Wu said that illegal immigration involves many complicated
issues. "We hope the Beijing authorities can face up to these issues
squarely and adopt effective measures to prevent mainland people from
illegally coming to Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's three special detention centers have become
overcrowded by the large number of illegal mainland immigrants, Wu
said Beijing should negotiate an agreement with Taiwan to address the
issue once and for all.</P>
      <P>Twelve detainees at the Hsinchu detention center have recently
delivered babies and 16 others are pregnant, adding even further to
the workload for staff at the center.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival -- one of the major
festivals in the Chinese calendar -- Wu said, the mainland
authorities should take back those "homesick" detainees out of
humanitarian considerations.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's three detention centers in Hsinchu, Ilan and
Matsu accommodate more than 2,500 illegal mainland immigrants,
including 1,100 in the Hsinchu detention center alone.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL AIRLINES POSTPONE AIR TICKET HIKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several domestic airlines decided Tuesday
to postpone planned additional fuel surcharges on passenger flight
prices from June 16 to July 1.</P>
      <P>The decision was made through urgent coordination by the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) among local carriers, and the
postponement will involve only domestic airlines, with foreign
carriers going ahead with the plan, according to a high-ranking CAA
official.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-szu, a session deputy chief of the CAA under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, had said earlier in
the day at a meeting attended by several lawmakers, executives of
domestic airlines, representatives of tourism agencies and officials
of the Cabinet-level Consumer Protection Commission, that he would
undertake the coordination among domestic airlines and urge them to
postpone the price hike.</P>
      <P>A tourism agency representative noted at the meeting that the CAA
has approved, in just three days, the airlines' plan to charge fuel
surcharges, which has left travel agents with insufficient time to
react and has created strong opposition from customers.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hong-chun of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) expressed dissatisfaction with the plan, saying that the CAA
approved the plan in just three working days and claiming that it was
done without strict examination and investigation.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Pang Chien-kuo lamented that civil aviation law
has no regulations on surcharges that carriers can impose on
customers and added that he and his PFP colleagues will work for an
amendment to the law in order to protect the interests of customers.</P>
      <P>However, Chen noted that the CAA can only receive airlines'
solicitations for ticket price hike but has no right to reject them.
He added that he will coordinate among domestic carriers and urge
them to postpone the price hike.</P>
      <P>The CAA approved last week the applications presented by several
airlines, including China Airlines (CAL), EVA Airways Corp., Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd., to impose a fuel surcharge on customers ranging
from US$5 to US$14 as a way of reflecting the mounting international
oil prices.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian unveiled six goals
for the police Tuesday, saying that his administration's agenda
depends heavily on their achieving the six goals.</P>
      <P>In a written letter of congratulations to the nation's policemen
on Police Day, Chen said the reforms pursued by his government in the
fields of politics, the economy, finance, the judiciary and society
need the support and cooperation of the police and this support and
cooperation is their first goal.</P>
      <P>As peace and order is vital to the country's economic
development, the president said the country will have difficulty
boosting its economy if it cannot maintain public security, therefore
good public order should be the second goal.</P>
      <P>The third goal, the president said, should be for the police to
improve their competence in enforcing the law and sticking to the
letter of the law while carrying out their jobs.</P>
      <P>The fourth goal is to tap into the abundant private resources to
check crime.</P>
      <P>The fifth is to improve police department efficiency and upgrade
services to the public, while the sixth is for the police to maintain

    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental, educational reform and
student activists will take to the streets Saturday to protest
against the government's new massive military procurement project,
sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Chung-hsun, the chief executive officer of the Nuclear-free
Taiwan Alliance, said the planned protest march is aimed at forcing
the government to give up its NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) plan
to purchase advanced weaponry systems from the United States.</P>
      <P>Ho said many private groups dedicated to promoting environmental
protection and educational reform, as well as several student
organizations, have agreed to join the demonstration.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has put forward the special military budget for the
purchase of eight submarines, a modified version of the Patriot
PAC-III anti-missile system and a squadron of 12 P3-C anti-submarine
aircraft over a 15-year period starting in 2005. The United States
offered to sell the military hardware to Taiwan in 2001 as part of
its most comprehensive arms package to the island since 1992 and the
budget bill is now pending approval by the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Huang Wu-hsiung, a National Taiwan University professor and a
co-initiator of the weekend protest, said he does not think such a
huge military procurement plan will contribute to peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"The government should instead use the money to boost educational
reform and help improve welfare services for local underprivileged
people," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The protest march will start from the main railway station in
Taipei and end at the 2-28 Peace Park. The half-day demonstration
will also include lectures and skits to signify the protesters'
appeal for peace, environmental protection, educational reform and
improvement of welfare services for the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>At the U.S. invitation, a 14-member delegation of lawmakers
from across the political spectrum, led by Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng, will leave for the United States Thursday to discuss

      <P>Young New Zealand visitors to Taiwan are also welcome to apply
for part-time work under the same working holiday scheme, Lin said.</P>
      <P>New Zealand is the first country with which Taiwan has signed a
working holiday agreement, while Taiwan is the 18th country with
which New Zealand has signed such an accord.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, the representative offices in
each country can issue visas to 400 young people each year who meet
the qualifications for enrollment in the program.</P>
      <P>The scheme is based on the principle of reciprocity, so that
youths from both countries can have a chance to understand first-hand
the social customs, culture and people of each other's country,
establish lasting friendships and strengthen long-term substantive
relations between the two countries through private contacts.</P>
      <P>Lin said vacation, not work, should be stated as the would-be
applicants' purpose of entry. They should not take full-time jobs nor
should they work for the same employer for more than three months.</P>
      <P>"The work they undertake will only be to allow them to earn extra
money to finance their living expenses during their stays and work
should not be the primary purpose of their visit," Lin explained.</P>
      <P>Taiwan citizens made about 25,000 visits to New Zealand last
year, while New Zealanders made 54,000 visits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two countries signed the working holiday agreement in
February.</P>
      <P>"We hope the implementation of the agreement will help boost
exchanges and enhance bilateral cooperation in various fields, " Lin
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER UPBEAT ON PROMISING ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Boosted by encouraging major indexes of
economic indicators, Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh said
Tuesday that she is not worried about an "industrial hollowing-out of
Taiwan businesses" in view of the steadily recovering economy.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks while giving a speech on Taiwan's economic
outlook at a meeting of members of a Rotary club in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Claiming that she has no fear that Taiwan companies will relocate
to mainland China in the face of the mainland's strong magnetic
effect, Ho predicted that this will not happen, as the Taiwan economy
is steadily rebounding, in particular the hi-tech sector.</P>
      <P>At a time when the world economy and international trade have
been forecast to grow by 4.6 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively,
for this year, the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics has predicted that the domestic economy
will expand by 5.4 percent, fueled mainly by private-sector
investment and consumption.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, private-sector investment projects registered
with her ministry have hit an all-time high worth NT$866.2 billion
(US$25.7 billion) , while the aggregate figure for the first four
months of his year has amounted to NT$466 billion, with 53.8 percent
of the projects being carried out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's industrial production index posted a 13.5
percent growth over the year-earlier level, she added.</P>
      <P>Citing data issued by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, she said that the economy, according to the
government's five-color gauge system, has over the past five months
flashed a yellow-red light that represents a rating of heating up for
the first time in 10 years, which is clear evidence that it is
steadily rebounding.</P>
      <P>The economics minister was especially upbeat on the prospects of
Taiwan's high technology industries, noting that the production value
of the semiconductor industry is expected to top NT$1 trillion this
year and that the LCD industry will manage to hit the level of NT$1.3
trillion by 2006.</P>
      <P>"I am not worried at all that Taiwan's industries will be
hollowed out by mainland China," she said.</P>
      <P>The semiconductor and LCD industries are included in the
"two-trillion, two-star" program initiated by the government amid an
all-out effort to upgrade Taiwan's hi-tech clout.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan will continue to play a key role in the
global supply chain despite the fact that the mainland is emerging as
a world economic power, she called for continued labor-division
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait that will benefit both.</P>
      <P>She expressed her belief that people on both sides will have the
wisdom to settle their current political disputes to forge a
"win-win" situation for the years to come.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESS TYCOONS SCRAMBLE TO KEEP DISTANCE FROM POLITICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan business tycoons are scrambling to
distance themselves from politics, at least on the surface, after
Beijing warned that it will not allow Taiwan businessmen who support
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to do business on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin Pai-li, the chairman of computer giant Quanta, who is
reportedly one of many Taiwan businessmen named by Beijing as a
supporter of the DPP and therefore, according to Beijing, also a
supporter of Taiwan independence, denied Tuesday that he is a "green
businessman" -- a term referring to DPP supporters in the business
world -- saying that he is not involved in politics in any way.</P>
      <P>Instead, he made a pitch for direct transportation links with the
mainland to show his ambition to venture into the mainland, claiming
that such links will facilitate the establishment of the peace
framework between Taiwan and the mainland advocated by President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Peace will in turn speed up Taiwan's economic growth, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the government's foot-dragging on approving Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's investment in the mainland
provides the company's mainland rival, SMIT, a chance to cement its
market dominance on the mainland, and Lin said the same mistake could
be repeated if the government continues to prohibit local TFT-LCD
upstream and midstream manufactures to venture across the strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not the only country in the world that owns TFT-LCD
manufacturing technology and the restriction on domestic TFT-LCD
manufacturers from investing in the mainland will not stop the
mainland from getting the technology. Rather, it will cost Taiwan
businessmen a valuable opportunity to get a share of the mainland
market, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Liao Chin-hsiang, chairman of the Chi Mei Group, whose founder
Shu Wen-lung was criticised by mainland China's People's Daily as a
green businessman, said Tuesday that he has always believed business
should be kept separate from politics. He added that he would rather
keep aloof from politics for "at least fifty years."</P>
      <P>Claiming that he visits the mainland one or twice every year and
maintains good connection with the mainland authorities, Liao said he
does not think his group has been discriminated against after the
People's Daily's lambasting of Shu.</P>
      <P>However, he shrugged off questions about whether his group will
press ahead with its plan to set up a new plant on the mainland or
instead divert its investment from the mainland to the Philippines.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun has instructed that all
government agencies work to ensure that Kaohsiung's hosting of the
eighth World Games in 2009 is a success, a spokesman of the Executive
Yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after Kaohsiung won the right to
host the international multi-sports event. The World Games is the
world's second-largest multi-sports competition after the Olympic
Games and covers mainly sports that are not included in the Olympics.</P>
      <P>The premiere expressed his appreciation for the Kaohsiung city
government, the Cabinet-level National Council on Physical Fitness
and Sports, and the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, which have made
concerted efforts over the past two years to win the hosting rights.</P>
      <P>The premier believes that hosting the international sports event
is an exciting thing for Taiwan and is also significant because it
will help Taiwan win international friendship and promote sports
exchanges, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed between Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh and the International World Games Association Monday, the 8th
World Games will be held from July 16-26, 2009, with contests in 34

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new political party was inaugurated
Tuesday, with former Minister of the Interior Chang Po-ya selected to
serve as its chairwoman.</P>
      <P>The Non-partisan Solidarity Union (NSU) held its inaugural
meeting in the auditorium of the Legislative Yuan, with many senior
officials and politicians from across the political spectrum showing
up to offer their congratulations and best wishes.</P>
      <P>Among the well-wishers were Vice Minister of the Interior Lee
Chin-yung and Chang Chun-hsiung, secretary-general of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) . Their presence conveyed the DPP
administration's goodwill toward the birth of the new party. The
Ministry of the Interior was originally reluctant to accept its
registration as a political party because its title bears the word
"non-partisan."</P>
      <P>"We welcome the NSU's inception as Taiwan's 106th legally
registered political party," Lee said at the inaugural ceremony.</P>
      <P>The new political party was founded by 10 incumbent independent
lawmakers and dozens of other veteran politicians, including former
Legislator Chen Chieh-ju and former Hsinchu Mayor Shih Hsing-chung.</P>
      <P>Chang said the party will nominate at least 15 candidates to take
part in the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"We expect to win 15 legislative seats in the new legislature, "
added Chang, a seasoned politician who has served as Department of
Health minister, a legislator and Chiayi mayor.</P>
      <P>Chang also unveiled a plan to seek designs for the party's logo

    <HEADLINE>CHEN VOWS TO CUT JOBLESS RATE, NOT TO INTRODUCE MAINLAND WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Tuesday
that he would not introduce mainland Chinese laborers to work in
Taiwan during his term and vowed to further cut the jobless rate to 4
percent next year.</P>
      <P>President Chen, who concurrently serves as chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made the remarks when he met with
leaders of labor unions at DPP headquarters to listen to their
opinions after the legislature passed a landmark bill late last week
that will transform the current old-age payments for retirees to an
annuity system.</P>
      <P>The president noted that after 14 years of efforts, the labor
pension bill finally cleared the legislature, which he said came
about through bipartisan efforts and that he had already thanked
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>In retrospect, Chen said that laborers in Taiwan used to have the
longest working hours in the world, but the government managed to cut
them when domestic and international economies were on the downturn
and having difficulties in 2000.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the government convened a national economic development
conference during which all participants reached consensus on the new
pension system and "no one is happier than me to see it pass the
Legislative Yuan," the president said.</P>
      <P>On the comments on new system by some laborers that "they are not
satisfied, but they can accept it, " he said that just as he told the
legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of the
DPP, although he had hoped for a perfect score of 100 points, if he
can only manage 80 points, it will still be better to have the 80
points than nothing at all and having to start over again from
square one.
"The government attaches great importance to the rights of eight
million laborers and their families, and wouldn't want to see
the long-term efforts go down the drain," he said, adding that if
laborers accept the system only reluctantly, then it means that
"there is still room for improvement."</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed that all his promises to laborers during the
presidential campaign will be delivered, especially after the most
difficult pension law has been passed.</P>
      <P>As long as he is in office, he said that he will protect the
working rights of domestic laborers and ban the introduction of
mainland Chinese laborers and will continue to promote the
introduction of the three basic rights, including collective
consultation rights, into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>He also said that with the continued economic rebound -- export
and import orders in May set a new high for a single month --
Taiwan's economy is on the road to recovery.</P>
      <P>"I'm confident that the jobless rate will be cut to 4.5 percent
this year, and further down to 4 percent next year, " the president
added.</P>
      <P>Under the current system, most workers cannot get retirement
payments from companies because they usually do not stay at the same
company for either 15 or 25 years as stipulated in the Labor Standards
Law.</P>
      <P>The new law calls for the establishment of an individual
retirement fund account for each employee with the allocation of 6
percent of monthly wages -- with the employers providing a matching
amount. Employees can continue building up the fund even if they
change to another job.</P>
      <P>The fines for employers who do not comply with the law will be
sharply raised, although they can make it up in a period of five
years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO GET SWISS JUDICIAL AID IN LAFAYETTE FRIGATE SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) confirmed
Tuesday that it has made principled commitments to Swiss judicial
authorities in order to receive their assistance in its probe into
the snowballing Lafayette frigate procurement scandal.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Hsien Wen-ting said the Swiss Federal
Supreme Court came up with a final ruling last month on offering
judicial assistance to Taiwan after rejecting a high-profile Taiwan
fugitive's appeal against such a decision.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsieh said, the Swiss supreme court has imposed
some conditions on its promised judicial assistance, including no
capital sentence for Andrew Wang, who has been wanted by Taiwan in
connection with the death of an ROC Navy captain in 1993 and the
alleged Lafayette kickback scandal, should he be convicted.</P>
      <P>Before his departure for a U.S. visit last Sunday, Hsieh said
Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan already signed a "principled
promises" document to clear the way for Swiss judicial assistance.</P>
      <P>According to the document, the MOJ promises to respect the
"innocent supposition" principle in treating Wang, to ensure Wang's
right to appeal his case, to allow Wang to retain attorneys and to
exempt him from the death sentence.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Chen's signing of the document complies with general
customs and practices in international judicial assistance in
criminal investigations.</P>
      <P>After completing the administrative formalities, Hsieh said, the
ministry will send the document to Swiss judicial authorities in near
future to secure access to their legal files concerning Wang's bank
accounts in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>If Wang returns to Taiwan to stand trial, Hsieh said, it will be
of great help in solving the Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng murder case
and the Lafayette kickback scandal.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, prosecution authorities are only responsible for
criminal investigations and have no power to decide whether a suspect
is guilty or how to punish a convicted one. Criminal trials are the
responsibility of the courts.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the MOJ's "no death sentence" promise would
encroach on the court's power, Hsieh said abolishment of capital
punishment has been an important long-term judicial policy goal of
the government.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the MOJ was informed of Switzerland's demand for its
"principled promises" on May 11.</P>
      <P>"We conducted extensive rounds of negotiations and consultations
before Minister Chen signed the document on the eve of his departure
for the United States last Sunday," Hsieh explained.</P>
      <P>He said the MOJ has drafted the document in English. "The
contents will not be publicized," he added.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ tallies, the United States is the only country
that has signed a formal judicial assistance agreement with the
Republic of China. The ROC has signed extradition treaties with six
to nine of its diplomatic allies. Switzerland only agreed to offer
judicial assistance to Taiwan on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>A Swiss federal court ruled last December that Taiwan, France and
the Principality of Liechtenstein should be given access to Swiss
legal files, particularly documents regarding the Andrew Wang
family's bank accounts in Switzerland, to facilitate investigations
into an alleged kickback scandal in connection with Taiwan's
procurement of six Lafayette frigates from France in 1991.</P>
      <P>Wang then filed an appeal against that ruling. The Swiss Federal
Supreme Court ruled against Wang's appeal early last month, paving
the way for the realization of the long-awaited Swiss judicial
assistance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Swiss judicial authorities have frozen Wang's Swiss bank
accounts, which contain some US$600 million in suspected slush funds
used as kickbacks from the Lafayette frigate deal.</P>
      <P>Wang, an arms broker, fled Taiwan in 1993 and has been wanted
since September 2000 for suspected involvement in the alleged
Lafayette kickback scandal and the subsequent murder of an ROC Navy
captain in 1993.</P>
      <P>Wang and his son, Wang Chia-hsing, might also have bank accounts
with deposits totaling US$100 million in Liechtenstein and the
British-administered Cayman Islands in the Caribbean Sea, according
to previous press reports.</P>
      <P>Since Aug. 1, 2000, a special investigative team headed by State
Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa has been probing arms procurement
scandals allegedly connected with the death of ROC Navy Captain Yin
Ching-feng under suspicious circumstances.</P>
      <P>MOJ sources said two prosecutors from the Public Prosecutors'
Office of the Taiwan High Court are now handling the case. According
to the sources, the two prosecutors have made several visits to
Switzerland in the past few years and have forged a smooth, informal
working relationship with the Swiss federal court.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy purchased six Lafayette frigates built by French
defense contractor Thomson-CSF for US$2.8 billion in 1991.</P>
      <P>Allegations of kickbacks over the deal emerged after the death of
Yin, head of the navy's arms acquisition office, whose body was found
floating in the sea off the east coast of Taiwan in late 1993.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged that Yin was murdered to prevent him from
blowing the whistle on rampant corruption in the military --
including the Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>The investigation team has so far indicted six middle-ranking
naval officers on charges of inflating the Lafayette price tag for
the benefit of the French contractor.</P>
      <P>As for the murder case, no major breakthrough has been achieved
because key suspect Wang, who is believed to be deeply involved in
the Lafayette kickback scandal, remains at large, reportedly residing
in London.</P>
      <P>The investigation team has not yet discovered any hard evidence
of alleged Lafayette kickbacks paid to Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>To speed up the investigations, the team has recently recruited
several prosecutors versed in financial and banking affairs to assist
in tracking the money trail.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL ACQUIRES NEW PLANES TO BOOST OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) -- Taiwan's largest
carrier -- will acquire seven new airplanes this year to increase its
passenger and cargo capabilities, mainly for routes within Asia,
according to a CAL executive.
CAL General Manager Philip H. H. Wei made the report in a
shareholder meeting over the weekend. Purchase and lease of the seven
airplanes will help CAL effectively reduce its costs, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Wei, three A330-300 planes bought by CAL will be
delivered by late June to gradually replace its A300-600R planes. The
three new aircraft will help CAL increase passenger seats by 20
percent and provide much greater space for its cargo business,
injecting a boost to the carrier's transport volume on Asian routes,
he explained.</P>
      <P>In addition, two newly leased B747-400F airplanes will join CAL
all-cargo operations in June, while another two new B747-400
passenger planes are slated to be delivered in November or December,
Wei added.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, competition in the global air traffic
market will become fiercer and full of new challenges because of the
global economic recovery, Wei predicted, saying that CAL will
continue the modernization of its fleet to upgrade its management and
explore new markets.</P>
      <P>The company has set a goal of posting an annual business turnover
of NT$89.07 billion (US$2.66 billion) and an EPS of NT$1 for 2004, he
said.</P>
      <P>CAL's operations last year were affected by the impact of the
outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the United
States-led war against Iraq, he said. However, he pointed out that it
still managed to chalk up a profit for 2003, registering after-tax
earnings of NT$1.78 billion.</P>
      <P>Amid a drive to expand its business, the carrier also launched
early this month regular commercial flight services between Taipei
and Hiroshima, while it plans to open a Seattle-Houston route on June
22 and start cargo services between Taipei and Milan on June 27.</P>
      <P>CAL opened a Hanoi-Brisbane route and resumed the Taipei-Hawaii
route last year. The aviation company was rewarded an "excellent
service award" by Commonwealth Magazine in its 2003 November edition.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, June 14 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government says that Taiwan is
complying with U.S. and international efforts to fight human
trafficking, sources from the Department of State reported Monday.</P>
      <P>In its just-published annual report on global human trafficking,
the State Department placed Taiwan among nations "deemed to be
complying with U.S. and international efforts to fight trafficking, "
a group labeled as "Tier 1."</P>
      <P>The report praises the Taiwan authorities for having paid close
attention to the human trafficking issue. In addition to
strengthening law enforcement to crack down on trafficking, the
Taiwan authorities have also collaborated with NGO groups in efforts
to stem such crimes from reoccurring, the report says.</P>
      <P>The report also infers that some Taiwanese women had been forced
to engage in the sex trade in Japan, and many mainland Chinese women
were conned into coming to Taiwan under the guise of employment but
ended up in underground brothels. The report adds that the situation
pertaining to Vietnamese women being tricked into coming to Taiwan
has also become increasingly serious.</P>
      <P>Countries that have made "significant efforts" are placed in
"Tier 2."</P>
      <P>For the first time in its four-year history, the 2004 report
created a "Tier 2 watchlist" for countries that are not yet in
compliance with U.S. legal standards and may be downgraded, but have
promised to make or are in the process of making significant efforts
to meet the requirements, officials from the State Department said.</P>
      <P>By far the largest number of the 140 nations surveyed for the
study were placed on the watchlist, including longstanding U.S. ally
Japan as well as Greece, Turkey, India and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Ten nations, including Cuba, Myanmar, North Korea and Sudan, were
cited by the report as being in the "Tier 3" group for not having
done enough to combat trafficking and will be subjected to sanctions
unless they "demonstrably improve their records by October, " the
State Department said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN COAST GUARD SEIZE 12,000 KG OF SMUGGLED BETEL NUTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Coast guard officials in the outlying
island of Kinmen announced Tuesday the seizure of over 12,000
kilograms of betel nuts aboard a Taiwan fishing ship.</P>
      <P>Coast guard officials were tipped off that the Ilan-registered
fishing boat "Chinfuli" was planning to smuggle betel nuts to Taiwan.
In a raid Monday night in waters off Kinmen, they made the largest
haul of smuggled betel nuts in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>At around 9 p.m. Monday, cost guard officials intercepted the
ship around six nautical miles northeast of Peiting islet after the
ship sailed out from a harbor of Quanzhou, Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Coast guard officials estimated that the 12,180 kilograms of
betel nuts came from Hainan, Guangdong, and could fetch NT$12 million
(US$358,200) on the wholesale market, or twice on the retail market.</P>
      <P>Captain Lee Chung-kuo, crew member Hsieh Chung-liang and a
Vietnamese man were arrested, the officials said. Initial
investigation showed that the trio sailed out of Wuchi, Taichung,
June 11. They loaded the betel nuts June 13, preparing to smuggle them
into Ilan, northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Captain Lee claimed that he was hired for NT$200,000 to carry the
betel nuts, but he insisted that he didn't know who the owner of the
cargo was.</P>
      <P>Officials noted that they had seized smuggled betel nuts at CKS
International Airport and the outlying island of Penghu recently,
apparently because between April and August each year betel nuts are
off-season in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They said that NT$100 can buy 40 betel nuts during the peak
season, but only 12 during the off-season.</P>
      <P>Captain Lee and the crew members were turned over to the Kinmen
Prosecutor's Office for violating regulations governing smuggling,
national security and the statute governing the relations between the
people across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 450 PEOPLE SIGN UP DURING ITRI HEADHUNTING TOUR IN U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 450 overseas Taiwanese have
signed up for interviews with a headhunting mission from Taiwan's
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) for high-technology
job openings in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ITRI mission, headed by ITRI President Johnsee Lee, visited
Silicon Valley, San Diego, Chicago and Boston in a whirlwind tour of
America June 5-12, interviewing over 450 overseas Taiwanese who have
studied engineering or computer science in the United States or have
worked in related fields.</P>
      <P>The non-profit ITRI is offering more than 200 high-tech job
openings for the overseas Taiwanese as the institute is envisaging an
ambitious "Go Beyond R &amp; D" project to be achieved by 2008.</P>
      <P>According to Paul P. S. Lin, director-general of ITRI's Computer
&amp; Communication Research Labs, the interviewees include experienced
professionals and young scholars who have recently obtained doctoral
degrees.</P>
      <P>The ITRI hopes to recruit specialists and talent to beef up the
institute's R &amp; D prowess in several fields, including electronics,
telecommunications, information technology, biochemical/medicine,
nanotechnology, advanced manufacturing, automatic systems and energy.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the number of U.S.-trained scientists and
high-tech professionals returning to Taiwan for career development
has declined to 50-60 annually in recent years from 200-300 annually
five or six years ago.</P>
      <P>The ITRI, meanwhile, has suffered a high personnel turnover rate
over the past several years given that employees from the ITRI have
been hotly sought after by private or publicly-run R &amp; D centers at
home and abroad, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, according to Lin, the ITRI has
recruited 172 Ph.D holders and 185 holders of master's degrees from
overseas, mainly the United States, to return to Taiwan to work.</P>
      <P>The ITRI, a top Taiwan research and development organization
engaging in applied research and technical service which was set up
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in 1973, has helped establish 36
high-tech companies in Taiwan, including such big names as Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and United Miroelectronics Corp.</P>
      <P>The number of ITRI-nurtured high-tech specialists totals over
16,000, with some 5,000 of these working in key positions at firms in
the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, including 58 CEOs.</P>

Tuesday in a libel suit filed against it by Kaohsiung Mayor Frank

court ruling was final.</P>
      <P>"The high court ruling is not only a victory for a single daily

adding that the ruling once again epitomizes judicial authorities'
recognition and protection of press freedom.</P>
      <P>The statement further said that it is both a constitutional right

insinuated that he might be involved in the vote-buying scandals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO SPEED UP REPATRIATION OF DETAINED ILLEGALS IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top mainland China policy
planner on Tuesday urged Beijing to speed up repatriation of illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants being detained in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made the
remarks when he visited a detention center for illegal mainland
Chinese immigrants in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that mainland China has unilaterally suspended the
pickup operations since March 12 and that Taiwan's three detention
centers in Hsinchu, Ilan and Matsu are overcrowded with a record high
of more than 2,500 detainees, including 1,100 in the Hsinchu
detention center alone.</P>
      <P>He urged the Beijing authorities not to drag their feet, to try
to sympathize with the "homesick" detainees, and to reactivate the
repatriation process immediately.</P>
      <P>Out of humanitarian considerations, the Hsinchu detention center
has arranged for the detainees in the center to be able to phone back
to their families on the mainland before the Dragon Boat Festival, a
traditional Chinese festival which falls on June 22 this year. Wu has
also donated NT$30,000 (US$) for extra holiday dishes for the
detainees.</P>
      <P>Wu said that a total of 14 repatriation operations were conducted
last year, with more than 2,200 illegal immigrants being returned to
the mainland. Five repatriation operations have been conducted so far
this year up to March 12, when Beijing stopped sending ships to pick
up more detainees.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing authorities to think about the feelings of the
detainees, especially prior to the Dragon Boat Festival, saying that
the authorities should shoulder the responsibility of taking care of
their own nationals.</P>
      <P>Faced with rising crime involving illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants, the overcrowded situation at the detention centers, and
the financial strain of accommodating the immigrants, Wu urged
Beijing to communicate through the current channels -- namely
Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Beijing
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) -- and sign an agreement so that both sides can work together
toward fighting crime.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society on both sides of the Taiwan Strait signed
an agreement in Kinmen in 1990 to deal with the repatriation of
criminals and illegal mainland Chinese immigrants, but the SEF and
the ARATS have yet to sign a formal agreement despite talks in the
intervening years. The talks between the two semi-official bodies
were suspended in 1999 in the wake of then-President Lee Teng-hui's
advocacy of "special state-to-state" cross-strait relations.</P>

winds of up to 130 kilometers per hour, Dianmu -- the sixth typhoon
reported in the Pacific area this year -- is not expected to directly
affect Taiwan since it is expected to shift to a northwest course
over the following hours, the CWB reported.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, temperatures in Taiwan have shot up due to the
influence of a Pacific high pressure system, with highs of 32-34
degrees Celsius forecast for around the island over the next few
days.</P>

large numbers of soldiers.

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Dianmu -- the sixth typhoon
reported in the Pacific area this year -- has gained strength over
the last eight hours and been upgraded to a strong typhoon, although
it is not expected to directly affect Taiwan, the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Dianmu was centered some 1,800 kilometers southeast of Taiwan at
8 a.m. Wednesday, moving in a north-northwest direction at a speed of
17 kilometers per hour, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>With a radius of 180 kilometers and packing maximum sustained
winds of up to 130 kilometers per hour, Dianmu is not expected to
directly affect Taiwan since it is expected to shift to a northwest
course over the following day and eventually sweep toward Japan, the
CWB reported.</P>
      <P>However, the CWB forecasters said that Taiwan as a whole should
pay close attention to the typhoon over the next 24 hours as weather
conditions could change fast.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, temperatures in Taiwan have shot up due to the
influence of a Pacific high pressure system, with highs of 34 degrees
Celsius forecast for around the island and afternoon thunder showers
for mountainous areas in central and southern Taiwan expected over
the next few days.</P>
      <P>The CWB meteorologists have also warned that the ultra-violet ray

    <HEADLINE>COMMISSION OF US CONGRESS RECOMMENDS TAIPEI-WASHINGTON HOTLINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 16 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A commission of the U.S. Congress urged
the Congress and the U.S. administration Tuesday to weigh the
possibility of installing a hotline between Washington and Taipei for
communication in case of emergency.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission noted in
its 2004 report that any military conflict erupting across the Taiwan
Strait won't last long in light of the fact that China emphasizes
surprise attacks and hoax military moves, therefore a hotline will
give Washington the chance to know and deal with any crisis in
the Taiwan Strait in time.</P>
      <P>At a news conference called to release the report Tuesday, C.
Richard D'Amato, vice chairman of the commission, said the hotline
should be established between officials of rather high levels who can
get a grip on what is happening immediately.</P>
      <P>The commission, set up by the House of Representatives and the
Senate in 2000 to work out suggestions to the Congress on economic
and security issues concerning China, consists of 12 members, with
three members each from the Democratic Party and the Republic Party
at the House of Representatives and the Senate.</P>
      <P>The commission's chairman, Roger W. Robinson, said China's
increasingly military threat against Taiwan, and its diplomatic
campaign to isolate Taiwan on the international stage have fueled a
schism among Taiwanese, and therefore the United States should review
its long-standing "one China" policy, which acknowledges Taiwan as a
part of China.</P>
      <P>Given the wide political difference between Taiwan and China,
D'Amato said Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula for
reunion with Taiwan won't work, and the United States should help
Taiwan to enhance its international profile as long as Taiwan doesn't
declare independence de jure.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain Taiwan's economic prosperity, D'Amato
recommended the United States resume free trade negotiations
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.S. government is not interested in the
negotiations, he suggested Taiwan sweeten the pill by submitting more
attractive proposals in the talks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has
proposed an extraordinary legislative session be held in mid-August,
a party whip of the KMT legislative caucus said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Te-fu, deputy secretary-general of the KMT caucus, said
that the KMT hopes the extraordinary session will deal with the
establishment of a task force to investigate and get to the bottom of
the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu, the establishment of a task force to look into the
activation of the national security mechanism and revisions to the
Republic of China Constitution for legislative reforms.</P>
      <P>If the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) finds other
issues to be discussed, Huang said, the proposed extraordinary
session can also deal with them.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun called on the Legislative Yuan June 11 when
the legislature concluded its regular session to open an
extraordinary session to deal with some urgent bills.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the accumulated number of bills mired down

      <P>He said that the lack of legislative action will hamper the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD RELAX POLICIES TO ATTRACT MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT: CPDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should accelerate the relaxation of
current regulations to develop as a regional financial service center
and attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) , a report from the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) suggested
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A CEPD official quoting the World Bank's Global Development
Finance 2004 report as saying that developing countries, especially
mainland China, Thailand and Malaysia are expected to attract more
FDI in the coming two years due to the global economic recovery and
the increasing economic liberalization in these countries.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics from the World Bank, FDI in
developing countries totaled US$135.2 billion in 2003, a decline of 9
percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>However, the trend will reverse in the coming years, with the FDI
expected to flow to emerging countries, in the amounts of US$152
billion and US$165 billion in 2004 and 2005, respectively, the
statistics show.</P>
      <P>Asian emerging countries will receive the largest FDI in the next
two years, with Latin American countries expected to register
small-scale growth, and Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries
expected to have moderate increases.</P>
      <P>The World Bank report shows that while mainland China continued
opening its financial and telecommunications markets, and Thailand,
Malaysia, and Vietnam relaxed their controls on many sectors, the
total Asia and Pacific area is expected to attract FDI worth US$65
billion and US$74 billion in 2004 and 2005, respectively.</P>
      <P>These figures will represent record highs and are expected to
recover the economic prospects as they were before the Asian
financial crisis in 1997.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs
show that FDI slowed for a short period in the second quarter of last
year due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks. However,
the FDI in Taiwan still managed to reach US$3.58 billion last year,
an increase of 9.3 percent over the US$3.27 billion registered in
2002.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials suggested that the government continue diverse
reforms and improve the investment environment to attract more
foreign investment and develop Taiwan as a regional financial service
center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO WORK OUT POPULATION WHITE PAPER BY 2005 MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will draft a white paper
on population by March of next year to secure Taiwan's
competitiveness in view of the country's rapidly aging segment of the
population and the nation's declining birth rate, Premier Yu Shyi-kun
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior will put forward the white paper by
that time while the Department of Health will also start a campaign
in one month to encourage parents to have more children, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's birth rate has rapidly dropped to 1.22 and its fast
growth in silver-haired population has resulted in a dramatic change
in the country's population structure, putting Taiwan in the position
of losing its competitiveness in the midst of robust global
competition, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after the Executive Yuan approved
earlier the same day a package of action guidelines in response to
the continued entry of foreign spouses, in particular, those from
mainland China, with an aim of setting up a harmonious and
multifaceted society by blending different races and ethnics.</P>
      <P>According to assessments made by the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , an influx of foreign and
mainland Chinese spouses will have both sound and adverse effects on
Taiwan's society in terms of education, economics, labor and national
security.</P>
      <P>The CEPD suggested government agencies in charge set up an early
warning system to effectively monitor the entry of foreign immigrants
and adjust its demographics upward to meet the country's need for an
adequate growth in population to secure its economic development.</P>
      <P>Under the set of mechanisms in line with actual situations, the
government will welcome foreigners with economic power to settle in
Taiwan, while the entry of foreign spouses will be justified in
accordance with a quota control that will be revised periodically,
CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>During the 1999-2003 period, Taiwan approved an average 2,111 and
7,249 residence permits each year for foreign and mainland Chinese
spouses, respectively, government statistics showed.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2003, there were about 280,000 foreign and
mainland Chinese husbands and wives in Taiwan, accounting for around
1 percent of the country's total population.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY ALLIANCE TO PUSH FOR REFORMS OF ELECTORAL SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A private alliance claimed Wednesday the
nation's existing electoral system is flawed and needs much
improvement to prevent election fraud and rigging.</P>
      <P>The Democracy Action Alliance unveiled at a news conference a
number of alleged suspicious findings from a comprehensive scrutiny
of voter rosters for the disputed March 20 presidential election to
back up its criticism of the current electoral system.</P>
      <P>The findings were provided by attorneys who represented the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) in scrutinizing lists of all eligible voters
in various constituencies around the country last month.</P>
      <P>According to the alliance, more than 90,000 ballots were listed
as suspicious or problem ballots because of various reasons. As shown
in voter rosters, some ballots were cast by those who had died or
went abroad or went missing before the voting date, and some other
ballots were cast by voters who received blank ballots by leaving
their fingerprints but without the endorsement of any election staff.
Other problems cited by the alliance included inconsistencies between
seals left on the rosters and the names of the listed voters as well
as blank ballots stamped with election supervisors' seals.</P>
      <P>Former Legislator Kao Tze-min, who is also a member of the
alliance, said these problem ballots indicate that there is room for
election rigging.</P>
      <P>"Since we have found flaws in our presidential electoral system,
the ruling and opposition parties should work together to push for
reform and improvement of the existing system. Otherwise, Taiwan's
young democracy will get rotten and cannot move forward or become
deep-rooted," Kao said.</P>
      <P>Incumbent President Chen narrowly won re-election in the March 20
election, but the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of KMT Chairman Lien
Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong refused to concede defeat. Lien has
filed two lawsuits to annul Chen's re-election victory and even the
entire election so that a new one can be held.</P>
      <P>Although Lien has provided little evidence to back up his
claim of election fraud, President Chen agreed to a full-scale
judicial vote recount. The unprecedentedly large-scale re-tally of
all the more than 13 million ballots cast in the election and a
scrutiny of all voter lists were completed last month. There
has so far been no solid evidence showing that the election was
rigged, although some technical mistakes have been discovered. The
Taiwan High Court is required to mete out rulings on the two lawsuits
in six months.</P>

      <P>There were 533 people arrested in connection with 37 fraud rings

      <P>He also thanks the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he

      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a delegation of

investment will continue expanding in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Chen said Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PROCUREMENT FROM U.S. DIFFERENT FROM FRANCE: DPP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday that arms purchases from the
United States will be different from purchases made from France and
that there is no question of kickbacks being involved.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung made the remarks in the wake of a
newspaper report that said Taiwan spent NT$36 billion (US$1.07
billion) more than it should have in procuring 60 mirage fighters
from France in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation United Daily News quoted an investigation
report by the Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog, on the
policy-making, price and commission of the Mirage fighters, which
shows that the Air Force Headquarters said at the time to the
Ministry of National Defense that the price would come to 22.8
billion francs (NT$131.2 billion at the exchange rate then), although
the final price tag was 6 billion francs more.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan said that neither the Air Force Headquarters nor
the Ministry of National Defense have been able to come up with a
plausible explanation for this huge gap and added that it is mulling
whether to propose censuring the two organizations.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Taiwan did indeed pay an inflated price for its
purchase of the advanced fighters and Lafayette frigates, adding that
commissions and improper deals were "obviously" involved and that the
relevant authorities should investigate the doubts and questionable
points raised by the report.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as France does not recognize Taiwan diplomatically,
the purchases of the fighters and the frigates were not from the
French government but from the French manufactures, which, he
claimed, was the main reason for the improper dealings.</P>
      <P>During that time, Taiwan had to circumvent all purchasing
obstacles by buying through foreign politicians, so there would
surely have been kickback problems, Lee said.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that the latest NT$610.8 billion purchase, which
the Executive Yuan passed early this month and is now subject to
approval by the Legislative Yuan, will be a direct procurement from
the U.S. Department of Defense, so there is question of using brokers
or paying kickbacks.</P>
      <P>The NT$610.8 billion arms purchase will cover six sets of
Patriot PAC-III missiles and eight conventional submarines and 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Control Yuan committee, which was scheduled to
discuss the report later Wednesday, expressed regret that the
newspaper had published part of the report before it was formally
unveiled and said that it would withdraw from the discussion because
of the newspaper's action.</P>

    <HEADLINE>60 PERCENT OF HI-TECH TALENT EYEING MAINLAND CHINA: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite recent political woes between
Taiwan and mainland China, as many as 60 percent of Taiwan's
professionals in the hi-tech sector still are willing to work in
mainland China, according to the results of a survey made public
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The public opinion poll carried out in late May by www.104.
com.tw, an executive research Web site, showed that 58.4 percent of
the respondents employed in Taiwan's hi-tech businesses are willing
to work in mainland China.</P>
      <P>In terms of their reasons to relocate to the mainland, 71.6
percent of them said that they are attracted by the "great potential
of the mainland market, " while 55.9 percent pointed to the "need to
start earlier in the mainland in view of its strong competition."</P>
      <P>Some 18 percent said that they think they can get a job with a
higher position there because of their "higher-level skills" than
mainland Chinese workers, while about 14 percent claimed that they
think they will be given a higher salary for working abroad.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 64.3 percent of those hi-tech workers who will not
consider finding a job in mainland China cited "family and friends"
as the leading reason behind their reluctance, while 41.8 percent
singled out "better working conditions and environment in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>While 40.8 percent said their unwillingness resides in
"difficulties in getting necessary information about the mainland
Chinese workplace, " some 30 percent said that they are determined to
stay in Taiwan to learn more advanced technologies, " the survey
found.</P>
      <P>Among the nearly 60 percent of Taiwan's hi-tech talent displaying
willingness to move to mainland China, male workers account for 61.5
percent, while 64 percent are in their 40s. Around 76 percent already
hold middle or high ranking posts in their companies.</P>
      <P>According to an executive at the head-hunting Web site, the
number of Taiwan workers wanting to find a job in mainland China has
risen to 10,214 so far since the beginning of this month. Job
opportunities in the mainland are mainly from its electronics
manufacturing, foreign trade, computer peripherals,
opto-telecommunications and engineering industries, he said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan hi-tech professionals have long been popular in
the domestic job market, the executive said that many of them are
increasingly feeling a sense of crisis in recent years due to
drastic changes in high-technology trends.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, he contended that working experience in
mainland China will be undoubtedly an advantage for hi-tech
professionals wherever they are employed.</P>
      <P>The problem of how to fend off an exodus of Taiwan's hi-tech
brainpower will be a key issue for many domestic businesses, he
pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUR PFP LAWMAKERS INDICTED OVER VIOLENT MARCH 26 PROTEST AT CEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four opposition lawmakers were indicted
Wednesday over their alleged leading roles in a riot at the Central
Election Commission (CEC) March 26 when officials were discussing
certifying the result of the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office said legislators Chiu Yi, Feng
Ting-kuo, Lin Hui-kuan and Lee Ching-hua of the People First Party
(PFP) should be indicted for violating the public assembly law by
igniting the violent protest at the CEC in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>The indictment said the four lawmakers led hundreds of their
aides and supporters to converge in front of the CEC building near
the Legislative Yuan after they learned that CEC commissioners would
meet in the afternoon of March 26 to discuss certification of the
result of the disputed presidential election a week earlier.</P>
      <P>Incumbent President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
narrowly won the bitterly fought election by a margin of 0.228
percent, or 29,518 ballots out of the 13 million ballots cast. The
sole challenging ticket, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong, refused to concede defeat and immediately
demanded a vote recount.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the existing law requires the CEC to certify the
election result and proclaim the winner within seven days of the
election.</P>
      <P>Prosecution authorities said the four opposition lawmakers
continued to make loudspeaker speeches even after police held up
placards demanding that they stop the demonstration, which had not
been approved by police authorities in advance.</P>
      <P>Worse still, the indictment said, the lawmakers even led their
supporters in chants of "Smash the Central Election Commission." The
protest then spiralled out of control, with some rioters struggling
with police as they tried to storm the CEC building, while others
broke glass cases used to display the election results.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they had scrutinized television footage and
videotape shot by police officers as well as reviewing riot police
work reports and interviewing many witnesses, before deciding to
indict the four lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Although the lawmakers claimed that they did not hear the
police's loudspeaker warnings and orders to disband the protestors
during the demonstration, the indictment said, their claims could not
be justified because the assembly was not legally sanctioned in the
first place.</P>
      <P>The Lien-Soong ticket has since filed two lawsuits to nullify
Chen's victory and the entire election so that a one can be held.</P>
      <P>Even though the Lien-Soong ticket has provided little evidence to
back its claim that the election was rigged, Chen agreed to a
full-scale judicial vote recount. The unprecedentedly large-scale
recount has been completed and still no solid evidence has been found
to support the Lien-Soong ticket's allegations.
The Taiwan High Court is required to mete out rulings on the two
lawsuits in six months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CONSTITUTION TO BE BASED ON CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  16  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed
Wednesday his determination to pursue constitutional reforms and said
he will bring about a new constitution through constitutional
procedures.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he presided over a celebration of the
80th anniversary of the ROC Military Academy in Fengshn, Kaohsiung,
in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was held against the background of mainland China
playing up the 80th anniversary of the academy and holding its own
big celebration of the academy at its original home in Whampoa,
Guangzhou, using its traditional "united front" tactics by inviting
oversea alumni to attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Although former Premier Hau Pei-tsun, an alumni of the academy,
failed to attend, more than 300 other alumni, including past academy
presidents, as well as former Air Force commanders-in-chief Huang
Hsien-jung and Tsai Chung-huei, as well as Teng Chu-lin, former
chairman of the Veterans Affairs Commission, and more than 700 family
members of the student cadets, attended the Fengshan event.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary General Su Tseng-chang, Examination
Yuan President Yao Chia-wen were also on hand to witness the
ceremony.</P>
      <P>The president reviewed a dress parade of 1,832 student cadets
from the academy and from two other academies -- the ROC Navy Academy
and the ROC Air Force Academy -- and expounded on the ideas for
writing a new constitution to take effect in 2008 when he completes
his presidency that he spoke about in his May 20 inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>On the constitutional re-engineering project, he said it is
irrelevant to fight over the semantics of whether it is "revising"
the Constitution or "instituting" a new one and that the crucial
thing is to bring about a new constitution through constitutional
procedures.</P>
      <P>During his campaign prior to the March 20 presidential election,
Chen advocated writing a new constitution through a referendum,
causing great concern among the United States and mainland China, who
feared it would take Taiwan down the road of independence.</P>
      <P>Seeking to allay these misgivings, the president reaffirmed yet
again that the new constitution will not touch on the issues of
sovereignty, territory or the subject of unification/independence.</P>
      <P>He said the new constitution will enhance efficiency and allow
for governmental structural reforms. He said it will be a
constitution that the military "must defend by all means, " and that
this is his commitment and an ideal that all must work toward.</P>
      <P>As president of the Republic of China, Chen said he knows that it
is his responsibility to seek stable and prosperous development for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Constitution stands as the supreme legal basis of a
nation, symbolizing a permanent contract between the government and
the people, and that he will follow his commitment to the people to
complete constitutional re-engineering through constitutional
procedures.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed that the new constitution, which will be "timely,
relevant and viable," will be ready by the time he steps down in 2008.</P>
      <P>The president told the cadets that the military is the
army of the Republic of China and that their goal is to defend the
survival of the nation and the security of its people.</P>
      <P>"Put simply," he said, "anyone who invades Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen
or Matsu, anyone who wants to swallow the Republic of China, they are
our enemies. This is unequivocable and there should be no doubts at
all."</P>
      <P>Noting that the academy was originally founded in Whampoa in
1924 with the late President Chiang Kai-shek as its inaugural
president, Chen urged the cadets to continue to promote the "Whampoa
spirit" -- which is sacrifice, unity and responsibility.</P>
      <P>But in tune with the changing times, he urged them to instill the
ideals of "courage, faith and trust" with the contemporary
significance so that they can become the new values of the CMA in the
next 80 years.</P>
      <P>He urged faith in the national system and the Constitution and
said that there should be no confusion about national allegiance and
national identity, in spite of the power transfer between the
political parties.</P>
      <P>Security at the ceremony was tight but nevertheless there was a
small incident when someone darted out from the area set aside for
the families of the students saying that he wanted to present an ROC
flag to Chen. The man was grabbed by security men.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The economies of Taiwan and Singapore have
much in common and also are complementary in some other fields, Yen
Ching-chang, Taiwan permanent representative to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks during a WTO meeting held to view
Singapore's trade policies, in which representative delegations of
more than a dozen member states took part.</P>
      <P>Citing assessments by the Lausanne-based International Institute
for Management Development and the Wall Street Journal, Yen praised
Singapore for having the most competitive economy among countries
with a population smaller than 20 million, as well as the world's
second-freest economy.</P>
      <P>Yen said that Taiwan and Singapore have much in common in their
economic structures and trade systems and that they are complementary
in other areas, giving great potential for the two countries to
bolster bilateral trade and economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>While hailing Singapore's trade openness and economic
liberalization, the Taiwan permanent envoy to the WTO expressed his
hope of gaining a better understanding of Singapore's
Government-Linked Corporations (GLCs).</P>
      <P>Yen said that Taiwan is particularly curious about the role
played by the Singapore government in the GLCs, as the GLCs are
active members in many sectors of the city state's economy and form a
major driving force behind the country's economic development. He
questioned whether such a government role dampens the market
mechanism.</P>
      <P>In essence, GLCs are tools of government. The GLC designation is
a sponsorship of an industry that the government wishes to promote.
By that rationale, GLCs are merely vehicles for government
subsidization, he said.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the possibility of whether Singapore is likely
to relax the rules on its service market to foreign suppliers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MRT CONNECTING CKS AIRPORT, TAIPEI TO BE COMPLETED IN FOUR YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Construction of a mass rapid transit (MRT)
system connecting Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and Taipei
City is scheduled to be completed in four years and open to public
traffic by the end of 2008, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Lung-wen, director of the MOTC's Department of Railways and
Highways, denied allegations that the CKS-Taipei MRT development
project will be shelved due to insufficient budget support.</P>
      <P>Clarifying the situation, Lee said the MOTC has never said that
the project will be postponed, adding that it will be carried out as
previously scheduled now that the budget plans for the five-year,
NT$500 billion (US$14.7 billion) national development plan -- better
known as the "Ten New Major Construction Plans" -- have cleared the
legislative floor.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the development of the CKS-Taipei MRT system
calls for an outlay totaling NT$93.56 billion. Of the total, NT$47
billion is covered under the "Ten New Major Construction Plans, "
while the remaining NT$46.56 billion will be financed by the regular
annual budget of the MOTC, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ho Yuan-hsuan, director-general of the Bureau of
Taiwan High Speed Rail, MOTC, also denied the allegations, stressing
that construction of the MRT system will begin as soon as the
construction plans, contractors and subcontractors are finalized.</P>
      <P>The disputed issue on the project -- whether the approach section
entering Taipei City should be built overground or underground -- is
still under discussion, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The MOTC officials made the clarification Wednesday after
opposition People First Party legislators Liu Wen-hsiung, Lee
Hung-chun and Ke Shu-min called a press conference in which they
claimed that the project will be shelved due to lack of budget and
controversy surrounding the design of the approach sections.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will
begin an across-the-board assessment of Taiwan's foreign labor
agencies as early as July, CLA officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they expect the assessment of the more
than 800 agencies to be completed by the end of the year and the
results to be posted on the Web site of the CLA's Employment and
Vocational Training Administration for reference by employers in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a bid to encourage foreign labor agencies to improve the
quality of their service, provide reference to employers, the CLA
plans to use an assessment index it has established to rate the
agencies.</P>
      <P>The assessment index developed by CLA-commissioned scholars and
experts was used last year on 50 agencies willing to take part in
the trial assessment.</P>
      <P>Out of the 50 agencies, 13 said they were willing to have the
results published. Employers can now visit the CLA's Web site to get
the information.</P>
      <P>As of the end of April, there were nearly 280,000 foreign
laborers working in Taiwan. Thai laborers led the pack in terms of
numbers, at 98,200, followed by Philippine laborers at 80,000,
Vietnamese at 60,100, and Indonesians at 41,300.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised
Taiwanese who visit Singapore to keep their travel documents to hand

      <P>A statement issued by the ministry said the three Taiwan women,

6 because they failed to produce their visas and were therefore
mistaken for illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry said the Republic of China representative
office in Singapore was informed of their plight through one of their
Singaporean friends and went to their rescue June 7. It also filed a
protest with the Singapore police department, which admitted that it
did not deal with the case properly and promised to improve police
training to avoid similar incidents from occurring.</P>
      <P>The statement urged Taiwan tourists to keep their visas to hand
to prove their identity and to contact the ROC representative office
if they encounter this kind of problem, said the statement.</P>
      <P>The three women, who work in a bank, have already returned to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is open on issues of cross-Taiwan
Strait talks based on the principles of equality and dignity, an
official of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a public hearing on government policies for faster
and more convenient cross-strait transportation links organized by
Legislator Hong Chi-chang, MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said that
government agencies should be invited to take part in cross-strait
talks on issues involving public powers.</P>
      <P>Many businessmen have asked the government to ease regulations to
facilitate the opening of cross-strait transportation links.</P>
      <P>Chao Teng-hsiung, chairman of the Far Glory Group, urged the
government to take action as soon as possible because a majority of
Taiwan businessmen agree with the opening of cross-strait
transportation links. National security should be based on the
country's economic development, he added.</P>
      <P>Wei Hsin-hsiung, general manager of China Airlines, Taiwan's
largest carrier, suggested that the government allow cargo planes to
ply direct cross-strait routes via the flight information regions of
Hong Kong and Macau without having to land in those places.</P>

demonstration and a trial for improving cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>However, Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said that the businessmen should first convince the Beijing
authorities to hold talks with Taiwan on the opening of cross-strait
transportation links, given that Taiwan has offered many goodwill
measures on this issue but has always had them rejected by Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The ball is in Beijing's court," he said.</P>

      <P>At a time when Taiwan is emerging as "a

Taiwan-centric notion among the people in order to inject fresh
energy to step up the country's competitive edge, Premier Yu Shyi-kun
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while giving a speech at a meeting of the
Importers and Exporters Association of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Given that a multi-ethnic and a multi-faceted society is taking
shape in Taiwan, the government will do its best to forge policies
focusing on the Taiwan-centric concept as a way of cementing the
people's identity with the land in the hope of transforming strength
into momentum to push Taiwan forward, he said.</P>
      <P>"Building a Taiwan identity is not tantamount to de-sinicization,
but is rather a pragmatic move aimed at stepping up Taiwan's
persistent development and progress, " he claimed, stressing that
Taiwan is open to all kinds of cultures and civilizations as long as
they are helpful to the country's growth.</P>
      <P>Pointing to an influx of 280,000 foreign spouses into Taiwan as
an example, he said that these foreigners living in Taiwan have
helped create new blood and provide a fresh labor force in a rapidly
aging society.</P>
      <P>In an effort to help them blend into society, it is important to
give adequate education to these new residents in Taiwan to increase
their identity and affiliation with this country, he said, adding
that only when these immigrants enjoy the same rights and share equal
obligations as Taiwan natives will the country's competitiveness be
effectively upgraded, he said.</P>
      <P>He also thanked the foreign trade sector for its contributions to
Taiwan's economic development over the long term and praised it as
one of the prime driving forces behind Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>The premier vowed to create a "safety net" for all the people

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's office denied
Thursday that first lady Wu Shu-chen has been involved in insider
stock trading, while a dealer at a security firm is set to give
testimony Friday in an investigation into the allegations about the
first lady.</P>
      <P>A statement issued through the Department of Public Affairs under
the Presidential Office said that Chen announced recently that his
wife will not buy or sell stocks any more, even though all her
trading in the past was in compliance with the law.</P>
      <P>The statement said both the president and his wife reiterated
during the presidential campaign that all their stock deals were
legal and would bear public scrutiny.</P>
      <P>In order to end the allegations for good, Chen announced that his
wife will no longer play the stock market, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The statement said it is regrettable and unacceptable that "a
media outlet" published a story Thursday about the first lady's
questionable stock transactions.</P>
      <P>A prosecutor from the Taiwan District Court who is leading a
probe into the allegations has summoned a security dealer who handled

      <P>The quotas for foreign laborers imported
into Taiwan will not be altered to take into consideration two
planned free trade ports in Kaohsiung and Keelung, a labor official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Fang-yu, director-general of the Employment &amp; Vocational

administration has to balance the development of the free trade ports
against work opportunities for local people and that therefore, the
quotas of foreign workers allowed to enter Taiwan will not be
increased.</P>
      <P>The existing rules provide that the percentage of local workers
to that of total workers employed at the free trade port should not
be below 60 percent.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid unfair competition between concerns inside and
outside the free trade ports, Kuo said, businesses in the free trade
zones should be subject to the same requirements as those outside
when bringing in foreign laborers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMCHAM DELEGATION SAYS TIME FOR SIGNING TAIWAN-U.S. FTA NOT YET RIPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 17 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of the American Chamber of
Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei said here Wednesday that although Taiwan
is keen on signing a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United
States, the time for such an agreement is not yet ripe.</P>
      <P>AmCham President Andrea Wu is currently leading the delegation on
its visit to Washington, D.C. to call on relevant U.S. government
agencies. The delegation has lobbied and communicated with them on
issues of concern after AmCham published its 2004 Taiwan White Paper
earlier this month in which it expressed concern over the
establishment of direct cross-Taiwan Strait transportation links and
the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR).</P>
      <P>The delegation said that the signing of an FTA is a good idea,
but the time has yet to come because the issues the United States is
most concerned about -- pharmaceuticals, IPR protection and
government procurement -- have yet to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Richard Vuylsteke, executive director of AmCham, said that
although Taiwan completed a revision of its copyright law last year,
it removed at the last minute the most intimidating part regarding
punishments for violators.</P>
      <P>On government procurement, he said that Taiwan has yet to sign a
government procurement agreement and the United States is almost
excluded from government procurement projects such as infrastructure
construction projects.</P>
      <P>Before such questions are resolved, there will be only limited
progress in moves to discuss a FTA between the United States and
Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>An official of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Taiwan branch noted that the
development of a new drug or new vaccine takes about 15 years and a
cost of US$1 billion, and that the developing manufacturers have to
be assured that related test information is thoroughly protected when
it applies to a government.</P>
      <P>If the information is revealed to local manufacturers, then no
foreign manufacturer will dare to turn over their information to the
government, and Taiwan's plan to turn itself into a biotechnology
center will be hard to realize, the Merck official said.</P>
      <P>AmCham delegates also said that Charles Freeman, deputy assistant
U.S. Trade Representative, was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan
in late June but will now postpone his trip until the second half of
July.</P>
      <P>Freeman will discuss such controversial trade issues as IPR
protection. If there is a substantial result, then both sides will be
able to restart talks on a trade and investment framework agreement
(TIFA). After TIFA, they will be able to address the issues of FTA
talks.</P>
      <P>On the issues of establishing direct cross-strait trade and
transportation links, AmCham delegates said that some Taiwan people
worry that direct links will cause a hollowing out of domestic
industry because of the flight to the mainland. However, the
delegates said that without direct cross-strait links foreign
businessmen will be forced by cost considerations to move their focus
to the mainland, which will indeed cause an industrial hollowing out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LAWMAKERS LEAVE FOR U.S. TO DISCUSS ARMS PROCUREMENT ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
left for the United States Thursday at the head of a 13-member
legislative delegation to discuss Taiwan's new arms procurement
projects.</P>
      <P>Wang said prior to his departure that the legislature has three
basic stances on the Cabinet's plans to purchase a number of advanced
weaponry systems from the United States.</P>
      <P>"The three stances are -- the weapons to be bought must be useful
in defending Taiwan's security in the event of a war in the Taiwan
Strait; their prices must be compatible to the general world market
prices; the deals must be helpful to boost bilateral industrial
cooperation, including technology transfer," Wang explained, adding
that the legislature hopes the United States can agree to a Taiwan
state-owned firm's participation in the construction of the eight
conventional submarines the Bush administration agrees to sell the
island.</P>
      <P>Wang said his mission will take advantage of the visit to get a
better understanding of the performance, functions and general
international prices of the arms that Taiwan intend to buy.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has approved a special military budget of NT$610.8
billion (US$18.2 billion) for the purchase of advanced weaponry from
the United States amid mounting mainland Chinese military threats.</P>
      <P>The draft budget calls for the procurement of eight submarines, a
modified version of the Patriot PAC-III anti-missile system and a
squadron of 12 P3-C anti-submarine aircraft over a 15-year period
starting in 2005. The United States offered to sell the military
hardware to Taiwan in 2001 as part of its most comprehensive arms
package to the island since 1992.</P>
      <P>The special budget bill is now pending approval of the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang said the delegation would first visit the U.S. Pacific
Command in Hawaii to receive a briefing on the general regional
security situation and visit a P-3C anti-submarine aircraft base.</P>
      <P>The delegation will then travel to Washington, D.C. via San
Francisco. In the company of ROC Representative to the United States
Chen Chien-Jen, the delegation will visit relevant U.S.
administrative departments June 21 and exchange views with their
senior officials on Taiwan's defense needs.</P>
      <P>On the following day, the delegation will be briefed on special
functions of the weaponry systems that the United States intends to
sell to Taiwan. The mission will also meet with U.S. congressmen
before leaving for Texas June 24 to visit a U.S. Patriot PAC-III
missile base. The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei June
28.</P>
      <P>The delegation is composed of 13 lawmakers from across the
political spectrum. Three other lawmakers, including two from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and one from the opposition
People First Party, will travel to directly Washington, D.C. later
this week to join the delegation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun presented citations and
cash prizes Thursday to six government units in recognition of their
achievements in cracking down on commercial piracy of intellectual
property rights (IPR).</P>
      <P>Personnel from the prosecutors' office of the Taiwan High Court,
the National Police Administration under the Ministry of the
Interior, the Investigation Bureau under the Justice Ministry, the
Directorate-General of Customs under the Ministry of Finance, and two
task forces under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, received their
rewards at a ceremony held in central Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan has made noticeable progress in IPR
crackdown drive, Yu stressed the government's resolve to wipe out
copyright piracy and voiced his content that Taiwan's efforts in this
field have gained foreign recognition.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the U.S.-based International
Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) , the premier said that the
value worth of Taiwan's infringements of U.S. IPR products fell
markedly from US$848 million in 2002 to US$453 million in 2003.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan's piracy rate of U.S. video game
software declined from 56 percent to 42 percent, while its music CD
piracy rate decreased from 47 percent to 42 percent, he went on.
Its business software piracy rate fell from 53 percent in 2001 to 41
percent in 2003.</P>
      <P>The IIPA is a private sector coalition representing the U.S.
copyright based industries.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs launched a new intensive
campaign in March 2003 to stem Taiwan's rampant piracy of CDs and
DVDs, providing rewards worth as much as NT$10 million (about
US$300,000) for each piece of useful information leading to a
crackdown on pirate manufacturers.</P>
      <P>According to Economic Affairs Minister Ho Mei-yueh, police,
investigators and prosecutors raided five large plants producing
pirated CDs and DVDs over the past year, seizing 630,000 discs and
relevant facilities.</P>
      <P>The informants and law enforcement officers were rewarded with
cash prizes worth more than NT$14 million and NT$3.5 million,
respectively, she noted.</P>
      <P>A case cracked in May this year in the central Taichung and
Changhua areas was a plant specializing in illegally recorded CDs and
DVDs, in which more than 400,000 discs were nabbed -- the largest
number in a single case in East Asia, she added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun ordered a new
crackdown on organized crime and firearm smuggling Thursday, as well
as a thorough review of the parole system.</P>
      <P>Yu issued the directive after paying a tribute to a police
officer in the central city of Taichung who was killed in a shootout
with an alleged kidnapper a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-fu, 41, a detective unit leader at a Taichung City
police precinct, was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital after
he was shot in the chest during the shootout shortly before Wednesday
noon. Another police officer, Yeh Hsi-tsai, remained in critical
condition as of Thursday evening after being shot in the head in the
shootout. A third officer, Lin Wen-wu, was shot in the arm was
reported in stable condition after receiving medical treatment. The
kidnapping suspect, Su Ming-an, was also shot dead in the shootout.</P>
      <P>Yu said he felt deep regret and sorrow over the police casualties
and said the government will offer the best possible financial
compensation and care for Lee's bereaved family.</P>
      <P>In a show of the government's determination to stamp out
organized crime and curtail gun smuggling, Yu ordered police
authorities to launch a new crime-fighting campaign.</P>
      <P>As the dead kidnapping suspect had been paroled earlier this
year, Yu said he will also ask the relevant judicial authorities to
conduct a comprehensive review of the parole system and tighten the
parole requirements. Available data shows that the ratio of
recidivism among parolees is relatively high, he said.</P>
      <P>"We should review our system and impose more stringent conditions
for parole in order to lower the crime rate and improve public order
and security," Yu said.</P>
      <P>In the company of Yu and several other senior officials,
President Chen Shui-bian also paid his respects to the deceased
police officer and visited the two injured policemen, who were being
treated in two different Taichung hospitals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will send a large delegation to
participate in the summer 2004 Fancy Food Show June 27-29 in New
York, promoting high-quality Taiwan gourmet food.</P>
      <P>The Fancy Food Show showcases foods from diverse cultures from
around the world and this year should attract exhibitors from 52
countries.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation, the largest in years, will be comprised of
representatives from eight food associations and the Taiwan
Provincial Farmers Association and will host a pavilion to introduce
various kinds of Taiwanese agricultural products with different types
of processing technologies.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Taiwan delegation noted that the island's
agricultural industry backed up Taiwan's industrial development
several decades ago, and when the industrial sector grew, advanced
technologies helped a lot to improve the quality of agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>The complimentary effects also can be seen in the example of the
Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center, which has a presence
in Taiwan and has conducted numerous exchanges and cooperation
projects with local agricultural entrepreneurs, they said.</P>
      <P>Recently, they added, Taiwan's enterprises have invested in other
Asian countries, thus allowing them to offer higher quality but cheap
products thanks to Taiwan's high R&amp;D and production capability and
the low costs of production in these Asian countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CEC CHIEF VOWS TO MAINTAIN IMPARTIALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Central Election Commission (CEC)
Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung said Thursday that he would fulfill his
responsibilities independently and that the public will see that he
performs his duties with impartiality.</P>
      <P>Chang, whose appointment caused controversy because of his past
leanings toward the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
President Chen Shui-bian, made the remarks after a change-over
ceremony held under heightened security because several groups had
previously gone to the CEC to protest against Chang's appointment.</P>
      <P>Chang took over the official seal of the CEC at the ceremony from
Rai Hau-min, another CEC member, because outgoing chairman Huang
Shih-cheng had gone abroad the previous day.</P>
      <P>He noted that with the deepening of democracy in Taiwan,
political parties and the public has attached great importance to
every election and the CEC has become the focus of the nation.</P>
      <P>"Given the public's high expectation and demands for reforms in
election affairs, the CEC will face more daunting tasks and
challenges ahead, especially after the addition of the referendum
vote," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan held its first referendum in tandem with the presidential
election on March 20. The CEC sponsored 10 public debates on the
questions on the referendum before the vote on whether or not to
increase defense spending in the face of mainland China's military
threats and the need to resume talks with Beijing to establish a
mechanism to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The CEC will work to staff a highly efficient team with the
utmost patience and tenacity, " he stressed, adding that the CEC will
be operated "fairly, justly, openly and independently" to understand
and review any defects that have surfaced in past elections to
increase the accuracy of elections.</P>
      <P>Chang also expressed the hope that the Legislative Yuan will
revise the Referendum Law that was passed in late November last year
and make the CEC the agency in charge of referendums. Currently, the
Executive Yuan is the one in charge, although the CEC is tasked with
carrying out referendum.</P>
      <P>Regarding People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong's remarks
that Chang's appointment by President Chen Shui-bian was made to pave
the way for a new presidential election, Chang said that this will
involve a lawsuit filed by the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
and the PFP to attempt to annul the March 20 presidential election,
and he would make no comment until the matter has been resolved in
court.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that he "is not a major supporter of
anyone, " and that his past ideas may have paralleled those of the
DPP, the situation will change when he takes over as CEC chairman.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chi-hsiung, minister-without-portfolio, in presiding over the
change-over ceremony, expressed his appreciation for the outgoing CEC
chairman.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that Huang, since taking over as head of the CEC in
1999, went through two each of presidential, legislative, mayoral and
county magistrate elections, and was at his post during the important
first transfer of political power between different parties in Taiwan
in 2000 when Chen won the presidency. He was also chairman during the
nation's first referendum in 2004. Both events, he said, were
milestones in Taiwan's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Hsu also lauded Chang, saying that Chang has practiced law for 37
years and has established a fine reputation, and is concerned about
the protection of human rights. He was one of the lawyers - along
with then-attorney Chen Shui-bian - to defend opposition movement
activists, among them current Vice President Annette Lu, for their
involvement in the 1979 "Kaohsiung Incident, " a rally held by the
opposition movement to mark International Human Rights Day but which
later turned violent.</P>
      <P>Chang also will concurrently serve as a Taipei Election
Commission member. He has been a member of that commission and the
CEC for over 10 years, and has been active in public affairs.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Chang is "not afraid of the powerful and has great
self-discipline," which he said are key attributes for a CEC head.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER ATTENDS U.S. THINK TANK ACTIVITY IN L.A.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, June 16 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The international community should try
to understand how the people of Taiwan feel about mainland China's
constant missile threat, ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said in Los Angeles Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while delivering a keynote speech at a
dinner organized by the noted U.S. think tank Asia Society.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China's security and prosperity are
the supreme common interests of the people of Taiwan, Chen said the
international community, while mulling the Taiwan Strait issue,
should not overlook the way that the people of Taiwan feel about
mainland China's imposing military threat.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has aimed roughly 500 ballistic missiles at Taiwan
along the southeastern mainland coast and the number is estimated to
increase by 50 or more each year.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Chen said, Beijing has forcefully demanded that
Taiwan accept its "one-China" principle.</P>
      <P>"However, this stance offers no room for the ROC to survive in
the world community," Chen said.</P>
      <P>While peace in the Taiwan Strait is in the best interests of the
United States, Chen said the continued existence of a free and
democratic Taiwan with full human rights complies with America's
traditional values and its basic national spirit.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in Los Angeles Tuesday, said this is his first
overseas trip since assuming office early last month. "I want to take
advantage of this visit to solicit opinions from U.S. scholars,
experts and ROC expatriates about the delicate triangular
Taiwan-U.S.-mainland China relationship and listen to recommendations
for maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>American scholars attending the dinner including Susan L. Shirk,
a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia and
the Pacific; Stanley Rosen, a Asian affairs expert at the University
of Southern California; Carie Cable, Asia Society chief executive;
and Charles Wolf, a senior researcher with the prestigious think tank
the Rand Corporation.</P>
      <P>Chen will leave for Beaver Creek, Colorado Thursday to attend the
World Forum -- an annual meeting of politicians, parliamentarians,
academics as well as business and financial executives to be
organized by the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based
think tank. U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to attend the
conference that will run June 17-20.</P>
      <P>Chen will stay in the United States for a week before returning
home. He is scheduled to travel to Europe in July to chair a meeting
of the chiefs of Taiwan's missions in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF TOURIST ARRIVALS TO TAIWAN DROPS IN FIRST FIVE MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of tourist arrivals in the first
five months of the year totaled 1.13 million, down 7.19 percent from
the 2002 level, a spokesman for the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications said Thursday.</P>
      <P>This year's figures were compared with the 2002 levels since the
numbers for the same period of 2003 were anomalous because of the
impact of sever acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on worldwide
travel, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the fall in travel to frequent terrorist
attacks in the international community, the re-appearance of SARS in
March in mainland China and outbreaks of bird flu that affected many
Asian countries early this year. Political uncertainties at home
after the March 20 presidential election may also be a factor, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the bureau, the number of
tourists from Japan, Hong Kong and Macau, and the United States --
the leading three tourist sources for Taiwan -- all dropped in the
first five months compared to their 2002 records. The number of South
Korean tourists increased for the five-month period as did those
from Malaysia.</P>
      <P>In the face of the decline, Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan, who
recently began serving as head of a Cabinet task force to boost
Taiwan's tourist arrivals, has instructed relevant authorities to
promote local festivals and make them a feature to attract foreign
tourists.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has set the goal of doubling the number of
foreign tourist arrivals to Taiwan by 2008, a key segment of its
"Challenge 2008" -- a six-year national development plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MILITARY SHOULD FOLLOW CONSTITUTION, SERVE TAIWAN PEOPLE: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the Republic of China's armed forces should abide by the nation's
constitution and serve the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at the Chenkungling
army base in the central Taiwan county of Taichung where many new
soldiers are undergoing training courses.</P>
      <P>The president told officers and enlisted men at the army boot
camp that his greatest expectation regarding military education is
instilling service members with the concept of the separation of
military affairs from politics and enhancing their awareness of
mainland China's threat and hostility toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In this democratic era, Chen said, the military should be loyal
to the Republic of China, the ROC Constitution and the 23 million
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of leadership changes and transitions of power
between different political parties, all military service members
should consistently follow our constitution, serve our people and
remain loyal to the Republic of China," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since Chen's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party swept
to power in 2000 after more than 50 years of Kuomintang rule in
Taiwan, some veterans and senior officers have reportedly been
suspicious of the military's mission and role. Some retired and
active officers had been quoted in the past as claiming that they
would not fight for any pro-independence movement.</P>
      <P>Chen's speech was seen as clarifying his administration's
military build-up goal. In an address delivered a day earlier to mark
the 80th anniversary of the Chinese Military Academy in southern
Taiwan, Chen reaffirmed his commitment to pushing for constitutional
reform and bringing about a new constitution suitable for Taiwan's
present situation through constitutional procedures.</P>
      <P>He also stressed in that speech that the new constitution will
not touch on issues regarding sovereignty and territory or the
question of independence versus unification. He said his
constitutional engineering project will mainly be aimed at ensuring
good governance and forging an efficient administrative mechanism.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Defense Minister Lee Jye and many other
senior officials on his Chengkungling boot camp inspection tour. He
lunched together with all the officers and soldiers at the base as
part of the celebration of the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, one of
the main festivals on the Chinese calendar. Dragon Boat Festival
falls on June 22 this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DENIES IT IS LAX ON  ILLEGAL TRADE   OF RARE INDONESIAN WOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  19 (CNA)
(By W. C. Lin and P. C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's restrictions against the
import of the valuable tropical hardwood ramin are enforced, contrary
to a U.S. environmental group's accusation, the Economic Division of
the ROC Representative Office to the United States said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a news release issued recently, the U.S. Environmental
Investigation Agency (EIA) accused some Taiwan traders of illegally
importing Indonesian ramin wood through Malaysia and then exporting
it in the form of baby cribs to the United States.</P>
      <P>Since the ramin trees were cut down in the National Indonesian
Park, where orangutans live, the practice endangers the rare animal,
the group claimed.</P>
      <P>The division said in a statement that in April, the EIA had sent
a letter to the ROC office protesting Taiwan's illegal import of
ramin wood from Malaysia and requested that the island adopt measures
to protect the ramin tree.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Board of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs has amended relevant laws and has adopted measures
in accordance with CITIES (the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) rules to protect the
ramin tree, the division said that it also received affirmation from
the EIA after notifying the agency what the island has done to
prevent illegal trading in ramin wood.</P>
      <P>However, it complained that the EIA did not mention Taiwan's
efforts in its recent news release and the ROC office said that this
was regrettable.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan is not a member of CITIES, it still
has regulations in accordance with CITIES' rules to protect the
precious species, adding that the island reinforces control over the
trade of ramin wood.</P>
      <P>The division also said that the island's authorities have been
investigating Nan Far Woodworking Manufacturing company, the one
accused of trafficking in ramin wood by the EIA.</P>
      <P>As the EIA has said that Malaysia is the principle illegal
transit center for Indonesian ramin wood and that mainland China,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the United States and Great Britain are all
the main importers of the wood, the division said that it is unfair
that the EIA only accused Taiwan in its news release.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REVISED COMMODITY LABELING LAW TO COME INTO EFFECT JUNE 25</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A revised commodity labeling law will come
into effect next week to further protect the rights of consumers,
the Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Starting from June 25, all commodities will have to be labeled in
Chinese and English with information on the product's applications
and usages, as well as a consumer hotline telephone number.</P>
      <P>Officials from MOEA's Department of Commerce noted that President
Chen Shui-bian promulgated the newly revised commodity labeling law
in June 25, 2003 and after a year of awareness campaigning, the law
will be enforced.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the biggest difference between the old
and the revised version of the law is that it used to govern only
producers, manufacturers and importers, while the revised law will
also govern distributors.</P>
      <P>In line with Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization,
the revised law also stipulates that the original place of production
must be included and labeled in Chinese and English. The Chinese
translation should also not be more brief than the description on the
original label.</P>
      <P>In addition, the revised law also stipulates that if the
commodity is a food product, it should also be labeled with usage
and preservation instructions.</P>
      <P>The officials reminded all manufacturers to beware of the
regulations under the revised law, saying that violators will be
given a period to improve, but after that they can be fined between
NT$30,000 (US$895) and NT$300,000. Serious offenders could face a
suspension of their business for a specified period of time under the
revised law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Police on Saturday seized more than 3,800
kilograms of betel nuts smuggled from mainland China to Taiwan and
arrested three suspects in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>As now is off-season for betel nut harvesting in Taiwan, retail
prices for the product has risen substantially in recent days.
Criminal rings have worked hard to smuggle the product, also
known as "green diamond" for its market value, from mainland
China and Southeast Asia. In the past few weeks, police have managed
to seize several batches of smuggled betel nuts.</P>
      <P>The betel nuts seized in Saturday's raid were smuggled from
mainland China's Hainan Island. They were packed in a 20-ft
container and first shipped to the Taiwan-held frontline island
of Kinmen before arriving at Kaohsiung Harbor Friday evening.</P>
      <P>The owner claimed the cargo early Saturday. Acting on tips,
police tracked down on the product at a warehouse in
Kaoshiung's Chienchen district. The owner of the smuggled betel

    <HEADLINE>FORMER AIT CHAIRWOMAN ARRIVES IN TAIWAN FOR VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Washington and Beijing
may face some new situations after the U.S. presidential election in
November this year, a former top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Therese Shaheen, a former chairwoman of the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) that handles Taiwan-U.S. relations in the absence
of formal diplomatic ties, made the remarks after her arrival in
Taipei for a visit.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Beijing-Washington relations are strained now,
Shaheen said it depends on the perspective used in the observation.
In her view, she said, some new developments may appear after the
U.S. presidential election late this year.</P>
      <P>Shaheen is very friendly toward Taiwan. Some of her remarks in
the run-up to Taiwan's March 20 presidential election were seen as
supporting incumbent President Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid. She
abruptly resigned from the top AIT post after Taiwan's presidential
election. Previous reports said Beijing had pressured the Bush
administration to oust Shaheen.</P>
      <P>Shaheen told Taiwan reporters after her arrival at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport that a host of reasons led to her
resignation from the AIT chairmanship. But she would not elaborate.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government had invited Shaheen to attend
President Chen's May 20 inauguration for a second four-year term. Due
to her tight schedule, she postponed her visit until Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shaheen said she is very pleased to come to Taiwan to meet with
her old friends and to make friend with some other people.</P>
      <P>President Chen will receive Shaheen Monday to express his
gratitude for all the hospitality and dignified treatment arranged
by Shaheen for him during his transit stop in New York last August.
Chen will decorate Shaheen with the Order of Brillant Star in
recognition of her contribution to promoting Taiwan-U.S. ties during
her AIT stint.</P>
      <P>Several senior ROC officials in charge of diplomatic
and cross-Taiwan Strait affairs hosted a dinner in honor of Shaheen
Saturday, sources said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hawaii, June 18 (CNA)
(By Lin Yi-feng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Adm. Thomas B.
Fargo was quoted as having said Friday that he is very worried about
an outbreak of war in the Taiwan Strait because of miscalculation by
the governments on both sides.</P>
      <P>Fargo made the remarks while meeting with a Taiwan legislative
delegation, headed by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, at the
U.S. Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that civilian Taiwan visitors have been
allowed to visit the U.S. Pacific Command headquarters and military
bases in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Yuan-kuo of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) quoted Fargo as having told the delegation that three issues in
the Pacific region have made him unable to sleep at night --
little progress in removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean
Peninsula; a possible outbreak of war in the Taiwan Strait because of
miscalculation by the governments on both sides and mainland China's
accelerated military modernization as a result of its rapid economic
growth; and terrorist activities in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the U.S. Pacific Command sent several senior officers,
including a lieutenant general, a major general and three brigadier
generals, to brief them on the command's mission and the general
regional security situations as well as the functions of weapons that
Taiwan plans to buy from the United States.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, the legislative delegation visited Pearl
Harbor. Hsu said he and his colleagues boarded an Arleigh Burke-class
guided missile destroyer equipped with the highly advanced Aegis
radar system. ROC Vice Minister of National Defense Lei
Kuang-shu, who is accompanying the lawmakers on their current U.S.
tour, explained in detail the differences between the Arleigh
Burke-class destroyer and the Kidd-class destroyer.</P>
      <P>The United States has agreed to sell four Kidd-class destroyers
to Taiwan and the delivery is scheduled to begin in 2005. Hsu
quoted U.S. officers as having hinted that if Taiwan intends to
buy the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the delivery could not begin
until after 2010 or 2011.</P>
      <P>The 13-member delegation arrived in Hawaii Thursday on the first
leg of a U.S. tour aimed at discussing Taiwan's new arms procurement
projects.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of 13 lawmakers from across the
political spectrum, visited a U.S. marine base at Kaneohe to take a
close look at the P-3C anti-submarine aircraft, one of the items
Taiwan plans to purchase.</P>
      <P>The ROC's Cabinet has approved a special military budget of
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) for the purchase of eight
submarines, a modified version of the Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
system and a squadron of 12 P3-C anti-submarine aircraft over a
15-year period starting in 2005. The United States offered to sell
the military hardware to Taiwan in 2001 as part of its most
comprehensive arms package to the island since 1992. The special
budget bill is now pending approval of the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>After the Hawaii visit, the legislative delegation will travel to
Washington, D.C. via San Francisco. In the company of ROC
Representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen, the delegation
will visit relevant U.S. administrative departments June 21 and
exchange views with senior officials on Taiwan's defense needs.</P>
      <P>On the following day, the delegation will be briefed on special
functions of the weaponry systems that the United States intends to
sell to Taiwan. The mission will also meet with U.S. congressmen
before leaving for Texas June 24 to visit a U.S. Patriot PAC-III
missile base. The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei June
28.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC JUSTICE MINISTER MEETS WITH OVERSEAS CHINESE IN DALLAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Dallas,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Chang Huei-yen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Justice Chen
Ding-nan told overseas Chinese in Dallas Friday night that several
government agencies are conducting investigations into the March 19
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to questions as to why a committee was not
organized to look into the shooting, which left both the president
and the vice president slightly injured. Taiwan police have yet to
take any suspects into custody and have few clues.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Control Yuan, the nation's highest
watchdog body, and the Criminal Investigation Bureau have conducted
investigations into the shooting, and although the names may be
different, they are doing exactly the same thing.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Dallas Friday afternoon to begin a "journey of
gratitude" after attending the 2004 summer conference of the
U.S. National Association of Attorneys General, which opened Tuesday
in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he was in the United States drumming up support
for President Chen during his 2000 campaign. This trip is to thank
belatedly supporters of the president and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>More than 100 overseas Chinese attended Minister Chen's speech
although there were also around 60 who unfurled banners outside to
protest against him, questioning why an investigation committee on
the shooting has not been formed and why there has been no movement
on investigating first lady Wu Shu-chen's alleged insider trading in
the stock market.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Minister Chen said that supporters of the
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party have
demanded that the Legislative Yuan form an investigation committee;
however, such a committee would be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>He noted that the U.S. Congress has the right to conduct
investigations, but there are no such rights in Taiwan's Legislative
Yuan because the ROC Constitution gives this power to the Control
Yuan, which has begun investigations on possible lapses on the part
of civil servants, and part of the investigation report will be
released soon.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau is also working on the case and
as no suspects have been arrested yet, it is still too early to talk
about criminal responsibility.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if the Legislative Yuan were to investigate
possible political and administrative lapses by civil servants, it
would encroach on the Control Yuan's power and if it were to look
into possible criminal activities, that would infringe the judicial
rights of those legally responsible for criminal investigations.</P>
      <P>President Chen won the March 20 presidential election by a narrow
margin of 29,518 votes out of more than 13 million cast, and the
supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" have since demanded a re-count
of the ballots and the formation of a committee to investigate the
election-eve shooting, which they claimed unfairly swayed the
bitterly contested election in Chen's favor.</P>
      <P>Minister Chen's schedule for the "journey of gratitude" is tight.
He will fly to Houston after Dallas and then proceed to New York,
Boston, Chicago and Honolulu before returning to Taiwan June 30.</P>

      <P>Officials of the state-owned Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) said Saturday that they have found abundant
natural gas reserves in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, and in the waters
near Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said the company has decided to explore these
areas, which are expected to produce a total of some 7 billion cubic
meters of natural gas.</P>
      <P>This was the second such news for CPC in the last few days,
following its recent announcement of the discovery of natural gas in
Kuantien village, Tainan County, the hometown of President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>According to CPC officials, Taiwan's terrestrial natural gas
reserves center on its western areas and the company estimates that
it can discover another 1.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas in
the next five years in these areas.</P>
      <P>The CPC is conducting an environmental evaluation for the two
natural gas fields in the waters off Kaohsiung and expects that the
natural gas can be transported to Taiwan proper in 2010 if the
exploration work goes smoothly.</P>
      <P>In addition, the exploration in CPC's overseas natural gas fields
in Indonesia and Ecuador is underway, and work in the natural gas
field in Venezuela will begin in 2006.</P>
      <P>CPC officials estimate that the natural gas CPC can produce in
its overseas fields in the next five years will be equivalent to 90
million barrels of oil.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR FORCE JET FIGHTERS TO CONDUCT TRAINING DRILLS ON EXPRESSWAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Air Force jet fighters will practice
takeoffs and landings at the Jenteh section of the Sun Yat-sen
Expressway in July as part of the Hankuang (Chinese Glory) No. 20
exercise, a senior official confirmed Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Mao-hsiung, director of the Southern District Engineering
Office under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC), said the 2.7 kilometer Jenteh section in the southern county
of Tainan has been refurbished in preparation for the upcoming
military exercise.</P>
      <P>The MOTC's Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau (TANFB) has also
drafted an alternative traffic plan to minimize the possible adverse
impact of the closure of the Jenteh section during the exercise, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>It will mark the first time in 25 years that the military has
conducted training exercises on the island's first north-south
expressway since its inauguration in 1979.</P>
      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH) issued a news statement
around noon confirming that jet fighters practicing landings and
takeoffs on the expressway is one of the scheduled maneuvers for the
upcoming Hankuang No. 20 exercise, the largest combined services
training drill of the year, which usually lasts for several months
and covers computerized war games and live-fire exercises.</P>
      <P>The AFGH statement said the planned expressway takeoff and
landing drills are mainly aimed at evaluating the feasibility of
using alternative runways during wartime to sustain the armed forces'
combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>The statement further said the AFGH is negotiating with relevant
civilian authorities and will work out a comprehensive operational
plan to minimize possible inconveniences for local citizens.</P>
      <P>Noting that using alternative runways can help diversify military
aircraft deployments, the AFGH statement said the upcoming training
drill is part of the Air Force's efforts to upgrade its overall
combat capabilities to defend national security.</P>
      <P>The Sun Yat-sen Expressway accommodates several sections which
can be used as runways for military aircraft takeoffs and landings
during wartime.</P>
      <P>The Jenteh section is close to President Chen Shui-bian's
hometown of Guantien. MOTC officials said they don't think that there
is any correlation between the military's choice of the Jenteh
section and mainland China's possible attack plan.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, one of the expressway sections that can be
converted into military aircraft runways has too many private houses
in its vicinity and has thus been ruled out as the venue for the
training drill.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the MOTC was informed of the military's plan to conduct
training drills on the Jenteh section in early January.</P>
      <P>"We have since launched a renovation plan which was completed
late last month, " Tsai said, adding that the ministry has paid
special heed to material quality and workmanship in the refurbishing
process.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the expressway from the Jenteh intersection to the
Luchu intersection will be closed to traffic for at least 12 hours on
the days of rehearsal and formal exercise.</P>
      <P>"The MOTC has worked out a detailed traffic control plan and will
designate several alternative highways for motorists," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Some local citizens said they hope the training drill can be open
for public viewing under proper security measures because they have
never seen any aircraft using the expressway as alternative runways
for takeoffs and landings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A rally to protest Taiwan's plan to spend
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) for U.S. weapons called for the
government to freeze the arms procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of people took part in the rally in downtown Taipei,
which was sponsored by activists from civic and environmental
protection groups and people representing education reform and
workers' rights from the private sector.</P>
      <P>The people gathered in front of Taipei Railway Station, wearing
green headbands emblazoned with the words "Opposed to arms
procurement" and holding posters. They also signed petitions opposing
the arms procurement.</P>
      <P>They said that they are opposed to government's plan to purchase
arms without public discussion and claimed that the deal was dictated
by the United States.</P>
      <P>If the government insists on spending NT$610.8 billion on
military hardware from the United States, they said that they would
not rule out the possibility of scuttling the plan through a
referendum.</P>
      <P>The people walked through the Taipei streets to the nearby Feb.
28 Peace Memorial Park and shouted slogans such as, "Opposed to an
arms race, insist on ideas of progress," "Opposed to receiving orders
from the superpower and insist on treading one's own path, " and
"Opposed to no public discussion and insist on public participation
in the nation's policy."</P>
      <P>They also performed music and skits in the park to highlight
their appeal.</P>
      <P>Huang Wu-hsiung, education reform activist and one of the
sponsors, expressed the hope that Taiwan can find a third option
other than the present plight of relying on the United States while
resisting to Beijing's "one country, two systems" unification scheme.</P>
      <P>To show that the rally has no party affiliation, no political
party flags were displayed throughout the demonstration, and children
and their parents led the demonstrators along the way.</P>
      <P>According to the sponsors, if the NT$610.8 billion is not spent,
the money will be enough to promote 12-year compulsory education
10-fold, a plan which has been on the drawing board for a decade and
has still not been finalized. The money could also help sustain
an annual environmental protection budget of NT$10 billion for 60
years, and could subsidize the medical bills for children under
three years old for 200 years.</P>
      <P>But they said the huge arms procurement, which the government
plans to sell national land and float national bonds to finance, will
squeeze out all other plans.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved the NT$610.8 billion arms procurement
early this month to buy six sets of Patriot PAC-III missiles, eight
conventional diesel-fuel submarines and 12 P-3C anti-missile
aircraft. The package is now pending review and approval by the

    <HEADLINE>EXPERIMENTAL SCHOOLS MAKE EDUCATION MORE DIVERSIFIED: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said
Saturday that experimental schools make Taiwan's education more
diversified.</P>
      <P>Tu made the remarks while receiving four students from Holistic
High School in Sanyi, Miaoli County who just returned from climbing
Mount McKinley, Alaska, Friday night.</P>
      <P>In a symposium about educational reforms held at National
Chengchi University in Taipei, Tu noted that he supports the
experimental schools in addition to regular schools, as they may
spark creative ideas.</P>
      <P>Experimental schools represent a stimulus to official education,
Tu said, and urged education departments in counties and cities
around the island to open their doors to these experimental schools
and supply them with more resources.</P>
      <P>Tu cited his own example, revealing that in 1990 he dedicated
himself to the study of medical history, which was considered unusual
and unpopular at the time, when he was a fellow researcher at the
Institute of History and Philology at Academia Sinica, the most
prestigious academic institution in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said this gave him many new ideas and new thoughts.</P>
      <P>Huang Cheng-hsiung, president of Holistic High School, who was
also present at the occasion, noted that he was proud of the
achievements of the four students who scaled Mount McKinley, the
highest mountain in North America. Among them, Chang Yuan-chih is
only 15 years old and might have been Taiwan's youngest mountaineer
on high mountains, while Chen Yi-chih, the only girl of the four, is
only 19 years old, Huang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW NATURAL GAS FIELD WORTH NT$2.5 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) on
Saturday confirmed the reserves of a natural gas field in Guantien,
Taiwan County to have about 400 million cubic meters of natural gas
deposits worth a production value of NT$2.5 billion (US$74.47
million).</P>
      <P>CPC Vice Executive Director Lu Ming-ta said Guantien, which
happens to be the hometown of President Chen Shui-bian, was known to
have natural gas deposits back in 1992, but the exact location was
pinpointed last year.</P>
      <P>Lu said that it is estimated that the first well of the natural
gas field will have a maximum natural gas production of 46,000 cubic
meters daily, and if calculated by two wells with a daily production
of 60,000 cubic meters, then it could produce for 20 years and create
a production value of NT$2.5 billion.</P>
      <P>If the development plan goes smoothly, natural gas in Guantien is
expected to provide for Taiwan proper starting in 2010, raising the
level of domestic supply of natural gas while cutting reliance on
foreign imports.</P>
      <P>The CPC rents the rice paddy where the field is located
NT$400,000 a year, Lu said, adding that the company will reciprocate
to local people depending on the result of the exploitation of the
natural gas.</P>
      <P>The CPC is the only petroleum and natural gas prospector in
Taiwan and has achieved a revenue of NT$150 billion over the past
decades.</P>
      <P>Buoyed by the find of the natural gas field in Guantien, CPC
Chairman Kuo Chin-tsai said that the company will increase
exploration, saying that it has appropriated a budget for this of
NT$15 billion between 2002 and 2007. Of that amount, NT$5.5 billion
is earmarked for land exploration, NT$1.9 billion for sea exploration
and NT$7.6 billion for overseas exploration.</P>
      <P>He said that the company hopes that the oil and gas
exploration side of the business will account for 30 percent of the
company's total profits by 2007.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTY CHARTER REVISION TO GIVE PRESIDENT OPTION: DPP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian won't resign from
his post as Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman immediately
after the party amends its charter at its upcoming national congress,
the convener of the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming said he on Friday initiated the proposal to change
the party charter which stipulates that the DPP candidate elected the
nation's president is automatically the party's chairman, to give the
president the option of stepping down as party chairman.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, if the president chooses to step down
as DPP chairman, then the party's Central Executive Committee will
choose a new chairman from among the party's vice chairmen.</P>
      <P>Ker said that President Chen will have a freer hand in carrying
out his two major tasks of revising the nation's constitution and
improving ties with the mainland in his second term if he is not the
DPP chairman, adding that the revision to the party's charter will
give him this option.</P>
      <P>The proposal also addresses the problem in the current DPP
charter which does not clearly stipulate which vice chairman should
take the helm of the party when the party chief is incapable of
carrying out his job, Ker continued.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP often alters its apparatus to adapt to the
evolving policial situation with a view to increasing the party's
strength.</P>
      <P>Ker said that the amendment has already won endorsement from
various factions within the DPP and that he believes it will be
approved by the party congress which is scheduled for next month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE PROMOTION MISSION TO VISIT AFRICA IN NOVEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will organize a trade
promotion delegation to visit various African countries in November
in view of the increased opening of markets in that part of the
world, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The mission, to be organized by the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign
Trade, is slated to travel to Morocco, Egypt and Nigeria in late
November, and Taiwan companies in the fields of medical-care
equipment, automobile parts and accessories, hardware, and textiles
are particularly encouraged to take part in the mission, the MOEA
official said.</P>
      <P>Morocco, which has posted an average annual economic growth rate
of 5.5 percent in recent years, has a great demand for machinery
equipment, the official said, forecasting that the North African
country is expected to further open its market following the signing
of a free trade agreement with the United States last week.</P>
      <P>Egypt, Taiwan's second-largest trade partner in Africa, imported
US$186 million worth of Taiwan products last year, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the second half of this year will present a
good opportunity for Taiwan companies to explore business
opportunities in Egypt because the neighboring market of Iraq will be
boosted with the U.S.-led coalition forces' handing back of
sovereignty of Iraq to the Iraqi people in late June.</P>
      <P>Nigeria, with a population of more than 120 million people, is a
potential market for a wide range of Taiwan industries because many
sectors in the African country are in their initial stages of further
development, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MUST CEMENT TIES WITH WASHINGTON: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan-U.S. relations are unlikely
to undergo a structural change in the coming years, Taiwan still
needs to cement its links with the United States amid the many
challenges arising from warming Beijing-Washington ties, a well-known
political observer said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Bau Tzong-ho, dean of National Taiwan University's College of
Social Sciences, made the comments at a seminar held by the
Foundation on International &amp; Cross-strait Studies with the aim of
offering the government valuable advice in view of the many problems
foreseen in Taipei-Washington-Beijing ties on the fronts of national
security, national defense, cross-Taiwan Strait relations and
political affairs.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Washington will remain firm in its position of
requesting that both Taiwan and mainland China exercise
self-restraint to avoid conflict, Bau warned that pressure from
mainland China will become stronger on Taiwan as the mainland begins
to engage with neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that relations between Washington and Beijing
are getting warmer, the United States still views the mainland as a
potential rival and also as a collaborator at the same time, Bau
said.</P>
      <P>If U.S. President George W. Bush fails to win re-election at the
end of this year, Washington's foreign policy is expected to shift
toward multilateralism, he analyzed. Should this happen and be
coupled with political reform in mainland China, Taiwan will become
further isolated diplomatically in the international community, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, Taiwan should do its best to minimize
political rows at home in its pursuit of democratization and
Taiwanization so as to maintain its status-quo, which is of extreme
significance to the Taiwan Strait security.</P>
      <P>As any change to Taiwan's status-quo would pose a very large
threat to Taipei-Washington-Beijing's ties, Taiwan should strengthen
and upgrade its relations with the United States and step up two-way
military cooperation while seeking greater diplomatic backing from
the European Union to curb increased pressure from the mainland, he
opined.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should also promote dialogue between Taiwan entrepreneurs
and their counterparts from Japan and South Korea to counter the
mainland's growing economic power in the region, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has asserted that
any leader of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should be
elected through a democratic process, a DPP official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, DPP deputy secretary-general, made the remarks
when he commented on a proposal initiated last Friday by Legislator
Ker Chien-ming, convener of the DPP legislative caucus, for amending
the party charter to give President Chen the option of stepping down
as party chairman.</P>
      <P>The DPP charter stipulates that the party's candidate elected the
nation's president is automatically the party's chairman.</P>
      <P>Chen has made it clear that the DPP has no problem on the
transfer of leadership and that any party leader should be elected
through a democratic process, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP headquarters has already completed its
mission of winning the 2004 presidential election, Lee said that
constitutional reform is now the party's most important historic
mission.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the DPP charter proposed by Ker and endorsed by
lawmakers from various factions in the party is to allow Chen to have
a supra-partisan and neutral position in promoting constitutional
reform which, they believe, will facilitate the reform by helping in
reaching consensus among the ruling and opposition parties, according
to Lee.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, who is considered
as a potential candidate to succeed Chen as the DPP chairman if the
president decides to step down from the party chairmanship, said
Sunday that he is too busy to be the DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>According to the proposed amendment, if the president chooses to
step down as DPP chairman, then the party's Central Executive
Committee will choose a new chairman from among the party's vice
chairmen.</P>
      <P>Ker said that the amendment has already won endorsement from
various factions within the DPP and that he believes it will be
approved by the party congress which is scheduled for July 18.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM TOOL VALUABLE IN RESISTING ONE CHINA POLICY: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June (CNA)
(By Mauro Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The referendum tool could be valuable for
Taiwan in resisting efforts by Beijing or the international community
to impose the "one China policy" on it, a scholar said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Teng Li-wen, deputy executive director of the Foundation on
International and Cross-strait Studies, noted at a workshop in Taipei
held by the foundation that President Chen Shui-bian did not
acknowledge the one China principle in his May 20 inaugural address
for a second term, and that Beijing did not admit the existence of
the Republic of China in its May 17 statement.</P>
      <P>The widely conflicting political views between the two sides
means that cross-strait relations will swing between "cold war" and
"cold peace" over the course of Chen's new four-year term, Dong
predicted.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has made out a case for its " peaceful rise, "
claiming that it is a plus for regional peace rather than a threat to
anyone. Meanwhile, Taiwan has thoroughly developed into a democracy
and has been trying to win international sympathy through this fact,
Dong said.</P>
      <P>He said that the United States is tilting toward mainland China
in the triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relationship because
Washington needs Beijing's support in tackling regional and
international issues.</P>
      <P>Dong called for the establishment of an economic and trade
interaction mechanism between Taiwan and mainland China as a way of
easing tension across the strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR URGES FINANCIAL REFORM, EASED RULES ON MAINLAND INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should speed up its financial
liberalization, deepen its reform in the field and ease restrictions
on mainland-bound investment to help promote Taiwan business
interests, a prominent scholar urged Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jong-fong, vice president of the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research, made the suggestion in a seminar held by the
Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies while making
public an overall analysis on Taiwan's economic, political, security
and social challenges over the coming four years.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan will experience structural changes in
bilateral relations with its major trade partners, Chang warned that
the mainland market share currently enjoyed by Taiwan companies will
begin to decline and that mainland China's emergence as a major
economic power will increasingly marginalize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the appreciation of the mainland currency --
the renminbi -- as well as the mainland's expected entry into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and its signing of "closer
economic partnership agreements" with countries in the region will
pose the largest threat to Taiwan in its bid to join in regional
economic integration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the lack of a mechanism for settling Taiwan-mainland
trade disputes, Taiwan's growing financial difficulties, as well as
the exodus of talent and capital from Taiwan to the mainland are some
of the things that will place major pressure on Taiwan's
macro-economy, he added.</P>
      <P>He called on the government to craft a white paper to outline its
prime economic and trade policies as a way of displaying its resolve
in strengthening Taiwan's economic power by taking advantage of its
high-quality workforce and manufacturing skills in the face of robust
mainland Chinese competition.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's complete globalization in terms of trade and economy
would not only increase the island's competitiveness but also help
protect its political independence, Chang said, urging the government
to develop Taiwan into a "high-tech island" and a "world business
operations hub" in its drive to seek a role for the country in the
international marketplace.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's value-added capabilities will help reduce pressure from
domestic companies' demands for opening direct trade and transport
links with the mainland and will also help curb Beijing's designs to
use Taiwan businesses to push the government to the negotiating
table, he claimed.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Kurds advancing ro
reclaim land in northern Iraq.

Thousands of ethnic Kurds are pushing into lands formerly held by
Iraqi Arabs, forcing tens of thousands of them to flee to ramshackle
refugee camps and transforming the demographic and political map of
northern Iraq. The new movement appears to have quickened this spring
amid confusion about American policy.

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS CALL FOR REFERENDUM ON NEW CAPITAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three lawmakers from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Sunday called for a referendum on whether
to choose a new capital after Vice President Annette Lu revealed a
day earlier that the central government is mulling over relocating
from Taipei to Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers Trong R. Chai, Lin Chin-hsing and Chiang Chao-yi
urged in a press release that the government hold a referendum on the
issue to let the people decide where the nation's capital should be
located.</P>
      <P>Based on national security considerations, the three said in the
press release, it is better if a nation's political center is
separate from its economic center, pointing to the example of the
United States whose political center is in Washington, D.C., and
whose economic heart is in New York City.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that mainland China has hundreds of missiles aimed
at Taipei, the lawmakers urged that the central government relocate
out of Taipei for the sake of security.</P>
      <P>Several lawmakers from the opposition People First Party (PFP)
said they won't oppose the idea of having a referendum on the issue,
but added they doubt that the DPP lawmakers could get enough
sponsorship to be able to hold the referendum.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP lawmaker Lee Hung-chun said the DPP wants to shift
the capital to a new location because the party has difficulty wooing
voters in Taipei.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) secured Monday a
credit loan from France-based CALYON Bank for its purchase of three
A330-300 planes, a CAL spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>CAL General Manager Philip H.H. Wei and CALYON Bank Taiwan
General Manager Michel Roy signed the 10-year loan agreement worth
US$235 million on behalf of their respective companies.</P>
      <P>Wei said at the signing ceremony that he strongly believes
bilateral ties between CAL and CALYON Bank will be further
strengthened by the credit loan.</P>
      <P>CAL -- Taiwan's largest carrier -- will use the preferential loan
to buy three A330-300 planes, the first of which will be delivered in
late June, with the remaining two delivered in July and December,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The three A330-300s will replace CAL's A300-600s on routes within
Asia to reduce the carrier's running costs in maintenance, personnel
training and travel time, the spokesman said, adding that each
A330-300 airplane has 313 seats, 18 percent more than the A330-600.</P>
      <P>CAL will be able to manage a targeted pre-tax profit of NT$31
billion (US$919 million) for 2004, despite the adverse effect of
rising fuel prices, the spokesman forecast.</P>
      <P>In a bid to phase out the carrier's ageing fleet and upgrade its
service quality, CAL has been searching for financial backup to
sustain its expansion program, he added, pointing out that the CALYON
loan is proof that CAL profit-making abilities and prospects are
endorsed by foreign banks.</P>

      <P>Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials urged local businessmen Monday to diversify their overseas
investments and reduce their over-reliance on the mainland Chinese
market, as the mainland is suffering a serious shortage of
electricity.</P>
      <P>MOEA Investment Commission officials noted that although the

mainland's overheated economy, Taiwanese businessmen's investments on
the mainland have continued normally, with the amount of investment
in the first five months of the year growing by 60.34 percent.</P>

investments are continuing, they believe that the effects of the

there still has high risk and they suggested that investors consider

    <HEADLINE>NEW COMPUTER-SIMULATED WAR GAME SYSTEM CAPABLE OF OVERSEAS LINK-UP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Lee Jye confirmed Monday
that the armed forces' new computer-simulated war game system can
link up with foreign countries' computer-simulated war game systems.</P>
      <P>Lee made the confirmation during a luncheon with local
journalists, the first time he has met with the press since assuming
office a month ago.</P>
      <P>Lee said the new system has been tested in a series of
computer-simulated war games that were concluded last weekend as part
of the Hankuang No. 20 military exercise -- the largest combined
services training drill of the year that will last for several months
and cover both computer-simulated war games and live-fire drills.</P>
      <P>He confirmed that the United States sent some 60 military experts
to observe the maiden use of the new combined services command system
in the computer-simulated war games.</P>
      <P>Lee said the American experts were impressed by the armed forces'
better-than-expected performance in the simulated war games with the
new command system.</P>
      <P>Media reports said the United States has agreed to conduct joint
computer-simulated war games with Taiwan from 2005. As the U.S.
computer-simulated war game system can be linked up with Japan's, the
reports said, Taiwan, Japan and the United States will be able to
conduct joint computer-simulated war games through the U.S. Pacific
Command headquarters in Hawaii in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee would not confirm whether Taiwan's computer-simulated war
game system can be linked with Japan's, saying only that if the
opportunity presents itself, Taiwan will be more than willing to
conduct joint computer-simulated war games with Japan.</P>
      <P>Turning to reports that air force jet fighters will practice
landings and takeoffs on the Sun Yat-sen Expressway's Jen-teh section

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun quoted President Chen

      <P>Yu made the remarks during a founding ceremony for the Republic

      <P>Noting that he has met with Chen every week since the March 20

about Taiwan's solidarity, cross-strait ties, the island's economic
development and prosperity, as well as stressing that the government
has set goals for the nation's development in the world community.</P>
      <P>Yu said he has great confidence in Taiwan's economic development
despite mounting international oil prices and predicted that the
country's economic growth will reach 6.7 percent in the second
quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The economic growth registered 6.28 percent in the first quarter
of this year and is expected to reach 4.6 percent and 4.18 percent,
respectively, for the third and fourth quarters, with the economic
growth for the whole year estimated at 5.41 percent, according to Yu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HOPES TO JOIN U.S.-INITIATED JSF DEVELOPMENT PLAN: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
informed the United States of its desire to take part in the
development of a new generation of combat aircraft known as the Joint
Strike Fighter (JSF), Defense Minister Lee Jye said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a luncheon with local journalists,
the first time that he has met with the press since assuming office a
month ago.</P>
      <P>Lee said the JSF is still in the research and development (R&amp;D)
stage and that the program will take 10 to 15 years to complete.</P>
      <P>"We hope to join this ambitious development program. But no
concrete progress has been made. The two sides are still discussing
the feasibility of Taiwan's participation in the project, " Lee told
reporters.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the JSF project is designed to develop a new
generation of affordable stealth tactical warplanes for the 21st
Century.</P>
      <P>Touching on the military's new arms procurement plans, Lee said
the MND usually uses its annual budget of about NT$260 billion to
finance its weaponry procurement projects, such as the purchase of
four second-hand Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, the MND must rely on special budget plans
for certain large-scale arms procurement projects because its regular
annual budget is not enough to finance such unexpected spending.</P>
      <P>For instance, Lee said, the MND has come up with a special
military budget of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) for the
purchase of eight submarines, a modified version of the Patriot
PAC-III anti-missile system and a squadron of 12 P3-C anti-submarine
aircraft over a 15-year period starting in 2005. The United States
offered to sell the military hardware to Taiwan in 2001 as part of
its most comprehensive arms package to the island since 1992. The
Cabinet has approved the special budget bill, which is now pending
approval of the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>A legislative delegation, headed by Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng, is presently on a U.S. visit to get a better
understanding of the functions of the military hardware the Bush
administration is offering. Delegation members said after visiting a
U.S. naval base in Hawaii over the weekend that the United States
might also be willing to sell Taiwan the Arleigh Burke-class
destroyer equipped with the extremely advanced Aegis radar system.</P>
      <P>If the United States will truly sell the Aegis-class destroyer to
Taiwan, Lee said, the ROC navy will use its regular annual budget to
finance the purchase and will not ask for additional budget.</P>
      <P>Lee said mainland China's military budget has continued to grow
at a double-digit rate. In contrast, he said, Taiwan's defense budget
has been maintained at roughly the same level in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's ever-mounting military threat,
Lee said, the military needs the three new arms procurement projects
to upgrade its defense capabilities. He said he hopes lawmakers and
the public will support the projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT FAVORS POPULAR ELECTION OF DPP CHIEF: DPP SECRETARY-GENERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian has not
said so, it is "obvious" that he supports the idea of having his
successor as Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman elected
directly by all party members, DPP Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung said Monday.</P>
      <P>"If the president chooses not to double as DPP chief, he would
not necessarily appoint a vice chairman and would not appoint that
vice chairman as his successor, therefore the best way is to give the
party members the right to choose their chief," Chang said.</P>
      <P>However, this changes entails a revision of the party charter and
should be referred to a party reformation panel for study, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>The DPP secretary-general quoted Chen as saying that he could
hardly moonlight as DPP chairman in light of the fact that he wants
to devote all his energies to constitutional reform and dealing with
Beijing during his second term as president.</P>
      <P>Ever since Chen let slip Friday that he would rather not double
as head of the DPP, speculation has raged as to how his successor
will be chosen.</P>
      <P>A proposal to change the party charter to allow Chen to quit the
job of party chairman was initiated by DPP lawmaker Ker Chien-ming,
who suggested that the DPP's Central Executive Committee should elect
one vice chairman to head the party in case the president opts not to
double as party chairman.</P>
      <P>But the proposal, reportedly to be dictated by Chen, backfired
among DPP members, some of whom called for a vote by party members
for chairman as provided for in the party charter.</P>
      <P>The method of picking a chairman through popular election among
its members was changed slightly in 2002 when the DPP party congress
decided to let any DPP member who won the presidential election
become automatically the party chief.</P>
      <P>Some of the DPP members criticized Ker for presenting the
proposal before the deadline of June 18 for submitting any motion to
be discussed at the July 18 party congress, as no other motion in
this regard could be put forward.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Tsai Huang-liang expressed reservations about the
idea of a popular election for DPP chairman, saying that the party
might be split if a chairman elected by the party were to compete
with the president for power within the party.</P>
      <P>However, he favored Chang Chun-hsiung's views on setting up a
party reform panel to study the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CONSENSUS NEEDED FOR FULL OPENING TO MAINLAND TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Full opening of Taiwan to mainland Chinese
tourists is an established policy of the government but will need
full discussion among related government agencies and cross-Taiwan
Strait consensus on handling the matter, an official of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san made the remarks after Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said earlier that he
hopes for a full opening to mainland tourists.</P>
      <P>The government has allowed mainland people studying abroad and
those who have obtained permanent resident status overseas to come to
Taiwan since 2002, and further eased the restrictions later that year
to allow mainland Chinese living overseas -- including Hong Kong and
Macau -- for more than four years and who have work permits, to visit
Taiwan, along with their spouses and direct relatives.</P>
      <P>Chiu noted that although full opening to mainland tourists is an
established policy of the government, implementation of the policy
hinges on the wishes of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as
the integration of views among the relevant government agencies. When
the time is ripe, the MAC will make an announcement, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that full opening will create problems with visa
overstays and legal disputes and added that both sides must reach
consensus on such issues before a full opening.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that unilateral opening without the consent
of the mainland authorities will be meaningless and will only bring
trouble for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fu Tung-cheng, director of the MAC's Department of Economic
Affairs, said that since the opening to mainland tourists in 2002, an
average of 1,000 have been coming to Taiwan per month.</P>
      <P>"The opening to mainland Chinese tourists is not for the sake of
economic purposes, " Fu claimed, adding that the basic consideration
is to "enhance bilateral exchanges and understanding."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san said Monday that he hopes to see the
mainland Chinese authorities allow mainland people full access to
visit Taiwan as tourists.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that he hopes to hold bilateral talks on the matter
with He Guangwei, mainland China's director of National Tourism
Administration, at the 2004 Asia Pacific Economic and Cooperation
forum Tourism Ministerial meeting in Chile in October.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Chen Shui-bian said in his May 20 inaugural
speech that cross-Taiwan Strait relations should be stabilized, Lin
expressed the hope that the mainland will take advantage of this
goodwill by allowing its people to use Taiwan as a tourism
destination.</P>
      <P>As the issue will involve a number of issues such as legal
disputes, Lin also said that both sides must have consultations based
on dignity and parity.</P>
      <P>He admitted that when he attended a 2002 APEC Tourism Ministerial
Meeting in Mexico and proposed the issue to He, Beijing refused to
discuss the issue, but he said he will take the chance of the Chile
meeting in October to try again.</P>
      <P>Lin said he had talked with Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council, about opening Taiwan to mainland tourists, and that
Wu also said it is a question that can be discussed.</P>
      <P>The government has allowed mainland people studying abroad and
those who have obtained permanent resident status overseas to come to

    <HEADLINE>PROPOSAL FOR TAIWAN TO PLAY ROLE AS SERVICE HUB FOR MAINLAND MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With mainland China's increasing emergence
as a vast market and a major driving force of the world's economic
growth, Taiwan enjoys an upper hand in serving as the service hub of
the mainland market amid the many benefits and challenges, according
to local experts.</P>
      <P>In the face of a new wave of economic evolution across the globe
because of the mainland's simmering economic clout, Taiwan stands a
good chance of serving as a service center for the mainland market,
on the grounds that more and more foreign and overseas Chinese
enterprises are rushing to cash in on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The mainland's success in economic reforms over the past 20 years
has lured a large number of foreign and overseas Chinese investors to
set up strongholds there, they said, adding that the influx of huge
amounts of foreign capital has created a need for skilled workers and
hi-quality management personnel there.</P>
      <P>As the mainland is rapidly transforming into a lucrative market
and a manufacturing powerhouse that is indispensable to the rest of
the world, Taiwan should grab the opportunity to seek to play a key
role by using its own unique advantages in view of the many
unanticipated opportunities and challenges, they suggested.</P>
      <P>Therefore, creating an outlet and building common ground for the
potential Chinese enterprises and hi-tech talent around the world has
become a significant issue at a time when the Chinese-speaking
population and the mainland market are set to become a symbol in the
coming knowledge-based era to be dominated by high technologies, they
claimed.</P>
      <P>By that rationale, the top task now is how to consolidate the
potential, expertise and resources of Chinese people across the
globe, they said, adding that successful consolidation would be a
turning point in history for all Chinese people.</P>
      <P>While the Greater Chinese economy has become the fastest-growing
region in the world, Taiwan's strong industrial levels and advanced
management know-how, along with its research and development
capabilities, have made it suitable to serve as a service hub for the
mainland market and a platform for Western companies to break into
the market, they analyzed.</P>
      <P>Acer Group Chairman Stan Shih said recently that geographically,
the mainland is an "old continent," but in terms of technological and
economic progress, it is a "new continent" full of possibilities.</P>
      <P>He encouraged Taiwan businesses to "go west" in search of greater
expansion and called for a global combination of Chinese capital,
technology and brainpower to gain a bigger slice of the international
market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies are capable of playing a leadership role for
Chinese enterprises around the world and full cooperation of the
economies in Greater China will undoubtedly be profitable and
invincible, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESEARCHER URGES EFFICIENT USE OF RAINWATER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Academia Sinica researcher urged the
government and private sector Monday to make efficient use of
rainwater because draught and flooding will be problems on the island
in the future.</P>
      <P>Wang Chung-ho, a fellow researcher at Academia Sinica's Institute
of Earth Sciences, quoting statistics showing that rainfall in Taiwan
last year fell 1,000 millimeters compared with past averages.
Although rainfall increased 20 percent in the north and fell 10
percent in the south, the days that it did rain, the precipitation
was more abundant than usual, Wang said, adding that the number of
rainy days declined significantly.</P>
      <P>If this becomes a trend, he said, the nation will be susceptible
to increased flooding because current drainage systems are unable to
move water efficiently. Also, Wang predicted that the number of days
without rain will be larger, increasing the chances of draught.</P>
      <P>He said that with decreasing rainfall, people will depend more on
ground water, especially in the southwestern and southeastern plains
that are home to many crops, where 20 million tons of ground water
was pumped out in 2000 alone.</P>
      <P>A joint research effort between Wang and other academics found
that Taiwan's annual rainfall has averaged 75 billion tons over the
last few years, with four billion tons seeping into the water table.
However, consumption of ground water in Taiwan ranges from between
six billion to seven billion tons per year, making a deficit of two
billion or three billion tons.</P>
      <P>The research team also found that people living in central and
southern coastal areas are already pumping water from 200 to 300
meters underground, where the water has been resting for 50,000 years
- the oldest ground water in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang suggested that future urban development should focus on the
efficient use of rainwater resources, and that public and private
buildings should be equipped with a secondary water supply system,
using rainwater to clean toilets, floors and to water plants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PRESENTS AWARD OF THANKS TO FORMER AIT CHAIRWOMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presented an award
of thanks to former American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairwoman
Therese Shaheen Monday in recognition of her contributions to
promoting Taipei-Washington ties during her time as the top AIT
officer.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony held at the Presidential Office, Chen decorated
Shaheen with the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon, a special
honor offered by the Republic of China government to foreign citizens
who have contributed to its national cause.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Shaheen as one of Taiwan's best friends and a
beautiful guardian angel of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan-U.S. relations are as "sumptuous and
delicious" as "tsungtzu" -- glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in
bamboo leaves which are eaten as part of the Dragon Boat Festival
celebrations, Chen said Shaheen had helped enrich substantive
Taiwan-U.S. ties just like "putting tasty ingredients into tsungtzu."</P>
      <P>The Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on Tuesday this year, is
one of the most important festivals on the Chinese calendar. Dragon
boat races are held and tsungtzus are eaten on the day in remembrance
of Chu Yuan, a famous scholar-statesman of the Warring States Period
(403-222 B.C.)</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and the United States do not maintain formal diplomatic
ties, Chen said, their relations are "like tsungtzu to be wrapped in
bamboo leaves."</P>
      <P>"Although we can't see tsungtzus' ingredients from the outside,
they are delectable foods. Shaheen's greatest contribution is to feed
Taiwan-U.S. ties with rich and delightful elements so that our
relations have become even closer and more cordial," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>During Shaheen's tenure as the top U.S. liaison officer with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Chen said, Shaheen
had offered much assistance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that during his transit stops in New York and
Alaska last year, Shaheen accompanied him throughout his stay.
"Shaheen's personal charm, kindness and hospitality had injected
vitality and exuberance into traditional Taiwan-U.S. interaction," he
added.</P>
      <P>Shaheen resigned from the AIT chairmanship in April. "Although
Shaheen has left public service, I'm convinced that she'll continue
to be active in the U.S. political and business arenas. I hope she
will continue to use her clout to speak for Taiwan's cause of
safeguarding its liberal democracy and to help Taiwan win more
support and assistance from various U.S. social quarters," Chen said.</P>
      <P>For her part, Shaheen said she had learned a lot during her AIT
stint. One of the things was that she came to learn that Taiwan has
"good shepherds, " Shaheen said, adding she believes that good
shepherds will lead the herd toward the right direction.</P>
      <P>Shaheen further said Taiwan people's courage has inspired her to
have even greater courage. In her view, she said, it's a special gift
to be able to inspire other people. The people of Taiwan have this
gift, she added. If the world were an oyster, she said, Taiwan would
be its most brilliant pearl.</P>
      <P>Shaheen arrived in Taipei Saturday for a four-day private visit.
She has met with several senior ROC officials. On Monday morning, she
paid a courtesy call on Minister of National Defense Lee Jye. As the
ROC Cabinet has approved a NT$610 billion budget for purchasing
advanced weapons from the United States, some opposition lawmakers
claimed that Shaheen's current Taipei visit might be related to
Taiwan's arms procurement plan. However, Lee said his half-hour
meeting with Shaheen didn't touch on any arms procurement issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHAHEEN IS A GOOD FRIEND OF TAIWAN: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Therese Shaheen, a former chairwoman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, is a good friend of the Republic of
China and she should not be a source of political bickering in
Taiwan, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative leader said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, a ruling DPP party whip at the Legislative
Yuan, discounted opposition allegations that Shaheen, who arrived in
Taipei Saturday for a four-day private visit, is in Taiwan for talks
on U.S. arms sales to the island.</P>
      <P>Tsai called for the opposition not to extend domestic political
struggles among parties to the development of U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>He urged the opposition not to besmirch Shaheen as an arms
broker, saying that no one would be Taiwan's friend if an American
citizen were groundlessly labeled as an arms broker simply because
she or he makes efforts to help improve Taiwan-U.S. ties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the opposition Kuomintang caucus at
the Legislative Yuan ridiculed Presidential Chen Shui-bian's
decoration of Shaheen with the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand
Cordon Monday "in recognition of her contributions to promoting
Taiwan-U.S. ties during her time with AIT, " as an abuse of the right
of the head of state since Shaheen was forced to step down from her
post because of her alleged role as brokering arms deals between
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu said the DPP administration is bringing shame on
itself if Shaheen was decorated this time because of her "true" role
in arms sales.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party's next legislative whip, Liu
Wen-hsiung, argued that Shaheen is by no means an architect of
bilateral Taiwan-U.S. cooperation.</P>
      <P>Shaheen's stepping down reflects the fact that the U.S.
administration was not satisfied with her performance, Liu said,
adding that President Chen's decoration of Shaheen is tantamount to a
slap in the face to the Bush Administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERIORS MINISTRY TO OPEN HOTLINE FOR ABUSED MEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A hotline for abused men will open
Wednesday for them to seek help when battered by family members, the
Ministry of the Interior, who is sponsoring the service, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Interior ministry officials said that although an average of 10
women died from domestic violence each month in the first five months
of this year, according to the Modern Women's Foundation, men,
children and the elderly have also suffered from domestic violence.
However, this group has no support services for abuse.</P>
      <P>A study of social news stories conducted by the Modern Women's
Foundation -- a private foundation dedicated to promoting women's
rights and wellbeing -- showed that between January and May, 56 women
died from domestic violence and 46 others were either seriously or
slightly injured.</P>
      <P>According to interior ministry statistics, each of the domestic
violence prevention and help centers around the island receives an
average of 3,008 calls for help per month, indicating that about
3,000 families in Taiwan are under the threat of violence each month.</P>
      <P>Although 80 percent of those seeking help were women, many men,
children and elderly are constantly subjected to physical or mental
abuse by members of their family, interior ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Municipal Police Department reported last
Saturday that five years after the domestic violence law was put into
practice, the number of men, children and elderly being abused has
increased.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City alone, according to the police department, those
who were abused by immediate family members have also increased over
the years -- 306 cases, or 9.4 percent of the total abuse case in
2003, up from 44 cases (3.8 percent) in 1999.</P>
      <P>The ratio of male victims also rose to 274 (12.5 percent of both
sexes) in 2003 from only 10 (2.9 percent) in 1999, showing that male
victims, instead of feeling ashamed, have come out bravely to ask for
assistance after being abused by women.</P>
      <P>The abuse targeting the elderly over 60 has also increased
yearly, setting a record high of 157 cases last year from the 47
cases in 1999.</P>
      <P>Police have handled nine abuse cases toward children in the first
five months of this year, and most came at the hands of their parents
or babysitter. Two have died.</P>
      <P>Interior ministry officials said that men who need professional
counseling should call 0800-013-999.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Russia have forged a cooperative
memorandum on water resources management and related technological
exchanges, the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials and specialists from Taiwan and Russia gathered in late
May for the 1st Taiwan-Russia Water Resources Conference to exchange
views on and experiences in hydrology, fresh water resources
management and related technologies, WRA officials said.</P>
      <P>The participants signed a cooperative memorandum upon the
conclusion of the conference that Taiwan and Russia will engage in
bilateral exchanges in water resources management and related
technological fields on a regular basis in the future, the WRA
officials said.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed that scholars and specialists in the
fields will swap visits to each other's countries to boost bilateral
cooperation, beginning with a visit to Taiwan by Russian delegates to
attend an international water-related technology exposition slated to
open in Taiwan Sept. 3, according to the WRA.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking part in the water conference, the 12-member
Taiwan delegation -- led by WRA Director-General Chen Shen-hsien and
made up of WRA officials, academics from universities and
representatives from the private industrial sector -- also attended
an international hydrology exposition -- ECWATECH-2004, the 6th
International Trade Fair and Congress Water: Ecology and Technology
-- held in Moscow in early June.</P>
      <P>According to the WRA officials, although Russia is no longer a
"superpower, " the nation's expertise and research in water and ocean
resources are renowned worldwide. The Russian "water" researchers
have also long been keenly interested in Taiwan's research in the
same field, particularly in deep-ocean research and industrial waste
water recycling research.</P>

For nearly two and a half years, American
officials have maintained that locked within
the steel-mesh cells of the military prison

A massive search two years ago of

loquacious Egyptian banker and the equally
talkative wife the banker left behind in
Virginia. Earlier this month, U.S. officials
confirmed that a Muslim activist who formerly
worked with some of the people targeted in the
raid -- and who is now in custody -- is
suspected of involvement in a plot to

    <TEXT>
      <P>People with persistent smoking habits live
10 years shorter than non-smokers, according to a British study that
has taken 50 years to complete.</P>
      <P>Oxford University professor Richard Doll had planned only a
five-year project, but later carried on for five decades.</P>
      <P>His research studied 34,439 British doctors born between 1900 and
1930. Each was asked about his smoking habits at the start of the
study in 1951. They were contacted periodically over the next 50
years to see if their habits had changed. Information was gathered on
those who died during the period.</P>
      <P>Early findings of the study confirmed a link between smoking and
lung cancer, as well suggestions that smoking caused heart disease.
Subsequent research showed smoking is linked to another 25 illnesses.</P>
      <P>The study also showed that among men who became persistent heavy
smokers, about two-thirds died from their habit. These men went into
the British Army during the Second World War and acquired the smoking
habit from the age of 18. On average, they smoked 18 cigarettes a
day.</P>
      <P>Doll, 91, said, "It is clear that consistent cigarette smoking
doubles mortality throughout the adult life -- middle and old age. It
is also clear that giving up smoking can eliminate a very large part
of the hazard."</P>
      <P>He disclosed that the British government was opposed to making
the early findings public because it would "frighten people."</P>
      <P>The latest report advised smokers to kick their habit as early as
possible. Quitting at 30, smokers can avoid nearly all the risk of
dying early, and even quitting at 50, they can still halve the risk.</P>
      <P>The findings of the study are published in the British Medical
Journal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIE TO BE CAST ON PLAN FOR SUHUA FREEWAY: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will decide by the end
of this month whether to continue with the plan for a freeway linking
Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan, Cheng Wen-lon, director-general
of the Taiwan Area National Expressway Engineering Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the plan for the Suhua Freeway is currently up in the
air because of protests by environmentalists, Cheng said a 1998
environmental impact assessment gave the project a green light. Its
design meets environmental protection standards stipulated by law, he
said.</P>
      <P>The current highways linking Hualien to other destinations cannot
be effectively widened because of the fragile geological conditions
that make the area susceptible to landslides during typhoons and
torrential rains.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Cheng said, large trucks, which account for over 30
percent of the traffic using the highways, make the narrow roads a
sometimes harrowing experience for passenger cars, making the need
for a new freeway all the clearer.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications began a
feasibility study on the 86.5-kilometer freeway between Suao and
Hualien in 1994 but stopped it in 1998 because of protests from
environmental groups that were asking for things that were beyond the
legal scope of environmental protection, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The plan was revived in May, 2002 by the Executive Yuan as one of
the public works constituting the 2008 national development projects,
and was listed as one of the country's 10 major projects the
following year.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the project is beneficial to eastern Taiwan
economically, free of difficulties technically and desired by many
people in eastern Taiwan. The only question is whether it can win
over the environmentalists, he added.</P>

      <P>The Indonesian boy staying in Tzu Chi
Hospital in eastern Hualien to have a large tumor removed that was
covering his face and neck was released from the hospital Tuesday
after recovering well from a series of craniofacial surgeries.</P>
      <P>The five-year-old boy, named Novendry, came to Taiwan in early
March from Indonesia's western island of Padang with the assistance
of a group of volunteers from the Taiwan-based Buddhist Compassionate
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, who met Novendry when they traveled to the
island to offer free medical services.</P>
      <P>Novendry, who has suffered from Von Recklinghausen's disease
since he was one year old, was almost blinded in his right eye by the
pressure caused by the facial tumor. With his thick facial skin and
lips, and protruding teeth, the boy had been cruelly dubbed "hippo
boy" by ignorant Indonesian villagers.</P>
      <P>Von Recklinghausen's disease is a genetic disorder of the nervous
system that causes tumors.</P>
      <P>Officials of Tzu Chi Hospital said that Novendry's facial tumor
was removed and his face restructured after receiving a series of
surgeries over the past three-and-a-half months.</P>
      <P>Novendry has been becoming more open and active after his face
was restructured to one similar to that of a normal person, they
said, recounting that the boy was very timid before being admitted to
the hospital.</P>
      <P>The boy even performed a dance at a farewell party hosted by
medical personnel of the hospital in celebration of his recovery,
they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER CALLS FOR COMPLETELY OPEN TOURIST EXCHANGES ACROSS STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   22   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san urged Beijing Tuesday to allow anyone in
mainland China who wishes to sight-see in Taiwan to come, and he made
it clear that Taiwan is willing to open its doors to all visitors.</P>
      <P>Lin repeated the call while answering questions from reporters at
a ribbon-cutting ceremony marking the opening by China Airlines (CAL)
of its Taipei-Seattle-Houston route.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, such a two-way opening would help Taiwan and
mainland China increase contacts and mutual understanding, helping to
boost security and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The free flow of tourists from each side would make it much
easier for people from mainland China to visit Taiwan, he noted,
adding that for the time being, mainland Chinese tourists are allowed
in via a third country or area excluding Hong Kong and Macau or those
with a residence permit overseas.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is willing to brace itself for mainland Chinese
tourists, the mainland should also include Taiwan on its travel
suggestion list, he suggested.</P>
      <P>He issued a reminder that President Chen Shui-bian also appealed
for greater cross-strait exchanges and stability in his May 20 second
inaugural address, and added that welcoming tourists from either side
would be a good way to achieve this aim.</P>
      <P>He further proposed two-way government-to-government negotiations
on the matter based on the principles of equality and reciprocity,
and pointed out that such talks should be led by the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) -- the highest government agency in policy-planning
toward mainland China -- on the Taiwan side.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu has a full understanding of the standing
of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications in this regard,
he added.</P>
      <P>The minister later headed for Houston on board the new CAL
flight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-SOUTH KOREA TOURISM MEETING OPENS IN HUALIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien, Taiwan, July 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director Su
Cheng-tien said Tuesday he hopes the number of tourists from south
Korea can be increased substantially in three years.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at the opening of the 19th conference on
Taiwan-South Korean tourist exchanges held in the eastern county of
Hualien.</P>
      <P>Su said South Korean citizens made about 60,000 visits to Taiwan
in the first five months of this year, compared to more than 100,000
visits made by Taiwan citizens to South Korea during the same period.</P>
      <P>"We'll make every possible effort to attract more tourist
arrivals from South Korea in the coming years," Su said.</P>
      <P>The annual meeting brought together scores of travel service
operators from the two countries to discuss measures to boost
bilateral tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, tourist service operators expressed their
hope that direct air links between the two countries can resume as
early as possible to facilitate tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>Direct Taiwan-South Korean air links have been suspended
since 1992 when Seoul switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing. Due to South Korea's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's
national status for fear of offending Beijing, the two
sides have been unable to strike a deal on resuming direct flight
services.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the two governments have allowed direct chartered
flights between selected tourist cities on a reciprocal basis.
Participants to the meeting said they hope the number of chartered
flights can be further expanded if direct air links cannot be resumed
soon.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Hualien Deputy Magistrate Chu
Ching-peng said the county government is constructing an
international youth education center which will be inaugurated next
September.</P>
      <P>"We hope young South Korean people can travel to Hualien to
attend the new center's various educational workshops to get a
taste of Taiwan's lifestyle, culture and social customs," Chu said,
adding that the center will provide a convenient platform for
bilateral cultural and civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chu also took advantage of the meeting to introduce the rich
tourist resources in Hualien County, which has traditionally been one
of Taiwan's major tourist industry destinations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTIES JOCKEYING FOR POSITION FOR EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of major political
parties are at loggerheads over whether to hold one or two extra
legislative sessions during the summer, the timing of the sessions
and just what might be included on the docket for consideration,
party sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) agreed with the Cabinet Monday that the Legislative Yuan should
hold an extraordinary session in late July to deal with a
long-stalled constitutional amendment bill that will pave the way for
much-anticipated legislative reforms as well as a special budget bill
for 10 new major construction projects and several bills regarding
crime-fighting operations aimed at improving public order.</P>
      <P>However, Kuomintang (KMT) legislative whip Liao Feng-teh said the
KMT and its ally, the People First Party (PFP), will push to hold two
extra legislative sessions -- one in mid-July and the other in
mid-August.</P>
      <P>"The 'pan-blue alliance' of the KMT and the PFP, which jointly
controls a majority in the legislature, hopes that the legislature
holds an extra session on July 19 to screen the constitutional
amendment bill," Liao said.</P>
      <P>According to the legislature's existing operational rules, the
four-month consultation period for the constitutional amendment bill
will expire on July 19. As a result, a vote can be held on that day
to determine the bill's fate. The "pan-blue alliance" wants to
convene the extra session on the last possible day of discussions to
forestall any further debates on the bill, which they have tailored to
their own predisposition.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Liao said, the "pan-blue alliance" will demand that
another extra session be convened in mid-August to address the
alliance-initiated proposals that a special committee be formed to
investigate the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu and that a special committee be set up to
scrutinize official files regarding the activation of the so-called
national security mechanism in the wake of the shooting.</P>
      <P>The four-month consultation period for those two bills will
expire on Aug. 12.</P>
      <P>"We hope an extra legislative session can be held in mid-August
to decide on the fate of these two bills by a vote," Liao said.</P>
      <P>In a bit of horse-trading, if the "pan-blue alliance"-proposed
extra legislative sessions are held, Liao said the alliance will not
oppose discussing the 10 major construction projects budget bill and
crime-fighting bills that the DPP is intent on passing.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on Liao's remarks, DPP legislative whip
Tsai Huang-lang said he hopes Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng will call a meeting of representatives of various
legislative caucuses to work out the date or dates and the agendas
for planned extra legislative session or sessions.</P>
      <P>Wang, a KMT vice chairman, is currently heading a cross-party
legislative delegation on a visit to the United States to discuss
Taiwan's new arms procurement projects. He is expected to begin
consulting with various party caucuses on extra session issues after
his return next week.</P>
      <P>However, the legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU), which controls 12 seats in the legislature, said it is opposed
to holding any extra legislative session this summer.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence party said it prefers to push for the
formulation of a new constitution that caters to Taiwan's present
needs instead of discussing various versions of constitutional
amendments to prop up the framework.</P>
      <P>"Since the existing Constitution requires a massive overhaul to
suit Taiwan's present status quo and needs, we had better write a new
one. Writing a new constitution requires a longer period of time to
prepare and discuss. This topic cannot be addressed in an extra
legislative session, " said TSU legislative whip Chen Chien-ming.</P>

      <P>Helped by a recovering domestic economy,
Taiwan-based banks have improved their performance by lowering their
overdue loan ratios in the first quarter of this year, according to
the latest statistics made public by Taiwan's Central Bank of China
(CBC).</P>
      <P>Taiwan-headquartered banks posted an average overdue loan ratio
of 4.4 percent for the first three months of this year and have
managed greater pre-tax net profits and attracted larger amounts of
deposits and released more loans, the CBC statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Some banks in charge of special designations have outperformed
general commercial banks, the same tallies pointed out. For instance,
the Export-Import Bank registered the lowest overdue loan ratio of
0.37 percent for the same three-month period, while the China
Development Industrial Bank's ratio was 1.66 percent.</P>
      <P>At the same time, privately-run banks performed better than
state-controlled ones. E. Sun Bank and Taishin International Bank
recorded overdue loan ratios of 1.42 percent and 1.5 percent,
respectively, followed by Sinopac Bank with 1.69 percent and
Chinatrust Commercial Bank with 2.29 percent.</P>
      <P>Although public banks lag privately-run banks in slashing their
overdue loan ratios, most of them still meet the target of being
below 5 percent set by the government.</P>
      <P>The Bank of Taiwan posed 2.98 percent, while the First Commercial
Bank and Hua Nan Commercial Bank registered 2.44 percent and 3.58
percent, respectively. Medium Business Bank of Taiwan and Land Bank
of Taiwan had a higher ratio of 10.35 percent and 5.92 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Q1 bank deposits grew by 9.72 percent as a whole over
the year-earlier level, while the combined amount of released loans
increased by 8.22 percent year-on-year, the tallies indicated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN KEEN ON ATTRACTING MAINLAND TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kinmen County authorities are keen on
luring mainland tourists from Xiamen to visit Kinmen via the "three
mini links" and are hoping for a full two-way opening of tourists to
strike a balance between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Since the set-up of the so-called "three mini links" in Jan. 2001
-- direct transport and trade links between Taiwan-held Kinmen and
Matsu islands and Xiamen and Fuzhou ports in mainland China's Fujian
province -- Kinmen tourists have paid over 100,000 visits to Xiamen
via the links, but only a few thousands of Xiamen people have done
so, according to Kinmen Tourist Association Chairman Chen Ching-bao.</P>
      <P>Kinmen tourists have spent so far more than NT$4 billion
(US$118.5 million) in the mainland, creating a huge gap in capital
outflight, Chen said. He proposed that the central governments on
both sides make it so that general mainland tourists can visit
the offshore island.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a seminar held last week on Kinmen to
boost Xiamen tourist arrivals to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Deputy Magistrate Yang Chung-chuan presided over the
meeting, in which members of a tourism promotion group from Xiamen
exchanged opinions with Kinmen representatives from the county
government, the tourism sector and the "three mini links" execution
authorities.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chao-chin, head of the Tourism Bureau under the
Kinmen County Government, Xiamen hopes very much to be a
transshipment center in cross-Taiwan Strait tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>But the current situation presents a very serious tilt toward the
mainland side, and it is necessary for the mainland authorities to
allow mainland people to make pleasure trips to Taiwan, he said,
adding that if mainland China makes the move to do this, it will
provide Kinmen with a boost in its efforts to ask the central
government in Taipei to open further the "three mini links."</P>
      <P>Yang said this would give a significant boost to Kinmen's
economic development if even just 10 percent of the more than 13.4
million mainland tourists who travel to Xiamen each year could extend
their trips to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Xiamen Mayor Ye Zhonggen, who headed the delegation, said
that he feels strongly that the great importance attached by the
Kinmen government and the private sector to the issue lays a sound
foundation for wider tourist exchanges between both sides.</P>
      <P>For the time being, Taiwan only allows mainland Chinese tourists
to visit Taiwan via a third country or area excluding Hong Kong or
Macau or those with a residence permit in a third country or area.</P>
      <P>Since the limited opening in Jan. 2001 along with the inception
of the "three mini links, " only about 25,000 mainland Chinese
tourists have come to Taiwan, a stark contrast to an average of at
least three million Taiwan tourist arrivals to mainland China per
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC IS MOST COVETED COMPANY TO WORK FOR BY SCI-TECH MAJORS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New job-seekers in the fields of science or
technology consider Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to
be the most coveted company in Taiwan to work for, results of a new
opinion poll showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by 104 Job Bank, one of the major job
placement service centers in Taiwan, found that TSMC, Chi Mei
Optoelectronics and AU Optronics, are the top three Taiwan companies,
in that order, that the new job-seekers are most interested in
working for. The top 10 companies are among more than 240 listed and
OTC companies in high-technology industries in Taiwan that were
possible choices for respondents. Those following the top three were
Hon Hai, MediaTek, Asustek Computer, United Microelectronics, Benq,
IBM and Acer in that order, according to the 104 poll.</P>
      <P>The 104 Job Bank poll conducted the survey by e-mail May 21-24 by
contacting more than 10,000 people who are in high-tech fields,
including job market "freshmen."</P>
      <P>The job bank received 4,116 valid responses for the poll, which
had a margin of error of 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, "obtaining an opportunity to learn
higher-level knowledge and skills" tops all reasons behind the
high-tech job seekers' motivation to work with a high-tech company or
to join a new company.</P>
      <P>Other reasons for the high-tech job-hunters to seek to join a new
company is to "put into practice what was learned in school and to
realize personal ideals, " followed by "good prospects for career
development," "better pay," and "global perspectives," in that order,
the poll found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll also found that nearly 60 percent of the
current high-tech professionals in Taiwan are interested in having an
opportunity to work in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Men who are high-tech professionals born in the 1950s and who
have worked at the middle-levels or higher were found to be most
interested in working in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the recent spate of political
suppressions that Beijing has launched against Taiwan businesses that
maintain operations in mainland China has had little impact on the
mentality of Taiwan's high-tech professionals. They are still
interested in heading toward the mainland, chief 104 pollster Chiu
Wen-jen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six water samples from Kinmen River which
supplies water to residents on the outlying island were rushed to
Taiwan for testing to determine whether the water have been
contaminated, Kinmen Water Co. (KWC) officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The water samples were taken from the upstream catchment area of
Kuangchien Creek after a Kinmen resident on Monday afternoon
discovered bags and bags of "Fumieshu" -- an organofluorine compound
used by farmers to kill mice -- dumped in the water in the area. He
then notified KWC authorities who determined that a total of 87 bags
of "Fumieshu" had been dumped, including two 5-kg bags and 85 smaller
bags.</P>
      <P>The water samples, together with several kilograms of the dumped
mouse killer chemical, were then transported by KWC chemist Tsai
Yuan-ming first thing Tuesday morning to a Taipei laboratory under
the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) for testing.</P>
      <P>EPA authorities said Tuesday that the lab is ready to carry out
the testing as soon as the samples are received, even though Tuesday
is a holiday. They added that the results of the chemical analysis on
the samples are expected to be made public Wednesday at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KWC officials said that after preliminary checks, the
water company believes that the water in the reservoir located in the
downstream area of Kuangchien Creek has not been contaminated.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the facts that the dumped mouse killer chemical is
past its expiration date, that it is insoluble in water, and that it
has not yet reached the reservoir area due to the dry season, the KWC
officials said the water supplied by the Kuangchien Creek Reservoir
is safe for use.</P>
      <P>Although it has been preliminarily determined that the dumped
chemical has not contaminated the reservoir's water, the KWC
officials have still decided to clean up the upstream area to allay

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO BECOME VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY HUB IN GREATER CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has much potential to become a
center for vehicle technology in Greater China because of its
expertise and language advantages, experts and industry leaders from
home and abroad said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The specialists made the assessment at a seminar held by the
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in Taipei, in which scores of
experts in the automobile industry and the academic sector from
Taiwan and U.S. got together to trade information to sharpen the
competitive edge of the domestic industry and seize the opportunity
to upgrade its status in the region.</P>
      <P>Wang Pai-jong, president of the SAE Taiwan chapter, said that
with the assistance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan is
increasingly becoming a key manufacturer of parts and components in
the global industry's labor division system thanks to its strong
development capabilities in the sector.</P>
      <P>Wang forecast that Taiwan parts and components exports will grow
markedly in the years ahead and appealed for greater cooperation
among the government, industry and academia to sustain progress.</P>
      <P>Taiwan outbound shipments have top NT$100 billion (US$2.95
billion) per year at present.</P>
      <P>Su Ping-hui, deputy director at the Machine Industry Research
Laboratories under the Industrial Technology Research Institute, said
that the SEA -- the premier membership society dedicated to advancing
mobility engineering worldwide -- serves as a good access for Taiwan
to recruit fresh talent and absorb the newest technologies.</P>
      <P>Should Taiwan further step up its design capabilities in key
parts, such as engines, and suspension and electrical systems, for
compact cars, coupled with its market experience, it will help the
country set up a comprehensive manufacturing line and enjoy a greater
market share amid fierce global competition.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan has hi-end capabilities in key parts and
components, it should raise the bar and build itself into a vehicle
technology center for greater China at a time when the regional
market, especially mainland China, is beginning to take off.</P>
      <P>Without language or cultural barriers, Taiwan stands an excellent
chance of conquering the mainland market, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF THANKS TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN FOR RETURNING FROM CHINA FOR MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  Taiwan, June 23 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) official said Wednesday that he was moved to see many Taiwan
businessmen operating in mainland China -- commonly known as
"taishang" -- "defy Beijing's pressure" by returning to their
homeland to attend an SEF-sponsored gathering.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin made the remarks at the
opening of the SEF-sponsored workshop in the northeastern county of
Ilan as part of the celebration of Dragon Boat Festival, which fell
on June 22 this year.</P>
      <P>The SEF, a quasi-official body authorized to handle exchanges
with mainland China in the absence of official contacts, has
consistently organized gatherings of senior executives of major
Taiwanese chambers of commerce on three important festivals on the
Chinese calendar -- Chinese Lunar New Year, Dragon Boat Festival and
Mid-autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>Since some Beijing officials and several mainland Chinese
official news media have recently said they don't welcome "taishang"
who support Taiwan's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
administration, SEF officials said last week they were worried that
the number of "taishang" who would return to attend the annual
SEF-sponsored Dragon Boat Festival gathering might be limited.</P>
      <P>Yen said he was very pleased to see more than 80 representatives
of major Taiwanese trade associations in various mainland cities,
including heads of some 20 such organizations, take part in the
SEF-sponsored two-day gathering.</P>
      <P>"I'm grateful for your support and admire your courage, " an
emotional Yen said in his opening remarks. "I'm moved to see the
larger-than-expected attendance."</P>
      <P>Yen said the forum will provide good opportunities for "taishang"
to brief government officials on the general business situation in
mainland China and difficulties faced by them there.</P>
      <P>"The two-day meeting will also enable 'taishang' and government
officials to discuss feasible measures to help them resolve their
problems, " Yen said, adding that the SEF will take advantage of the
forum to get a better understanding of pressures "taishang" are under
in their mainland operations.</P>
      <P>Yen further said the SEF doesn't think that those who failed to
return to attend the Dragon Boat Festival gathering lack Taiwan
consciousness or are not loyal to the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>To defuse the gathering's political implication, the SEF has for
the first time invite representatives of industry associations with
close ties with "taishang, " such as the travel services industry and
airline industry, to take part in the event this year.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu
and Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh will attend the meeting
to explain the government's basic policies on cross-strait ties and
economic development as well as exchange views with "taishang" on
other related topics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, most senior executives of Taiwanese trade associations
in mainland China who attended Wednesday's meeting said they didn't
feel pressure from Beijing authorities over their return to
participate in the SEF-organized colloquium.</P>
      <P>Wu Chin-chung, president of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce in
Xiamen in mainland China's Fujian province, said Xiamen officials in
charge of Taiwan affairs fully understand that the SEF's Dragon Boat
Festival gathering was a routine event. "They didn't dissuade me from
attending," he said.</P>
      <P>Nearly all participants said they want to separate politics from
business. "We also look forward to seeing a permanent peace in the
Taiwan Strait. We hope the government will help cultivate a stable
business environment," Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HSINCHU MAYOR HOPES TO EXPAND MINI CROSS-STRAIT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government must expand the current
cross-strait "mini three links" and restart flights from Hsinchu to
Kinmen, Hsinchu Mayor Lin Cheng-tze and Legislator Chang Tsai-mei of
the opposition Kuomintang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin and Chang made the appeal when they called on Lee Chu-feng,
magistrate of the outlying island of Kinmen, to get a better
understanding of the current situation regarding the "mini three
links" -- direct trade, postal and transportation links between
Kinmen and Matsu and Fujian province, which began in 2001.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Lee said that going from Taiwan to the mainland via
Kinmen costs about NT$5,000 (US$148) per person, but having to
transit through Hong Kong or Macau instead costs roughly double that,
not to mention the extra time spent.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example that if a person starts from Taichung to
go to Taoyuan's CKS International Airport in northern Taiwan or
Kaohsiung's Hsiaokang International Airport in southern Taiwan, he
could already be in the mainland if he had taken a ferry in Kinmen to
Xiamen.</P>
      <P>"This is why the 'mini three links' are getting more popular with
Taiwan businessmen in the mainland," Lee said, adding that the Kinmen
County Government will ask the central government to expand the scope
of the links so that people in Taiwan can shuttle across the Taiwan
Strait via Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Mayor Lin said that manufacturers in the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park and even in Taoyuan and Miaoli need the channel to go
to the mainland to make money, adding that the channel should not
only be open to Taiwan people going to the mainland for religious
pilgrimages or if they already have a business operating on the
mainland; the policy should be eased to cover people from the
industrial sector who do not have businesses in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He noted that an airline opened a Hsinchu-Kinmen route in 1998,
but canceled it later because of too few passengers and the Hsinchu
terminal was later converted to other uses. He said that he will ask
that the terminal be reopened to help manufacturers in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park travel to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>At the urging of Lin, Chang promised that she would invite
officials from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the
Civil Aeronautics Administration and manufacturers to a public
hearing to promote the reopening of the Hsinchu terminal and work
with Magistrate Lee to expand the "mini three links."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some of the Taiwan businessmen operating in

mainland China but they expressed hope that the government will

      <P>As the number of the participants this year was less than last
year, the businessmen were asked if that was because of pressure from
the mainland following an editorial that appeared earlier this month
in the People's Daily -- the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist
Party -- which said Beijing does not welcome Taiwan businessmen who
make profit on the mainland and funnel the money back to the
independence movement in Taiwan. The paper named Hsu Wen-lung,
founder of the Chi Mei Group, as an example.</P>
      <P>Chang Shih-chin, president of the Taiwan Businessmen's
Association in Nanjing, said that he has not felt pressure from the
Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council.</P>
      <P>He said the declining number was because some Taiwan businessmen
felt embarrassed to attend the party, which was sponsored by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party because they publicly expressed
support prior to the March 20 presidential election for opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's failed presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Wan Hai-shui, who operates in Guangzhou, said that he was not
aware of any Taiwan businessmen who could not come because of
pressure from Beijing and that he has not felt any heat from the
mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>Wu Chin-chung, president of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association
in Xiamen, said that he had no such worries about attending and that
Taiwan affairs officials in Xiamen know that the party is a regular
activity of the SEF.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chun-jung, vice president of the Taiwan Businessmen's
Association in Dongguan, said that with the post-election turmoil,
supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First
Party and the "pan-green camp" are not in a good mood and it is
understandable that Wednesday's tea party attracted fewer
participants.</P>
      <P>Asked whether they felt pressure because Hsu was named by the
People's Daily, Yeh said that as a businessman, the businessmen only
want good business and to let politics be politics.</P>
      <P>Wang said that all Taiwan businessmen on the mainland want
cross-strait peace and he expressed hope that the government will
create a peaceful cross-strait environment conducive to doing
business.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan businessmen in Xiamen hope for an expansion
of the current direct links between Kinmen and Matsu and mainland
China so that cross-strait transportation will become more convenient
and Kinmen will have a greater chance of economic development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW QUOTATION MIGHT CAUSE POSTPONEMENT OF SUB DELIVERY: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new quotation by the United States for
eight submarines on Taiwan's military procurement list might lead to
delays in delivery of the vessels, Huang Hui-sheng, a spokesman for
the Ministry of National Defense (MND), said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang's comment came after a media report that quoted Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng as asking the United States offer a new
quotation for the eight diesel-fueled submarines that are to cost
Taiwan NT$400 billion.</P>
      <P>Although Huang said that the MND will abide by any resolutions
approved by the Legislative Yuan, he claimed that a new price
quotation is likely to postpone U.S. deliveries of the submarines by
over six months at a time when the Taiwan authorities are hoping to
take delivery of the ships five years sooner than originally quoted.</P>
      <P>According to MND officials, the existing quotation by the United
States is merely a rough estimate that does not take into
consideration the model of the submarines. The United States may
still offer the same price even if it quotes again, they pointed out,
adding that this would be an unnecessary waste of time.</P>
      <P>The eight conventional submarines form the most disputed segment
of the major military procurement plan submitted by the MND for
legislative approval with a value of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2
billion) that also includes budget appropriations for 12
anti-submarine aircraft and six batteries of Patriot PAC-3 missiles.</P>
      <P>The huge budget allocation has stirred up grave concern among the
public and some legislators.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is currently visiting the United States at the head of
a legislative delegation, made the remarks Tuesday in Washington
after being briefed by U.S. officials on the submarine deal.</P>
      <P>Wang asked the U.S. side to offer a cheaper price for the eight
submarines and bring forward the delivery date by five years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT JOINT CABINET WITH TSU: DPP LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is still too early to talk about a joint
Cabinet before the year-end legislative elections, a legislator of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, DPP party whip in the legislature, was
responding to media speculation that the DPP will form a joint
Cabinet after the legislative elections in December.</P>
      <P>According to the mass-circulation United Daily, President Chen
Shui-bian and former President Lee Teng-hui, who is the so-called
"spiritual leader" of the TSU, have met at least three times since
the March 20 presidential election and that they decided that if the
DPP and the TSU, win more than half the seats in the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan, the two parties will form a joint Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The newspaper reports quoted "unnamed sources" as saying that Lee
is pinning his hopes on the year-end elections, knowing that the
Cabinet will be reshuffled according to the constitutional protocol
next February when the new legislature is sworn in. If the DPP and
TSU combined can get half of the seats, then the TSU would get five
minister-without-portfolio positions, and even ministerial posts,
according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the only goal of the DPP and the TSU is to win the
legislative elections and added that after the goal is achieved, Chen
will have more room to form a Cabinet and will not rule out the
possibility of inviting elite TSU members to serve in the government.</P>
      <P>He said that Chen focuses mainly on whether a potential appointee
is good for the position, citing the example of Chen's inviting Hau
Lung-pin of the opposition New Party to serve as the Environmental
Protection Administration head.</P>
      <P>The president does not consider party affiliation in promoting a
person, Huang claimed.</P>
      <P>Tseng Wen-tsang, a DPP official in charge of public relations,
echoed Tsai's words.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that both the DPP and the TSU are still undergoing
nomination process of candidates to run in the year-end
legislative elections and that their lists have yet to be finalized,
so it is too early to speak of a joint Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The focus now should be on how to coordinate the candidate
nomination of the two parties so as to increase the number of seats
they can win.</P>
      <P>Currently, the DPP is the largest party in the legislature, but
the opposition Kuomintang and its ally, the People First Party, still
have a combined edge over the DPP and the TSU.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TSU Legislator Chen Cheng-lung said that the reports
about forming a joint Cabinet are untrue.</P>
      <P>Chen said that President Chen did meet with Lee several times,
but not to discuss a joint Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He said that the premise of forming a joint Cabinet will be
winning more than half of the seats in the legislature, and whether
the TSU has personnel qualified to serve in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Chien-ming, TSU whip in the legislature, said that
if the DPP and the TSU can combine to get more than half of the
legislative seats, then the road to forming a joint Cabinet is
"inevitable."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER DELIVERS SPEECH IN RHODE ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,   June  22  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should honor its
much-touted commitment to peaceful emergence by respecting Taiwan,
Republic of China Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said
Tuesday in a speech delivered in Newport, Rhode Island.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is currently on his first U.S. visit since assuming
office in April, said democracy and human rights are universal
values.</P>
      <P>If Beijing wants to truly pursue peaceful emergence, Chen said,
it should respect Taiwan's democratic political system and way of
life and refrain from saber-rattling against the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Addressing a packed audience at Redwood Library in Newport, Chen
said Taiwan appreciates the longstanding U.S. moral support and
practical assistance in various fields.</P>
      <P>He outlined three priorities on Taiwan's agenda -- deep-rooting
Taiwan's young democracy and promoting domestic ethnic harmony;
forging rapprochement with mainland China and maintaining peace in
the Taiwan Strait; and enhancing Taiwan's international profile and
fulfilling its international obligations.</P>
      <P>While expressing his gratitude for the U.S. support for Taiwan's
bid to join the World Health Assembly -- the governing body of the
World Health Organization -- as an observer, Chen said the United
States, as a world leader, should pay more heed to Taiwan Strait
issues.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's security is in the interest of many parties, including
the United States itself," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Before his speech, Chen presented a "diplomacy medal" to
Claiborne Pell, a former U.S. senator, on behalf of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in recognition of Pell's outstanding contribution to
promoting Taiwan-U.S. friendship, trust and cooperation over the
decades.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that he first traveled from Taiwan to the United
States in 1964 to pursue advanced studies. After he received a
doctorate in physics, he was unable to return to his homeland simply
because of his pro-democracy efforts. He was forced to stay and work
in the United States for nearly three decades. After Taiwan ended
martial law in 1987, he was finally allowed to return in 1992.</P>
      <P>Thanks to his long stay in the United States, Chen said he has
come to a deep-rooted conviction for freedom, democracy and human
rights. Describing Pell is an "old pal, " Chen said their friendship
is built on their shared values of liberal democracy and human
rights.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Boston Monday after attending the World Forum, an
annual international conference organized by the noted U.S. think
tank the American Enterprise Institute, in Beaver Creek, Colorado
from June 17-20.</P>
      <P>Chen held a colloquium with scholars at Harvard University's John
F. Kennedy School of Government later Monday.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, he met with Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Charles Fogarty and
Salve Regina University Sister Therese Antone for wide-ranging talks.
He is scheduled to meet with Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney Wednesday
and he will also inspect operations of the Taipei Economic and
cultural Office in Boston before leaving for New York.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER INSTRUCTS STEPPED-UP PATROLS OF WATER CATCHMENT AREAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun instructed the Ministry
of Economic Affairs Wednesday to step up security and patrols of
water catchment areas around the country to prevent water supplies
from being endangered.</P>
      <P>Yu also instructed the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) to hasten its efforts on water examination in reservoirs
nationwide, including those in the outlying islands, in an effort to
secure safe supplies of clean water.</P>
      <P>The premier issued the directives one day after a feeder river
leading to a reservoir on the island of Kinmen was found to have been
contaminated with rat poison, causing panic among Kinmen residents.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, water samples collected from the Kuangchien creek
were analyzed and determined Wednesday by the EPA to be poison-free
and safe for use.</P>
      <P>Six bottles of sample water taken from the creek, which supplies
water to residents on the island were rushed to Taiwan by Kinmen
Water Co. (KWC) officials Tuesday for testing to determine whether
the water had been contaminated.</P>
      <P>The water samples were taken after a Kinmen resident discovered
Monday bags of Fumieshu -- an organofluorine compound used by farmers
to kill mice -- that had been dumped in the water in the area. He
notified KWC authorities, who determined that a total of 87 bags of
Fumieshu had been dumped, including two 5-kg bags and 85 smaller
bags.</P>
      <P>The water samples, together with several kilograms of the dumped
poison, were taken to a Taipei laboratory under the EPA for testing.</P>
      <P>KWC officials said Tuesday that after preliminary checks, the
water company believed that the water in the reservoir had not been
contaminated.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the poison was past its expiration date, that
it is insoluble in water and that it had not yet reached the
reservoir area due to the dry season, the KWC officials said the
water supplied by the Kuangchien creek reservoir is safe for use.</P>
      <P>Although it has been preliminarily determined that the reservoir
had not been contaminated, the KWC officials have still decided to
clean up the upstream area to allay the concerns of Kinmen residents.</P>
      <P>The officials said the suspected contaminated section of the
creek will be blocked off and the water drawn out and into the sewer
system. They did not say how long the cleanup operation would take.</P>
      <P>In response to the incident, officials from the Taiwan Water Co.,
which oversees the KWC, said Tuesday that safety and security at
reservoirs, related facilities and catchment areas will be tightened
up nationwide to ensure safe water supplies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU TO PROPOSE ALTERING LEGISLATOR-AT-LARGE REGULATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) said Wednesday that it will propose a revision of the election
and recall law to lower the threshold of votes required by political
parties for legislator-at-large positions and political party
subsidies from the current 5 percent to 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, TSU legislative caucus whip, said the idea is to
make sure the voice of a diverse society is heard and a strategic
maneuver to disintegrate the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Chen's words came after recent suggestions to lower the threshold
to 2 percent by the opposition New Party and the newly inaugurated
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union headed by former Minister of the
Interior Chang Po-ya, so that small political parties will have the
chance to be awarded legislator-at-large seats and political party
subsidies.</P>
      <P>Currently, legislator-at-large seats are awarded to a party in
proportion to the number of votes it receives in legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed at a press conference that lowering the threshold
will also ease the current pitting of the "pan-blue alliance" of the
KMT and its two splinter parties -- the People First Party and the
New Party -- against the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally the TSU, as well as the political
polarization among the general public.</P>
      <P>He noted that when the KMT was the dominant party, the DPP's
Chang Chun-hsiung, a former premier and legislator, also proposed
lowering the threshold to 3 percent, a proposal that was quashed at
that time.</P>
      <P>Asked why TSU -- which has former President Lee Teng-hui as its
so-called "spiritual leader" and which garnered 8 percent of the
votes during its debut in the last legislative election in 2000 -- is
proposing a lowering of the threshold while it is expected to gain
more votes in the legislative election in December this year, he said
that the party has "strategic considerations" in mind.</P>
      <P>In addition to making a pluralistic society, he claimed that it
will encourage "native" KMT legislators -- as opposed to the old
guard KMT who identify more strongly with their traditional KMT
roots -- to defect to other parties or form their own political
groups or parties and break down further the once-monolithic KMT
party machine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TESTING, TFT-LCD MAKERS MAY BE ALLOWED TO VENTURE ACROSS STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan providers of advanced testing and
packaging techniques and makers of smaller-sized TFT-LCD panels may
be allowed to venture across the Taiwan Strait if it is determined
that this wouldn't compromise Taiwan's high-tech development, a
government source said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-yi, director-general of the Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that the
IDB has nearly completed an assessment on allowing Taiwan companies
of semiconductor testing and packaging technology and makers of
4-inch or smaller TFT-LCD (thin-film-transistor
liquid-crystal-display) panels to invest in mainland China, and that
the bureau is likely to recommend that Taiwan do so.</P>
      <P>The assessment studies the impact of such an opening on Taiwan's
job market and capital situation, as well as the competitiveness
prospects of the two rival sides of the Taiwan Strait, according to
Chen.</P>
      <P>In the assessment, Chen said, the IDB has concluded that allowing
such manufacturing industries involved in advanced know-how to invest
on the Chinese mainland would not compromise Taiwan's own high-tech
development, so the IDB has decided that such an opening is feasible.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out, however, that when and whether Taiwan will
actually give the green light still depends on the final decision to
be made by a supra-ministerial ad hoc committee made up of experts
from the academic, government and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>Chen said plans on such an opening have not entered the
government screening stage yet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>George Washington University on Tuesday
bestowed the President's Medal on outgoing Republic of China
Representative Chen Chien-jen in recognition of his promotion of
U.S.-Taiwan friendship and his contribution to bilateral academic
exchanges.</P>
      <P>George Washington University President Stephen Trachtenberg, in
presiding over the ceremony, lauded Chen's contribution by saying
that he has played the role of a bridge between Taiwan and the United
States over his long diplomatic career.</P>
      <P>Trachtenberg also expressed his appreciation for Chen's support
for academic exchanges between the two countries, noting that his
university has established close academic relations with Taiwan's
Yuan Ze University in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The President's Medal is the highest honor bestowed by the
prestigious university. Past winners include former Czech Republic
President Vaclav Havel, former Israel President Ezer Weizman, U.S.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, U.S. Senate Majority leader Bill Frist and
Boston University President John Silber.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen noted that he has spent 20 of the 37 years of
his diplomatic career in Washington and that he has learned not only
the importance of protecting one's own nation's interests but also
the importance of taking care of the interests of the countries being
engaged.</P>
      <P>He said that he accepts the honor of the President's Medal with
pride and humility. In addition to extending appreciation to George
Washington University for its recognition, he also thanked his wife
who was also on hand to witness the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The university also arranged for Taiwan student Tsao Yi-ying to
speak about her feelings of Chen. Tsao, who is currently studying
museum management for a master's degree, said that Chen was very kind
toward students, which she said changed her stereotyped impression
about high-ranking officials.</P>
      <P>Nearly 100 people, including academic and diplomatic figures,
officials from Taiwan's representative office in the United States,
and Taiwan students studying at George Washington University,
attended the ceremony. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs James A. Kelly also attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chen, 65, started his diplomatic career as a secretary at the
former ROC Embassy in the United States and became ROC Representative
to the United States in 2000. He also served as a legislator, a
director-general of the Government Information Office and foreign
affairs minister.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An ROC Legislative Yuan delegation
visiting the United States has made two decisions regarding the
submarine procurement plan and requested that the ROC Ministry of
Defense pass on these decisions to its U.S. counterpart, a delegation
member said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), the decisions were made after the delegation
listened to U.S. defense officials' briefings at the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) the same day on procurement of eight
diesel-powered subs and 12 P3C anti-submarine reconnaissance aircraft.</P>
      <P>In the decisions, the legislators requested that the U.S. side
adjust the price tag for building the submarines, including building
subs with China Shipbuilding Co. (CSC) or building them without the
CSC, as well as shorten the delivery date from 15 years to 10 years.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the delegation's request demonstrates its
dissatisfaction with the NT$400 billion price tag quoted by the Bush
administration for the building of the submarines, Lee said that in
Taiwan, there are many different opinions concerning the high price.</P>
      <P>Instead of procuring 12 P3C anti-submarine reconnaissance
aircraft as planned, the legislators hope to make a further study on
whether the procurement of eight such aircraft would temporarily
satisfy the island's defense needs.</P>
      <P>Noting that a newer model anti-submarine aircraft will be
produced by the United States by 2013, the delegation said it feels
that Taiwan would have a better chance of buying the new aircraft if
the procurement eight P3C can satisfy the island's defensive
requirements temporarily.</P>
      <P>The delegation also listened to briefings by U.S. defense
officials the same day on the CISR system, namely an integration of
various elements including command, control, communications,
computer, intelligence information, monitoring and reconnaissance.</P>
      <P>The legislators were scheduled to meet with U.S. scholars and
former AIT directors and call on U.S. congressmen later in the day.</P>
      <P>Headed by Wang Jin-pyng, speaker of the Legislative Yuan, the
delegation is currently in Washington, D.C., to discuss Taiwan's new
arms procurement project with relevant U.S. officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO GIVE PRIORITY TO REBUILDING TRUST WITH U.S: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government has
given priority to rebuilding trust with the United States since
President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration for a second four-year term
May 20, ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said in New York
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with the Central News Agency, Chen said
Taiwan and the United States have a solid friendship basis. Although
mutual trust was hurt a bit before and after Taiwan's bitterly fought
March 20 presidential election due to certain reasons, Chen said,
bilateral relations have gradually returned to previous levels.</P>
      <P>Chen said his optimistic observations were based on positive U.S.
comments on President Chen's inaugural speech and the courteous and
dignified treatment that Vice President Annette Lu received during
her transit stops in Las Vegas and San Francisco in late May and
early June.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, now is a "testing time" for Taiwan-U.S.
relations as the Bush administration is watching whether Taiwan will
abide by the commitments that President Chen made in his inauguration
address.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the ROC's ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) must be pragmatic in implementing its party platform and
pursuing its party goals. The ruling party must put national
interests above anything else, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-U.S. relations were for a time clouded by President Chen's
insistence on holding a "defensive" referendum simultaneously with
the March 20 presidential election and formulating a new constitution
for Taiwan in 2006 as the Bush administration thought that those
moves might provoke Beijing. However, President Chen promised in his
inaugural address that his constitutional reform plan would not touch
on the sensitive issues of sovereignty, territory or national title
and flag.</P>
      <P>Minister Chen arrived in New York Wednesday after concluding a
three-day visit to the New England region where he met with Deputy
Governor Charles Fogarty of Rhode Island, Governor Mitt Romney of
Massachusetts, President of the Salve Regina University in Newport
Sister Therese Antone, and scholars from Harvard University's John F.
Kennedy School, and also delivered a speech on recent developments in
Taiwan in Newport, Rhode Island.</P>
      <P>This is Chen's first overseas trip since assuming office in
April. His itinerary also included attending the World Forum, an
annual international conference organized by the noted U.S. think
tank the American Enterprise Institute, in Beaver Creek, Colorado
from June 17-20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MODIFIED TOY PISTOL SUSPECTED IN SHOOTING OF PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police officers leading a probe into the
March 19 assassination attempt against President Chen Shui-bian said
Thursday they believe a modified toy pistol was the weapon used to
injure Chen and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>In a press conference called to reveal their theory, Ho Yu-yi,
director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, said experiments
conducted by forensic analysts in his bureau found that a modified
toy pistol, commonly used by local gangsters, would be powerful
enough to penetrate the windshield of a car and the clothing of a
person, as well as graze the skin of the victim.</P>
      <P>Ho said this might explain why Chen was only slightly injured and
why the bullet came to rest between his clothing and his skin.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsiao-kuei, the director of the forensics department of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau who conducted the experiments, said a
total of three rounds were fired in a simulation of the
March 19 shooting.</P>
      <P>All of the bullets penetrated the windshield of a car and the
jacket and shirt on a dummy. The first and third bullets ended up
between the jacket and shirt after grazing a pig hide covering the
dummy. The second cartridge penetrated the dummy.</P>
      <P>Chen said the cartridges, loaded with between 0.08 grams and 0.12
grams of powder, were ordinary cartridges used in such modified
pistols.</P>
      <P>Although the modified pistols can be lethal, they are not as
powerful as real pistols and the trajectories of their bullets are
lower than those of bullets fired from real pistols, which is why
tests conducted in April by a panel of American ballistics experts
with laser equipment did not match the ballistic curve of the bullet
that hurt the president.</P>
      <P>The American panel was retained by Henry Lee, a Chinese-American
forensics scientist who was asked by the "pan-blue alliance" of the
opposition Kuomintang and People First Party to look into the
shooting.</P>
      <P>The alliance, which lost the election to Chen, suspects that the
incident was an election scheme.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsiao-kuei said the hole in the windshield of the car also
proves that the bullet was fired from a modified pistol, as it spun
in the air in a way quite different from a bullet fired from a real
pistol.</P>
      <P>Ho said the results of the experiments have been sent to Lee in
the United States and might debunk the opposition's claims that the
shooting was a political scheme and that gunman who fired the pistol
did not mean to kill the president.</P>
      <P>The shooting took place on the eve of the presidential election
when Chen and Lu were parading through the streets of Tainan City in
the same car in an eleventh-hour effort to canvass votes. The parade
ended in chaos after bodyguards of Chen and Lu found that the
candidates had been wounded and rushed them to a nearby hospital.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT PLANS SUPPORT FOR TAIWANESE BUSINESSMEN IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui plans to
preside over a forum Sunday to offer support to Taiwanese businessmen
operating in mainland China who have suffered from "political
interference" from Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan Advocates, one of the organizers of the
forum, Lee will urge the government, as well as the ruling and
opposition political parties, to pay heed to the situation.</P>
      <P>An official of the Taiwan Advocates said the mainland authorities
should face the reality of the continuation of the Democratic
Progressive Party administration in Taiwan after the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Instead the mainland authorities have begun to interfere
politically with Taiwanese businessmen with operations on the
mainland as a way of pushing Taiwan toward reunification with the
mainland, he said.</P>
      <P>The mainland government, through its official mouthpiece -- the
People's Daily -- named some Taiwanese businessmen, among them Hsu
Wen-lung, founder of the well-known Chi Mei Group, as unwelcome on
the mainland as Beijing believes they use profits gained on the
mainland to finance the independence movement in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official predicted that the mainland's stubborn political
ideology will continue despite Taiwanese businessmen's heavy
contributions to the mainland's economy, stubbornness that will
greatly jeopardize Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>The official also asked whether Taiwan's trade policy should be
reviewed in light of Beijing's interference, adding that the issue
should be of greater concern to the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lee, Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Poh-chih,
members of the Taiwan Association of University Professors and other
think tanks, as well as several local businessmen who have suffered
losses with their mainland investments, will also attend the forum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan
said in New York Wednesday that Taiwan has much to learn from the
United States in helping ex-convicts rebuild their lives.</P>
      <P>Chen is currently on a two-week visit to the United States that
has taken him to several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Houston and Boston.</P>
      <P>During his stay in San Francisco, Chen said he visited the
California Delancey Street Foundation (CDSF) , which is dedicated to
helping ex-inmates rebuild their lives.</P>
      <P>"The foundation operates restaurants and home removal companies
aimed at helping ex-convicts adapt themselves to normal society after

foundation's restaurant department makes a profit of up to US$3
million a year and its home removal company section's annual profit
reaches US$4 million.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's ex-convict assistance organizations can learn
from the CDSF operations. "Our agencies usually offer loans for
ex-inmates to launch their own ventures. But many of them fail
because operating a new business is no easy task. In the future, we
can follow the CDSF model in helping our ex-convicts rebuild their
lives," Chen said.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Columbia University's drug addiction treatment
research center, Chen said he learned that religious belief can to
some extent help drug addicts quit drugs.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Ministry of Justice has tentatively decided to
transform an idle reform center previously operated by the
now-defunct Garrison Command into a drug addict detention and
education center. Chen said he plans to invite major Christian,
Catholic and Buddhist organizations to help administer the center.</P>
      <P>Chen will travel to the state of Vermont Thursday to study its
monitoring and control system for sex offenders that have been

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POISED TO UPGRADE DEFENSE CAPABILITIES: LEGISLATIVE HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is fully poised to step up its
defense capabilities to safeguard its national security, because it
is unreliable to pin hopes on others, Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng said here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks at a news conference prior to his departure
from Washington, D. C., where he was paying a visit at the head of a
legislative delegation over the last week.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the trip was aimed at gaining a further
explanation from the United States on a major military procurement
program that will cost Taiwan NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) to
buy advanced defense weapons such as submarines, anti-sub aircraft
and anti-missile batteries.</P>
      <P>Touching on the controversial deal in which the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) has allocated NT$400 billion for the purchase
of eight diesel-powered submarines, Wang made it clear that the
United States will only help Taiwan acquire the eight vessels but
will not assist Taiwan in building the ships.</P>
      <P>Although the Legislative Yuan has approved a resolution asking
for U.S. help to allow the China Shipbuilding Corporation to have a
role in constructing the submarines, Wang explained that the United
States backs the idea that Taiwan should have maintenance and repair
capabilities but is opposed to the proposal that Taiwan builds its
own subs.</P>
      <P>In view of the U.S. stance, which is contradictory to the
legislature's resolution, Wang acknowledged that "Taiwan cannot turn
a blind eye to this fact" and said compromises should be made to
bridge the gap.</P>
      <P>Wang asked the U.S. side to quote a cheaper price for the planned
procurement of the eight subs before the Legislative Yuan's budget
appropriation screening to assuage grave public concern over the huge
amount of spending. He also demanded a quicker delivery of the subs
by shortening the current estimated time of 15 years to 10 years.</P>
      <P>After learning of Wang's comments, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said
in Taiwan on Thursday that he will thoroughly discuss the issue with
Wang and ranking MND officials after he returns from the United
States, especially regarding U.S. opposition of Taiwan's constructing
its own subs.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks to reporters ahead of a gathering in eastern
Ilan County with Taiwan businessmen's association representatives who
returned from mainland China to take part in a seminar on the
occasion of the Dragon Boat Festival.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Export orders in May totaled US$17.25
billion thanks to the continued strong global demand for wireless and
digital consumer electronic products and demand for panels in
mainland China, according to tallies released Thursday by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs' Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>Economics officials said that despite Beijing's announcement that
it is cooling down its overheated economy and the soaring price of
international crude oil, export orders still registered an annual
increase of 25.68 percent to reach US$17.25 billion in May.</P>
      <P>The figure was next only to US$18.03 billion in April, or the
second-highest figure for a single month.</P>
      <P>In terms of products, export orders for electronic products in
May increased US$1.31 billion from the same month last year, or an
annual increase of 51.33 percent. Precision instrument products
increased US$710 million, or an annual increase of 150.85
percent thanks to the display panel industry's investment in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The most orders were placed by the United States, Hong Kong,
Europe and Japan, in that order. Compared with the same month of last
year, only Japan registered a slight decline of US$40 million, with
everywhere else recording growth. The United States increased by
US$1.2 billion, Hong Kong increased by US$1.4 billion, while Europe
increased by US$660 million. The items that contributed to the
increased orders were electronic products and precision instruments.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope
Thursday that the private and government sectors can work together to
help establish a national image of Taiwan as a place of "creativity
and high quality."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he presented awards to
winners of the 12th National Awards of Excellence in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the award represents the highest honor for the
winning manufacturers and will help the upgrading of the country's
industry.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan enterprises, facing the pressure of
globalization, have to upgrade and try to promote the excellence of
Taiwan products, which he said deserve the highest respect.</P>
      <P>Chen said that any product marked "made in Taiwan" represents the
image of Taiwan and noted that "a lot of foreigners" derive their
impression of Taiwan from its products sold all over the world. The
overall national image, he claimed, will decide the market price and
the level of the country's products.</P>
      <P>He cited digital cameras as an example, noting that cameras made
by the same manufacturer and of the same type are more expensive when
they are produced in Japan rather than in other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>"This is because consumers have `subjectively' concluded that
Japanese products will offer more protection, " the president said,
adding that "the price difference projects the overall image of a
nation's industry."</P>
      <P>Chen said that manufacturers that have produced excellent
products are the biggest contributors to getting Taiwan products a
niche in the world and pushing domestic industry to continue to move
toward high value-added products.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that he has stressed creativity in industry before,
Chen stressed that this should not be confined to a single industry
but should apply to all industries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's excellent products should not be confined to only a few
products, but should represent all products, the president said,
adding that Taiwan must pursue excellence in production, research and
development, marketing and after-sales service.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Ching-hui, an outstanding
middle-ranking police officer who had taken part in many cross-border
criminal investigations, was found dead on the floor of his office in
Taipei early Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiang, 48, had been working day and night preparing a special
report to be delivered at an outstanding police citation ceremony in
Manila June 28, his colleagues at the Criminal Investigation Bureau's
(CIB's) international affairs department said.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that Chiang did not sustain any
injuries and there were no signs that anyone had entered Chiang's
office during the night.</P>
      <P>According to his colleagues, Chiang was a workaholic, often
staying late or even overnight at his office. A graduate of Central
Police University, Chiang pursued advanced studies at Northwest
University in the United States. He could speak fluent English and
had attended many training programs abroad.</P>
      <P>"Chiang had made friends with many foreign law enforcement
officers and played an important role in cross-border criminal
investigations," said a CIB official.</P>
      <P>In 2003 alone, Chiang joined forces with police officers from the
Philippines to bust a Taiwan-Japan-Philippines car smuggling ring, as
well as cooperating with American and Philippine investigators to
thwart a cross-border drug-trafficking ring and seizing more than
1,000 kg of amphetamines and 7,000 kg of chemical compounds for
making contraband drugs worth some NT$1.3 billion in street value.</P>
      <P>Early this year, Chiang again cooperated with Philippines police
authorities in uncovering some 4,000 kg of semi-finished illegal
drugs in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>In recognition of his crime-fighting achievements, the Philippine
government invited Chiang to attend its June 28 outstanding police
citation ceremony at part of celebration of that country's Police

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although a water shortage crisis is looming
in the Tainan area, the Southern Taiwan Science Park does not
currently have any water shortages, according to a park
administration official Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-wei, deputy director of the Southern Taiwan Science
Park Administration, said that water supplies for hi-tech facilities
should be secured through the end of this year as the Nanhua
Reservoir will supply water for the park, which consumes over 40,000
cubic feet of water per day.</P>
      <P>Although the park's water consumption has been assured for the
rest of this year, Chen still called on the public to conserve water
because water levels in domestic reservoirs are running low due to a
scarcity of rainfall in the Tainan area.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Nanhua Reservoir in Tainan County now has
more than 52 million cubic feet of water and water supplies will be
normal through September.</P>
      <P>The Tsengwen Reservoir and the Wushantou Reservoir, two prime
providers in the area, now contain a combined 19 million cubic feet
of water, a level far short of the estimated 400 million cubic feet
needed for the second crop irrigation planned for late June on the
Chianan Plain -- Taiwan's leading rice producing granary.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has in recent years been plagued by a sharp disparity in
rainfall. The northern Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu region has been
hit hard by a drought over the past two years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun has authorized the
Government Information Office (GIO) to handle issues regarding
license renewal for an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -controlled radio
company, a senior official said Friday.</P>
      <P>GIO Director-General Lin Chia-lung made the remarks ahead of a
GIO meeting to screen Broadcasting Corporation of China's (BCC's)
application for renewal of its operation license.</P>
      <P>Lin announced a day earlier that the GIO will push for amendments
to the existing broadcasting and television law to ban any single
private radio company from simultaneously controlling more than two
nationwide broadcasting channels. Before the proposed "anti-monopoly"
law revision is completed, Lin said, the GIO plans to issue only
interim licenses to relevant companies.</P>
      <P>The BCC currently controls three nationwide channels. In the
past, the BCC was given special privileges because it played a role
in countering mainland China's attempts to interfere with Taiwan's
broadcast transmissions. As the times and environment have changed,
Lin said, this BBC function no longer exists.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's media reform plan, Lin said, the GIO
will push for law revisions to prevent monopolies of broadcasting
channels by radio firms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOUSE PASSES RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF U.S. VISITS BY TAIWAN OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. House of Representatives'
International Relations Committee passed a resolution Thursday to
reiterate Congress's commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and
to state that serving Taiwan officials should be allowed to visit the
United States.</P>
      <P>The resolution, jointly introduced by committee chairman Henry
Hide and ranking committee member Tom Lantos, and co-sponsored by 20
other House members, reaffirms Congress's unwavering commitment to
the TRA as the cornerstone of U.S. relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It also states that: "The United States government should not
discourage current officials of the Taiwan government from visiting
the United on the basis that doing so would violate the 'one China
policy.'"</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-chi, president of the Formosan Association of Public
Affairs, said that passage of the resolution "opens the door for a
future visit by President Chen to Washington, D.C."</P>
      <P>"The reference to the TRA being 'the cornerstone' of U.S.-Taiwan
relations is significant too, since the People's Republic of China
continues to claim that the three U.S.-PRC Communiques prevail, " Wu
added.</P>
      <P>Many members of Congress support a visit by President Chen to the
U.S. capital, but the Bush administration may have reservations about
such a visit as it does not want to affect its relations with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wu said that "obviously, the U.S. Congress agrees that the TRA is
the law of the land and dictates U.S.-Taiwan relations, and not the
three communiques."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRENCH COMPANY SUSPECTED OF BID-FIXING IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>French telecommunication company Alcatel is
suspected of bid-fixing in winning a NT$940 million (US$28.03
million) contract to deliver control and safety train detection
systems to the Taiwan Railway Administration, investigators from the
Prosecutors' Office at the Taiwan High Court said Friday.</P>
      <P>The investigators said they found Alcatel had transmitted NT$80
million, about 10 percent of the value of the contract, in three
batches to several apparent competitors for the bid for the contract
after it was awarded the contract in February.</P>
      <P>Investigators suspected the money was payment to bidders who were
in collusion with Alcatel and submitted unreasonably high bids to make
Alcatel a shoe-in.</P>
      <P>The investigators were tipped off on the allegations of
bid-fixing by a secret informant and found that Alcatel executives in
Taiwan invited their potential competitors to dinner before the
contract was put out for tender.</P>
      <P>Bid-fixing is illegal under the Government Procurement Act and a
bidder who is found guilty of bid-fixing will be stripped of the
right to deliver on the contract and responsible individuals will be
liable to prison sentences.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 the Taiwan Railway Administration has invited bidders
for contracts for the railway monitoring systems, which feature 6,200
axle counters, but failed to choose a winner in the last 10 public
tenders for various reasons until Alcatel won it in February.</P>
      <P>In a news release issued in April, the French company spoke of
the contract as the largest ever signed worldwide for this class of
railway monitoring solution.</P>
      <P>Several local political figures were reportedly involved in
fixing the bid. Among them was an aide to Legislator Wang Tuo of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Wang said Friday, however, he
had no idea of his aide's role in the scandal and he himself had
nothing to do with the contract.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and the United
States are based on the universal values of democracy and human
rights; therefore, ties between the two will be easy to maintain
unless there are major changes in the world situation, Republic of
China Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Thursday in New
York.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in New York on June 23 from Boston, noted that
U.S.-Taiwan ties have been based on the Taiwan Relations Act and the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques over the last two decades.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China has tried its best to sabotage
U.S.-Taiwan ties, it is easier for the two countries to keep their
traditional relations alive since these are based on their shared
universal values of democracy, freedom and human rights, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Saying that he thinks the existing bilateral relations will
continue, Chen added that he hoped the bonds would strengthen.</P>
      <P>During his U.S. visit, Chen attended the World Forum, an annual

    <HEADLINE>COURT HEARING HELD IN LAWSUIT SEEKING TO ANNUL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court held a hearing Friday
regarding a lawsuit filed by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) seeking to annul the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Su Yung-chin, a professor from National Chengchi University
arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs, said that the presidential
election was skewed in favor of incumbent President Chen Shui-bian
because of its coincidence with the referendum initiated by the
president, citing studies to back his allegation.</P>
      <P>However, lawyers for the president and Vice President Annette Lu
disagreed, claiming the opposite was true. But for the referendum,
they said, the Chen-Lu ticket would not have won by almost 30,000
votes, as was the case, but by more than 100,000 votes.</P>
      <P>The four-hour hearing closed without setting the next court date.</P>
      <P>In addition to the lawsuit seeking to annul the entire
presidential election, the KMT and PFP have also filed a lawsuit

    <HEADLINE>LONE GUNMAN RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON PRESIDENT: POLICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investigators have concluded that a single
gunman fired two shots that slightly wounded President Chen Shui-bian
on the eve of the March 20 presidential election, the director of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau said in Tainan City, southern Taiwan
Friday.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called on the 100th day after the March 19
incident, Director Ho Yu-yi said that based on recreations and
forensic analysis, one of the two shots has been determined to have
penetrated the windshield of the open vehicle that President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu were traveling in at an angle
of 38 degrees; the other hit the screen dead on, or at an angle of 90
degrees.</P>
      <P>Given that the car in which President Chen and Vice President Lu
were standing in was moving at 6.4 meters per second, and that the
interval between two shots is usually 0.65 seconds, it is very likely
that one gunman fired the two shots, Ho said.</P>
      <P>This analysis is supported by the fact that the two bullets, one
of which gave the president a flesh wound across his abdomen and the
other grazed the knee of the vice president, caused both injuries at
1.4 meters from the ground, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The news conference was held in Tainan City, where the
assassination attempt took place.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, People First Party Legislator Lee Ching-hua raised
questions about the police theory announced the previous day that a
modified toy pistol was the possible weapon used in the incident.</P>
      <P>Lee said ballistics experiments conducted by police on the path
the bullets took are aimed more at debunking critics' claims that the
whole incident was a political scheme concocted to boost Chen's
presidential campaign than finding the culprits in the case.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the assassination attempt had turned the
presidential race upside down, Lee said the only way to find the
truth would be to set up an independent investigative committee in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Police have so far not taken any suspects into custody regarding
the shooting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Southern Taiwan Science Park will have
no water shortage problems this year, although irrigation for the
second crop in Taiwan's main rice-growing region nearby has been
postponed twice, a park administration official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-wei, deputy director of the Southern Taiwan Science
Park Administration in Tainan, said the park consumes some 40,000
cubic meters of water daily, supplied by the Nanhua reservoir, which
held 52 million cubic meters of water as of Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although the water supply for the park is assured for this year,
Chen urged the public to keep conserving water, as other reservoirs
in the Tainan area are facing a serious lack of water.</P>
      <P>According to the Chianan Irrigation Association, irrigation
planned for the second crop on the Chianan Plain -- the island's main
rice granary -- was postponed twice in June as result of the serious
water shortage.</P>
      <P>The Tsengwen reservoir and the Wushantou reservoir, two prime
water suppliers for the Chianan Plain, now have a combined 19 million
cubic meters of water, a level far short of the 400 million cubic
meters needed for the second crop irrigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC GROWTH TO BE BETTER WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fundamentals of Taiwan's economy are
very good and if the "10 new major construction projects" program can
be put into practice, it will ensure that economic growth over the
next few years will be even better, the head of a think tank
predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said that if the five-year, NT$500 billion (US$14.88
billion) program can be passed and put into practice in July, then
the economic growth this year could reach 6 percent, with even higher
growth in the next few years.</P>
      <P>According to a survey of manufacturers conducted by the institute
in May, Wu said that the number of those who perceive that businesses
will improve in the next six months dropped to 41.1 percent from 45.4
percent in April, while those who perceive that business in the next
six months will remain the same rose to 51.1 percent from 46.6
percent and those who think it will take a turn for the worse rose
slightly to 7.8 percent from 7 percent in April.</P>
      <P>Wu commented that the slight increase in the number of people who
think the economy will take a turn for the worse is due mainly to a
recent announcement by Beijing that it was taking steps to cool down
its overheated economy.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea are all affected
by mainland China and that the uncertainty posed by the change of
mainland policy is important to manufacturers.</P>
      <P>He also said that the post-March 20 presidential election turmoil
in Taiwan has also made manufacturers tense.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that the fundamentals of Taiwan's economy are
very good and said that if the effects of the mainland's cooling-down
policy become clearer, then Taiwan's stock market and manufacturers'
optimism will return to a steady high level.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court acquitted Friday
a university professor accused of posting obscene pictures featuring
bestiality on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Central University Professor Josephine Ho, upon learning the
news, said that although acquitted, the chilling effect of "trying to
stifle views on sexual issues" had been felt deep and wide.</P>
      <P>Ho claimed that the mere fact of being prosecuted is in itself a
punishment to try to prevent her from "airing her views on sex."</P>
      <P>She said that during the litigation, she realized the "irrational
persecution of moral panic" from the public and the terrible power of
a smear campaign, as well as the maneuvering of the judicial system.</P>
      <P>In April 2003, Ho was in charge of the Web site of a gender
research institute at the university that contained links to
bestiality Web sites, believing that it was "necessary for academic
research."</P>
      <P>When news of these links surfaced, a number of civic groups
demanded that prosecutors investigate the case for alleged violations
of the obscenity law.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office conducted an investigation last

Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, Chiu said the MAC --

the development of cross-strait relations because bilateral
commercial and cultural exchanges have been on an upward swing since

programs should not exceed 16 percent of the total air time.</P>
      <P>But Wang Keng-ling, an official from the GIO's Department of
Radio and Television Affairs, said that the legislator's figures
differ from those of the GIO.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that in fact, in the first five months of the year,
mainland-produced TV dramas accounted for 0.8 percent of the programs
on terrestrial stations and 1.3 percent of the cable TV stations, or
3.9 percent if re-runs are included.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER VISITS ROC NAVAL OFFICERS ON DE-MOTHBALLED KIDD DESTROYER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Sun
Kuo-hua said in Washington, D.C. Thursday that he was impressed by
the performance of a group of Taiwan naval officers who are taking
part in a Kidd-class destroyer de-mothballing and renovation project
in Charleston, South Carolina.</P>
      <P>Sun visited a Charleston shipyard Wednesday to show his concern
for the 300-plus ROC naval officers working there in preparation for
taking delivery of four Kidd-class destroyers that the United States
agreed to sell to Taiwan in 2001.</P>
      <P>The four destroyers were originally built for the Shah of Iran in
1979 but were later mothballed when Iran canceled the deal.</P>
      <P>Sun said he boarded one of the destroyers to see for himself the
9,600-ton warship's cabin facilities and operational systems, as well
as the examination and renovation work.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, the navy has christened the four destroyers as
the Chi-teh, the Ming-teh, the Tung-teh and the Wu-teh.</P>
      <P>Sun said all the members of the ROC naval corps, headed by Rear
Adm. Pu Tze-chun, have worked hard in preparation for taking delivery
of the warships.</P>
      <P>Quoting American naval experts, Sun said the Kidd-class
destroyers have superb naval and air defense capabilities and can
serve as a training platform for ROC naval officers in preparing
them to operate the Aegis battle management system-equipped Arleigh
Burke-class guided missile destroyers in the future. Taiwan has
expressed interest in purchasing the highly advanced Aegis-equipped
destroyers, but the United States has not yet agreed to negotiate
such a deal.</P>
      <P>Sun said one of the four Kidd-class destroyers has already been
de-mothballed and launched. If all goes smoothly, Sun added, two
Kidd-class destroyers can be delivered to Taiwan before the end of
next year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yue
dismissed Friday "unrealistic" the notion that mainland China's
renminbi (RMB) could be used for trade transactions across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on a mainland scholar's suggestion that Beijing
should consider full convertibility for the RMB for trade
transactions between Taiwan and the mainland, Ho said that to the
best of her understanding, no company doing international trade
anywhere in the world would choose to use a currency that is still
under government control for import or export trade transactions.</P>
      <P>Ho was asked to comment on a recent International Herald Tribune
report in which Chen Lin, a researcher with Beijing's Tsinghua
University's Business Management College, suggested that Taiwan and
the mainland use the RMB as the currency for trade transactions
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Ho said that as far as she knows, most of the Taiwan companies
operating business on the mainland use either the U.S. dollar or the
New Taiwan dollar, as currency for trade transactions.</P>
      <P>Taking the information technology industry as an example, Ho
said, Taiwan exporters, regardless of whether their products are to
be delivered from Taiwan or the mainland, all use the greenback for
their quotations.</P>
      <P>Ho said she sees no possibility of using the RMB for cross-strait
trade even if the NT dollar is excluded for such trade in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVITED TO ATTEND G-10 GROUP MINISTERIAL MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June 24 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top trade official
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) confirmed Thursday that Taiwan
has been invited to participate in a G-10 Group agricultural
ministers' meeting set for July 5 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, ROC permanent representative to the WTO, said
that he received a letter the same day from the Swiss delegation to
the organization to invite Lee Ching-lung, chairman of the Council of
Agriculture, to attend the gathering that will be presided over by
Swiss President Joseph Deiss.</P>
      <P>It is believed that this will be the highest-level meeting in
which Taiwan will have participated in Geneva since the country
became a WTO member in January 2002.</P>
      <P>The G-10 Group, made up of Taiwan, Bulgaria, Israel, Iceland,
Japan, Mauritius, Norway, Switzerland, South Korea and Liechtenstein,
is aimed at protecting and advancing the agricultural interests of
its members.</P>
      <P>Noting that the main purpose of the forthcoming meeting is to
consolidate the G-10 Group members' common negotiation stance and to
show the group's political strength in agricultural talks, Yen said
that due to the importance of the agricultural trade negotiations and
the meeting, Taiwan's presence at the gathering is significant.</P>
      <P>Lee's participation in the meeting with the Swiss president under
the WTO mechanism also demonstrates the substantial interests that
the island has gained from its WTO membership and the fruitful
results of the efforts made by the island's delegation to the WTO in
the past two years, he said.</P>
      <P>Deiss, who is also minister of economic affairs, said in his
invitation letter that as the negotiation mechanism of the Doha New
Round trade talks is expected to be completed at the end of July and
that the most important issues of agricultural trade talks have
entered a critical stage, the forthcoming meeting will not only give
the G-10 Group ministers' an opportunity to exchange their views, but
will also give them an opportunity to discuss ways of strengthening
their joint stance in the talks.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed the hope that agricultural ministers
of all the G-10 Group members will be able to participate in the meeting.</P>
      <P>The G-10 Group members, which are all small agricultural
countries that have been in a relatively weak position in trade
talks, have adjusted their negotiation tactics in the past two days
and have agreed that future agreements on agricultural talks should
be reached by means of multilateral talks and that they will not
accept all comprises made by other WTO members or groups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIA MAY BE SOURCE OF SUBMARINES TO BE SOLD TO TAIWAN: U.S. PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  25 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Russia may be the source of eight
diesel-powered submarines that Taiwan intends to buy from the United
States, the Washington Times reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Under a plan percolating in the Pentagon, the paper said, Russia
would sell the United States eight very quiet Kilo-class submarines
outfitted with Russian weapons but equipped with U.S. electronics and
propulsion systems, which would eventually be sold to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting a Pentagon official, the paper said, Russian President
Vladimir Putin has quietly signed off on the deal on the condition
that the submarines are sold to the United States.</P>
      <P>"If the Americans resell them (to Taiwan), it's none of Russia's
business," the Pentagon official quoted Putin as having told U.S.
officials.</P>
      <P>Other options call for using another European design or building
the submarines from the U.S. Barbell-class diesel submarine design,
the paper said.</P>
      <P>The daily added that mainland China, which has commissioned
several Kilo-class submarines into service in its navy, would
vehemently object the sale of the submarines to Taiwan, as it has to
all U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The submarine deal, however, is still being held up over cost
estimates, the paper said.</P>
      <P>The submarines were high on the agenda of a visiting Taiwanese
legislative delegation, along with the island's plans to buy P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot PAC-3 antimissile batteries,</P>
      <P>The delegation, headed by Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, met with Pentagon and other senior U.S. officials in
Washington, D.C. this week, including Deputy Defense Secretary Paul
Wolfowitz. A key topic discussed was a novel way to build submarines
for Taiwan. The United States has not built any conventional
submarines for many years.</P>
      <P>The delegation visited a Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile system at
Fort Hood, Texas, and a P-3C base in Hawaii. The delegation also

    <DATELINE>New York,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign
Affairs Tan Sun Chen said in New York Thursday that he foresees no
problems with Washington consenting to David Ta-wei Lee as the new
ROC representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration is expected to give the green light to
Lee to assume the post, Chen said, adding that the administration is
currently pondering the appointment and that the process will require
a little time.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is on a visit around the United States, denied
allegations that the Bush administration has been "procrastinating"
in giving its consent for unknown reasons.</P>
      <P>"Give them some time, " Chen said, adding that even Taipei spends
some time considering the appointments of new U.S. envoys to Taiwan
before granting consent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen clarified rumors circulating in the media that
the ROC's formal diplomatic relations with Panama and Haiti are
facing challenges because of Beijing's interference.</P>
      <P>He noted that although Beijing has tried everything to try to win
favor in Panama since the election of a new Panamanian president,
bilateral ties between Taiwan and Panama are in good shape, adding
that he sees no changes in that situation in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Panama and mainland China may have closer economic and trade ties
following the new Panamanian administration taking office, but this
does not necessarily mean that Panama will sever its formal
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>On relations with Haiti, Chen said that reliable sources have
confirmed that bilateral ties between Taiwan and the Caribbean
country are firm and will continue to be steady, although mainland
China has contributed some peacekeeping troops to the country.</P>
      <P>Chen also mentioned that Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials
are making arrangements for Premier Yu Shyi-kun to make stopovers in
the United States on his way to and from the Dominican Republic where
he will attend the inauguration of the nation's newly-elected
president next month.</P>
      <P>It is still too early to speculate whether Premier Yu will make
stopovers in New York or Washington, D.C., or both, Chen added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Taiwan,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hsinchu County Government in
northern Taiwan cooperated with several fishing industry promotion
groups in releasing more than 200,000 fish fries off the shore
Saturday as part of their efforts to boost sustainable fishing
industry development.</P>
      <P>A county government official said fishery resources in Taiwan's
coastal areas have been dwindling because of poaching by mainland
Chinese fishing boats in recent years. Worse still, the official
said, mainland fishermen illegally use dragnets in their operations
which has aggravated the decline of fishery resources in the region
as dragnets also trap smaller fish.</P>
      <P>Many schoolchildren took part in the fish fries release activity.
The official said the county government hopes the program can help
enhance local people's environmental awareness and lead them to work
together with the government to conserve fishery and maritime
resources as well as other natural resources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR MORE EFFECTIVE ANTI-NARCOTICS STRATEGIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
the government should work out more effective strategies to prevent
drug abuse and eradicate cross-border drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call in a written message read at the opening
ceremony of a national anti-narcotics conference.</P>
      <P>In the message, Chen said drug trafficking has become ever more
complex and that many new substitute lethal drugs have continued to
hit the market.</P>
      <P>"These trends have posed new challenges to our campaign against
drug abuse and drug trafficking, " Chen said, adding that relevant
government agencies should formulate more comprehensive and more
effective strategies to contain drug abuse and drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>Addressing the confernece, Premier Yu Shyi-kun echoed President
Chen's view, saying that the government will devote full energies to
fighting against drug abuse and the narcotics trade.</P>
      <P>"We must set a timetable for achieving our goal in a specified
period of time," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The premier said that although law enforcement authorities have
successfully busted many large drug trafficking rings, similar
criminal operations have continued incessantly. Yu said relevant
government agencies should place an equal emphasis on reducing the
demand for contraband drugs.</P>
      <P>"We should step up a publicity campaign to cut the number of drug
abusers. At least we should try to prevent any person from becoming a
new addict as drug abuse harms personal health and creates social
problems," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, U.S. HAVE NEVER DISCUSSED OPTION OF BUYING RUSSIAN SUBS: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and U.S. officials have never
discussed formally or informally the option of purchasing
Russian-built Kilo-class submarines, the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a Washington Times report a day
earlier that the Pentagon is considering procuring eight very quiet
Kilo-class submarines from Russia for resale to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under a plan percolating in the Pentagon, the daily said, Russia
would sell the United States eight Kilo-class submarines outfitted
with Russian weapons but equipped with U.S. electronics and
propulsion systems for eventual resale to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An MND spokesman said the ministry has never heard of such a
plan.</P>
      <P>"The option of purchasing Kilo-class submarines has never been
brought up in our formal or informal talks with Pentagon officials, "
the spokesman said, adding that the position papers the MND has
presented to the Legislative Yuan and the news media have also never
contained such a proposal.</P>
      <P>The MND position papers have only mentioned that the eight
conventional submarines the United States has agreed to sell to
Taiwan are likely to be built by Spain, Germany or the United States
itself, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that the United States has been mulling over
re-opening a production line to build new diesel subs for Taiwan
based on its 1950s Barbell-class design after encountering
difficulties obtaining conventional submarines on the international
spot market. Out of concerns about upsetting Beijing, major countries
that still build conventional subs have been reluctant to accept any
Taiwan-related orders. The United States stopped building diesel
submarines years ago.</P>
      <P>The MND spokesman said that after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, some arms brokers explored the possibility of selling
Russian-made Kiol-class submarines and Su-27 fighter jets to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the military has traditionally used American- and
European-made weaponry systems, the spokesman said, the MND has never
included any Russian-made arms into its list of options because of
possible difficulties in subsequent repair and maintenance work.</P>
      <P>The submarines are high on the agenda of a Taiwan legislative
delegation which is in Washington, D.C., this week, as are the
island's plans to buy P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot PAC-3
anti-missile batteries.</P>
      <P>The delegation, headed by Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, has met with Pentagon and other senior U.S. officials,
including Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, to discuss those
arms procurement projects which the ROC military plans to carry out
in a 15-year period.</P>
      <P>The delegation visited a Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile system site
in Fort Hood, Texas, and a P-3C base in Hawaii. It also visited an
Aegis battle-management-equipped warship at Pearl Harbor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSENSUS NEEDED IN TAX REFORM: FINANCE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lin Chuan said Saturday
that a national consensus must be forged before any critical tax
reform program can be implemented smoothly.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while delivering a lecture at Ketagalan
Institute, a school founded by President Chen Shui-bian to nurture a
new generation of leaders for public service.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's income tax system doesn't comply with the
general world trend. All major countries around the globe levy income
taxes on their nationals regardless of their workplaces, while Taiwan
doesn't levy income taxes on its citizens who work abroad.</P>
      <P>"It's unfair, " Lin was quoted as having told Ketagalan students.
Nevertheless, he added that tax reforms cannot succeed before a
national consensus is forged and that all tax reform programs should
be carried out in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>Lin also stressed the importance of crafting a fair tax system.</P>
      <P>"Fairness is the most important as far as tax reforms are
concerned, " he said, adding that tax hikes would definitely draw a
backlash unless the existing tax system is modified to become fairer.</P>
      <P>Lin further said the government's financial problems mainly lie
with its structural budget deficits. The government's budget deficit
zoomed from NT$608.4 billion in 1990 to NT$2.2 trillion in 2000 when
the Democratic Progressive Party came to power for the first time
after more than five decades of Kuomintang rule.</P>
      <P>By now, Lin said, the government's budget deficit has further
ballooned to NT$3.9 trillion.</P>
      <P>"The government's financial situation has further deteoriated, and
the issue can only be resolved by overhauling its long-term fiscal
structure," Lin added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) chairman and the
People First Party (PFP) chairman have come to a consensus regarding
forming a grand alliance among their parties, the New Party and those
non-partisan members who have similar views, to try to win the
year-end legislative elections, a well-placed source said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The source said that the consensus between KMT Chairman Lien Chan
and PFP Chairman James Soong was reached after the two opposition
leaders held a four-hour closed-door meeting Friday.</P>
      <P>According to some KMT and PFP legislators, the purpose of
creating such an alliance is to consolidate the opposition's forces
and to form a majority in the Legislative Yuan by winning the
year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Some PFP legislators also said that since it is difficult for the
KMT and PFP to merge in a short period of time, the opposition forces
have to unite to check and balance the power of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislators also attached great importance to the rapid
creation of such an alliance under considerations of mutual respect,
saying that each opposition party should better its coordination with
other opposition parties on the total number of nominations of candidates
for the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the current KMT-PFP working platform will be
enlarged and will include members of the New Party and other
opposition groups after the formation of the planned alliance in
order to have better cooperation among the opposition forces in the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST GEAR UP TO JOIN INTERNATIONAL TRADE GROUPS: CEPD CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must make every possible
effort to join major international trade organizations or alliances
lest it be marginalized amid the current economic globalization
trend, the Cabinet's top economic planner said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of senior business executives in the central
city of Taichung, Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said major countries around
the world are forming various kinds of strategic economic alliances.</P>
      <P>Because of mainland China's diplomatic embargo and boycott, Hu
said, Taiwan has had a hard time joining those international groups.
"We must use wisdom and creativity to make a breakthrough. Otherwise,
our economy will be marginalized," he said.</P>
      <P>In his view, Hu went on, signing bilateral free trade agreements
(FTAs) can be an alternative for Taiwan in forging strategic economic
alliances with other countries. Taiwan has so far only signed a free
trade agreement with Panama. For fears of offending Beijing, Hu
acknowledged, many countries that maintain formal diplomatic ties
with mainland China are reluctant to sign free trade accords with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hu said, the United States can play an
crucial role in Taiwan's FTA drive. If Taiwan can sign a free trade
pact with the United States, Hu said he believes other major
countries would be more willing to negotiate similar agreements with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said the government will continue to try hard to convince the
United States to sign a free trade agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's economic prospects, Hu said, Taiwan must step up
infrastructure construction and renovation as well as accelerate
industrial upgrading and transformation in order to beef up the
nation's competitiveness in the world market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RESEARCHERS FIND 50 SUBSTANCES THAT KILL SARS VIRUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan research team has found more than
50 substances that can kill the virus that causes severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>The research team was led by Dr. Wong Chi-huey, director of the
Genome Research Center under the Academia Sinica, and their report
has been published in the latest Proceedings of the National Academia
of Sciences of the United States, according to Wong.</P>
      <P>In addition to researchers from the Academia Sinica, Wong's
research team consists of researchers from the National Defense
University, National Taiwan University, National Tsinghua University
and National Taipei University of Technology.</P>
      <P>The work was not without risks. A researcher from the National
Defense University became infected with the potentially fatal disease
last December while in the laboratory. He recovered after being
quarantined for two weeks.</P>
      <P>In the last year, the researchers tested some 10,000 substances
and found that about 50 of them were able to effectively check the
reproduction of the SARS virus in the laboratory.</P>
      <P>Some of the substances have already been used for other purposes,
such as the early medication for high blood pressure called
Reserpine, an anti-inflammatory drug called Aescin, and the
insecticide Valinomycin.</P>
      <P>Some substances were found in plants, including oil of eucalyptus
and extract of honeysuckle and ginseng.</P>
      <P>Wong's team combined two drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and
found that they were not only effective in killing the SARS virus but
also in treating cats suffering from AIDS.</P>
      <P>AIDS is a common disease among cats in the United States,
affecting almost 20 percent of the cat population there, Wong said.</P>
      <P>Noting that pharmaceutical companies might not be interested in
developing a drug used exclusively for the treatment of SARS because
of the relative small market, Wong said the synthetic drugs created
by his team have caught the interest of many foreign pharmaceutical
companies because of their potential in treating AIDS in human beings
and cats, as well as SARS.</P>
      <P>Wong said his team is cooperating with the Development Center for
Biotechnology in hopes that their drugs will be commercially
developed one day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABORIGINES HAVE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE IN MILITARY ACADEMIES: LEGISLATORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A program to aide aboriginal youths to seek
higher education in military academies has resulted in giving them
access to the choicest departments for study and the situation is
crowding out non-indigenous students, two lawmakers claimed Sunday.</P>
      <P>Legislators Lin Chin-hsing and Lee Chen-nan of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party said that parents of non-aboriginal
students have complained that the system that awards aborigines with
extra points on their military academy entrance exams is unfair.</P>
      <P>The legislators asked that relevant governmental agencies look
into the matter and establish a fairer policy to enter military
academies.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, nine out of the top 20 scorers in this year's
military academy joint entrance exam were aborigines who scored high
enough to enter the most prestigious departments because of the bonus
points privilege.</P>
      <P>Because of this, they were able to enter the most coveted
departments, such as law, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee, meanwhile, said that some non-aboriginal parents
have complained that some of the "aboriginal" students are actually
not aborigines at all, and that some of them were born in cities and
don't even know an aboriginal language. The only thing aborigine
about them is found on their identification cards that indicates
their ethnic origins.</P>
      <P>Lee called for the government and the Ministry of National
Defense to work out a fairer testing policy that satisfies both
sides.</P>

An August 2002 memo by the Justice Department that concluded

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) have proposed an extraordinary legislative session
be held August 16, a KMT official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Department, said that both the KMT and its political ally, the PFP,
hope the extraordinary session will deal with the establishment of a
task force to investigate and get to the bottom of the March 19
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu,
and the establishment of a task force to look into the activation of
the national security mechanism after the shooting.</P>
      <P>The proposed extra legislative session should also discuss
revisions to the Republic of China Constitution for halving the
225-member legislature because a four-month grace period for a vote
on the issue after the political parties failed to reach a consensus
on it expired on July 23, Tseng noted.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties will also agree to discuss other issues
initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the
extra legislative session, including the budget allocations for the
new 10 major construction projects, he added.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun called on the Legislative Yuan June 11 when
the legislature concluded its regular session to open an
extraordinary session to deal with some urgent bills.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has not changed its
resolution to have the China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) be involved in
the building of the eight submarines to be ordered from the United
States, Chen Chi- mai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Five days after U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz
told a group of visiting Republic of China legislators in Washington,
D.C. that it would be wrong to let the CSBC play a role in the
building of the submarines, Chen said the Executive Yuan will contact
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is leading the group, to
learn more of the attitude of the United States on the issue.</P>
      <P>The submarines are part of a proposed NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) arms purchase from the United States.</P>
      <P>Legislators from Kaohsiung are insisting on having the
Kaohsiung-based CSBC build parts of the submarines to create more
jobs in their constituencies. But Wolfowitz reportedly scuppered the
idea on the grounds that it would postpone the delivery of the
submarines to the detriment of Taiwan's defense and would impose on
the U.S. an extra obligation of transferring part of the work and,
therefore, the technology of the submarines to Taiwan.

      <P>The competitiveness of a business lies in
its ability to innovate and improve itself, Lin Hsin-i, a senior

Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar organized by the Ketagelan Institute in

because doing so would be a denial of the past. However, these steps
are vital for keeping a company viable for the future since there is
not a single solution that can cope with the ever-changing market and
situations that are liable to shift without notice.</P>
      <P>Businessmen should keep in mind that the strategy that brings

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO ALLOW IN PROCESSED CHICKEN FROM PANAMA: NEWSPAPER REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama City,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will soon open its market to
processed chicken from Panama in accordance with the two countries'
efforts to expand bilateral trade and investment under a free trade
agreement (FTA) that took effect in January this year, according to a
recent report by La Prensa, a Panama-based daily newspaper.</P>
      <P>Group Melo will soon be allowed to export its processed chicken
to Taiwan after it gains green light from the Taiwan authorities, and
it would mark the first time that Panama will ship its
chicken-related products to the Taiwan market, the report said,
adding that Taiwan will first send quarantine personnel to inspect
the chicken-raising farms prior to the shipments.</P>
      <P>The report quoted Group Melo as estimating that it could export
about US$2 million of processed chicken to Taiwan per year. Group
Chairman Arturo Melo was cited as saying that production facilities
on his farms are ready to begin processing goods for Taiwan and that
he is waiting for approval by officials from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Melo, Panama is permitted to export 900 metric tons
of poultry products free of custom duties to Taiwan each year under
the terms of the Taiwan-Panama FTA.</P>
      <P>He stressed that his products will be very competitive in price
and quality in the Taiwan market and noted that chicken is the first
Panama product to gain approval from Taiwan for export after the two
countries inked the FTA last year.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan only allowed in beef, pork, seafoods and noni
fruit from Panama. The FTA will permit Panama to ship large amounts
of other goods to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Panamanian Ministry of Commerce
and Industry, La Prensa reported that the value of the country's
outbound shipments to Taiwan in the first five months of this year
had already topped US$5 million, a similar level to the figure

      <P>Taiwan lawmakers have exchanged
opinions with the United States about Taiwan's major military
procurement plan and have also made clear Taiwan's strong
determination to safeguard its national security, Legislative Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng said in San Francisco Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks during a meeting with about 70 members of
the main opposition Kuomintang's branch in San Francisco on the last
leg of a U.S. tour by a legislative delegation headed by the
Legislative Yuan speaker.</P>
      <P>The mission has over the past week met with U.S. officials and
congressmen to gain a better understanding on the procurement program
worth billions of dollars from the United States.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, they have asked the United States to re-assess
the prices of the weapons that are included in the package, which
includes eight diesel-fueled submarines, anti-submarine aircraft and
anti-missile batteries, and shorten the delivery time.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing his satisfaction with the trip, Wang
said that they also made it clear to the United States that Taiwan
was serious about increasing its national security by upgrading the
country's defense capabilities through stepped up cooperation with
the United States.</P>
      <P>Saying that the Legislative Yuan will further screen and have a
final say on the items on the procurement list, Wang added that he
hoped that the United States would give a positive response to their
requirements.</P>
      <P>The huge expenditure for the military procurement plan put
forward by the Ministry of National Defense for legislative approval
carries a price tag of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) and has
created much concern from the public.</P>
      <P>The NT$400 billion allocated for the eight conventional
submarines is the most disputed section of the procurement plan,
deliveries of which have been demanded by the legislative mission to
be reduced from the current estimated time of 15 years to 10 years.</P>

areas.</P>

      <P>Relocating Taichung's airport from Taichung

government policy, CAA officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to legislators' questions about the

said that as the supply outstrips demand and the passenger rate is

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING DOES NOT WANT EXTERNAL CRISIS: U.S. NEWSPAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is tough on Taiwan and
Hong Kong because it has a lot of internal problems and an external
crisis is the last thing it wants, a columnist wrote in Sunday's
Washington Post.</P>
      <P>David S. Broder made the comments in an article titled "The
Chinese Divide, " in which he noted that the gap between the cities
and countryside in mainland China is getting worse.</P>
      <P>He cited retired economist Mao Yushi as saying that "China is
splitting into two countries, " with the cities developing rapidly
under the policies of market capitalism while the countryside is
unchanged or falls further behind.</P>
      <P>Mao was quoted as saying that if the hope of democracy lies in
the growing urban middle class, the danger of a backlash stems from
the dead weight of the two-thirds of the population still stuck in
the rural past.</P>
      <P>Broder also wrote that Beijing "is trying to slow the
double-digit growth of the past few years and bring it to a 'soft
landing' before what some see as a 'bubble' economy, fueled by
foreign investment and a huge construction boom, explodes."</P>
      <P>"The roaring economy is depleting China's resources -- and
threatening worldwide inflation in oil, steel and other commodities,"
the article said, adding that pollution has come with the rapid
economic growth.</P>
      <P>Equally evident is social strain created by the high-speed
economic revolution, with a graying population and a social security
system that can only cover a small fraction of urban workers and
almost no-one in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The family structure that has been the linchpin of Chinese
society for centuries is under severe stress, the article says,
quoting a recent mainland newspaper report that two-thirds of urban
youngsters are being raised by their grandparents because both
parents work.</P>
      <P>With so many internal problems, mainland leaders "do not need --
and say they do not want -- any external crises," the article says.</P>
      <P>"That is why, they said, they have drawn a hard line against any
dramatic steps toward democratic elections in Hong Kong, and it is
why they talk constantly with visitors about the 'threats' of a move
toward independence by Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian. China has
declared it would oppose any such move 'at any cost.'"</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR BIGGER ROLE FOR DCS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu proposed Monday a
greater role for the Distinguished Citizen Society (DCS) and urged it
to open branches in foreign countries as a means of helping the
government cement foreign relations and provide volunteer services.</P>
      <P>Lu made the call during a DCS-sponsored award ceremony at the
Presidential Office, in which scores of representatives from college
student associations dedicated to social service work across the
country were cited for their outstanding performance.</P>
      <P>In addition to praising the students for their charity work, Lu
urged the DCS to expand its horizons by setting up chapters in the 26
countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, to assist the
government in forging closer foreign relations and providing
volunteer and public services in the international community.</P>
      <P>The DSC has devoted itself to social welfare services since its
establishment in 1968, Lu noted, and she said that the organization
should play a bigger role by "extending its reach to the diplomatic
arena." She did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Lu also appealed for enthusiastic participation by the Taiwan
people in her proposal for sponsoring poor children in Guatemala, and
encouraged especially college students to take part in the campaign,
which was initiated by the vice president after she returned home
last month from a tour of three Central American diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Only NT$10,000 (about US$300) a year will be sufficient to help a
Guatemalan child live without worry, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>She wished all the students a bright future and said they should
continue to keep their precious virtue of knowing how to love and
care for others after entering society because, she said, "life is a
true lesson that is worthy of learning by everyone."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central News Agency (CNA) published an
album Monday to mark its 80th founding anniversary and the July 1
eighth anniversary of its conversion into a state agency independent
of any political group.</P>
      <P>Coinciding with the launch of the album was the issuance of a set
of commemorative stamps made with 10 of the photos in the album.</P>
      <P>CNA President Hu Yuan-hui said the 300 photos included in the
album, titled "Six Decades of Taiwan, " were picked from more than a
million historical photos accumulated by the agency in its 80-year
history.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the album is different from other books of this
kind, as it features photos showing the daily lives of the Taiwan
people and their land rather than providing a graphic record of the
activities of governments and officials.</P>
      <P>Mark Ou, deputy editor-in-chief of CNA and the executive editor
of the album, said the book depicts the changes in the lives of
ordinary people, not official events, and therefore bears witness to
the people's emotions.</P>
      <P>As a news agency whose history is closely interwoven with that of
the country, CNA has seen the same ups and downs as the rest of the
country and its fate has converged with that of Taiwan ever since it
sent its first correspondent to Taipei in 1945 at the end of World
War Two and began sending out stories from Taipei, Hu went on.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Hu said, the album is actually a pictorial record of
Taiwan of the last six decades.</P>
      <P>Sixty of the photos are on display in the agency's newly-opened
gallery, the Buena Vista, in an exhibition that will last until July
30.</P>
      <P>Hu said CNA is approaching the United Daily News and the China
Times as well as other news media and research institutes, with a
proposal to pool their photos together and make them available to
subscribers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Discussions about whether the China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) should take part in the construction of
submarines that the United States has promised to sell to Taiwan have
taken a U-turn, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, the DPP whip at the legislature, made the remarks
after a delegation of legislators completed an 11-day fact-finding
trip to the United States and Navy Commander-in-Chief Miao Yung-ching
called on the Legislative Yuan to communicate on the review of the
arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan submitted a NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion) special budget to buy 388 Patriot PAC-III missiles, eight
conventional submarines and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the
United States earlier this month, and the budget is now pending
approval by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Miao, it is not feasible for CSBC to take part in
the construction of the submarines and the navy will negotiate with
the United States on obtaining repair capacity and technology
transfers, said Ker.</P>
      <P>Miao said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines,
which would make it futile to give the CSBC the capacity to build
them.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the United States has control of the key technology in
building the submarines, Miao said.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chung, another DPP legislator, said that the delegation
asked the United States to shorten the delivery period of the
submarines from 15 years to 10 years, which reveals that Taiwan has
already given up the policy of building the submarines itself.</P>
      <P>He said that if the submarines are not built by Taiwan, and based
on the price tags of submarines sold by Germany and Spain together
with the cost of obtaining repair capacity, then the cost of the
eight subs will be NT$100 billion less than the original plan of
NT$400 billion.</P>
      <P>When asked if the long delivery period of 10 years might affect
Taiwan's military strength and tip the military cross-Taiwan Strait
balance toward mainland China after 2005, Lee said that although the
naval military balance could tilt toward Beijing after 2005, it does
not mean that there will be an eruption of war by that time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still enjoys the edge in the air, Lee claimed, and an
order of Kidd-class destroyers will arrive at Taiwan by the end of
next year, which, he said, means that Taiwan can still maintain its
edge until then.</P>
      <P>He also said that the United States will deliver the first of
12 P-3C aircraft in 2008, with another three in 2009, four in 2010 and
the final four in 2011.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER: ARMS PURCHASES TOO SLOW TO BE HELPFUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Proposed arms purchases from the United
States is too slow to be helpful in light of the urgent threat the
country is facing from mainland China, opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
lawmaker Liao Wan-ju said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liao, who had just returned from a visit to the United States
where she was briefed by U.S. officials on the proposed arms deal,
said U.S. intelligence claims that Beijing could intimidate Taiwan
with force on a small scale either in 2006 or 2008. She added that
the arms intended to preempt this threat will not be ready before
then.</P>
      <P>Quoting U.S. sources, Liao said the first of eight submarines
listed in the proposed arms purchase plan will not be delivered until
2013, with the first seven of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft
delivered in 2009 and the remainder in 2011. Even 388 Patriot
Advanced Capability-3 missiles will take two years to be delivered,
she added.</P>
      <P>She also expressed concern over the prices demanded by the United
States for the weapons, especially the eight submarines. "We should
not be forced to accept whatever price is requested by Washington"

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu Monday invited
Harish Kumar, vice president of Junior Chamber International (JCI) ,
to come to Taiwan to attend the second Democratic Pacific Assembly in
Taiwan in August.</P>
      <P>Lu extended the invitation to Kumar and other JCI officials to
attend the assembly of the Democratic Pacific Union, which was
founded by Lu, in the hope that it will promote understanding between
JCI members in the Asia and Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Kumar, accompanied by Francis Lee, president of the Taiwan Junior
Chamber, was visiting Lu at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed hope that Kumar will help promote cooperation and
exchanges between Taiwan and India.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kumar said he would like to promote regional
cooperation and exchanges, especially since the Taiwan Junior Chamber
is soliciting to host the Asia-Pacific Conference in 2007, an event
sponsored by the JCI.</P>
      <P>Noting that there will be more than 5,000 members participating
in the Asia-Pacific Conference, he said that if the Taiwan Junior
Chamber can host the event, it will promote international
understanding and cooperation and will boost Taiwan's diplomatic
and trade development.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that the Taiwan Junior Chamber nurtures a lot of what
she described as "elite" members of society, and that President Chen
Shui-bian was once a member. She added that the government will
always support Taiwan Junior Chamber activities, especially in its
efforts to obtain hosting rights for the Asia-Pacific Conference in
2007.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Iraq group issues threat
to behead a missing marine.

A militant Iraqi group threatened Sunday night an American marine
it said it had abducted from a military base unless the United States
released all Iraqi prisoners, according to a video broadcast on the
Qatar-based television network Al Jazeera. The video shows a man
identified as Cpl. Wassef Ali Hassoun sitting on the ground in
desert-patterned camouflage fatigues, with a thick blindfold over his
eyes and a long, curved sword held over his head. Marine officials
said Sunday night that Corporal Hassoun, who is of Lebanese descent,
has been missing since June 21.

The Wall Street Journal: In surprise move, coalition transfers
power in Iraq early.

The U.S.-led coalition transferred sovereignty to an interim
Iraqi government Monday, speeding the move by two days in an apparent
bid to surprise insurgents who may have tried to sabotage the step
toward self rule. Although the interim government will have full
sovereignty, it will operate under major restrictions -- some of them
imposed at the urging of the influential Shiite clergy which sought
to limit the powers of an un-elected administration.</TEXT>

      <P>The government's "active opening, effective

has remained unchanged, a senior mainland affairs official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san made
the remarks after former President Lee Teng-hui said a day earlier
that many of the difficulties Taiwan business people are now facing
can be attributed to the government's failure to fully implement his
"no haste, be patient" policy.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the government's policy on cross-strait commercial
exchanges was altered from the Lee administration's "no haste, be
patient" to "active opening, effective management" in 2001 in line
with the conclusions reached at a cross-party national economic
development conference.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chiu said the "active opening, effective management"
strategy largely complies with the basic spirit of "no haste, be

Taiwan companies' global business expansion following Taiwan's
admission to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party administration's "active

    <HEADLINE>ALLIANCE ISSUES STATEMENT TO OPPOSE NT$610.8 BILLION U.S.  ARMS DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An alliance made up of members of social
groups and academic figures issued a 10,000-Chinese character
statement Monday to oppose the Taiwan government's plan to spend
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion) to purchase weaponry from the
United States.</P>
      <P>The members of the Democratic Action Alliance issued the
statement to coincide with the return of a delegation of legislators
from the United States, believing that a "bargaining" type of arms
procurement will not protect Taiwan's security or its interests.</P>
      <P>The legislators had met with U.S. government and military
officials during their stay in the United States to discuss issues
ranging from the apparent higher-than-average price tag for the
package to whether Taiwan's China Shipbuilding Corp. should take part
in the construction of the submarines.</P>
      <P>Former National Assembly member Cheng Li-wen, poet and social
activist Chan Che, National Chung Cheng University Professor Hsieh
Ta-ning, and National Taiwan University Professor Chang Ya-chung held
a news conference at the Legislative Yuan to make public the
statement.</P>
      <P>The statement seeks to analyze the issue in five aspects:
military security, strategic security, economic development, social
justice and democratic values, believing that the huge budget for the
arms deal, which the Executive Yuan proposed earlier this month and
which is now pending approval of the Legislative Yuan, is tantamount
to paying "protection fees to the United States."</P>
      <P>They also suspected that there could be kickbacks among Taiwan's
top brass and huge profits for arms dealers.</P>
      <P>According to the proposed budget, Taiwan should buy 388 Patriot
PAC-III missiles, eight conventional submarines, and 12
anti-submarine P-3C aircraft.</P>
      <P>Professor Hsieh said that the arms purchase is a major public
policy and shouldn't be made rashly, adding that he "welcomes the
government to convince us [of the need for the weapons], and we would
also like to conduct rational debate."</P>
      <P>Professor Chang said that the NT$610.8 billion arms deal is
"unacceptable," and urged the government to rein itself in before the
brink of the precipice, or the alliance will organize a protest or
publish the names of legislators who are involved in the arms
purchase.</P>
      <P>Chan noted that a referendum to step up national defense held
concurrently with the March 20 presidential election failed to pass,
but the government has proposed a special budget for the arms
purchase, which he termed as "illegal."</P>
      <P>Cheng said a military purchase should not be a "bargaining game,"
and that to have a domestic shipbuilder build the submarines is also
not a simple task.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PROCUREMENT AIMED AT ENSURING TAIWAN STRAIT PEACE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday the
Republic of China government's arms procurement projects have
consistently been aimed at safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with U.S. Congressman Scott
McInnis (R-Colo.) who arrived in Taipei Sunday for a goodwill visit.</P>
      <P>The president told his guest that he is very grateful for the
Bush administration's consent in April 2001 to sell a robust package
of military hardware to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he remembered vividly that Taiwan took the
initiative to purchase those weapons to meet its practical defense
needs.</P>
      <P>"We had lobbied strenuously for the procurement project. The
package was not the result of any U.S. pressure as some opponents or
critics claim," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's administration has approved a special military budget of
NT$610.8 billion (US$18.2 billion) for the purchase of eight
diesel-powered submarines, a modified version of the Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile system and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft
over a 15-year period starting in 2005.</P>
      <P>The United States offered to sell the military hardware to Taiwan
in 2001 as part of its most comprehensive arms package to the island
since 1992. The special budget bill is now pending approval of the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Ministry of National Defense had carefully
evaluated Taiwan's defense needs before coming up with a priority
weaponry procurement list for U.S. reference.</P>
      <P>At the time, Chen said, the eight conventional submarines topped
the priority list.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the submarines, the Patriot anti-missile
batteries and the P-3C anti-submarine aircraft are all needed to beef
up Taiwan's defense capabilities in the face of mainland China's
military threat.</P>
      <P>"Our arms procurement projects are mainly aimed at protecting
lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait, avoiding a cross-strait imbalance
in military strength and in safeguarding Taiwan's hard-won democratic
achievements, " Chen said, adding that maintaining the cross-strait
military balance is expected to help be the catalyst for the early
resumption of bilateral talks.</P>
      <P>Chen also took advantage of the occasion to clarify his
administration's constitutional reform plan. In his May 20 inaugural
speech, Chen said, he clearly explained Taiwan's urgent need for a
new constitution suitable for the present status quo.</P>
      <P>"Formulating a new constitution is primarily to ensure good
governance and to upgrade Taiwan's overall competitiveness, " Chen
said, adding that he already outlined in his inaugural address the
scope and procedures for Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration is responsible and idealistic yet
pragmatic.</P>
      <P>"We are firm in pursuing progress, but we are also realistic as
well. We fully understand the importance of forging an internal
consensus and solidarity as well as stabilizing cross-strait
relations and promoting economic prosperity, " Chen said, adding that
he will endeavor to end domestic disharmony and confrontation in the
wake of the bitterly fought March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>This is McInnis' first visit to Taiwan. A six-term member of the
U.S. House of Representatives, McInnis has formally announced that he
will not seek re-election as a Congressman and may run for Colorado
State governor. Chen extended his best wishes for McInnis'
success.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Colorado's 11th-largest export outlet. Chen said he
hopes McInnis' visit can help further boost Taiwan-Colorado
agricultural trade and economic cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD DEAL WITH U.S. ARMS PURCHASE ISSUE ASAP</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>

By Jay Chen and P.C.Tang
CNA REPORTERS</P>
      <P>Washington, June 28 (CNA) Despite the fact that Taiwan will hold
legislative elections at the end of the year and the United States
will have its presidential election in November, the coming few
months will certainly be a crucial period for Taiwan to actively deal
with its arms-purchase issues.</P>
      <P>The coming few months might also be a golden opportunity that
Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties should grab in dealing with
its new arms procurement plans since such an opportunity will never
come back.</P>
      <P>A Legislative Yuan delegation, headed by Wang Jin-pyng, speaker
of the Legislative Yuan, had expressed serious concerns during its
recent visit to Washington, D.C., over the high price tag for the
U.S. weapons, including eight submarines, that the island is planning
to purchase.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, a Bush administration official recently told the Central
News Agency that Taiwan should discuss its arms-purchase plans with a view
to considering Beijing's military threat to the island and its own defense
capability rather than the issue of price alone.</P>
      <P>Noting that the arms that are currently being discussed between
Taiwan and the United States are weapons that were requested by
Taiwan several years ago, the official who wished to remain anonymous
said that the United States agreed to sell the weapons to Taiwan
after the Bush administration took office and after a thorough review
by relevant U.S. officials who considered that it is necessary for
Taiwan to possess such arms.</P>
      <P>But after three years, the official said, Taiwan is still
murmuring against the price tag and the specifications of the
weapons, adding that this has led the United states to question the
purpose of Taiwan's earlier request for purchasing the U.S. arms.</P>
      <P>Some have said that Taiwan could be trying to use the
arms-purchase plan as a tool to test Washington's political
commitment to the island, the official said, adding that the island
might consider the sale of the weapons as indicating Washington's
firm commitment to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Although the official would not say that it could be very serious
if Taiwan's new arms procurement plan is postponed again, he however
assured that the United States would not be treated as a mercenary by
serving other countries anytime they needed it.</P>
      <P>A U.S. National Defense University military expert said that the worst
possible situation regarding the arms purchase issue would be that
Washington thinks Taiwan is not willing to spend the money or the
effort to protect itself and is relying on the United States for
everything.</P>
      <P>If this situation is true, the experts said that both the U.S.
executive branch and Congress, which has long been in support of
helping defend Taiwan, will adopt a more conservative stance on
whether the United States should intervene or not in the event of an
outbreak of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>A well-placed source also said that both the Bush administration
and the U.S. Congress are hoping that the island will be able to put
some of its arms procurement plans into practice as soon as possible
since they consider that the mainland's military strength has rapidly
increased and that its threat to Taiwan has also increased as the
island has not increased its defense budget in the past few years.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Washington's push for Taiwan to upgrade its
military forces and to speed up its defense reform is that it hopes
the island can at least defend itself for a certain period of time
before U.S. intervention in the event of a mainland Chinese attack on
the island, the expert said.</P>
      <P>A senior researcher of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies said that the U.S. Congress will be disappointed and
dissatisfied if no progress is made by Taiwan in its budget debate on
the arms procurement plans in the Legislative Yuan in the coming few
months.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, some U.S. officials and experts are worried that if
the United States cannot prevent leading members of the European
Union from continuing their ban on arms exports to mainland China in
the future, the possible sale of British, French and German weapons
to the mainland will make the cross-strait military imbalance more
serious.</P>
      <P>As the arms-purchase issue is of vital importance in terms of
Taiwan's national security and survival, now might be the right time
for the island's ruling and opposition political parties to
rationally discuss the relevant issues and to try to reach a
conclusion on the issues, the sooner the better.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday that
she is contemplating starting a "saving mind" campaign and organizing
a seminar on healthy living at her office to raise public awareness
about health issues.</P>
      <P>Receiving visiting American mental health expert Alice P. Lin at
her office, the vice president said she has always been concerned
about the public's mental health and has tried several times to raise
the public's awareness of the importance of good mental health.</P>
      <P>Her efforts included two public campaigns for mental health,
namely the "sunshine life" and the "life train," although she did not
elaborate on when or even where the two previous campaigns were
conducted.</P>
      <P>Claiming that mental health is "too academic" to be understood by
the public, Lu suggested changing it to "healthy life, " which covers
a broader range of health issues than mental health and will be
easier for what she described as "ordinary people" to understand.</P>
      <P>However, the vice president rejected Lin's recommendation for the
government to set up a mental health commission at the Presidential
Office to coordinate the efforts of both the public and private
sectors in improving the public's mental health, saying it would be
difficult for her office to form a commission not provided for in the
organic law of the Presidential Office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NSU CHAIRWOMAN VOWS TO PROMOTE ETHNIC HARMONY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  29  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly established Non-partisan
Solidarity Union (NSU) will promote harmony among ethnic groups in
Taiwan and will take a middle-way approach in dealing with public
affairs, NSU Chairwoman Chang Po-ya said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Chang noted that Taiwan's politics
have been polarized and its people have divided into two camps -- the
"pan blue alliance" comprising the opposition Kuomintang and its two
splinter parties of the People First Party and the New Party, and the
"pan green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- since the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The political rivalry has produced a great rift among the
country's various ethnic groups and people who have different
political ideas, the former minister of the interior said, claiming
that this has also endangered national security and affected social
stability.</P>
      <P>At this critical moment, Chang said, a middle-way is needed to
ease or dissuade the political rivalry and confrontation among the
different groups. The NSU will bear this mission and responsibility,
she added.</P>
      <P>Despite a long career in politics and public service, Chang said
that she had never joined a political party before taking charge of
the NSU earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The former legislator and Chiayi mayor said that her joining the
NSU represents a voice for the silent majority and the use of a
middle-way force. The NSU will never be "extremist," she promised.</P>
      <P>Referring to December's legislative elections, Chang said that
her party will nominate one candidate in each of more than 30
constituencies around the nation and hopes to win at least 15 seats
in the 225-member legislature.</P>
      <P>The NSU will not join a grand opposition alliance proposed by
some politicians and parties, neither will it coordinate with other
parties on the nomination of candidates nor participate in joint
electoral campaigns.</P>
      <P>The NSU will play a decisive role in the rivalry between the two
polarized camps, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>With regard to cross-Taiwan Strait issues, Chang said that her
party suggests that the two sides set aside temporarily disputes over
sovereignty and jointly seek the opportunity to establish a lasting
peace in the strait.</P>
      <P>The sovereignty issue can be left for future generations to
settle in 50 or 100 years, she added.</P>
      <P>The NSU, initiated by 10 incumbent independent legislators and
dozens of other veteran politicians, including former Legislator Chen
Chieh-ju and former Hsinchu Mayor Shih Hsing-chung, was established
June 15.</P>

The United States turned over formal sovereignty to the Iraqis

Bush's mission is far from accomplished. The transfer represents yet

Just one day after the handover of limited sovereignty to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will decide whether the Suao-Hualien Expressway construction
project should be subject to a second-stage environmental impact
evaluation, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after two groups filed two opposite appeals
with the Cabinet earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>A group of residents from the eastern Taiwan county of Hualien,
headed by Hualien County Council Deputy Speaker Lin LIen-wen,
demonstrated in front of the Cabinet building early in the morning
demanding that the Suao-Hualien Expressway construction project be
launched as soon as possible to boost the county's tourist and
economic development.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, scores of environmental activists also
filed an appeal with the Cabinet urging the government to conduct a
second-stage environmental impact assessment to gauge
whether the damage to the natural environment caused by
the construction project can recover or not.</P>
      <P>"Unless a second-stage impact study ensures that the natural
ecology in the region will not be spoiled irreversibly, the project
should not be implemented," said an environmental activist who joined
the petition.</P>
      <P>Responding to the opposite appeals, Chen said the government must
conduct extensive environmental impact studies before any major
infrastructure construction is launched.</P>
      <P>A first-stage environmental impact study for the Suao-Hualien
Expressway project was completed in March 2000. The government was
originally scheduled to start construction of the 80-km expressway
linking Hualien to Suao in Ilan county late last year. But Premier Yu
Shyi-kun announced a three-month delay on the eve of the start of
construction due to environmental activists' strong opposition.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Cabinet has set aside a budget for building the
expressway as part of its 10 new major construction projects aimed at
reinvigorating the domestic economy. Nevertheless, he said, the
government must make further study on its possible environmental
impact. The EPA will decide later whether to conduct a second-stage
environmental impact assessment, Chen added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four men were arrested at CKS International
Airport for smuggling heroin into Taiwan Monday and Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tipped off by informers, investigators arrested Tsai Chia-wen,
31, for smuggling 797 grams of heroin Tuesday afternoon. He said
during the initial arraignment that he was set up in mainland China
in visiting prostitutes and gambling and because he was unable to pay
the money he was forced to carry drugs. He was given the heroin in
Macau, which he taped to his body.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, aviation police also arrested Liu Wu-hsiung, 60, Yu
Tien-huei, 54, and Ke Fu-yuan, 26, for smuggling 2.674 kilos of
heroin when they arrived at CKS Airport Monday night.</P>
      <P>All four men have been turned over to the Taoyuan Prosecutor's
Office for violation of the anti-drug trafficking law.</P>
      <P>Investigators and aviation police reported that they recently
uncovered suspects returning from Thailand, Macau and Hong Kong with
drugs. They said that this is because summer is coming and the
selling drugs to students reaches its peak during this time of the
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA CHIEF TO REPRESENT TAIWAN AT G10 AGRICULTURAL MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Lee
Chin-lung will represent Taiwan at a Group of Ten (G10) agriculture
ministers meeting scheduled to open in Geneva July 5.</P>
      <P>It will be the highest-level meeting in Geneva that Taiwan has
participated in since the island's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>As Swiss President Joseph Deiss concurrently serves as his
country's economics minister, he will preside over the upcoming G10
agriculture ministers meeting.</P>
      <P>G10 member states include Bulgaria, Taiwan, South Korea, Iceland,
Israel, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Mauritius. The
agricultural sector in each of these countries is relatively small in
scale, so these countries usually have less leverage individually in
the WTO-organized farm trade talks and therefore have formed the G10.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent representative to the WTO,
said Monday that as the WTO farm trade talks will soon enter a
critical period, the G10 countries decided to meet in early July to
discuss joint strategies and cement their common stances on major
farm trade issues in preparation for the Cancun round of WTO trade
talks.</P>
      <P>Yen said Lee's attendance at the G10 ministerial-level meeting
has both substantive and symbolic significance. "Lee's presence will
help upgrade Taiwan's international visibility and profile," he said,
adding that it is also the result of strenuous efforts by the Taiwan
WTO mission over the past two years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of new forest rangers will begin
working July 1, but officials in Hualien are concerned that not
enough of them will be assigned to their area.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Hualien District Office of Taiwan Forestry

policemen to be forest rangers, but Hualien will only get 21 of them.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in the past their forest rangers did not
have the broad rights that policemen have, and even if they saw
people engaged in illegal logging, farming, burying, construction or
dumping they had to rely on local police to apprehend the suspects.
This delay often resulted in the culprits escaping.</P>
      <P>Officials said that the area encompassing the Hualien Forestry
Bureau is large, covering a strip of land 125 kilometers by 45

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
lawmaker urged the government Tuesday to offer longer residence
permits to foreign missionaries.</P>
      <P>Legislator Cheng Kuo-chung said that under current immigration
regulations, foreign missionaries can only obtain one-year residence
permits, resulting in many inconveniences for them.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Cheng said, foreign missionaries have to renew
their driver's licenses and Internet service applications whenever
their one-year residence permits expire.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Cheng said, the residence permit renewal fee is
NT$1,000 per person.</P>
      <P>"It has become a financial burden for some married foreign
missionaries with young children," Cheng said, adding that a foreign
missionary familiar with him has to spend NT$7,000 a year on renewing
residence permits as the missionary has five children.</P>
      <P>Noting that many foreign clergymen have dedicated themselves to
serving local society and most of them have earn only small salaries,
Cheng said the Immigration Bureau under the National Police
Administration should revise relevant regulations to grant three-year
residence permits for foreign missionaries.</P>
      <P>"Since the current regulations allow the issuance of three-year
residence permits for foreign teachers and management staff of
foreign companies in Taiwan, I think similar privileges should be
extended to foreign missionaries, " Cheng said, adding that foreign
clergymen's contributions to Taiwan society deserve more recognition
and respect.</P>

York, promoting high-quality Taiwan gourmet food.</P>
      <P>Andrew L. Y. Hsia, director-general of Taipei Economic and

    <HEADLINE>COA TO SET UP TASK FORCE TO CRACK DOWN ON SELLING OF TAINTED PORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) announced
Tuesday that it will create a task force to crack down on the illegal
practice of selling products from pigs that died of illness.</P>
      <P>The COA's announcement followed a shocking report by the Consumer
Protection Commission (CPC) under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The commission reported that the illegal selling of such pork has
been hard to eradicate, saying that a total of 161 tons of tainted
pork had been found over the past three years. Although the owners of
the unlawful abattoirs were prosecuted, law enforcers have failed to
track down the final destination of the bad meat and it may have
ended up in various products or for sale in markets.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that to combat the unlawful practice, they
will now publish on their Web site establishments that have violated
the law, and keep them on file for regular checks and monitoring.</P>
      <P>The COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine will also call an intra-agency meeting Wednesday, inviting
officials from the Department of Health, the Environmental Protection
Administration, the National Police Administration, the COA's Animal
Industry Department, as well as those from major pork production
counties of Changhua, Yunlin, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung to
discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials are also asking the violators of the law be given
the maximum sentences.</P>
      <P>Bureau Director Chiang Yi-nan said that to track down the
possible outlets of the tainted pork, the bureau will now install
satellite positioning systems in vehicles carrying the dead animals
to incinerators.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that all the contracted 100-plus vehicles will be
installed with the system, and the number of pigs they carry will be
matched with that sent to the incinerators in the future so as to
prevent the drivers from diverting the dead pigs to other places.</P>
      <P>The commission has suggested that the COA subsidize pig farmers
for their pigs that died of sickness, but COA officials said the
issue will have to undergo further study as it involves the questions
of fairness.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials asked the public to use pork products that carry
CAS certification from authorized slaughterhouses, and asked them to
call 0800-039-131 if they have doubts about pork products. Those who
provide tips leading to the discovery of the illegal practice will be
rewarded with NT$500,000 (US$14,880).</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE MAINLAND FISHING BOATS, 13 PEOPLE EXPELLED FROM KINMEN WATERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen marine police on Tuesday seized
three mainland Chinese fishing boats along with 13 mainland fishermen
and crew caught fishing illegally in waters off the outlying island
of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen marine police, backed up by a cutter from the Coast
Guard Administration, discovered the three mainland fishing vessels
poaching in the corridor between Kinmen and Liehyu, or little Kinmen,
around 8 a.m. Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The police seized the mainland fishing vessel's fishing gear,
including 15 drift nets, before expelling the three vessels and the
13 mainland Chinese, including seven fishermen and six female crew
members.</P>
      <P>All three fishing boats - the "Minlongyu" No. 0751, the
"Minlongyu" No. 5015 and the "Minlongyu" No. 5047 -- were from
Longhai City in Zhangzhou, Fujian province.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese were released after questioning by the
Kinmen marine police, who determined that they had been poaching in
Kinmen waters, but had not used dynamite or electricity to catch
fish.</P>
      <P>Two other mainland fishermen were not that lucky. Captured for
similar poaching and trespassing by Kinmen marine police Monday,
also in the Kinmen-Liehyu corridor, the two mainlanders were detained
before being transferred to the Kinmen Prosecutors' Office because
they were found to have electrocuted fish.</P>
      <P>Illegal forays by mainland fishing boats into the waters around
Kinmen have become rampant in recent years. The mainland fishermen,
who use nets and explosives, and also frequently engage in smuggling,
often intentionally ignore warnings from Taiwan marine police or
naval vessels.</P>
      <P>Residents of Kinmen, most of whom used to make a living by
fishing, have complained that their fishing rights are being
seriously violated by their mainland counterparts. They demand that
the marine police and the ROC Navy do more to prevent Taiwan's
territorial waters from being encroached upon.</P>
      <P>A resident living near the Kinmen-Liehyu corridor, surnamed Chen,
said that there used to be 30 sampans from his village fishing in
Kinmen waters. But today there is only one sampan still operating,
entirely as a result of poaching by mainland fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Mainland fishing boats' destructive fishing gear, dynamite and
electricity not only catch small fish, but also kill other undersea
life, causing great losses to Kinmen fishermen.</P>
      <P>Another Kinmen resident, surnamed Lin, complained that mainland
fishing boats have not only been poaching in Kinmen waters, they have
also planted stationary nets in waters near Kinmen's beaches for
regular harvests. If such harvests are insufficient, according to
Lin, they just walk onto the beach to pick shellfish and other
aquatic produce.</P>
      <P>Answering the residents' complaints, the Kinmen marine police
authorities said Tuesday that intensive patrols will be increased to
once a week from this week and attention will be specially paid to
those mainland vessels using dynamite or electricity during their
poaching.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Mindulle is posing a greater threat
to the Bashi Channel and waters off southeast Taiwan as it continues
moving towards Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After issuing a sea warning Monday afternoon for ships operating
in the Bashi Channel and waters off southeast Taiwan, CWB
meteorologists said Mindulle, the seventh typhoon of this year in the
Pacific area, has continued to move in a west-northwesterly direction
towards Taiwan at a speed of eight kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>With a radius of 250 kilometers and packing maximum sustained
winds of up to 43 meters per second, the typhoon was centered about
470 kilometers southeast of Taiwan's southernmost tip of Oluanpi at 8
a.m. Tuesday, the meteorologists reported.</P>
      <P>Noting that the waters along the coasts of eastern Taiwan and the
Hengchun peninsula have been rough, the meteorologists advised people
to refrain from going near the seaside.</P>
      <P>Since the radius of Typhoon Mindulle is wide and its strength
could gradually increase, the weathermen said they will keep a close
watch on the typhoon, which is forecast to directly affect Taiwan
Thursday or Friday.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau warned that Typhoon Mindulle may bring a
considerable amount of rainfall to Taiwan when it is nearest to the
island between Wednesday and Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another typhoon, dubbed Tingting, was located about
630 kilometers north of Guam and moving northwesterly at a speed of
19 kilometers per hour as of 8 a.m. Tuesday, the meteorologists said,
adding that it is still too early to tell whether the typhoon will
affect Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The meteorologists are warning of high temperatures in Taiwan
over the next few days, with highs of 36 degrees Celsius forecast for
the western and northern parts of the island, 35 degrees Celsius for
the central and southern parts, 32 degrees Celsius for eastern
Taiwan, and thunder showers for the north and northeastern areas.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau has also warned that the ultra-violet ray
index around Taiwan will be high for the next few days.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged newly
promoted generals Tuesday to cultivate three leadership
characteristics -- perseverance, wisdom and conviction.</P>
      <P>Addressing a joint commissioning ceremony for newly promoted
generals from the military's three branches, Chen said senior
military officers should evaluate Taiwan's defense needs and work out
effective strategies to upgrade combined services combat capabilities
in the face of mainland China's ever-mounting military threat.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland China has continued expanding its military
strength and is developing new combat strategies, such as unlimited
and asymmetrical warfare tactics.</P>
      <P>To cope with these new developments and challenges, Chen said,
senior military officers should continually pursue new knowledge in
warfare, technological and management and apply their expertise in
military affairs and combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>Chen then spoke of the qualities of a good military leader.</P>
      <P>"Military leaders need three special qualities -- perseverance,
wisdom and conviction to win on battlefields and defend national
security," Chen said, adding that in the face of mainland China's
accelerated military modernization, all senior officers should
constantly think how to promote reform in military management and
combat operations as well as how to integrate limited resources to
establish an elite high-tech combat force that can deal with all
sorts of tough challenges.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his hope that newly promoted generals can
work with their colleagues in injecting a new spirit of courage,
conviction and trust into the military rank and file.</P>
      <P>During the joint commissioning ceremony presided over by Minister

      <P>A Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman expressed his
negative view regarding the creation of a grand alliance among the
opposition political parties and groups, saying that the only right
course for the sustainable operation of the "pan-blue alliance" is a
merger between the KMT and the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Media reports have said that KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong came to a consensus at a June 25 closed-door
meeting regarding forming a grand alliance among their parties, the
New Party and those non-partisan members who have similar views, to
try to win the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>But KMT spokesman Tsai Cheng-yuan said while responding to media
questions that consideration of forming a grand alliance among the
opposition parties and groups is only "temporary" and that a merger
of the KMT and the PFP is the only way for the sustainable operation

      <P>Pointing out that it is not easy to put the formation of a grand

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER KEEPING LOW PROFILE DURING EUROPEAN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen has
kept a low profile during his visit to Europe because of the
relentless stifling of Taiwan in the international community by
mainland China, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chun-teh, deputy director of the MOFA's Department of
European Affairs, made the remarks after Chen flew into Rome
following his visit to the United States Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that this is Chen's first visit to Europe since
assuming his post in April. He said Chen will preside over a meeting
of the chiefs of Taiwan's missions in the region, as well as visit
the Vatican, Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>Chen said earlier that Taiwan should strengthen its relations
with the European Union considering its population, economic strength
and market potential after it expanded to 25 member countries
from 15 members this past May.</P>
      <P>During his visit to the United States, Chen called on several
think tanks, met with overseas Chinese and attended an annual
conference of the World Forum in Colorado -- a gathering of
politicians, academics and financial executives organized by the
American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank.</P>

influences, could only have been produced by fear."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY SUGGESTS INTEGRATING FOREIGN TRADE INTO DIPLOMATIC WORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government should
study the feasibility of integrating its foreign trade affairs into
the jurisdiction of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , the ROC
representative to the World Trade Organization (WTO) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, permanent representative of the Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu at the WTO
headquarters, made the suggestion at a meeting of ROC mission chiefs
stationed in European countries, which opened in Geneva Tuesday, with
Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen presiding.</P>
      <P>Yen, a former ROC finance minister, said that the ROC has had a
hard time expanding its diplomatic frontiers due to Beijing's
diplomatic embargo.</P>
      <P>"I think we may be able to achieve some diplomatic breakthroughs
if we can wisely use our relatively strong trade and economic clout,"
Yen said.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Yen said, many countries, including
Australia, have merged their foreign and trade affairs departments.
Several other countries, such as Japan, have traditionally authorized
their foreign affairs ministries to chart their basic international
trade policies.</P>
      <P>Yen said he hopes relevant ROC government agencies can conduct an
extensive study on whether Taiwan can learn from those countries'
experiences and allow the MOFA to handle foreign trade affairs to
enhance its leverage in the diplomatic arena.</P>
