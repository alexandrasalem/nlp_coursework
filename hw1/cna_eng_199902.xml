Confucius' lesson of the day: "In my method of teaching, I
always wait for my student to make an effort himself to find his way
through a difficulty, before I show him the way myself. I also make
him find his own illustrations before I give him one of my own. When
I have pointed out the bearing of a subject in one direction and
found that my student cannot himself see its bearings into other
directions, I do not then repeat my lesson."</TEXT>

      <P>Chang, at the head of a KMT delegation, will attend an annual

      <P>Bush, the top US liaison official in charge of Taiwan affairs,
arrived here on Jan. 24 for a two-week visit.</P>
      <P>It is widely believed that Bush has a special political mission
in Taiwan seeing as there are several major issues of national
concern -- such as Taiwan's inclusion in the US-initiated theater
missile defense system and Taiwan's partial cabinet reshuffle --
which have sparked discussion here.</P>
      <P>Bush played a round of golf with Vice President Lien Chan on
Sunday, during which the AIT chairman reportedly expressed concern
about Taiwan's democracy development and the island's relations with

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPOREANS SPENDING THEIR WAY TO BANKRUPTCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An increasing number of Singaporeans are
overspending, sinking deeper into debt and bankruptcy despite the
relatively somber consumer sentiment, figures from the Official
Assignee indicated on Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of people who filed for bankruptcy because they lived
beyond their means doubled from about 170 people in 1997 to 336 last
year. These new bankruptcies joined about 2,000 other "big spenders"
who are bankrupt today because they did not watch their spending.</P>
      <P>There was an increase in the total number of bankruptcies as the
economic crisis took its toll, with 2,585 people declaring bankruptcy
last year. Of these people, 2,250 cited reasons other than
overspending for their insolvency, up from 1,530 in 1997.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Official Assignee said as in previous years,
these people went bankrupt mainly because their businesses failed or
they were unemployed -- factors which might be beyond their control.</P>
      <P>As a result of their business losses or losing their jobs, they
could not pay their creditors and loans for property or cars, and so
become insolvent.</P>
      <P>But a cause for concern, he said, was that overspending continued
to feature as the main "self-induced" cause of bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>According to the law, when a person is declared bankrupt, he
cannot travel or run a business without the court's permission, or
invest in private property. He also has to disclose that he is
bankrupt when borrowing more than S$500 (about US$312).</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORST MAY BE OVER FOR SINGAPORE FIRMS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An improvement in company performance in
Singapore during the fourth quarter of last year suggests that the
worst of the economic downturn may be over, a recent survey
indicated.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Business Times and the Center for
Business Research and Development (CBRD) of the National University
of Singapore, showed the number of companies which reported a worse
rather than better performance, shrank.</P>
      <P>While performance indicators -- such as sales, profits and new
orders -- improved yet again in the fourth quarter, they still
registered negative figures.</P>
      <P>This suggests that the Singapore economy is still far from a
full-fledged recovery, said Chow Kit Boey, director of CBRD.
"Business conditions were still weaker than they were in the fourth
quarter 1997, but there is less pessimism over business prospects in
the next six months.</P>
      <P>The results may well indicate that the worst is over in
Singapore, barring any unexpected adverse global development," she
said.

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA SAID TO BE CURBING TAIWAN FIBER IMPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is rumored to be planning to
reduce synthetic fiber imports from Taiwan, textile and fabric
industrial sources said on Monday.</P>
      <P>That has sent shock waves through Taiwan's textile and fiber
industries, as the island is the largest synthetic fiber maker in the
world. More than one-third of the textiles it produces are exported
to Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Taiwan exported US$16.6 billion worth of textiles and
garments, with 37 percent going to Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Last year total exports declined to US$14.7 billion, with 33
percent going to Hong Kong and mainland China. The reduction in
exports to those two areas amounted to a loss of NT$42 billion
(US$1.3 billion) for Taiwan companies in 1998, sources said.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan textile and fabric industry sources, Taiwan
makers have been feeling mainland China's pinch on imports from
Taiwan since last year, when authorities intervened to restrict
imports. The intervention was said to be politically motivated and,
coupled with a crackdown on imports through "irregular channels," it
has resulted in Taiwan synthetic fiber makers facing a "cold winter"
earlier this year than usual.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang warned against Beijing's
taking unanticipated prohibitive measures against imports, and urged
Taiwan businesses to diversify their overseas investments rather than
concentrating solely on mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as mainland China is not yet a member of the World
Trade Organization, it has every right to ban imports whenever -- and
to whatever degree -- it wants.</P>
      <P>Wang added that the government will work to help domestic
synthetic fibers makers tide themselves over during this period of
difficulty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG CHIN-PING, JAO YIN-CHI ELECTED NEW LEADERS OF LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Candidates Wang Chin-ping and Jao Yin-chi 
from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) on Monday were elected the new
president and vice president of the Legislative Yuan on the first day
of the new legislative session.</P>
      <P>Wang, 58, the former vice president of the legislature, garnered
134 votes to win the presidency. His nearest rival, Chang Chun-hsiung
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), received 72
votes.</P>
      <P>Previous Legislative President Liu Sung-pan received two votes,
and there were seven invalid votes in the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Jao pocketed 133 votes to win the vice president post. His
nearest rival, Shih Ming-teh of the DPP, garnered 89 votes.</P>
      <P>As the KMT had expected the election for the vice presidential
seat to be closer than the presidential race, a relieved Jao embraced
Wang after the results of the vice presidential election were
announced.</P>
      <P>The election for president and vice president were held in the
morning and afternoon in a generally peaceful atmosphere although the
New Party was not happy that four KMT legislators were elected to
monitor the voting process.</P>
      <P>Hung Chao-nan of the KMT, who presided over the election, said
that the four-man list was presented by the KMT and the DPP. They
offered to give one seat to the NP, but it was not accepted.</P>
      <P>Candidates for the posts up for election were required to garner
a total of 113 votes to win. If there was no clear winner, another
round of votes would be cast.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's revised Constitution in 1997, the
legislators were increased from 164 to 225 this year. After the
year-end elections last year, the KMT took 123 seats, while the DPP
had 70 seats, and the New Party had 11 seats. The rest 21 seats were
shared among the minor parties and independent members.</P>
      <P>After being sworn in, all 225 legislators took part in the
elections for president and vice president.</P>

index, the market's key barometer, nose diving 135.53 points to close

suspend the implementation of the tax.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu said the decision was correct and
revealed that the stock market stabilizing task force will withdraw
from the market on schedule before the lunar Chinese New Year. His
remarks led to the heavy drop of share prices.</P>
      <P>Monday's turnover amounted to NT$39.79 billion, down from the
NT$51.73 billion recorded in the previous session.</P>

      <P>Australia has launched a diplomatic drive
to win international backing for political reform in Indonesia,
warning major powers that without such reform the world's largest
Islamic country could plunge toward chaos and a bloody breakup.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer last weekend urged government

sending an international monitoring team to observe the elections and
by providing logistical help, according to a dispatch from The Sydney

that Indonesia's political and economic future depended on credible
elections. Otherwise, there could be an upheaval that the country's

      <P>Downer also took the opportunity to seek support for Indonesia's

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government is determined to
reduce the country's unemployment rate to 5 percent from the current
7.5 percent, a rate on a par with that of the United States.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Federal
Treasurer Peter Costello said he would slash Australia's jobless rate
to a level near the United States' "full employment" level of 4
percent to 5 percent through further reforms to the country's welfare
system and labor market.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate plunged to 7.5 percent in December, the
lowest level in about nine years. Costello stressed that reducing the
rate to 5 percent was not a goal subject to a particular timetable.</P>
      <P>He said he does not have a time frame to reach the target of 5
percent unemployment rate because "it depends on the progress we make

    <HEADLINE>NEW MAC HEAD VOWS TO PROTECT HAPPINESS OF TAIWANESE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
chairman said he will make it a top priority to protect the happiness
of people in Taiwan as the leading ROC official in charge of mainland
China policy.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, formerly deputy presidential secretary-general, was sworn
in as MAC chairman on Monday, succeeding outgoing Chang King-yuh, who
will soon be appointed another post.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Su said he was honored to be assigned to the post,
one which is not to be taken lightly. He added that although his
predecessors have laid a solid foundation for him, he will try his
utmost to push forward Taiwan's relations with mainland China, a job
the word "tough" can hardly describe.</P>
      <P>Su said both cross-Taiwan Strait relations and regional stability
in the Asia-Pacific area are engulfed in uncertainties. Although good
cross-strait relations require goodwill from both sides, Taipei has
vowed to take the initiative to show friendship toward mainland China
which would prevent the cross-strait issue from being one of the
factors of uncertainty in the region.</P>
      <P>One is lucky enough already to be Taiwanese, the chairman said,
and one of the MAC's tasks is to protect the happiness of Taiwanese.
In the meantime, he hopes people in mainland China will lead lives as
happy as their counterparts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su's predecessor, Chang, lauded Su as a young but capable
official who is both well educated and experienced. With his past
experience in cross-strait relations, Su is actually "taking a
familiar path" to assume his new post, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China in
the absence of formal contact, also wished Su good luck at the
swearing-in ceremony.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that under Su's leadership, the MAC will collaborate
even closer with SEF to jointly to open up a new era of relations
across the Taiwan Strait, Koo added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RENMINBI MAY DEVALUE IN 2000: TAIWAN SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the renminbi, mainland China's
currency, is facing pressure to devalue, it will not likely be
devalued now as the proper time for such action will be in 2000, said
a Taiwan financial scholar.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-hsien, a monetary expert, said the Chinese yuan may be
devalued next year by 5 to 10 percent, which will provide the
mainland with the exact volume to offset losses from its export
declines in 1999.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, said Wu, if the renminbi is to be devalued next
year, it will not wreak havoc to those Southeast Asian countries
which have just recovered from the latest financial turmoil, and thus
can ease the region's concern over the possibility of a
further devaluation.</P>
      <P>A seminar, co-sponsored by the MasterLink Securities Corp., will
be held on Wednesday to address issues regarding Taiwan's industries
amid the financial storm and ways of coping with it. Wu was invited
to offer possible strategies to ward off risks in foreign exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wu said in an interview that it is simple to evaluate the trend
of a currency's exchange rate. To come out a winner in the foreign
exchange market is not necessarily being an expert in finance, Wu
added.</P>
      <P>Wu offered methods of evaluating the rate of a currency as
follows:</P>
      <P>--The exchange rate in black market: it offers a direction for a
correct evaluation of a currency's exchange rate. In view of the
current exchange rate of the renminbi in the mainland's black market
is 9.40 yuan against one US dollar, or 13 percent lower than the
official rate; therefore, a devaluation of 10 percent in the renminbi
may be a rate nearing a realistic rate after deducting the risk costs
in an illegal transaction.</P>
      <P>--The forward exchange rate: the quotation of forward exchange
rate of the renminbi given by foreign banks in Hong Kong is about 15
percent lower than that of the spot exchange rate, which evidently
has taken the 13 percent devaluation rate into consideration.</P>
      <P>--Using practical experiences and international experts' opinions
as reference.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui has reiterated that he
will not run for reelection, and stressed in an interview with a
well-known Japanese monthly the importance of grooming a new
generation of leaders for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the latest issue of the political magazine Shokun, due to hit
newsstands on Tuesday, Lee praised Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's resistance to pressure from Beijing in refusing to declare
the so-called "three noes" policy during the visit to Japan last year
by mainland China's President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" refers to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for "one China, one Taiwan," or "two Chinas," and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations requiring
statehood.</P>
      <P>He welcomed Tokyo's characterization of the "areas surrounding
Japan" in the Japan-US defense guidelines as a concept to be
determined by "the nature of an incident" rather than defining it in
geographic terms.</P>
      <P>The guidelines provide for Japanese logistic support for US
military operation in the area.</P>
      <P>"This will curb the potential military threat in East Asia," Lee
said in the interview conducted in January by famous Japanese writer
Yusuke Fukada.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's relationship with mainland China, the United
States, and other neighbor-states, the president said he believes
preservation of the status quo is the best the island can hope for,
and that he is looking forward to preserving it.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four-star General Tang Fei donned mufti on
Monday to assume the post of national defense minister.</P>
      <P>Tang, who is regarded as an "enlightened general" in the Republic
of China military, was promoted from vice chief of the general staff
to chief of the general staff in March last year.</P>
      <P>He has long been responsible for the improvement and build-up of
the ROC's new generation military, and is one of the generals who
helped Taiwan weather the crisis of the threat of mainland Chinese
missile attacks in 1996.</P>
      <P>He also became the first military officer to attend an
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, a move which was
highly praised by legislators. At that time, he expressed his opinion
that the post of national defense minister should be assigned to a
civil servant, because a defense minister with a military background
would probably be biased to his own branch of the armed forces.</P>
      <P>From his remarks, it seems Tang may never have thought he would
one day have the opportunity to serve as defense minister.</P>
      <P>A graduate of the ROC's Air Force Academy, Tang served for a long
time as a military attache to the ROC embassy in South Africa,
putting him "out of the loop" in terms of promotions, but after
returning from South Africa, he rose through the ranks, serving as
principal of the Air Force Academy, director-general of the Air Force
political warfare department, commander-in-chief of the Air Force,
vice chief of the general staff, and chief of the general staff.</P>
      <P>Tang's military experience is well-rounded, and he possesses an
international point of view. He also maintains good relations with
the US military, all of which are factors conducive to the collection
of military information and military procurement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THEATER  MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM WOULD BE DETERRENT: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Tang Fei
said on Monday that introduction of the theater missile defense (TMD)
system would be to build up a deterrent power, and not for offensive
purposes.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference organized by the Government
Information Office (GIO), Tang pointed out that the purpose of
augmenting the nation's military power is to prevent a battle from
occurring, rather than to instigate a battle.</P>
      <P>The new defense minister said that the introduction of the TMD
system would bear a political significance bigger than its military
significance.</P>
      <P>The TMD system is an umbrella of missile defenses which the
United States wants to raise over the Asian region as a deterrent to
aggression. Because of its prohibitive cost, however, it is seeking
the collaboration of countries such as Taiwan and Japan to spread the
financial load.</P>
      <P>He noted that if a political solution or other means better than
the TMD system can be found to lessen mainland China's military
threat to Taiwan, the ROC Defense Ministry will support it fully.</P>
      <P>Tang said the ROC has been assessing the feasibility of joining
the TMD system from the points of view of technology, cost and
benefits, as well as possible sources of finance for the project.</P>
      <P>When the assessment has been completed, he said, it will be
submitted to the Legislative Yuan and the government.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that the armed forces began studying the TMD issue in
1996, and currently consider it appropriate for the ROC to join a
"lower-altitude" defense system, the technical requirements of which
are already well-developed.</P>
      <P>Further study is required on whether to join the
"higher-altitude" TMD defense system, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, new Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi
criticized Beijing for its opposition to the TMD plan, saying that it
is mainland China's military threat that prompted the United States
to come up with the plan in the first place.</P>
      <P>The TMD system would not have appeared in East Asia, he said, if
mainland China had not engaged in rapid military modernization,
posing a threat to Taiwan and the entire East Asian region.</P>

      <P>Newly appointed Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Chairman Su Chi on Monday reiterated Taipei's welcome to a
visit to Taiwan by the mainland's top negotiator with the island.</P>
      <P>"Our stance on the matter has not changed, that is, it would be
better for Wang to come (to Taiwan) than not, and the sooner the
better," Su said at a press conference held immediately after his
swearing-in.</P>
      <P>Wang, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), promised during a meeting in
Shanghai last October with his Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu, to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su said that he hopes the leaders of both sides' intermediary
bodies can meet in a "totally free atmosphere" with no preconceived
agenda or topics for discussion.</P>
      <P>Su, formerly deputy secretary-general to President Lee Teng-hui,
stressed the need for Taiwan to maintain flexibility as far as its
mainland policy is concerned.</P>
      <P>"There is neither a hawkish nor a dovish stance on the issue," he
said, adding: "We just want to keep our policy flexible to cope with
any eventuality."</P>
      <P>On the development of Taiwan-mainland relations, Su, who once
served as MAC deputy chief, predicted that the imminent changes in
both the regional economy and the mainland's situation will be
crucial to future relations between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>He stressed the need for dialogue and exchanges between the two
sides in order for a stable development of cross-strait ties. "We
should not allow the uncertainty of cross-strait ties during the past
three years to again take place," Su added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the SEF received a letter from ARATS re-extending its
invitation for an SEF deputy secretary-general to visit Beijing, and
said that it would "at the proper time" send one of its deputy
secretary-generals to Taipei for discussions in the run-up to Wang's

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Monday that he
has ordered the Ministry of Finance to work out a mechanism to ensure
the long-term stability of the bourse, following the day's 135-point
plunge of the weighted price index, the market's key barometer.</P>
      <P>Noting Taiwan's sound economic fundamentals in comparison with
those of its Southeast Asian neighbors, Siew said at the first press
conference after the swearing-in of his new Cabinet that market
forces are what ultimately decide whether the stock market rises or
falls.</P>
      <P>Siew cited the island's growth rate of 6.8 percent of 1997, and 5
percent in 1998, pointing out that the figures put Taiwan almost 11.6
percentage points ahead of South Korea, Japan, and the states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations for the last couple of years.</P>
      <P>Although psychological factors and investors'confidence may
affect the movement of the bourse in the short term, stock prices
will always mirror economical fundamentals in the long term, said the
premier who resigned on Jan. 21 to set a constitutional precedent and
was immediately re-appointed the next day.</P>
      <P>Declaring that economic reforms will soon be made out by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development under the Cabinet after
wide-ranging consultations with scholars and industrialists, Siew
said the new scheme will stimulate economic growth through fiscal,
financial, and business restructuring, as well as manpower training,
efficiency improvement, and the upgrading of productivity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Finance Paul Chiu said late on Monday that
an outline of the package demanded by the premier to boost the bourse
has already been settled.</P>
      <P>Refusing to disclose when the new measures will be ready, Chiu
said that his ministry still needs time to flesh out the package with
the purpose of revitalizing the flagging stock market without cutting

      <P>The rediscount rate will be reduced from 4.75 percent to 4.50

      <P>This is the fourth time the central bank has lowered the

enter the 2000 presidential race on the Kuomintang ticket, according
to a panel of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>One day after a Sunday poll which said that about 60 percent of
the public believe the 2000 presidential race will be a competition

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) on
Monday refuted allegations by Fortune magazine that it will probably
become the next economy to fall victim to the global financial storm.</P>
      <P>The CBC cited facts such as the island's balance of international
payment surplus, declining interest rates, sufficient self-owned
capital by local banks, and huge overseas assets, as the reasons that
it considers Taiwan unlikely to be engulfed by a financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>The leading US magazine said in its latest issue that although
Taiwan has emerged relatively unscathed from the Asian financial
crisis, but with a worsening economic situation which is evidenced by
financial institutions going bankrupt, it seems it will be difficult
for Taiwan to escape an imminent storm.</P>
      <P>CBC Deputy Governor Hsu Yi-hsiung said in a press statement that
Taiwan, like many other countries, saw a decline in its exports last
year. But Taiwan's exports are expected to gain momentum this year as
the economies of Japan and its neighbors, traditionally important
markets for Taiwan, gradually recover.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan will also continue to enjoy a surplus in its
balance of international payments, despite its shrinking exports.</P>
      <P>With regards to the island's financial system, Hsu said that
local banks generally have sufficient self-owned capital, enabling
them to shoulder risks. In addition, he added, those banks have
adopted a more cautious attitude towards lending to property
developers and stock investors.</P>
      <P>The huge overseas assets owned by Taiwan's banks, which totaled
US$128.2 billion last year, compared with their combined overseas
debts of only US$35.2 billion, will add to the island's ability to
guard against any financial disaster, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan has been able to maintain low commodity price
growth and an adequate money supply, substantially reducing the risk
of inflation.</P>
      <P>Hsu said forecasts by several foreign research institutes have
agreed that a recovery in the economies of Asian countries will give
a shot to the arm to Taiwan, allowing it to register moderate growth
for the coming years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILLING TO COOPERATE WITH MAINLAND IN NON-POLITICAL FIELDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Monday told Richard
Bush, visiting chairman of American Institute in Taiwan, that Taiwan
would like to cooperate with the mainland in some nonpolitical
fields.</P>
      <P>The two sides could cooperate in the fields of agriculture,
weather forecasting and other areas with little political
connotations, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Such cooperation will depend on the sincerity of the mainland,
the premier added, noting that the most thorny issue across the
Taiwan Strait concerns the ROC's participation in international
activity. He cited Beijing's reaction to the ROC's established ties
with the Macedonia Republic as an example.</P>
      <P>Another major issue is the mainland's continued military threat
against Taiwan, making the island's population think that the
mainland is hostile toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bush, who arrived here on Jan. 24 for a two-week visit,
congratulated Siew on his appointment to the premier's post again.
He also said that Taiwan and the United States, share common
interests and values.</P>
      <P>He said the US' policy to support Taiwan's bid to enter the World
Trade Organization remains unchanged, and the US would consult on
bilateral and multilateral trade issues with Taiwan. Bush said he
believed Taiwan has a chance to join the WTO this year.</P>
      <P>The AIT chairman also said the US would like to see a positive
development of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
He noted that the visit last year to the mainland by Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, was an ice-breaking trip
and a good beginning.</P>
      <P>In response, Siew said Taiwan has made every preparation for the
visit of Koo's mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, who promised to
visit the island during his meeting with Koo last October. But the
premier noted that there should not be any preconditions for the
visit.</P>
      <P>Siew also mentioned that the appointment of Su Chi as the
chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, which charters that
nation's mainland policy, does not mean that there will be any change
to Taipei's mainland policy. The decision to appoint Su to the post
was based on his long-term participation in the drafting of the
nation's mainland policy, as well as his expertise and experience in
mainland affairs.</P>
      <P>Bush made note that the Kuomintang's victory in elections last
December showed that most of the public supported the KMT's mainland
policy.</P>
      <P>The AIT official met with ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu earlier
in the day to exchange views on matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Hu said there is still room for the development of relations
between the ROC and the US, and that both sides could further
strengthen substantive relations this year, the 20th anniversary of
Taiwan Relations Act which provides a framework for Taipei-Washington
ties in the absence of diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Bush is scheduled to hold a news conference on Friday before his
scheduled departure from Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC OFFICIALS ARRIVE IN MACEDONIA TO SHORE UP TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A team of Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
officials arrived in the Macedonian capital of Skopje on Monday to
consolidate bilateral relations, ministry spokesman Roy Wu said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The team will meet with Macedonian officials on the opening of
our embassy in the southeastern European country," Wu said, adding
that the MOFA delegation will also discuss details concerning a
planned visit to Macedonia by ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu later
this month.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China established full diplomatic ties with
Macedonia on Jan. 27. A newspaper report said as Macedonian President
Kiro Gligorov continues to oppose the establishment of official links
with Taiwan, the future ROC ambassador to Macedonia may not be able
to take part in diplomatic activities there in his official capacity.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the future ROC ambassador may have to
use the title of "charge d'affaires" while participating in
diplomatic activities in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Wu said it was still too early to
discuss such an issue.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Lee said last week that even though
the Macedonian president does not support the newly forged
ROC-Macedonian diplomatic ties, he cannot veto the decision made by
his country's prime minister and Cabinet.</P>
      <P>A CNA report from New York said Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georievski is scheduled to issue a formal statement on the
establishment of ROC-Macedonian diplomatic relations in Washington,
D.C. on Friday.</P>
      <P>Georievski was quoted as saying upon his arrival in New York on
Sunday that his country's decision to establish diplomatic ties with
the ROC remains unchanged. Nevertheless, he would not go into detail.</P>
      <P>"Please wait for a few days. We'll explain details about
the issue. By then, we hope news media in all major countries
around the world will give extensive reports on the event,"
Georievski told a group of Taiwan journalists covering his arrival
in New York.</P>
      <P>Georievski is scheduled to visit the United Nations headquarters
on Tuesday to meet with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He will then
travel to Washington, D.C. later in the day to start an official
visit.</P>
      <P>Macedonia, a former Yugoslavia state, gained independence in 1991
and was admitted to the UN in 1993. It forged diplomatic ties with
mainland China in October 1993, but Beijing has threatened to sever
their relationship after Macedonia diplomatically recognized the ROC
last week.</P>
      <P>Macedonia is the only former Yugoslavian state that has not
suffered from war and chaos after becoming independent.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is a high possibility of a major
influenza outbreak this year, an official from the Department of
Health (DOH) warned on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tu Hsing-tze, the director of the Bureau of Communicable Disease
Control under the DOH, said that last week alone, the number of
reported cases of acute respiratory infection topped 183,000. The
figure is similar to one reported in the peak week of a 1997-1998
outbreak.</P>
      <P>Tu noted that the influenza virus is able to mutate so rapidly
over the course of a single year that antibodies produced by the body
against the previous year's vaccine become largely ineffective the
following year.</P>
      <P>Tu noted that 1968-1969, 1978-1979, and 1988 saw major outbreaks
of influenza, and pointed out that Taiwan is now entering the crucial
period of what can be seen as a 10-year cycle of outbreaks. He warned
that the outbreak could begin before the Chinese New Year holiday,
which falls on Feb. 16, and last until mid-March, because of the
warmer-than-usual winter weather.</P>
      <P>He also warned in particular that the hustle and bustle of crowds
during the holiday, and the annual mass migration of people traveling
all over the island to be with their families, could fuel an
outbreak, and advised the public, especially the old and the young,
against going to public places where there are likely to be large
crowds.</P>

      <P>Seven fishermen from mainland China were
rescued and six others were still unaccounted for after their fishing
vessel was rammed by a Hong Kong freighter off the Penghu archipelago
in the Taiwan Strait, police said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Police said that the freighter rammed the mainland ship at around
10 p.m. on Monday, causing the boat to sink.</P>
      <P>Chen Junyi, captain of the fishing boat, said his ship was
heading toward a sheltered bay to avoid rough conditions when the
accident took place, and that most of his crew were asleep at the
time.</P>
      <P>Chen and six others were rescued by the Hsin Hung Ming, a Taiwan
fishing vessel which was operating in the vicinity.</P>
      <P>Liu Yin-bin, captain of the Hsin Hung Ming, said he gave chase

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A wave of bombings and widespread protests
in mainland China has sent a warning signal to Beijing officials that
an economic slump and surging unemployment pose a threat to social
and political stability.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday
said there have been eight reported bombings in the last month as
frustration appears to be mounting over economic hardship and rampant
government corruption.</P>
      <P>The fatal bombings are particularly difficult to stop as
explosives are easily available in a country with thousands of mines
and sprawling military industries, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Chinese authorities have also been confronted with persistent
demonstrations in many major cities and towns as unemployed workers,
retirees and heavily taxed peasants take to the streets.</P>
      <P>Crime appears to be soaring in many bigger cities as jobless
workers move in from the countryside or provinces.</P>
      <P>Late January, an explosion on a stretch of the Beijing-Guangzhou
railway line damaged tracks. On Jan. 17 workers were blamed for a bus
blast which left 37 passengers injured in Changsha, the capital of
Hunan Province. Meanwhile, 19 passengers were killed in Liaoning
province on Jan. 8 during a robbery attempt in which bombs were
exploded.</P>
      <P>In one of the major protests reported this year, about 5,000
farmers in Hunan province clashed with police and military troops on
Jan. 8, leaving one person dead and about 100 injured, according to a
human rights group in Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIA, MAINLAND CHINA NO GREAT THREAT TO US SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While serious military threat to US
security has diminished dramatically since the end of the Cold War,
both Russia and mainland China should be closely watched, according
to a policy analysis by a Washington think tank.</P>
      <P>Ivan Eland, director of defense policy studies at the Cato
Institute, wrote Monday in an analysis titled "Tilting at Windmills:
Post-Cold War Military Threats to US Security" that the threat from
conventional Russian military forces has all but disintegrated and
would take many years to reconstitute.</P>
      <P>"China would take 20 to 30 years to transform its bloated and
obsolete military into a major threat to US vital interests. The
militaries in both nations should be watched, but they may never
develop into credible threats," noted Eland.</P>
      <P>In addition, the US government tends to overstate regional
threats (for example, Iraq and North Korea) because it still sees
them through Cold War lenses, the director said. A rival superpower
no longer exists to back surrogates or to exploit potential regional
conflicts. There is no longer any danger that Middle East oil or the
Korean peninsula will be controlled by the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Before the Persian Gulf War, prominent economists across the
political spectrum noted that the small costs (in higher oil prices)
to the US economy of Saudi Arabia's potential fall to Iraq did not
warrant American military action.</P>
      <P>Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Persian Gulf states have combined
economies that greatly exceed those of the weakened Iraq or Iran.
Likewise, South Korea's economy surpasses that of North Korea. Those
nations can afford to defend themselves and should be weaned from US
protection, added Eland.</P>
      <P>One threat that is becoming more severe in the post-Cold War
world is the proliferation of chemical, biological, nuclear and
missile technology. The probability of a retaliatory strike on the US
homeland by rogue states or terrorist groups using such weapons,
however, can be reduced by ending unneeded and provocative US
military intervention abroad, concluded the policy analysis.

      <P>Inaction in many countries to fight the

action plan should not be taken to imply that countries will be fully

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSC) is
planning to expand into the field of manufacturing machine tools,
with an eye on diversifying its business operations, a company
official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tan Tai-pin, deputy general manager of CSC's Kaohsiung shipyard,
said that because both domestic and foreign shipbuilding markets have
experienced a sharp decline in recent years, average shipbuilding
prices have dropped about 20 percent.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, he went on, customers who have made 10
percent down payments might be reluctant to pay installments on their
purchases due to the continuing sluggish pricing market.</P>
      <P>Tan said that CSC faces increasing pressure from shipbuilding
companies in Japan and South Korea which are cutting prices in order
to win contracts. Competition is also especially strong from mainland
China, which has experienced rapid growth in the development of its
shipbuilding industry, he said.</P>
      <P>CSC's Kaohsiung Shipyard officials feel that plans by the local
petrochemical industry to further develop naphtha cracking plants and

    <HEADLINE>FPG APOLOGIZES TO KAOHSIUNG COUNTY RESIDENTS OVER TOXIC WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) on Tuesday
made a public apology to the residents of southern Kaohsiung County
for dumping more than 10,000 tons of mercury-laced industrial waste
in local landfills.</P>
      <P>FPG Vice Chairman Wang Chin-shu and General Manager Lee Chih-tsun
openly apologized to Kaohsiung County Chief Yu Cheng-hsien for the
incident and promised that FPG will ship all the mercury-laced waste
produced in its Jenwu and Chienchen plants -- both located in
Kaohsiung County -- to advanced Western countries for proper
disposal.</P>
      <P>A further 2,700 tons of the FPG waste which was shipped by a
Taiwan contractor to an open dump in Cambodia will also be
transported to Europe or America for processing, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Foreign news reports in November that toxic waste had been dumped
in the impoverished Southeast Asian country provoked a wave of panic
among the people living near the dump.</P>
      <P>FPG, working through Kuomintang lawmaker Tseng Chen-nung, who
maintains close contacts with the Cambodian government, agreed to
ship the waste back to Taiwan until alternative plans could be made
to dispose of the waste. The company is Taiwan's largest
petrochemical producer.</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's remarks, Ting Shan-lung, head of Kaohsiung
County's Environmental Protection Bureau, pointed out that about
1,300 tons of the more than 18,000 tons of mercury-laced waste
produced by FPG's Chienchen plant are still stored within the plant
compound.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the amount is not that high, Lee said that this
waste will also be shipped to advanced countries for handling.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside Lee's explanation, another Kaohsiung County
councilor demanded that FPG remove the more than 10,000 tons of
mercury-laced waste currently buried in nearby landfills, in order to
protect the health of local residents.</P>
      <P>Since the public remains skeptical about FPG's sincerity in
handling its waste, the Kaohsiung County Environmental Protection
Bureau has requested the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration carry out tests on the industrial waste buried in
three landfills within its jurisdiction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPS GROUP TO INVEST OVER NT$10 MILLION IN TAIWAN'S ERP MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Holland-based Origin Technology Inc. is to
invest over NT$10 million in its Taiwan subsidiary for its
specialized "Enterprise Resource Plan" (ERP), with the aim of
providing its customers with the techniques for building up ERP
structures, global CEO Robert Pickering said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Pickering said the global market for ERP is growing, and added
that his company is anxious to grab the lion's share of Taiwan's
market. He described ERP as a system which integrates enterprises'
resources and allows the re-engineering of working processes, both of
which are helpful when an enterprise intends to open up its market
abroad.</P>
      <P>He predicted a 25 percent growth rate in the global ERP market,
and a 40 percent growth rate in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Origin Technology Inc., which has already spent over NT$10
million in Taiwan for a "solution center," is a subsidiary of the
Netherlands technology giant Philips. This year, Origin plans to
combine the solution center with the ERP to create a package that
covers services such as hardware, licensing, consultancy, and network
solutions for local small- and medium-sized enterprises wishing to
engage in on-line trading, said Pickering.</P>
      <P>The company will also design a special version of ERP that can be
applied to an enterprise with branches in Taiwan, Hong Kong and
mainland China, and which requires computer software that can
function using three different character types -- standard Chinese,
English, and mainland China's simplified Chinese characters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the company's CEO for the Greater China region, Lee
Lian-yo, added that Origin will continue to invest in Taiwan to
facilitate local enterprises wishing to expand their businesses into
global markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW MAC CHIEF CALLS FOR END TO ZERO-SUM CROSS-STRAIT DIPLOMATIC WAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The diplomatic competition between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait is a tough battle, the Republic of China's
new chief mainland China policy planner said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We do not like engaging in a `zero-sum' diplomatic war with
mainland China. But if Beijing continues to adopt this strategy, we
can but follow suit," said Su Chi, newly appointed chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Su, a former deputy secretary-general to President Lee Teng-hui,
said the ROC must maintain bilateral and multilateral relations with
other countries to sustain its survival and development.</P>
      <P>Noting that military and diplomatic issues are the thorniest
cross-strait problems, Su said they are also the fields most prone to
conflict.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the ROC has long adopted a defensive military
deployment strategy and a "win-win" policy toward diplomatic issues.
"However, mainland China has continued its military threat to Taiwan
and has even intensified its diplomatic strangulation strategy
against us," he noted.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned-official further said mainland China's
recalcitrant, hegemonic attitude is not only detrimental to the
development of cross-strait relations, it has also triggered a
backlash from the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on mainland China's strong reaction toward the recent
establishment of diplomatic ties between the ROC and Macedonia, Su
said the ROC has applied its "win-win" policy to the issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macedonia currently maintains diplomatic ties with
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Su said the ROC does not care
whether or not its diplomatic allies adopt a "dual recognition"
policy toward the two sides of the strait. "Nor do we care whether or
not our allies sever their diplomatic relations with mainland China
after they forge official links with us," he went on.</P>
      <P>"We hope to make friends with all countries around the world. In
this post-Cold War era, we hope mainland China will not block any
country from making friends with us," Su stressed.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait exchanges, the new MAC chief said that
exchanges of visits by top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
will become a reality "when the time and atmosphere are ripe."</P>
      <P>"If Wang Daohan, mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan, can
visit Taiwan smoothly this year, it will help cultivate an
environment conducive to further high-level cross-strait exchanges,"
Su said.</P>
      <P>Wang, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), agreed to make a reciprocal visit
to Taiwan when he met with his Taiwan counterpart, Chairman Koo
Chen-fu of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), in Shanghai last
October.</P>
      <P>"Last year's Koo-Wang meeting marked the opening of constructive
cross-strait dialogue. We hope Wang's planned visit to Taiwan this
year will continue this trend and help pave the way for a resumption
of systemic SEF-ARATS dialogue and consultations," Su said.</P>
      <P>As for the agenda for the planned Koo-Wang meeting in Taipei, Su
declined to speculate, saying that now is not the right time to make
any predictions on such topics.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he pointed out some of the many practical issues
which exist between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, such as the
personal safety of Taiwan business people on the mainland, fishery
disputes, and cross-strait drug and firearm trafficking.</P>
      <P>Su said mainland China should not force the ROC to accept its
"one China" concept.</P>
      <P>"Beijing should face up to the reality that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are now ruled by two separate governments," Su said,
adding that it is the ROC's consistent stand that each side should be
allowed to maintain its own definition of "one China" prior to
eventual unification.</P>
      <P>Su further said that if mainland China can accept Taiwan's stance
on the "one China" principle, many cross-strait issues can be
resolved more easily.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a proposal that Taipei, Beijing and Washington form
an unofficial "second track" dialogue channel to strengthen contact
and communication, Su pointed out that such informal dialogue
channels have long existed.</P>
      <P>"We do not oppose the formation of informal
Taipei-Washington-Beijing dialogue channels. What is most important
is that such informal channels should never replace the legally
authorized `first track' dialogue channel," Su stressed.</P>
      <P>The "second track" dialogue channel was first broached by a group
of retired officials and academics from the United States, Taiwan and
mainland China. Their informal three-way contacts actually increased
the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will propose a
plan to promote the local bourse on Feb. 10, the final day of stock
market trading before the Lunar New Year holiday, Vice Finance
Minister Yen Ching-chang said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The plan will include the normalization of parent and subsidiary
companies' mutual holding of each other's shares and consolidated
financial reports. It will also encourage individual stock
investors to hold on to their shares on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>However, the MOF denied that it will cut or exempt taxes on those
long-term stockholders.</P>
      <P>The local bourse has been in the doldrums recently, and some
industrial and commercial groups have proposed exemptions or cuts in
securities transaction taxes for two years to prop up the market.</P>
      <P>However, the Cabinet and the MOF are opposed to any such moves,
and Premier Vincent Siew has instructed the MOF to map out an
alternative medium- and long-term plan to safeguard the sagging
market.</P>
      <P>The timing of the plan's announcement will coincide with the
withdrawal of the stock market stabilizing task force which was
established recently as a short-term measure to prop up the bourse.</P>
      <P>Yen said the plan will emphasize ways to maintain medium- and
long-term stabilization of the local bourse, and to ensure the sound
development of the island's capital market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MYOPIA RATE WORLD'S HIGHEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As many as 85 percent of Taiwan's high
school students and 90 percent of its college students are
nearsighted, figures high enough to give Taiwan the sobriquet "the
island of myopia," a leading local ophthalmologist said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has the highest number of nearsighted people relative to
its overall population in the world, as well as the highest
percentage of people with advanced myopia, said Dr. Lin Lung-kuang of
National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>Nineteen percent of the people in Taiwan who are nearsighted
suffer from advanced myopia, compared with about 2 percent of
populations in Europe and the United States, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>According to a report in the latest issue of Health Magazine, the
number of young people in Taiwan who are nearsighted is increasing
more rapidly than in the past.</P>
      <P>In 1996 12 percent of first graders in Taiwan were myopic,
against 3 percent in a similar poll 10 years earlier, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>Seventy-five percent of junior high school students in Taiwan, 85
percent of high school students and 90 percent of students in
colleges and universities are nearsighted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's myopia levels are higher than those of Japan or
Singapore, two countries generally considered to have more myopic
people, the report noted.</P>
      <P>Dr. Lin, meanwhile, noted that in Taiwan people are developing
myopia at an earlier age, the number of people with myopia is
increasing and more people are developing advanced myopia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's staggering myopia levels are the result of parents
having children read and write at too early an age, he said. The
longer a person goes without developing myopia, the less severe the
condition is likely to be, so it is especially important to ensure
people do not develop myopia as children, he said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the seriousness of Taiwan's myopia problem,
Department of Health Director-General Chan Chi-shean said that
beginning this year, eyesight examinations will be given to students
in kindergartens islandwide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GOLF CLUB MAKERS DENY COUNTERFEITING CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   2  (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwan golf club manufacturing
firms denied on Tuesday that they had counterfeited US brand-named
golf equipment.</P>
      <P>Tourney Golf Co. and Join Wee International Co. made the denial
after three of their staff members were arrested by US customs
agents on Monday when they were attending a trade fair in Orlando,
Florida.</P>
      <P>The US Customs Service announced on Monday its agents had
arrested six golf club distributors and four manufacturers who
allegedly sold millions of dollars in counterfeit golf equipment.</P>
      <P>Among the arrested suspects were Midi Cheng of Tourney Golf and
Ben Liao and David Lioa of Join Wee International.</P>
      <P>Tourney Gold said Midi Liu, a saleman, went to the United States
last week to attend the Orlando professional golf equipment trade
fair and to negotiate some export deals.</P>
      <P>A company spokesman said Tourney Golf has not produced any
brand-named golf equipment on an OEM (original equipment
manufacturing) basis. "We couldn't understand why Liu was arrested,"
he complained.</P>
      <P>Bei Liao and David Liao are brothers and their father is head
of Join Wee International. A company spokesman said Join Wee has
produced golf equipment on an OEM basis and has not produced any
counterfeit goods.</P>
      <P>Both Tourney Golf and Join Wee International denied the
counterfeit charges and have asked the government to assist them in
resolving the issue.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, the arrests by US
customs agents in Orlando, Atlanta, Houston and Savannah, Georiga,
followed an undercover investigation, dubbed ``Project Teed Off,'' in
which agents posed as importers for two major counterfeit golf club
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>US agents made 303 seizures of phony golf equipment worth US$6
million during the two-year investigation, which was initiated at the
request of the golf equipment industry. The arrests were timed to
coincide with the US Professional Golf Association's Merchandise Show
being held this week in Orlando.</P>
      <P>"We were aware of a counterfeiting problem in the golfing
industry and we attempted to infiltrate the underground, the
counterfeit component," said Joe Henderson, an agent in charge of
the US Customs Service's Orlando office.</P>
      <P>The investigation focused on fake US brand-name golf equipment
made in Taiwan, mainland China, Vietnam and Thailand. Investigators
said the majority of counterfeit golf club parts in the United States
are imported into the country, sold to a group of distributors and
resold to retailers. Some distributors also had their own retail
outlets and some of the sales were made by mail orders or over the
Internet.</P>
      <P>The counterfeit golf clubs were sold for a third of the price of
the real product, agents said.</P>
      <P>The distributors arrested were Andrew Lee and Oscar Gonzales in
Houston; Mike Cohen and Rob Isola in Savannah, Georgia and Albert and
Angie Chung in Atlanta. Two distributors in Los Angeles were still at
large.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers arrested in Orlando were Midi Liu, owner of
Tourney Golf in Taiwan; Ben Liao, and his brother David, whose
father owns Join Wee International, a Taiwanese golf manufacturer;
and Stephen Cheng, of Los Angeles. Cheng was released on a US$50,000
bond. The three others were being held in federal custody.</P>

      <P>He politely acknowledged the view of DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung,
who said to Bush that Taiwan is an independent sovereign state whose
application for membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
should be processed separately from that of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province, has

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROCSAT-1, Taiwan's first wholly owned and
operated satellite, is functioning normally and has passed over
Taiwan 40 times since it was put into orbit on Jan. 26, the National
Science Council (NSC) of the Republic of China reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>NSC officials involved in Taiwan's space program said that the
satellite has so far orbited Earth 89 times. Five days after its
launch the satellite began using its solar panels to collect energy
from the Sun to power itself.</P>
      <P>The NSC's space center in Hsinchu is making adjustments to
ROCSAT-1's orbit as operators prepare the satellite to begin
conducting scientific experiments.</P>
      <P>Chu Fei-hung, head of Taiwan's ROCSAT-1 project, said on Tuesday
that all research-related trials will be completed by the end of
March. ROCSAT-1 will then begin to collect data on the effects of
ionosphere plasma electrodynamics, take pictures of various oceans,
and perform a variety of communications-related experiments.</P>
      <P>The research satellite has 72 kilograms of fuel, enough to
operate under normal conditions for four years, two years longer than
originally planned, Chu said.</P>
      <P>At the space center, located in the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park, a total of 120 technological experts, grouped into
three task forces, are monitoring ROCSAT-1.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-1's successful launch, which indicates the ROC's advanced
satellite-manufacturing ability, is expected to bolster the island's
development of high-tech industries and attract foreign buyers to
Taiwan-made satellite components.</P>
      <P>The launch marks a new era in the ROC's scientific research and

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking official with the Republic of
China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday denied a press report that Taiwan
has been excluded from the US-proposed theater missile defense (TMD)
system.</P>
      <P>The press report allegedly claimed that a report prepared by the
US Department of Defense has reached a conclusion that "Taiwan is in
no condition to take part in the TMD system."</P>
      <P>The ROC official said that the press report was incorrect. But he
said Taiwan is not in a position to comment as the US Defense
Department's assessment on the TMD issue would be sent to the US
Congress in one or two days and has not been made public yet.</P>
      <P>The official also denied another press report that former US
Assistance Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman made a secret visit
to Taiwan recently to invite Taiwan to participate in the TMD system.</P>
      <P>He said the Taipei visit by Freeman and three other scholars was
in connection with a study on how Asia's political and military
landscape will look in the year 2025. That study will be used to help
the United States map out a middle- and long-term defense plan, and

      <P>The official acknowledged that Freeman and his party did hold
talks, arranged by the American Institute in Taiwan, with some ROC
government leaders.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan the US group also visited mainland China,
Japan and South Korea. That shows the purpose of their visit was not
to invite Taiwan to join the TMD system as reported by some media, he
said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has been assessing the feasibility of
joining the US-initiated TMD system. Newly appointed Defense Minister
Tang Fei said on Monday that if a better means than Taiwan's
participation in the TMD system can be found to reduce the military
threat posed by mainland China to Taiwan, then the ministry would
fully support such measures.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chia Lee, a former Tokyo bureau chief of the
Central News Agency, died of an illness in the United States in
December last year. He was 81.</P>
      <P>Lee's friends in Taiwan will attend a memorial service at CNA's
head office on the morning of Feb. 6 to remember the outstanding
journalist and writer.</P>
      <P>Lee joined CNA in 1947 and was the first Chinese reporter to
cover the Korean War in 1950.</P>
      <P>His wife Topaz said in an interview that her husband was a "loyal
journalist," and that was why he turned down several invitations to
serve the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was fluent in Chinese, Japanese and English, worked for
CNA's Tokyo bureau for three decades. In 1963 he served as president
of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan.</P>
      <P>In 1988 Lee underwent a successful operation in Taipei to treat
prostate cancer. In 1991 Lee and his wife left Japan to stay in the

    <HEADLINE>COAST GUARD COMMAND LOOKING INTO GROUPING OF UNIDENTIFIED BOATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Command (CGC) is closely
watching the recent convergence into Republic of China waters of
unidentified vessels, and will continue to monitor the development
for reasons of national security, CGC sources reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a formal statement released Tuesday, CGC said that over the
past month, many unidentified boats, most of which are believed to be
of mainland Chinese origin, have converged in the waters off Penghu
in southwestern Taiwan and off Miaoli in northern Taiwan. Officials
said the boats had likely entered ROC waters to seek refuge from bad
weather at sea.</P>
      <P>Starting 2 a.m. Tuesday the vessels began to converge on Penghu
and Miaoli. By 6 p.m. that same day, 61 boats had entered the Penghu
area -- only 0.2 nautical miles from Penghu's Kupuoyu, while four
others were anchored 1.2 nautical miles from Miaoli.</P>
      <P>As has been the case during the past month, ROC marine police
have been ordered to take a hands-off approach to the encroachment
and, for humanitarian reasons, to allow the boats to seek shelter in
ROC waters.</P>
      <P>CGC officials said the boats will be ordered to leave as soon as
the weather clears up, adding that they will closely monitor the
boats in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The vessels' classification, characteristics, sailing routes and
operations are being studied and analyzed, as are relevant weather
factors, to ensure Taiwan's continued national security, officials
said.</P>
      <P>Mainland fishing boats constantly sail across the demarcation
line dividing the Republic of China and the People's Republic of
China to fish in defiance of ROC warnings. The incursions have
seriously endangered Taiwan's security and local fishermen's
livelihoods, CGC officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT APPROVES GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET REQUEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2. (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui gave a green light
Tuesday to the government's budget for the fiscal year running from
July of this year to June, 2000, clearing the way for the Executive
Yuan to present it to the legislature for approval.</P>
      <P>The budget, which contains expenditures totaling NT$2.25 trillion
(US$70.03 billion) and revenue of NT$1.94 trillion (US$60.31), has a
deficit of NT$313.2 billion (US$9.72 billion). The government must
also pay a total of NT$193.4 billion (US$6 billion) over the next
fiscal year to service its existing debt, which means it must raise
an extra NT$506.6 billion (US$15.73 billion) through loans.</P>
      <P>In explaining to President Lee the preparation of the budget, Wei
Duan, director-general of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under the
Executive Yuan, said the government's outstanding debts account for
22.1 percent of the country's gross national product (GNP).</P>
      <P>Specifically, central government debts accounts for 15 percent of
Taiwan's GNP, while local government debts account for 7 percent.
Taiwan's overall debt level relative to its GNP is relatively healthy
compared with other countries, he said.</P>
      <P>The budget counts on NT$140 billion (US$4.34) in income being
generated through stock transaction taxes. This virtually rules out
the possibility of phasing out the tax to reinvigorate Taiwan's
flagging bourse.</P>
      <P>Given the widening budget deficit, Wei said there is no
possibility of a pay hike for public employees during the next fiscal
year. A decision on the matter will be announced by Premier Vincent
Siew at the end of February when he formally passes the budget on to
the legislature.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Last year was a bleak one for all Taiwan
airlines because of a variety of factors, sources from the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Domestic and international carriers in Taiwan suffered declines
in both the number of flights made and in passenger loads in 1998,
mainly because of an economic slump and a series of air disasters,
CAA officials noted.</P>
      <P>Domestic airlines conducted 250,000 flights last year, averaging
684 flights per day, a decline of 12.82 percent from year-earlier
levels.</P>
      <P>The number of seats available on flights by all Taiwan airlines
last year totaled 25.98 million, a year-on-year decline of 7.13
percent. The total number of passengers carried on those flights,
however, totaled only 16.67 million, or an average of 45,672
passengers per day. That figure is down 10.41 percent from
year-earlier levels, according to CAA tallies.</P>
      <P>Passenger loads dropped 2.34 percentage points from 1997 levels
to 64.16 percent. Only those air routes connecting Taiwan and the
offshore islands of Green Island, Lanyu, Penghu and Matsu, maintained
average passenger loads of 75 percent or greater.</P>
      <P>CAA officials attributed the sluggishness suffered by airlines in
1998 to the region's economic slowdown, a series of crashes that
began last February, and an islandwide enterovirus outbreak that
begain in the spring, an strike by pilots with Transasia Airways.</P>
      <P>Other factors included a spate of mechanical problems faced by
UNI Airlines, the financial crisis of U-Land Airlines and
insufficient ground facilities at aiports in Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vasil Tupurkovski, head of the Macedonian
government agency responsible for reconstruction and development, has
said that a large Republic of China delegation will visit Macedonia
in March for discussions on trade and economic cooperation between
the two allies.</P>
      <P>Tupurkovski mentioned the visit in an interview with a Macedonia
daily. He accompanied Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov on a trip
to Taiwan last month to forge formal relations with the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Tupurkovski said the visit will allow the two countries to
evaluate potential Taipei-Skopje cooperation projects. He said an
agreement by the Republic of China to help Macedonia with trade and
economic cooperation was an essential element in discussions that led
to the countries forging diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>He said through the cooperation his country is expected to obtain
benefits that can help Macedonia's financial balance for four years,
while annual technological assistance worth US$3 million is expected
from the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's annual exports to the European Union as a whole reached
US$40 billion, Tupurkovski said, stressing that if as little as 5
percent of that amount was processed in or shipped through Macedonia,
his country could earn a fortune.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIES WITH ROC ARE BIG FINANCIAL STEP FORWARD FOR MACEDONIA: PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of formal diplomatic ties
between Macedonia and the Republic of China represents a giant step
forward for Macedonia in its financial and business development, said
a leading Macedonian newspaper on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Macedonian Diary gave a thumbs-up to the new Taipei-Skopje
ties, saying it has ushered Macedonia into a new era financially and
commercially, according to Chi Wang-teh, the ROC diplomatic attache
in Skopje who is keeping Taiwan abreast of the latest reactions in
Macedonia regarding the ties.</P>
      <P>Chi arrived in the Macedonian capital of Skopje Monday to prepare
for Taipei's opening of an embassy there. The Republic of China and
Macedonia forged formal diplomatic relations on Jan. 27. Chi will
also begin making arrangements for a visit at the end of this month
by ROC Foreign Minster Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>Chi quoted The Macedonian Diary as reporting that Macedonia's
decision to establish formal ties with the Republic of China was not
made with the aim of bringing money into the eastern European
country, nor was it intended as a snub to mainland China. The
newspaper, however, said Beijing's opposition to the Taipei-Skopje
ties is understandable.</P>
      <P>According to another Macedonian newspaper, The Macedonia Today,
some lawmakers from opposition parties are said to voice strong
opposition to the move in new parliamentary sessions. They said they
will publish the telephone numbers of various Macedonian officials
involved in the decision so that the public can contact them to
express their disapproval.</P>
      <P>A leading Macedonian political commentator, however, said formal
ties with the Republic of China is not harmful to Macedonia, and
"there is no foundation for negative reactions," according to the
newspaper.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Professor Skaric, a constitutional authority in
Macedonia, suggested that Macedonia and the Republic of China form a
confederation for even closer ties, Chi said.</P>
      <P>Chi quoted another report as suggesting that Macedonia should
remain firm in its resolve to establish full relations with the
Republic of China. Otherwise, it may follow in the footsteps of
Latvia, which initially attempted to establish relations but
ultimately abandoned that attempt. If that were to happen to
Macedonia, it could create bad feelings, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE GANGS FLOOD CANADA WITH HUMAN CARGO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada has become a prime target for
mainland Chinese gangs trying to funnel illegal immigrants into the
United States in what is fast becoming a multi-million-dollar
operation, a major Canadian newspaper reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail quoted official sources as saying that last
year, 1,365 mainland Chinese nationals were arrested trying to enter
Canada illegally -- and the number who succeeded in entering
undetected is many times higher.</P>
      <P>The discovery on Sunday of four mainland Chinese women wedged
under a fish truck preparing to cross from Ontario into New York
state was "a small but newsworthy example of the growing trade in
smuggled humans that has developed in Canada," according to the
daily.</P>
      <P>It quoted Canadian government sources as saying most of the
illegal immigrants pass through a lucrative, highly developed
international pipeline run by professional criminals, many with links
to triads, mainland China's brutal equivalent to the Mafia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has become part of the "international pipeline," according
to the report. It noted that the illegals are usually sent by boat
from Fujian to Taiwan, "where they are given forged passports and
visas, then flown to South America or Europe." Paris has become one
of the most popular stopover spots, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>They then board a flight to Canada. Most often, the newcomers
arrive in Toronto's Pearson Airport, where they present themselves as
refugees and ask for asylum. After making their refugee claim and
promising to appear for a hearing at a later date, they are released.</P>
      <P>The Mail quoted an immigration official as saying, "Many of these
people claim refugee status and then cross the border to the United
States soon after they enter." Government tallies show that the
number of abandoned or withdrawn refugee claims has soared in Canada,
from 126 in 1989 to 5,663 in 1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA EXTENDS ITS PAPERLESS VISA SYSTEM TO TAIWAN, HK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a move to lure more foreign tourists to
the country, the Australian government on Wednesday announced it
would expand its electronic travel authority (ETA) system to include
Taiwan and Hong Kong starting July 1.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to CNA, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock
said, "The ETA system has been a great success, with more than 70
percent of all visitors to Australia using the system."</P>
      <P>"In the lead-up to the introduction, officers of my department
will continue working with officials in Hong Kong and Taiwan on
administrative and technical issues,' he said.</P>
      <P>Tourists from mainland China, however, will still have to apply
for visas to visit Australia.</P>
      <P>"Tourism provides major economic benefits to Australia and the
continued expansion of the ETA system will considerably improve
Australia's ability to handle the expected increase in visitors,
particularly in the lead-up to the Olympic Games in the year 2000,"
Ruddock said.</P>
      <P>ETA entry is currently available to nationals of 29 countries,
including the United States, the United Kingdom, parts of Western
Europe, Singapore and Japan.</P>
      <P>The system makes it easier for tourists and short-term business
travelers to enter Australia.</P>
      <P>"It is important for genuine travelers to be able to take
advantage of this service but at the same time it is essential to
ensure that suitable measures are in place to ensure the security of
Australia's borders," Ruddock said.</P>
      <P>"In (fiscal) 1997-98 some 2.9 million visitors obtained visas to
travel to Australia on business or to take a holiday. Of these,
75,000 were issued to residents of Hong Kong and 140,000 residents of
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Tourist arrivals from Taiwan fell 2.2 percent to 129,299 between
January and October 1998 from a year earlier, and the number of Hong
Kong tourists dropped 6.7 percent to 118,864 during the same period,
according to the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC).</P>
      <P>An ATC spokesperson attributed the decline to the lingering
impact of the Asian financial crisis on the one hand and the
exclusion of Hong Kong and Taiwan from the ETA system on the other.</P>
      <P>Australian tourism promoters said the expansion of the ETA system
will definitely help boost the number of tourists from Taiwan and
Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>The number of civil servants in
provincial governments in mainland China will be cut by half,
according to a plan by Beijing to streamline the country's
bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong Standard reported Wednesday that the plan is to
take effect after the lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Premier Zhu Rongji last March launched a
three-year program to trim the army ranks of civil servants.
Personnel of the Central Government would be cut by at least
one-third under the plan.</P>
      <P>By the end of last year the streamlining of a new State Council
was almost completed, with the number of ministries reduced from 41
to 29, the report quoted sources as saying.</P>
      <P>The State Council, it noted, issued the circular on streamlining
several weeks ago, and provincial governments are expected to start
shedding staff members immediately after the lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>Half of the total number of provincial government staff members

      <P>Provinces were only allowed to make their own decisions on

    <HEADLINE>CIA DIRECTOR SAYS PLA'S MODERNIZATION PUSHES ON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a slowdown in economic growth,
mainland China is still actively pursuing its military modernization
program while seeking to prevent US intervention in the Taiwan
Strait, a top US intelligence official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"China's military modernization program continues apace despite
slowing economic growth," according to George Tenet, director of the
Central Intelligence Agency.</P>
      <P>Their efforts are assisted by sustained levels of defense
spending and by the availability of weapons and technologies from the
former Soviet bloc, he told the Senate Armed Forces Committee.</P>
      <P>Testifying on threats to US national security, Tenet said
mainland China is increasing the size and survivability of its
retaliatory nuclear force.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is, however, "unlikely to make the resource
commitment needed to approach the (nuclear) force levels either of
the United States or Russia," he added.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is also developing and acquiring air and naval
systems "intended to deter the United States from involvement in
Taiwan and to extend China's fighting capabilities beyond its
coastline," he said.</P>
      <P>"Although China does not want a conflict over Taiwan," the told
the senators, " it refuses to renounce the use of force as an option
and continues to place its best new military equipment opposite the
island."</P>
      <P>In his prepared testimony, Tenet described mainland China as "a
great power on the rise, diplomatically, militarily and
economically."</P>
      <P>He said mainland China has the potential to affect the United
States' security posture in Asia but said that "the extent to which
its ambitions and growing capabilities represent a challenge or
threat to US interests is still an open question."</P>
      <P>Despite having more favorable conditions than Russia, mainland
China's future is uncertain because of some domestic challenges, such
as doubts over sustained economic growth and labor and social unrest,
he said.</P>
      <P>During the hearing, the CIA director also talked about "regional
troublemakers" such as Iraq, North Korea, Iran, the Balkans and the
South Asian subcontinent.</P>
      <P>He said Russia is "increasingly unpredictable" in political terms
and that its worsening economic situation "affects all aspects of the
Russian scene."</P>
      <P>For example, Tenet said, Russia "has magnified the proliferation
threat across the board, as growing financial pressures raise
incentives to transfer sensitive technologies."</P>

    <HEADLINE>1999 KEY TO TAIWAN'S WTO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This is a key year for Taiwan's bid to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT)
Director-General Chen Ruey-long said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Canada and Hong Kong are currently the only two WTO members which
have not yet signed formal protocols with Taiwan on the island's
membership at the world trade regulatory body. However, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said it hoped to complete the signing by
the first half of this year, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He told CNA that Taiwan wishes to join the WTO as soon as
possible, preferably by 2000 when contracting parties will start a
fresh round of negotiations. The third WTO ministerial meeting,
slated for December in Seattle, will determine the timetable and how
new negotiations will be handled, he added.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan cannot enter the WTO by 2000, Taiwan may have to
conduct a new set of bilateral talks on its terms for joining the
Geneva-based organization with its contracting parties under new
requirements, MOEA officials warned.</P>
      <P>It is understood that relevant trade authorities have been
pushing up the schedule for the signing of a protocol with Canada on
Taiwan's WTO membership while seeking to persuade WTO's working party
to conclude all procedural issues in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan applied to join the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade,
WTO's predecessor, in January 1990. A total of 26 WTO contracting
parties voiced interest in holding two-way negotiations with Taiwan
on its terms for entry, 24 of which have clinched bilateral accords
with Taiwan on its membership at the world body which oversees global
trade.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, three international trade experts -- John Jackson,
Robert Hudec, and Deora Steger -- will visit Taiwan to help local
businesses familiarize themselves with WTO regulations in the face of
Taiwan's foreseeable entry to the trade organization.</P>
      <P>While here, they will take part in a seminar on international
trade at the Taipei International Convention Center on Friday,
according to Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEARLY 40 PERCENT OF TAIWAN PEOPLE HAVE HIGH BODY FAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of Taiwan residents polled
have a high level of body fat and about 90 percent do not know how to
measure their body fat, results of a recent survey on obesity showed.</P>
      <P>While people in Japan and the United States regularly check their
body fat rate as an index of whether they are obese or not, a
majority of people in Taiwan don't have a clear idea about the body
fat factor or they don't know how to have their body fat checked,
said Dr. Hsiao Tun-jen of Provincial Taoyuan Hospital.</P>
      <P>A recent poll of more than 6,000 adult residents in Taipei and
Kaohsiung cities found that 37 percent of the respondents have a high
level of body fat, while 67 percent don't know what body fat rate is,
and 55 percent said they didn't know that obesity equals a high body
fat rate.</P>
      <P>As many as 30 percent of those surveyed said they have tried to
control their weight. Of these, 86 percent chose to diet as a means
to cut weight, 61 percent chose exercise, 13 percent elected to fast,
and 7 percent used weight-control pills and medicine.</P>
      <P>In general, a man is overweight if his body fat rate exceeds 25
percent of his body weight, compared with 30 percent for women, Hsiao
noted.</P>
      <P>He stressed the importance of controlling one's body fat, citing
statistics that six out of 10 major causes of deaths in Taiwan last
year were related to obesity.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said the best way to control body fat is to exercise. He
recommended that people follow a 3-3-3 rule to get the best results
-- exercise at least three times a week, at least 30 minutes each
time, and exercise to a degree that your heart beats 130 times a
minute.</P>
      <P>In addition to exercise, Hsiao said a balanced diet is equally
important. A balanced diet involves controlling one's intake of sugar,
eating the right fat, drinking enough water, and consuming a
sufficient amount of fresh vegetables and fruit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CUSTOMS ARREST TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN FOR COUNTERFEIT GOLF CLUBS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least eight Taiwan businessmen were
among 12 people arrested in seven major US cities on Monday as a part
of a crack down on counterfeit brand-name golf equipment, customs
officials said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>From Taiwan are Midi Liu who heads Tourney Golf Co.; Ben Liao and
his brother David Liao of Join Wee International, a golf equipment
manufacturer; Albert Chung and his wife Angie Chung; and Andrew Lee.
Two additional Taiwanese were reportedly arrested but their
names were not released.</P>
      <P>Liu, and the Liao brothers were arrested in Orlando, Florida,
Chung and his wife were arrested in Atlanta, and Lee was arrested in
Houston, customs officials said. The remaining two were arrested in
Savannah, Georgia and Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Liu, who is believed to be a key figure in the counterfeit ring,
reportedly sold 10,500 brand-name golf clubs to Lee at a lower price
than the authentic clubs Lee purchased last year. Lee is accused of
selling these lower-priced clubs and passing them off as the real
brand.</P>
      <P>Customs officials said most of the phony golf equipment they
seized was made in Taiwan, mainland China, Vietnam and Thailand. The
contraband goods were then shipped to the United States and passed
off by involved distributors as well-known brands such as Calloway,
Taylor Made, Cobra, Titleist and Ping.</P>
      <P>Titleist and Cobra representatives were first alerted to the
counterfeit goods during a golf fair held in the US in 1996, during
which they discovered inauthentic goods carrying their brand name</P>
      <P>Two years ago, the US customs began an undercover investigation,
called "Project Teed Off," with customs agents posing as importers.</P>
      <P>The arrested suspects will be prosecuted on charges of
counterfeiting. According to US law, if they are found guilty, they
face a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a fine of US$2 million
or less.</P>
      <P>Officials with Taipei's representative office in Miami set off
for Orlando on Tuesday in the hopes of providing relevant assistance

    <HEADLINE>US PROSECUTOR DROPS CHARGES AGAINST TAIWAN PROFESSOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan professor, who was accused of
trying to steal technology trade secrets from a US drug company for
the Taipei-based Yuen Foong Paper Co., has cleared his name, his
lawyer said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"US prosecution authorities have dropped all criminal charges
against Chester Ho, a professor at Taiwan's National Chiao Tung
University," said William E. McDaniels, Ho's lawyer.</P>
      <P>According to McDaniels, US prosecutors filed an application with
a federal court in Philadelphia last Wednesday saying they would drop
all charges against Ho in connection with the Yuen Foong case to
uphold "judicial justice."</P>
      <P>US Federal Court Judge Stuart Dalzell issued a decree on Jan. 28
approving the prosecution's request.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the US prosecution maintains charges against two
Yuen Foong executives -- Hsu Kai-lo and Chou Hua-ping. They were
charged with attempted theft of technological secrets relating to the
anti-cancer drug Taxol belonging to New York-based Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co.</P>
      <P>A federal court in Pennsylvania is scheduled to hold a hearing on
Hsu and Chou's case on April 5. A grand jury, composed of 12 jurors,
will be present at the hearing and is expected to make a decision on
whether the two are guilty. If they are convicted, federal judges
will mete out sentences within 45 to 75 days.</P>
      <P>If convicted, Hsu faces a maximum jail term of 60 years and a
fine of up to US$2.5 million, while Chou could receive up to 55 years
plus a maximum US$1 million in fines. Chou, who is now in Taiwan,
would be arrested if she sets foot on US soil.</P>
      <P>Ho and Hsu were arrested by Philadelphia FBI agents upon their
arrival in the United States on June 14, 1997 on charges of
attempting to steal Taxol-related technological know-how.</P>
      <P>Ho has been living in Boston since he was released on US$1
million bail on June 19, 1997 and was forced to give up his US and
ROC passports and driver's license. Ho is now a visiting scholar at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Ho, also a technology broker, has reclaimed his passports and
driver's license after all six criminal charges against him were
dropped. He has yet to decide whether he will return to Taiwan to
continue his teaching career at National Chiao Tung University's
Graduate Institute of Biotechnology.</P>
      <P>Ho's lawyer said US prosecutors decided to drop charges against
Ho after a careful, comprehensive scrutiny of available evidence.</P>
      <P>"The prosecutor has done so purely out of the consideration of
upholding judicial justice. Ho has not struck any secret deals with
US prosecution in exchange for his vindication," McDaniels stressed.</P>
      <P>The "Taxol" case began in 1995 when an FBI agent, posing as a
technology broker, sought to mediate a deal related to Taxol
production expertise for Yuen Foong. Between 1995 and mid-1997, Yuen
Foong allegedly contacted the undercover FBI agent 135 times by
telephone or letter regarding the proposed deal.</P>
      <P>Yuen Foong has consistently denied FBI accusations that it
attempted to steal trade secrets from the US pharmaceutical company.
Noting that the proposed Taxol deal was a FBI set-up, Yuen Foong said
it had contacted the phony technology broker simply to gather
information to evaluate a Taxol-related investment project without
ever attempting to steal US trade secrets.</P>

      <P>Indonesia has ruled that Taiwan, Australia,

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Feb.  3 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
introduced a new rotation of cadres to promote honesty in government
and curb regionalism, the South China Morning Post reported on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, senior cadres have circulated a recent
dictum by Jiang on the "principle of the five lakes and four seas."
It refers to how officials, including those in the provinces, must
come from different geographical and "factional" backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The Post's report quoted a Beijing source as saying the
continuing rotation went deeper than previous exercises, which were
restricted to senior cadres such as provincial party chiefs and
governors.</P>
      <P>"This time, even mid-echelon cadres such as heads of counties are
affected," the paper said. "Before, Beijing usually allowed 'native
sons' to fill the positions of county chiefs."</P>
      <P>A PLA source also noted similarly thorough personnel changes were
taking place in the army, down to provincial and sometimes even
smaller military districts. The source said Jiang was playing a
personal role in both civilian and military reshuffles.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said the key concern among the Jiang
leadership was to boost the authority of the Communist Party amid
decentralization and potential social unrest.</P>
      <P>For example, Jiang recently approved a plan to tighten the
party's control over local-level people's congresses.</P>
      <P>The analysts said more provincial and municipal party secretaries
would double as the chairmen of people's congresses in their
provinces or cities. This was despite Jiang's recent instructions to
"run the country according to law".

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the success of the Philippines'
economic zones, the government is considering establishing 53
additional such sites to attract greater foreign investment and
revitalize the countryside and increase rural incomes.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a radio interview, Secretary Jose Pardo of the
Department of Trade and Industry said the zones will attract
businesses, provide jobs, boost home-based businesses as well as
micro-enterprises.</P>
      <P>Small- and medium-sized enterprises and housing projects will
emerge around these new growth centers, Pardo said, adding that he is
confident that these economic zones will be as successful as the
first 56.</P>
      <P>According to a recent survey conducted by the Makati Business
Club, the business community shares Pardo's positive outlook on the
economy.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 73.3 percent of the respondents expect
"strong or modest revenue growth" this year.</P>
      <P>The business community attributed the economy's stronger
performance on four factors: the lowering of interest rates, a
stabilized peso, the restoration of peace and order, and the
continuity of the reform programs initiated by the administration of

      <P>Tung Ting Oolong Tea from Taiwan has become
very popular among Moscow's artistic and literary set these days, a
vogue which just a year ago would have been unthinkable.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, Russians far prefer tea to coffee, but in the past
they have been accustomed to drinking black tea. This means that
promoting green tea in Russia is no easy task.</P>
      <P>However, ever since the owner of the Cosmopolitan Tea Shop in
Moscow began working to combine the art of green tea-drinking,
research into the I-Ching, or Book of Changes, the Chinese martial
art of Tai-chi, and the art of Chinese painting, into an all-round
interpretation of Chinese culture, it has become more than just a
pipe dream.</P>
      <P>The tea house, which is located in the vicinity of three of
Moscow's major theaters, has now become a haunt of the city's
literati.</P>
      <P>Within a year, several other clubs and restaurants have followed
the Cosmopolitan's lead, and business has become so brisk that

      <P>In view of the latest fad, tea merchants from mainland China have
been quick to make plans to market mainland green tea in Russia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CONTINUES TO FARE WELL IN REGION: BUSINESS TIMES EDITORIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan has steered clear of much
of the turmoil during Asia's economic crisis, there are signs its
economy could come under stress in the months ahead, the Business
Times said in an editorial on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a year which saw negative growth figures in other countries,
Taiwan achieved 5 percent growth in 1998, down from 6.8 percent in
1997 and the lowest in more than a decade.</P>
      <P>An increasing number of bounced checks, bad debt, and high
unemployment are worrying finance officials as key economic
indicators remain low. Exports, which account for more than 40
percent of Taiwan's economic output, are declining as its
cash-strapped Asian trading partners buy less. And the stock market
index has fallen to a 32-month low.</P>
      <P>The economic slowdown in Taiwan began in the second half of last
year as East Asia's economic crisis began to sap the Taiwanese
economy. Just before last December's parliamentary elections, the
Kuomintang government had to direct state-owned banks not to cut off
credit to those companies which faced short-term financial problems
and could not repay their loans.</P>
      <P>When it became known that several large firms were suffering
cash-flow problems, it caused jitters in the stock market and the
government set up an US$8 billion Stock Stabilization Fund to prop up
sagging shares prices. Taxes on business incomes have been cut to
help small- and medium-sized enterprises -- the backbone of Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>Despite these efforts, the economy is expected to revive only in
the second half of 1999 as the impact of these will take some time to
kick in.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew has set a 5.5 percent growth target for
1999. Private sector analysts are less sanguine, with most predicting
a figure of about 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not without its strengths. It has ample foreign
reserves of US$85 billion, little foreign debt, and like mainland
China, has tough capital controls which make it difficult for
speculators to attack its currency. Indeed, it was probably this
combination of factors that kept out the troubles faced by the other
East Asian economies in the first place.</P>
      <P>But there are a few clouds gathering on the political horizon
which could hurt the economy. Beijing seems to have raised the stakes
on the reunification issue.</P>
      <P>How the island's politicians manage this, the most delicate of
relationships, will clearly have an impact on consumer sentiment and
investment decisions. It can be safely said that this will be a
challenging year for Taiwan, the business daily predicted.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A tea party was held at the Taipei
International Convention Center on Wednesday to celebrate elder
statesman K. T. Li's 90th birthday.</P>
      <P>Li, now a senior adviser to President Lee Teng-hui, is widely
reputed as Taiwan's technology godfather and a chief architect of
Taiwan's economic miracle.</P>
      <P>During his tenures as economics minister (1976-1980) and finance
minister (1980-1987), Li pushed for the establishment of export
processing zones, the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park and the
privatization of state-run enterprises. All these projects have
helped lay a solid foundation for Taiwan's economic take-off and
phenomenal development over past decades.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 well-wishers, including Vice President Lien Chan
and Premier Vincent Siew, attended the tea party to wish Le many
happy returns.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the party, Lien led all well-wishers to bow
to Li to express their respect and best wishes to the elder
statesman.</P>
      <P>Lien said Li's devoted, down-to-earth working style and moral
stature deserves emulation by all local people.</P>
      <P>"Li has also set a model for today's civil servants by strictly
keeping personal interest and preferences from affecting
policy-making procedures," Lien said, adding that Li is a man of
capability and virture.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lien said, Li has continued paying great attention to
national and social affairs after his retirement. "His devotion to
public-spirited community development programs in recent years is
his intangible contribution to our country," Lien noted.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Premier Siew said the younger
generation of Taiwan's civil servants should learn from Li's
innovative thinking, far-sightedness, and efficient, passionate and

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP HEAD DETERMINED TO JOIN 2000 PRESIDENTIAL RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the nation's three major political
parties have yet to announce their respective candidates for the 2000
presidential election, the former opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) chairman on Wednesday expressed his determination to join
the fray.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang said in an interview with the CNA that it is his
"sacred mission" to run in the 2000 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he does not care whether or not he wins the election,
adding that he only wants to forward the concept of "rising people"
and describe what he thinks Taiwan's development direction should be
in the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>His so-called "rising people" refers to the creation of a new
culture in Taiwan whereby the island will become more positively
involved in economic activities in mainland China, will compete with
the mainland in the international economic arena, and will maintain
political dialogue with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The concept also emphasizes that in the new international order,
Taiwan will no longer need to worry about attack by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hsu first proposed the "rising people" concept in 1994, and said
that although the concept was severely criticized then, it has "been
proved correct," and that "now is the right time to discuss the
idea."</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that some people within the DPP hope he
will withdraw from the race, Hsu said he is not worried that his
opinion is not accepted by the party because he believes his concept
represents the views of the majority of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu also suggested that a special unit be set up under the direct
jurisdiction of the presidential office to deal with cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, and suggested that the government adopt a "go west"
policy toward mainland China under the principle of separating
politics from economics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An "extremely premature baby" which recently
checked out of the hospital has grown to his normal weight of 5.2
kilograms, the Linkou Chang Kung Memorial Hospital announced on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Pediatrician Lin Jui-ying said that the boy, surnamed Lin, had a
birth weight of just 540 grams, setting a record for what may be the
most premature birth in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin's mother went into labor for unknown reasons when she was
only 23 weeks pregnant, and gave birth to two babies, only one of
which survived.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the hospital said that according to medical
literature, a 23-week-old baby has only a 30 percent chance of
survival. However, with the skill and teamwork of the hospital, the
boy overcame the symptoms most common in premature babies such as
chronic pulmonary disease, sepsis, and retinal problems.</P>
      <P>Dr. Lin said that the boy checked out on Jan. 25, by which time
he was in a normal condition, except for some difficulty in
coordinating his suckling motions.</P>
      <P>The doctor said she expects the boy to grow up to be a normal and
healthy adult.</P>
      <P>The hospital said that its success in nurturing the tiny boy puts

      <P>The results of a survey released on
Wednesday on NBA fans in Taiwan show that 97 percent of them will
still watch the reduced number of NBA games.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by a market research company commissioned
by cable television channel ESPN, shows that the NBA has loyal fans
here, despite the fact that there are now just 50 games in the
regular season. The reduction in the number of games is a result of a
long lockout triggered by disputes between players and management.</P>
      <P>The survey targeted fans aged 16-30, and the ratio of men to
women was six to four.</P>
      <P>With Michael Jordan's retirement from the Chicago Bulls, the
survey also asked fans to choose his successor. Some 20 percent of
those polled nominated Kobe Bryant, while 11 percent named Scottie
Pippen, and six percent said Grant Hill should take up the mantle of
"his airness."</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Deputy
Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng said on Wednesday that over the next
couple of days, the SEF will ask its Beijing counterpart to take back
nine mainland Chinese hijackers in detention on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jan said the SEF hopes to deport the nine mainlanders via sea,
following the pattern of the two previous such handovers. On both
occasions, one hijacker was flown to Kinmen, Taiwan's frontline
island outpost, and thence taken by boat to a point between the
island and the mainland coast to be handed over to mainland security
officials.</P>
      <P>The SEF told the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) of its intentions on Jan. 11, and has received a
positive reply from ARATS, welcoming the proposal and referring the
SEF to the Red Cross Society of Fujian Province, which would take
delivery of the criminals.</P>
      <P>Jan said the SEF hopes to complete the deportations before the
Chinese New Year, which is only 11 days away.</P>
      <P>The nine mainlanders, all of whom hijacked mainland Chinese
aircraft to Taiwan on various occasions, have either completed their
jail terms or have been released into illegal alien detention centers
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legal documents relating to each of the cases will also be turned
over to mainland security officials in the hope that the jail terms

      <P>Riding the steam locomotive up the steep
slopes of Alishan (Mount Ali), the famed forest resort in Chiayi,
southern Taiwan, is an indelible memory for many people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Now, after a six-month period of renovation and repair, the old
steam engine will again take to the rails to puff gracefully through
one of the country's most beautiful forests.</P>
      <P>Testing of the 86-year-old refurbished train has now been
completed in readiness for its comeback journey during the Forest
Rail Legend trip, the feature attraction of the Chiayi Cultural
Festival at the end of the month.</P>
      <P>The locomotive, one of 20-odd that have been gradually phased
out, is once again in fine working order, and Chiayi City Government
said the train will make four round trips daily between the North
Gate stop and the stop at Chuchi, starting from the beginning of the
festival on Feb. 27, so that the public can relive their fond

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Evidence gathered during the course of an
initial investigation reveals that the fatal crash in Taitung County
of a US-made F-16 fighter last month might be linked to instrument
failure, high ranking air force officials said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The air force managed to locate the aircraft's
flight data recorder at the scene of the crash and sent it to the
United States on Tuesday to try to determine the real cause of the
accident.</P>
      <P>But air force generals said that all evidence from the initial
investigation points to instrument failure as the cause of the crash,
although they did not rule out other factors.</P>
      <P>They said that if the crash can be attributed to a problem with
the plane's instrumentation, all the F-16s delivered by the US and
remodeled by the air force will be grounded for an overhaul to
avoid similar tragedies from occurring in the future.</P>
      <P>The jet fighter, one of the 30 twin-seater F-16B's delivered by
the US since 1997, smashed into a tea plantation in eastern Taiwan's
Taitung County on Jan. 25, killing Lt. Col. Chang Chia-kun, 43 and
Maj. Tai Wei-kang, 30, who were on a routine training flight.</P>
      <P>It was the second accident involving a F-16B since the air force
began taking delivery of an order for 150 of the planes in the 1997.
The last incident occurred on March 20, 1998, when another of the
planes disappeared over the sea near Penghu County, a group of small
islands off the west coast of Taiwan. The wreckage of the aircraft
has not been found, and its two pilots are presumed dead.</P>
      <P>The advanced warplanes, ordered in 1992, form the backbone of the
air force's new generation fleet of jet fighters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-MACEDONIA TIES CAN SERVE AS FORMULA FOR OTHER BALKAN STATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of formal diplomatic
relations between Macedonia Republic and the Republic of China can
serve as a formula for other Balkan states to help cement ties
between Taiwan and that part of the world, a leading Macedonian
lawmaker said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Savo Klimovski, speaker of the Parliament of Macedonia Republic,
said the new ROC-Macedonia relations is conducive to stability in
southern Europe. He added that some day, small nations like the ROC
and Macedonia will be granted due justice and proper recognition.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Taipei-based Chinese-language
China Times, Klimovski gave the thumbs-up to Taipei-Skopje ties,
saying it has ushered bilateral relations into a new era of financial
and political cooperation.</P>
      <P>Klimovski urged Taiwan not to worry about noises in Macedonia
toward the new diplomatic ties, saying Macedonia's decision to
establish formal relations with the ROC was supported by more than
two-thirds of the country's coalition parties currently in power.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Klimovski described Taiwan's proposed financial aid
to, and investment plans in Macedonia as reciprocal cooperation which
is mutually-beneficial. Macedonia's economic prospects, however, will
hinge on the results of the year-end presidential election, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's strong protests against the new Taipei-Skopje ties,
Klimovski said Macedonia has maintained cordial ties with mainland
China, and he would hate to see the good relations be affected by
such an issue. He said he would feel sorry if Beijing were not able
to accept the fact rationally.</P>
      <P>Besides, he said, Macedonia is a sovereign country which has
every right to make its own decision on whom to make friends with.</P>
      <P>Concerning Macedonia's national security, Klimovski said
Macedonia has its own measurement of national security and diplomatic
relations, such as its relations with mainland China, which is now a
super power.</P>
      <P>"My point of view is that Macedonia's internal stability and
sovereignty will face challenges if the economy is shaky and funds
are short. Economy and finance are also key factors related to
national security," he added.</P>
      <P>ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu and his Macedonian
counterpart, Aleksandar Dimitrov, signed a joint communique in Taipei
on Jan. 27 on the establishment of full-fledged diplomatic relations
between the two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LONG-ACTING PAIN KILLER DEVELOPED BY LOCAL RESEARCHERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A long-acting pain killer developed by local
researchers has been approved by the United States' Food and Drug
Administration for clinical testing on humans, the National Defense
Medical Center said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Center researchers said Sebacoyl Dinalbuphine Ester (SDE) will be
the first drug developed in Taiwan to gain such approval, marking a
big step for local biopharmacuticals making inroads into the
international market.</P>
      <P>SDE is said to be effective in fighting pain for up to a week or
longer, greatly relieving the suffering and inconveniences of
patients as well as cutting medical costs.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the medical center, Tri Service General Hospital and the
privately-run Yung Shin Pharmaceutical Industry, began to work
together in developing the drug in a project promoted by the National
Science Council.</P>
      <P>Hu You-pu, the head of the project and director of the medical
center's Pharmaceutical Research Institute, said the total research
budget for SDE, about NT$200 million (US$6.15 million), was about
one-fortieth of a regular budget in the United States to develop a
new drug.</P>
      <P>Hu said terminal cancer patients and those recovering from
surgery normally require a great deal of analgesic. Currently, the
most common pain killers are effective for only several hours and the
patients will need injection every few hours, while SDE has been
developed to continue to be effective for days.</P>
      <P>Researchers have completed all experiments and animal testing as
well as toxicology tests on SDE, an injected intramuscular drug, and
results have shown that it is safe and has no annoying side effects,
Hu said.</P>
      <P>SDE now faces between three and five years of clinical testing
before it will be available for sale. It is expected to hit the US
and Taiwan markets simultaneously once approval has been granted, Hu
noted.</P>
      <P>Some 15 pain killer chemical components along with SDE have been
developed under the project, and have applied for patents in the ROC,
the United States, Japan and South Korea.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A daring democratic experiment in a remote
township in Sichuan where farmers selected their local leaders in a
secret ballot sent alarm bells ringing in Beijing, according to the
Sydney Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>Voters in Buyun township, a rural village with a population of
about 20,000 in the central Chinese province of Sichuan, defied
central authorities on Dec. 31 and cast their ballots for a new
township chief after two weeks of spirited campaigning by three
candidates, the Herald reported from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chinese leaders have ordered a news blackout of the poll in the
official media to avoid other townships following suit during a
period of widespread economic and social turbulence.</P>
      <P>The poll has been declared illegal and was attacked in the
state-run media before the blackout but it remains unclear what the
central authorities intend to do about the tiny outbreak of
democracy, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>China has promoted village-level elections across the country in
recent years to demonstrate that the Chinese Communist Party was
gradually working towards democracy. But these low-level polls are

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT PASSENGER SERVICE UNDER STUDY: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is still studying whether to permit
direct passenger transport across the Taiwan Strait, officials of the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks amid reports that the MOTC is
planning to begin allowing such services starting in May. Reports
have also said that Fujian province on mainland China's southeastern
coast has constructed a passenger wharf on Meizhou Island, and will
push for cross-strait passenger services this year.</P>
      <P>Another report said that a Singaporean ocean liner has applied to
Keelung harbor authorities for permission to establish a triangular
chartered liner service route that stretches from Keelung to Japan's
Ishigaki Island and on to Meizhou.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said that direct cross-strait shipping and
passenger transport would be one of the key issues studied this year,
but they said that the MOTC has not yet made plans to permit such
services, let alone formulated a policy on the issue.</P>
      <P>They noted that the issue of cross-strait passenger transport is
affected not only by Taiwan's mainland China policy but also by such
considerations as entry and exit procedures for people on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, as well as navigation safety.</P>
      <P>Meizhou boasts a century-old temple dedicated to the Goddess of
the Sea, more commonly known as Matsu in Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>According to MOTC tallies, Taiwan pilgrims make more than 100,000
visits to the Meizhou Island every year to pay tribute to Matsu, The
peak season are around March 3 and Sept. 9 on the lunar
calendar. March 3 is Matsu's birth anniversary and Sept. 9 marks her
deification.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan still bans direct cross-strait transport service,
local pilgrims have to spend nearly a day reaching Meizhou via
either Hong Kong or Macau. The direct travel ban prompted many
local residents to illegally travel to Meizhou by fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Mainland officials in charge of cross-strait navigation affairs
said that the mainland welcomes any Taiwan measures to promote direct
cross-strait shipping and passenger transport.</P>
      <P>They noted that most of the Taiwan tourists traveling to Meizhou
Island, located off the coast of Fujian province, have gone there in
fishing ships, which sometimes experience difficulty in navigating
the strait.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that Meizhou has constructed a passenger
wharf to accommodate passengers arriving on liners, but they said
that the liners could also berth in Xiamen.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The federal government's proposed 10
percent goods and services tax (GST) may cost Australia 59,000 in
jobs and US$1 billion in lost revenue from decreased foreign tourism,
the Tourism Task Force said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The number of overseas tourists is expected to drop about 10
percent once the GST is introduced in July 1, 2000, the task force
told the Senate committee.</P>
      <P>The parliament is deliberating a federal government tax reform
proposal which includes the controversial GST.</P>
      <P>"This would result in a loss of over 25,400 jobs and the loss of
A$1.6 billion (over US$1 billion) per annum in export earnings,
equivalent in export terms to the abolition of the sugar or iron and
steel industry overnight," the report noted.</P>
      <P>Another 34,100 jobs will also be lost as a result of the decline
in foreign tourist arrivals in service-related sectors such as
restaurants and hotels.</P>
      <P>Tourist promoters and travel agencies are putting pressure on the
government to exempt foreign tourists from the tax to prevent the
loss of jobs and revenue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Yunlin, southern Taiwan, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A large number of milkfish,
a seafood delicacy often bred and raised in freshwater ponds, froze
to death Thursday morning in the coastal county of Yunlin as a cold
front lay over Taiwan, fishery sources reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>About 50,000 milkfish in ponds scattered around Taishi in Yunlin
County were found belly up early Thursday morning when the
temperature there dropped to 8 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>Fishermen said a power outage Thursday morning at 4 a.m. shut
down the ponds' temperature regulators, which resulted in water
temperatures dropping even more quickly.</P>
      <P>The total loss to fishermen is estimated at NT$1 million, and
further losses are expected as the cold front is expected to remain
over Taiwan for the next couple of days.</P>
      <P>The frozen milkfish will be taken to canneries or food processing
plants, where the fish will be ground into powder and used as
foodstuffs, fishermen said.</P>
      <P>Although southern Taiwan has average temperatures that are
generally warmer than those in northern Taiwan, portions of Yunlin
and Chiayi counties often see the coldest weather around Taiwan
during the winter because of special oceanic and geographical
factors, weather forecasters said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) has taken
three measures to cope with the year 2000 computer crisis, also known
as Y2K, and to prevent the millennium bug from having an adverse
effect on the operations of the nation's foreign exchange market.</P>
      <P>First the CBC has urged appointed foreign exchange banks to be
aware of the legal risks stemming from Y2K. At the invitation of the
CBC, Nigel Li of the law firm Lee and Li spoke on Jan. 22 to banks on
the legal problems they could face in 2000 and provided them with
reference information on the problem.</P>
      <P>The bank has also urged appointed foreign exchange banks to be
aware of need to test all their computer systems. The CBC gave
written notice to all appointed banks last Dec. 24, asking them to
make sure they test their systems early enough to ensure that the
banks will be able to weather the Y2K crisis smoothly.</P>
      <P>Finally the CBC has urged appointed foreign exchange banks to be
aware of the importance of emergency measures. Last Dec. 31 the CBC
provided the banks with a list of questions and answers regarding the
emergency measures adopted by US financial institutions to cope with

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dao Sheng Group, owners of kindergartens
in and around Taipei City, has reportedly bought the Independence
Evening Post (IEP) on Thursday, a move that may stem the growing
dispute between the owner and employees of the financially strained
Independence News Group.</P>
      <P>Jiang Dao-sheng, owner of the Dao Sheng Kindergarten Education
Group, was said to have acquired the IEP at a cost of NT$1.3 billion
(US$40 million) after signing an agreement with Independence News
Group owner Chen Cheng-chung, who is also a Taipei city councilor.</P>
      <P>The purchase has helped to defuse, at least temporarily, a
two-week standoff between the paper's management and labor union over
unemployment compensation and employee rights.</P>
      <P>Labor union leaders said they were pleased with the alleged
purchase and would call off protest activities triggered by Chen's
failure to agree to provide what the labor union considered adequate
unemployment compensation.</P>
      <P>The IEP ran into financial trouble just days after a sister
newspaper, the Independence Morning Post (IMP), unexpectedly
announced an indefinite suspension of publication on Jan. 21.</P>
      <P>But labor union leaders said protests will resume if the
employees were not paid by Friday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The IMP, a liberal daily news founded 11 years ago, suspended
publication without warning, a move that shocked the paper's
employees and triggered immediate protests.</P>
      <P>Chen, who brought into the Independence News Group in 1994, said
employees of the group would receive unemployment compensation and
back-wages if he found an individual or business group willing to buy
into the newspapers.</P>
      <P>No buyer has yet been found, however, for the IMP.</P>
      <P>Jiang and the Dao Sheng Group, which maintain a dozen
kindergartens in Taipei city and county and other businesses,
including a communications company and an information technology (IT)
firm, have declined to comment on the purchase.</P>
      <P>Dao Sheng sources would only say that if indeed the group
acquires the IEP, the actual buyer would be the affiliated
communications or the IT company.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW MAY VISIT MACEDONIA TO CEMENT TIES: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) does
not rule out the possibility of Premier Vincent Siew visiting
Macedonia at an appropriate time to shore up the newly established
bilateral ties, ministry spokesman Roy Wu said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to a newspaper report that Premier Siew is
scheduled to head a large delegation of ROC government officials and
business executives to visit Macedonia in March.</P>
      <P>Wu said MOFA has not received any Cabinet instruction regarding
the premier's possible visit to the southeastern European country.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu said, MOFA does not rule out such a
possibility.</P>
      <P>"Since the Republic of China has forged formal diplomatic ties
with Macedonia, it is a natural thing that senior officials from the
two countries exchange visits," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>The spokesman went on to say that Macedonian Foreign Minister
Aleksandar Dimitrov invited President Lee Teng-hui to visit his
country when he came to Taipei late last month to sign a joint
communique with his ROC counterpart, Jason Hu, on the establishment
of official ties.</P>
      <P>"Against this background, we do not rule out the possibility of
Premier Siew making an official visit to Macedonia at a proper
time," Wu added.</P>
      <P>He also clarified a press report concerning US stance on the
establishment of full diplomatic ties between the ROC and
Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Wu said MOFA has contacted American authorities over what US
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said during her meeting with
Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georievski on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, Madeleine had told Georievski that
the establishment of ROC-Macedonian diplomatic ties may cause some
problems.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said, the reports might not be correct. "To our
knowledge, Albright just reiterated that the United States would not
adopt any official stance on the issue and that it's up to Macedonian
leaders to decide whether to forge ties with any other country."</P>
      <P>Asked about the US stance on the establishment of ROC-Macedonian
ties at a Wednesday news conference, State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin also said that the issue should be decided by Macedonian
political leaders.</P>
      <P>Rubin stressed it is a long-term US policy that the United States
would not take any official stand on whether any other country should
establish diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rubin further said the United States sees no reason why one
ought to connect the issue of United Nations forces in
Macedonia and the mandate with Macedonia's establishment of official
ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rubin said the United States supports the extension of
UN Preventive Deployment (UNPREDEP) force in Macedonia and urges all
UN Security Council member states to do the same.</P>
      <P>The UN currently deploy more than 900 peacekeeping troops along
Macedonian borders with Kosovo and Albania to contain a further
spread of military conflicts and instability in the Balkan peninsula.
In addition, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also
stations 2,000 to 3,000 troops in Macedonia to help cope with any
contingencies.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has threatened to boycott a proposed extension of
the mandate for UNPREDEP force in Macedonia after the former
Yugoslavia state forged diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's threat, MOFA spokesman Wu said Macedonia
has carefully evaluated all related issues, including the mandate for
UN military deployment on its territory, before it finally decided to
establish ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Wu further said the ROC will gradually discuss with
Macedonia various cooperative programs in economic, social and
technological fields.</P>
      <P>"We hope the newly forged ties will benefit both countries. We
also hope our economic cooperation programs will help increase
Macedonian people's job opportunities and boost that country's
overall economic development," Wu said, adding that he believes this
kind of development will contribute to peace and stability in the
Balkan peninsula.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US RESOLUTION ON TAIWAN SECURITY INTRODUCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two members of the US House of
Representatives submitted Wednesday a concurrent resolution urging
President Bill Clinton to seek from Beijing a public renunciation of
the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the non-binding concurrent resolution, Robert E. Andrews
(D-N.J.) and Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) jointly called on the president to
help Taiwan in the event of a military attack, or the threat of such
an attack, by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The House of Representatives voted 411-0 in favor of a similar
resolution in June 1998.</P>
      <P>US senior officials from the executive branch have also called on
authorities in Beijing to renounce the use of force against Taiwan,
the resolution noted. It cited the 1979-enacted Taiwan Relations Act,
which said US policy is "to consider any effort to determine the
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts
or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western
Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States."</P>
      <P>Under the act the United States may provide Taiwan with defensive
weaponry.</P>
      <P>The Washington-based Formosa Association of Public Affairs (FAPA)
praised the passage of the resolution. FAPA is a political
organization that lobbies for Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>FAPA leader Chen Wen-yen said that mainland China's 1996 missile
exercises in the Taiwan Strait, which he described as an attempt to
interfere in Taiwan's first direct presidential elections, caused the
US Congress to reconsider its position on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since that event, congressmen have continually demanded that the
Clinton administration take a strong stand against mainland China. In
Taiwan, meanwhile, most lawmakers believe the United States should
help Taiwan defend itself if it is attacked by Beijing, Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The parents and brothers of newly elected
legislator and Hai Shan conglomerate head Liu Ping-wei have, like
Liu, left Taiwan for the United States.</P>
      <P>Their departure, recorded by immigration authorities at CKS
International Airport, came after checks issued by Liu and worth
millions of NT dollars bounced this week.</P>
      <P>Liu Ping-hua, a younger brother of Liu Ping-wei who is deputy
secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC), left for
Los Angeles on Tuesday night, while another younger brother, Liu
Ping-chung, left Wednesday night. He was also bound for Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>All three brothers' tickets were for one-way travel, according to
the airlines that issued the tickets.</P>
      <P>The NSC confirmed that its deputy secretary-general is on leave
and has gone abroad for several days. But the council declined to
indicate the duration of the leave or Liu's whereabouts. Calls to his
office are directed to an answering machine.</P>
      <P>Liu Ping-wei, according to reports, has over the past two days
bounced checks totaling more than NT$100 million. Analysts say the
resulting turmoil may threaten the stability of Taiwan's banking
system because the Hai Shan Group, which has partial ownership of
companies in fields ranging from construction to banking, has total
debts of NT$6 billion.</P>
      <P>Upon reaching Los Angeles Wednesday Liu Ping-wei told the media
that he would stay in the United States for four or five days before
he returns to Taiwan, reported a CNA correspondent in Los Angeles.
Liu stressed that his financial problems have nothing to do with the
recent elections for speaker and deputy speaker of the legislature,
adding that he deeply regrets the trouble this matter has caused his
family.</P>
      <P>Media reports have suggested Liu Ping-wei's current financial
troubles stem from his bid for the deputy speakership of the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Union Commercial Bank (UCB) in Taiwan said
that Liu's checks bounced on Feb. 1 and that he should deposit funds
sufficient to cover the checks within seven days and in accordance
with banking regulations. Otherwise he will have legally defaulted.</P>
      <P>UCB officials clarified that the total value of bounced checks
issued to the bank by Liu was about NT$120 million, not NT$210
million, as had been reported.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan sailboat left Singapore on
Thursday bound for Malacca, the third leg of a round-the-world voyage
aimed at inspiring the nation's younger generation to cultivate an
adventurous spirit and embrace Mother Nature.</P>
      <P>It will take only three to four days to reach Malacca, capital of
Malaysia's Malacca State, but Liu Ning-sheng, skipper of the 35-ton
"New Era," said the voyage may be the riskiest of the whole journey.</P>
      <P>"The winds in the Malacca Strait are notoriously fickle and there
may be pirates in the region," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of Singaporeans and overseas Chinese well-wishers showed
up to bid farewell and pray for God's blessing for the vessel's crew,
including the Republic of China's de facto ambassador to Singapore,
Ouyang Jui-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Liu expressed his heartfelt gratitude for all the assistance and
hospitality extended to the "New Era" and her crew during their
two-week stay in the city-state.</P>
      <P>"Some friends have helped repair the boat's engine, while others
have provided us with weather information, cash donations and various

year.</P>
      <P>"After two weeks of repair and maintenance of our equipment, and
purchases of foods and other necessary supplies in Singapore, we

Hope." It is scheduled to return to Kaohsiung in November 2000.</P>

presence of this force has had regional benefits in limiting
instability in the Balkans," he added.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's ambassador to Skopje was quoted last week as
saying that unless Macedonia retracts its decision on Taiwan, Beijing
will reconsider an extension of the mandate for the UN Preventive
Deployment Force (UNPREDEP).</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council is expected later this month to consider
extending the UNPREDEP mandate, which has been renewed every half
year since the force was first sent to the former Yugoslav republic
in March 1995.</P>
      <P>Composed mainly of US and Scandinavian troops, UNPREDEP's mission
is to prevent conflicts in other parts of former Yugoslavia from
spreading.</P>
      <P>Rubin's statement came after Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright touched on
Taiwan during a discussion at the State Department.</P>
      <P>Georgievski told Taiwan reporters that during their meeting,
Albright expressed concern over implications at the UN following
Macedonia's decision to recognize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that the secretary of state asked about the decision and
said that "she presented her opinion that we should have consulted
between us."</P>
      <P>"She indicated problems that we can have in the future,
especially at the UN, when the decision about the station of the
UNPREDEP mission in Macedonia is going to be taken." he said.</P>
      <P>Answering questions on the exchanges about Taiwan, Rubin said the
United States does not take a position on whether other countries
should establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"That is a matter for the Macedonian political leaders to
decide," he said.</P>
      <P>Later, the State Department tried to clarify Albright's remarks
about consultations between Macedonia and the United States.</P>
      <P>"In the course of the meeting, the secretary of state underscored
US interest in close consultations with the former Yugoslav republic
of Macedonia on important matters of mutual concern, including
UNPREDEP," an official said.</P>
      <P>The official said that Albright also reiterated "the
long-standing US policy that the United States takes no official
position on whether (other) countries establish diplomatic relations
with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Macedonian prime minister is on a four-day visit to
Washington, where he will have meetings with President Bill Clinton,
Defense Secretary William Cohen, members of Congress, and officials
of the International Monetary Fund.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA AT RISK OF FURTHER FINANCIAL CRISIS: US BANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A coming slowdown in economic growth in
the United States, mainland China and Europe, combined with
uncertainty in Japan, could cause a new phase of the Asian financial
crisis, according to the chief economist and managing director of
Chase Manhattan Bank.</P>
      <P>John Lipsky forecast that US growth will probably slow to about 1
percent this year, compared with 3.4 percent in 1998, which will
limit the ability of the United States to serve as a locomotive for
the world economy.</P>
      <P>The slowdown will be driven by a further widening of the US
external current account deficit, a decline in capital investment
growth following lower corporate profits, and weaker housing
activity.</P>
      <P>Lipsky pointed out that an important additional cause of the
slowdown will be a decline in consumer spending growth to only around
2 percent this year, from 4-5 percent in 1998.</P>
      <P>Given declining inflation and a slowing economy, the US Federal
Reserve will cut interest rates this year, according to Lipsky.</P>
      <P>With regard to the economy of mainland China, Lipsky pointed out
a number of "risk perceptions." One is that capital flight might be
increasing.</P>
      <P>If indeed capital flight is occurring and is rising, this will
heighten market perceptions of a future renminbi devaluation, Lipsky
said.</P>
      <P>Perceptions of a renminbi devaluation could also put pressure on
the Hong Kong dollar, Lipsky said.</P>
      <P>Turning to Japan, Lipsky pointed out the need for the government
to "break the deflationary psychology" prevalent in the country.</P>
      <P>"Japanese policy should not be oriented to maintaining any
particular level of the exchange rate, but to reviving domestic
demand," he said, noting that the country's policymakers are still
"describing goals in exchange rate terms," as evidenced by Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's recent endorsement of "target zones" for
currencies.</P>
      <P>However, Lipsky said he is hopeful that Japan will eventually
succeed in reviving domestic demand -- a side effect of which would
be a weakening of the yen against the US dollar. But this in turn
could lead to new pressure on Asian economies, especially in Korea
and Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND  CHINA  SLAMMED  FOR  LAXNESS  AGAINST  PIRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China was criticized on
Wednesday for its record in fighting piracy and its failure to
prosecute suspected pirates at an international conference on piracy
in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The actions of the mainland authorities in piracy incidents were
described in a paper by Capt. Jayant Abhyankar as "unbelievable" and
as "encouraging pirates to carry on."</P>
      <P>At the International Maritime Organization (IMO) seminar on
piracy and armed robbery against ships, he singled out two cases in
recent years to illustrate the failure of mainland China to act
against pirates.</P>
      <P>Taking last year's hijack of a Malaysian-registered tanker, he
said: "What makes his case important is that although the alleged
pirates, the ship and its cargo were found intact, the pirates were
not prosecuted."</P>
      <P>"Despite indisputable evidence, the pirates who had committed a
serious offense of hijacking a vessel and attempting to sell the
cargo were simply sent back to Indonesia without being prosecuted,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He made similar comments about a much earlier case of a vessel
which was hijacked in October 1995. In December 1995, mainland
China's Public Security Bureau (PSB) said it found the ship, renamed
the Arctic Sea, and detained it and 14 pirates aboard. However, by
February 1997 they had all been released without charge.</P>
      <P>Indonesia remains the hotspot for piracy, with some 59 actual and
attempted piracy attacks out of a global total of 192.</P>
      <P>Southeast Asia as a whole accounted for over half of the 192
attacks, including 15 in the Philippines, 11 in Malaysia, and nine in
Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>However, the total number of attacks worldwide dropped by 20
percent compared with the 1997 figures.</P>

of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were established without

political party in mainland China to 23.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and

    <HEADLINE>ABORTION RATE IS HIGH IN TAIPEI: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly half of Taipei's adult women have had
an abortion, and about 40 percent of unmarried Taipei women have
experienced sex, according to the results of a survey released by the
Bureau of Health under the Taipei City Government.</P>
      <P>The bureau commissioned the Taipei Women's Rights Promotion
Association to conduct the telephone survey between May 11 and May 21
1998, with the aim of finding out more about female Taipei residents'
demands regarding health care and services.</P>
      <P>The association managed to complete interviews with 981 adult
Taipei women.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that about 40 percent of Taipei women use
various methods of contraception, including intrauterine devices,
contraceptive pills, or surgery, to prevent pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Roughly 40 percent of the respondents said their husbands used
condoms. Looking at the figures, one municipal health official said
local men should be educated to enhance their sense of responsibility
regarding contraception.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 45 percent of adult Taipei women have had an
abortion, and 50 percent of the respondents aged between 20 and 30
said women should have the final say in deciding whether or not to
terminate a pregnancy.</P>
      <P>As 38.9 percent of unmarried Taipei women responding to the
survey have had sex, municipal health officials said they will launch
a campaign to encourage women under 30 to have regular pap smears to
facilitate early detection of possible cancerous cervical growths.</P>
      <P>Only 35.4 percent said they have had a cervical smear test,
results which indicate that municipal health authorities should
strengthen health education to encourage women to pay more attention
to their own health.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 64.2 percent of those interviewed said
they have conducted a breast self-examination at least once, but only
26 percent said they give themselves regular examinations. A further
35.6 percent said they have never examined their breasts for lumps.</P>
      <P>One particularly shocking finding was that many women have had a
total hysterectomy simply because of a benign tumor. The health
bureau said it will set clinical regulations to minimize unnecessary
removal of the uterus. The bureau said it also plans to inspect
hospitals with high records of such operations to probe whether any
irregularities are involved in the practice.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 5 percent of the respondents had
encountered sexual harassment while seeing doctors, and 10.7 percent
said they have never undergone a physical checkup because they fear
sexual harassment by the physician.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIFICATION, WISDOM TEST FOR TAIWAN AND MAINLAND CHINA (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finding a formula which respects the
separate rule in Taiwan and mainland China before the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait eventually achieve peaceful unification will be a
test of wisdom for the governments of both sides, political observers
say.</P>
      <P>Ever since mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin issued his
"eight-point statement" regarding Taiwan on Jan. 30, 1995, the
statement has become the principal factor governing mainland China's
key policies in its dealings with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Jiang's statement does not oppose Taiwan developing
trade and cultural links with other countries under Beijing's "one
China" principle, it clearly states that mainland China will never
accept Taiwan's drive to expand its niche in the international
community.</P>
      <P>In Beijing's view, all such efforts by the Taiwan authorities are
tantamount to creating the so-called "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan," which are seen by the Chinese communists as promoting Taiwan
independence, blocking eventual unification of China, and impeding
the mainland's territorial integrity.</P>
      <P>However, "reaching out" has been the focus of President Lee
Teng-hui's pragmatic foreign policy since he assumed the Republic of
China presidency.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the National Unification Council in April 1995,
Lee stressed that the ROC's bid to expand its international presence
is to create a "win-win" situation for both Taiwan and mainland China
and an attempt to find a way to give Taiwan's 21 million people a
voice in the international community.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that Taiwan's pragmatic foreign policy does not seek
Taiwan independence, and that the ROC government has never deviated
from its ultimate pursuit of China's unification.</P>
      <P>Although there are voices within Taiwan opposing the ROC
government's policy of pragmatic diplomacy, accusing it of conducting
"money diplomacy," the latest public opinion survey carried out by
the Mainland Affairs Council shows that about 70 percent of the
people of Taiwan are in favor of pragmatic diplomacy, while the
number of local residents who believe that relations with foreign
countries should take precedence over cross-strait ties has also
increased.</P>
      <P>The poll results indicate that most of Taiwan's people back the
government's efforts to win international recognition, but political
experts point out that Taiwan's drive to increase its presence on the
international scene is effectively the central conflict between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The major difference between Taiwan and mainland China over the
issue is their different perceptions of the concept of "one China,"
according to political analysts.</P>
      <P>Taipei cannot accept Beijing's view that the so-called "one
China" refers to mainland China, while Beijing also shrugs off
Taipei's view that the concept refers to a "China which is currently
divided and under separate rule."</P>
      <P>This dispute has led to a fierce diplomatic wrangle between the
two sides, and the competition to win international recognition has
degenerated into a "zero-sum" game, the political observers say.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has decided to repatriate nine
mainland Chinese hijackers on Feb. 9, while two children brought to
Taiwan by their hijacker parents will be sent back to the mainland
via Hong Kong on Feb. 6.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) informed its mainland
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), of the decision on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are the quasi-official organizations set up to
handle cross-strait contacts in the absence of official ties between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>In accordance with past practice, the nine hijackers will be
transferred to the mainland authorities in the Taiwan Strait, at a
point midway between the ROC island outpost of Kinmen and the
mainland Chinese coast.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng told a press
conference that the decision to repatriate the hijackers and their
children was based on the principles of humanity, safety, and
convenience.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he urged ARATS to resume consultations on the
handling of hijacking problems at an early date in order that a

(By Victor Lai)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over the past four years, Taiwan has forged diplomatic relations
with several countries in Europe, Africa and the South Pacific, but
the island also lost one of its traditional and major allies -- South
Africa -- last year. Currently, Taiwan is officially recognized by 28
countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Trying to consolidate their countries' ties with foreign nations,
the leaders of both governments have also launched intensified
diplomatic offensives, increasing the number of their overseas
visits.</P>
      <P>ROC President Lee made a historic visit to his alma mater,
Cornell University in the United States, in 1995, and pulled off a
very successful tour of ROC allies in Central America and the
Caribbean in 1997.</P>
      <P>On the other side, mainland Chinese President Jiang held his
first summit meeting with US President Bill Clinton in New York in
1995, followed by a visit to Europe in June 1996, and the second
Clinton-Jiang summit in October 1997. In November 1998, he also
visited Russia and Japan.</P>
      <P>Amid the changing global political climate, Taiwan's
democratization and desire for membership of international
organizations, as well as Beijing's increased leverage and its
endless efforts to isolate Taiwan internationally, all reflect a
"blind point" in mainland China's dealings with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Judging from the experience of the former two Germanys and the
two parts of the Korean peninsula, it would not seem impossible for
the two parts of a divided country to have separate representation in
the international community, political experts say. Although the
cause of their separations may be different, they all have strived
toward unification and eventually, at least in Germany's case, have
accomplished their aspiration.</P>
      <P>In view of such historical precedent, the challenge for the
leaders of Taiwan and mainland Chinese now is how to achieve the goal
of national unification through acceptable means to both parties,
while respecting the current state of affairs on the two sides, they
conclude.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the Republic of China is fully
eligible to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), it will not be
allowed in ahead of mainland China because of Beijing's insistence, a
US trade expert said on Thursday at a seminar in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan might not like it, but will have to come to terms with the
political reality that most of world's powers will tie the island's
WTO bid to that of mainland China, said John Jackson, a professor at
Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., and drafter of the Special
301 provisions of the 1984 and 1989 US Omnibus Trade Acts.</P>
      <P>Beijing, whose application for the WTO membership has been held
up by its persistent reluctance to open its markets, has always
claimed that Taiwan is a part of mainland China, and should not be
allowed into the world trade regulatory body ahead of it.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economic miracle is indisputable, so is the fact that
most states in the world acknowledge Beijing as the sole legitimate
ruler of China, and accordingly would give in to its demand that
Taiwan's access to WTO should be granted only after Beijing's
membership is secured, said Jackson, cautioning that he was
expressing his personal view.</P>
      <P>Contrary to many people's fear that the current Asian financial
storm will postpone Beijing's WTO entry by impeding its economic
reform, Jackson said the economic tumult will remind the WTO of the
importance of bringing in a powerful economy such as mainland China
to ward off further financial crises.</P>
      <P>Later in the seminar, in a veiled rebuttal of Jackson's argument,
Chen Rue-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade and one
of Taiwan's chief negotiators on WTO access, pointed out the
necessity for would-be WTO members to meet the entry criteria,
including market-opening and bringing their trade system into line
with WTO rules.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has almost completed its application
procedures, Chen urged the WTO not to take political factors into
account when reviewing Taiwan's bid, and vowed to seek the support of
other member states for the island's membership, irrespective of
Beijing's demands.</P>

      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said on Thursday that he is willing to
exchange views on any issue with Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while delivering a report titled "Pursuing
Peaceful Cross-Taiwan Strait Relations" at a dinner party hosted by
the American Chamber of Commerce.</P>
      <P>Wang is scheduled to visit Taipei some time this year to
reciprocate Koo's mainland trip of last fall.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
and Director Daryl Johnson of AIT's Taipei Office were also invited
to the dinner party.</P>
      <P>Koo said the United States is a long-standing friend of the
Republic of China. He pointed out that Taipei supports the US
government's policy of engagement with Beijing, and urged Washington
to balance its policies regarding Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>In response to Koo's overture, Bush reiterated Washington's five
principles governing Beijing-Taipei relations as follows:</P>
      <P>-- There must be a peaceful solution to problems arising between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait;</P>
      <P>-- Constructive and meaningful dialogue between Taipei and
Beijing is the best way to solve cross-strait disagreements;</P>
      <P>-- Cross-strait disagreements and other problems should be solved
by Taipei and Beijing without outside interference;</P>
      <P>-- The US will take a neutral stand over cross-strait dialogue;
and</P>
      <P>-- All agreements reached by Taipei and Beijing should be based
on conditions acceptable to both sides.</P>
      <P>Bush said he believes Wang's hoped-for Taipei visit this year
will improve the atmosphere of cross-strait relations. He said the US
will not lean on either side, and will not pressure either side into
making unwilling concessions.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Koo pointed out that the basic reason for the
stalled cross-strait relations is the lack of mutual trust, and added
that bilateral relations may worsen if highly sensitive political
issues are taken up under such conditions.</P>
      <P>He said mutual trust can be built up through continuous
dialogues, implementation of already-concluded agreements, and
solution of less-sensitive political issues.</P>
      <P>Koo acknowledged that peaceful reunification of China can be
attained only when Beijing respects Taiwan's political and economic
development, as well as the fact that there exists separate rule in
mainland China and Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSES URGED TO BID FOR ADB CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businesses are being urged to take
part in open bidding for infrastructure and reconstruction contracts
under an Asian Development Bank (ADB) framework to help invigorate
Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) officials said Taiwan contractors and
suppliers are welcome to bid for contracts in nine major categories
of ADB-initiated development projects in developing Asian countries,
including electricity; reservoir, dam and water supply;
transportation; telecommunications; education; medicine; agriculture;
and fisheries.</P>
      <P>ADB authorities are scheduled to hold a presentation on ADB
business opportunities in Taipei March 22-23 under the joint auspices
of the CBC and the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT), according to CBC
officials.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said Taiwan contractors and suppliers have been
awarded only some US$20 million worth of contracts since 1997 by the
ADB for infrastructure and reconstruction projects. This figure pales
in comparison to those of other ADB member countries. Since 1997, the
ADB has offered US$6 billion worth of business opportunities to
bidders in member countries.</P>
      <P>CBC officials urged Taiwan businesses to take the advantage of
ADB business opportunities to expand their exports to Asian nations.</P>
      <P>According to BOFT statistics, Taiwan's exports fell 9.4 percent
in 1998, with those to Japan dropping 20.2 percent and those to
Southeast Asia sliding 27.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's current stake in the ADB stands at 1.25
percent, which puts it 13th among the organization's 56 members.
Japan and the United States hold the largest stakes, at around 16
percent each, according to CBC officials.</P>
      <P>The ADB changed the Republic of China's designation to "Taipei,
China" after mainland China was admitted into the body in 1986.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China, a founding member of the regional
financial organization, rejected the change and has since taken part
in ADB meetings and activities only under protest.</P>

dramatically -- from 7,580 in 1996-97 to 1,080 in 1997-98, according

      <P>The department reported the decline was due to a change in the

migration of skilled workers.</P>
      <P>Skilled migrants accounted for about 52 percent of the total
intake of about 68,000 in fiscal 1997-98, Immigration Minister

    <HEADLINE>KMT LEADER TALKS ABOUT 'NEW TAIWAN PERSON' CONCEPT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should not fear or
misunderstand the concept of "New Taiwan Person," said KMT
Secretary-General John Chang, who also noted that Taiwan will not
declare independence because the ruling Kuomintang is against it and
because Taiwan has been a sovereign and independent state since 1912.</P>
      <P>While addressing the Washington-based Heritage Foundation
Thursday, Chang also noted that after the ruling party won Taipei's
mayoral seat and captured a clear majority in the Legislative Yuan in
December 1998 elections, some members of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) are now advocating either modification or
outright deletion of the call for Taiwan independence that is part of
the DPP's party platform.</P>
      <P>These trends should increase the stability of the cross-strait
relationship, he said.</P>
      <P>But the elections that have served to consolidate democratic
freedoms on Taiwan also show the disparity between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan simply cannot seek reunification while the
mainland is still under a one-party dictatorship and while its people
lack such freedoms as those of speech and association. Bridging this
gap will take much effort and will likely be a gradual process, added
the former foreign minister.</P>
      <P>Chang told participants that only the people of Taiwan have the
right to decide their future and that the leaders of all political
parties in Taiwan have to preserve its existing system, freedoms and
rights, as well as protect the island's people from the threat posed
by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be better treated in the international community if
the world understands the truth about Taiwan, and "only with your
help, Taiwan will have a better future," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that the "New Taiwan Person" concept is designed
only to eliminate tensions between various ethnic groups in Taiwan,
such as native-born Taiwanese and the "mainlanders" who came to
Taiwan from the mainland earlier this century.</P>
      <P>The concept is not intended to create a "Taiwan person" that
stands in opposition to a "Chinese person," he said. While some
people on the mainland believe this is the real intent behind the
concept, "there is no need for such misunderstanding," he said.</P>
      <P>He explained that a "New Taiwan person" is Chinese by ethnicity,
although that person may have arrived in Taiwan at any of several
different historical stages. Distinctions between various ethnic
groups have become blurred because of marriages between the groups.
As a result of this blending, a person born in Taiwan today is
"Chinese by birth and a world-citizen in outlook."</P>
      <P>Chang added that between 60 percent and 85 percent of the people
in Taiwan favor either the status quo or reunification with the
mainland, while only 10 percent to 20 percent favor independence,
according to nearly 30 surveys conducted between 1994 and 1997 on the
question of Taiwan's status. Therefore, Beijing should not worry
about the intentions of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Talking about Taiwan's democratic achievements, Chang noted that
the 1996 presidential election has proved that the Chinese on Taiwan
are both interested in, and capable of implementing, democracy, and
helped debunk the myth advocated by many Sinologists and China
watchers in the West that two or three thousand years of imperial
monarchy has left the Chinese incapable of establishing a democracy.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the fact that Taiwan can openly embrace democracy
should also serve to show that once the mainland throws off the
straitjacket of communism, it too can make democratic changes, he
said.</P>
      <P>While expressing deep gratitude to the United States for
answering the mainland's belligerence by sending two aircraft carrier
battle groups to the region during the 1996 missile crisis, Chang
said these courageous actions have answered once and for all the
question of whether or not the Taiwan Relations Act has teeth.</P>
      <P>Through the combined efforts of Congress and the Clinton
administration, the United States has shown its willingness to take
heavy risks to fight against unjust militarism and to ensure peace
throughout the world, Chang added.</P>

      <P>The sun will not be coming out tonight.</P>
      <P>Russian cosmonauts aboard the Mir space station failed to unfold

    <HEADLINE>MOJ TO PROBE RUMORS BEHIND MARKET POUNDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is establishing a task
force to investigate the source of rumors that have caused Taiwan's
stock market to take a pounding in recent days, government spokesman
Chen Chien-jen said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Partly because of a bounced check scandal involving Kuomintang
Legislator Liu Ping-wei, who is also founder of a Taipei-based
business group, the Taipei bourse plunged 4 percent on Thursday,
continuing a bearish trend which has lasted throughout the week. The
market shed another 0.7 percent on Friday.</P>
      <P>The business and industrial groups that have been affected by the
recent rumors include the Koo Group, Hualon-Teijran, Pacific Electric
Wire and Cable, and Walsin Lihwa, all of which slid to their floor
prices in Thursday trading.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Ministry of Justice has been authorized to form the
investigative task force. Rumor-mongers will be dealt with severely
once they have been pinpointed, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew appealed to the general public
not to be too pessimistic over Taiwan's economy in the wake of the
recent spate of economic irregularities, including bounced checks,
bad debts, and high unemployment.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan is scheduled to call a meeting on Feb.
15 of top thinkers from the industrial, government, and academic
sectors to jointly oversee an economic pump-priming package recently
devised by the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The package is expected to help usher in a new era for Taiwan's
economic development after the prolonged slump which has continued
over the past year, Siew added.</P>
      <P>He stressed yet again that Taiwan's economy remains healthy, and
urged the public not to lose confidence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME NOT YET RIPE TO OPEN CROSS-STRAIT PASSENGER SERVICE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The time is not yet ripe for an opening of
maritime passenger transport services across the Taiwan Strait, the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng made the statement following
press reports that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) is considering allowing foreign-flagged ocean liners to
operate cross-strait passenger transport services via a third area.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the MOTC clarified the reports on Thursday by saying
that it did not take the initiative to draw up a blueprint for such a
plan. The proposal was broached instead by private industry
associations, the MOTC stressed.</P>
      <P>Sheu pointed out that various government agencies reached
consensus during a Cabinet-sponsored working meeting on mainland
China affairs on Nov. 1, 1998 that cross-strait shipping services
will be liberalized step-by-step under the premise that the nation's
security and dignity, as well as the people's well-being, are
assured.</P>
      <P>The MAC spokesman went on to say that the government's stance on
cross-strait transport services is clear and consistent.</P>
      <P>"At present, our policy is that indirect cross-strait cargo
transport links should be established before passenger services, and
that shipping services should take precedence over flight services,"
Sheu said, adding that the government will deregulate cross-strait
transport services gradually, in order to protect national security
and stability.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still bans direct cross-strait transport services because
mainland China remains hostile and has never renounced the use of
force to overrun the island.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the government opened direct cross-strait cargo
transshipment services in January 1997 mainly to facilitate the
development of Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific maritime transshipment
center. As for passenger services, Sheu said, the MAC, which charts
Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, has never planned to open either
direct or indirect cross-strait passenger services.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait passenger services, regardless of
scheduled or chartered services, involves many complicated problems,
including civilian-exchanges, crime prevention, and public security,
Sheu said now is still not the right time to open such services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS CALL FOR SUSPENSION OF HIGH-POLLUTION INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has been working in cahoots
with Taiwan's industrial sector on actions which are endangering the
environment and ecology of coastal areas in western Taiwan, a group
of scholars and academics said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The members of the liberal Taipei Society, most of whom are
university professors, joined a group of aquaculturalists from Yunlin
County's Taishi township at a press conference to call for the
government to stop allowing high-pollution industries such as the
petrochemical industry, to operate in the Yunlin and Chiayi areas.
The areas, spread from central to southern Taiwan, are home to
Taiwan's large clam fishery industry.</P>
      <P>The aquaculturalists said Taishi's salt-water clam ponds, which
have the world's best clam breeding and cultivation technology, are
in grave danger from water and earth pollution caused simply by
initial preparations for construction of an industrial complex which
is to be developed nearby.</P>
      <P>The pollution levels are expected to become much higher once the
complex has been completed, the clam farmers warned.</P>
      <P>Prof. Chujoe Hsia of the Graduate Institute of Building Planning,
National Taiwan University, who is one of the Taipei Society members,
said that while Taiwan strives to raise its GNP by developing economy
and industries, the GNP may end up an acronym for "garbage, noise and
pollution" if care is not taken to simultaneously protect the
environment and ecology.</P>

      <P>A lengthy dispute between the owner and

      <P>Chiang Dao-sheng, chairman of the Dao Sheng Group and an
affiliate company, China Agritech Corporation (CAC), signed a buyout
agreement with Independence News Group (ING) owner Chen Cheng-chung
on Friday morning after an overnight marathon negotiation.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, CAC acquires the newspaper at a
cost of NT$1.3 billion (US$40 million), while Chen on Saturday will
clear up the accumulated wage debts, including back-pay and
unemployment compensation for the Independence Morning Post (IMP)
employees, as well as overdue wages of IEP employees.</P>
      <P>Independence Group labor union leaders said at a news conference
on Friday that they are pleased with the deal, and will immediately
cease all protest action. They also expressed regret over their
unpleasant protest against Chen and his family.</P>
      <P>Chen, who bought the ING in 1994, unexpectedly announced an
indefinite suspension of publication of the IMP on Jan. 21 due to
financial problems. A few days later, IMP's sister newspaper, the
IEP, also ran into financial trouble. Chen's failure to pay wages and
unemployment compensation to his laid off employees triggered a
two-week management-labor standoff.</P>
      <P>CAC was transformed by Chiang from China Agricultural and
Economic Co. after he bought a 60 percent stake in the company. The
Taipei-based company is involved in bio-technological research and
development.</P>
      <P>In addition to CAC, Chiang's Dao Sheng Group also owns several
other businesses, including Filmate Communication International

Communication owns eight cable TV channels, and enjoys annual
turnover of more than NT$1 billion.</P>
      <P>According to a CAC press release, the company is responsible for

    <HEADLINE>AIT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEVELOPMENT OF ROC-US RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman and managing director
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), said on Friday that he is
optimistic about the future of relations between the Republic of
China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Bush made the remarks in a press conference wrapping up a 13-day
visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the Taiwan
Relations Act, which provides the framework of Taipei-Washington
relations in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to the next 20 years of relations between Taiwan
and the US, Bush said he was optimistic since both sides have
established solid and friendly relations, and that they also share
common interests and values.</P>
      <P>During his third trip to Taiwan as AIT head, Bush said that he
was met with warm hospitality everywhere he went on the island,
saying that he had seen examples of Taiwan's long and rich history in
places like Tainan, Meinung, Peikang, and Lukang in central and
southern Taiwan. He also saw an example of Taiwan's future when he
visited the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>He said that he was struck more than ever before by the basic
vitality of Taiwan's economy, made even more obvious by the
difficulties plaguing other parts of the Asian region.</P>
      <P>On the ROC's establishment of diplomatic relations with Macedonia
on Jan. 27, Bush noted that the event took place during his visit to
the island, and he reaffirmed the comments by State Department
spokesman James Rubin on the issue.</P>
      <P>Bush said that the "US does not take a position" on whether or
not two political entities should establish relations. He said there
should be no linkage between the extension of the United Nations
peacekeeping force deployment in Macedonia and the East European
nation's recognition of Taiwan, and added that the United States is
urging other UN Security Council members to support this position.</P>
      <P>Beijing, one of the security council permanent members, is
threatening to reconsider the extension of such forces unless
Macedonia retracts its decision to establish diplomatic ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On whether Taiwan should join the US-proposed theater missile
defense (TMD) project, Bush said that the US Defense Ministry's
report on TMD has yet to be sent to the Congress, and that the
content of the report has not yet been made public.</P>
      <P>He said that the United States understands the anxiety of the
Taiwan people over mainland China's missile capacity, but pointed
out that before Taiwan makes a decision on TMD, it has to clarify
many questions, such as its cost and its effect on the cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>He also said that the US has always supported dialogue between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, but stressed that the timing,
venue, and agenda for meetings must be decided by both sides of the
Taiwan Strait on mutually agreed basis.</P>
      <P>Bush said that the US will not suggest any ways for the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait to solve their problems, saying that the Chinese
have always been creative in solving their problem, and that this may
be a chance to show these skills.</P>
      <P>On whether Taiwan will be able to join the World Trade
Organization this year, Bush also reaffirmed US support of Taiwan and
mainland China's entries, saying that Taiwan has made a lot of
progress in its application to join the WTO, and that its application
should be treated independently from that of the mainland.</P>
      <P>Bush arrived here on Jan. 24. During his visit, he met with
President Lee Teng-hui, Premier Vincent Siew, and other political
heavyweights from the ruling and opposition parties, to exchange
views on matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>He last visited Taipei in July 1998, when he came to brief Taiwan
leaders and officials on the summit meeting between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENIOR TAIWAN RULING PARTY OFFICIAL MEETS MACEDONIAN PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will speed up
exchanges and cooperation with its new diplomatic ally, Macedonia,
for the mutual benefit of both sides, a senior Taiwan ruling party
official said here on Thursday.</P>
      <P>John Chang, secretary-general of the ROC's ruling Kuomintang,
made the statement after meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister
Ljubco Georievski, who is currently on an official visit to the
United States.</P>
      <P>Both Chang and Georievski attended the annual US national prayer
breakfast on Thursday, where they were seated at the same table.
Chang later took the initiative to pay Georievski a visit in his
hotel room.</P>
      <P>Chang said after the meeting that his talks with the Macedonian
prime minister will be conducive to the development of the newly
established bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>"I have assured Georievski that our ruling party firmly supports
the establishment of full diplomatic ties with Macedonia," Chang
said, adding that his meeting with Georievski has helped enhance the
Macedonian prime minister's confidence in making friends with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chang said, Georievski expressed a strong
desire to promote exchanges and cooperation with the ROC in various
fields.</P>
      <P>"Georievski told me that he hopes various ROC-Macedonian
cooperative programs can be launched as soon as possible," said
Chang, who once served as ROC foreign minister.</P>
      <P>For his part, Georievski later told reporters that he had
exchanged views with Chang on a variety of possible cooperative
programs. "We look forward to seeing fast and fruitful cooperation
with the ROC. We also expect to see frequent exchanges of visits by
political leaders from the two countries," he added.</P>
      <P>Some Macedonian politicians, including the president, still
oppose the establishment of diplomatic ties with the ROC. However,
Chang said both he and Georievski believe that the ties are in the
interests of both sides.</P>
      <P>"I believe that Georievski will be able to resolve Macedonia's
domestic issues satisfactorily," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He further said Macedonia really needs foreign economic aid. "We
have exchanged views on the promotion of bilateral trade and Taiwan
investment in Macedonia. Nevertheless, we have not touched on any
concrete, specific programs," Chang said, adding that he will convey
Georievski's opinion and recommendations on possible bilateral
cooperative projects to the relevant ROC government authorities.</P>
      <P>Chang will travel to New York on Friday to continue his US visit.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Macedonia forged formal diplomatic ties on Jan. 27.
The southeastern European state is the ROC's second diplomatic ally
in Europe, after the Vatican.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS COMPLETED WTO ENTRY PROCEDURES: BOFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has completed its
application procedures for entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO), one of Taiwan's chief negotiators on WTO access said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) who is also one
of the island's chief WTO negotiators, said he anticipates an average
tariff cut to agricultural and industrial products to 13.11 percent
and 4.06 percent, respectively, when Taiwan joins the world trade
regulatory body.</P>
      <P>In addition, restrictions on regions from which cars and
motorcycles can be imported will also be lifted, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that since the ROC applied for entry into the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the forerunner of the WTO
-- on Jan. 1, 1990, Taipei has almost completed all the procedures
for entry.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have been concluded with 24 countries out of the 26
countries which requested negotiations on Taiwan's entry terms, the
BOFT head noted, adding that polylateral consultations have already
been convened nine times.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said that apart from rice, all other agricultural
products will be permitted to be imported, while in order to meet
tariff-cutting agreements, tariffs on agricultural and industrial
products will be reduced even further to 10.76 percent and 2.61
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>State-owned enterprises have already completed their preparations
for privatization, said Chen, a requirement for WTO entry. A total of
42 state-owned enterprises will have completed privatization by 2000,
while all restrictions on foreign investment in Taiwan's bourse are
expected to be lifted in 2001, Chen revealed.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that the lifting of restrictions on foreign
investment in Taiwan's stock market does not mean the lifting of
restrictions on capital movement.</P>
      <P>The ROC is the world's 14th-largest trading nation, and the
seventh-biggest in terms of investment, Chen pointed out. The WTO
will remain incomplete until Taiwan is allowed to participate, and
the island will surely be an excellent market in the world community,
the director-general said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Jordanian Crown Prince Abdullah bin Hussein,
who was appointed heir to Jordan's Hashemite throne just 10 days ago,
is very friendly toward the Republic of China, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-huang, director of the MOFA's West Asian Affairs
Department, said Jordanian King Hussein's appointment of his eldest
son Abdullah as crown prince has won positive response from the
international community.</P>
      <P>"International political observers generally believe that
Jordan's political and economic situation will remain stable under
the new crown prince's leadership," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, substantive
relations between the ROC and Jordan are traditionally cordial. King
Hussein, who is critically ill with cancer, has maintained close
friendships with many senior ROC officials.</P>
      <P>Chen said Crown Prince Abdullah also maintains close ties with top
ROC leaders.</P>
      <P>Abdullah, 37, has made three visits to Taiwan -- in 1991, 1993
and 1996.</P>
      <P>Chen said Abdullah hosted a dinner in honor of ROC President Lee
Teng-hui, on behalf of his father, when Lee made a private visit to
the Middle East kingdom in 1995, and held wide-ranging talks with
Foreign Minister Jason Hu when he visited Jordan last October.</P>
      <P>Chen said Lee, Vice President Lien Chan, and Hu all sent their
congratulations to Abdullah on Jan. 26, when a Jordanian royal decree
announced that he was formally appointed his country's crown prince,
replacing King Hussein's brother Hassan as successor to Jordan's

      <P>Taiwan's plastic giant, the Formosa Plastics
Group (FPG), reached an agreement with Cambodian authorities on
Friday to take back industrial waste it dumped in that country,
according to a statement issued by the group.</P>
      <P>FPG promised to clean up the 3,000-ton, mercury-tainted mud then
re-package and ship it out of Cambodia within 60 days after the pact
was formally signed.</P>
      <P>The group didn't elaborate on where the waste will go for fear of
opposition from environmental groups. Instead, the statement said the
compressed and solidified mud will be shipped to "the country of
origin or a third country."</P>
      <P>Cambodian authorities promised to facilitate the shipment of the
mud by providing FPG with the required documents within 30 days after
the signing of the pact.</P>
      <P>The agreement was reached between FPG Deputy Chairman Wang

visit to Britain.</P>
      <P>KMT sources said that in a January meeting with KMT legislators
elected last December, President Lee Teng-hui, who serves
concurrently as KMT chairman, spelled out the importance of overseas
visits to the island's constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>The sources said Lee places great weight on foreign experience
and the carrying out of constitutional affairs of other democratic
countries, believing that they can provide references for Taiwan's
own parliamentary reforms.</P>
      <P>The delegation to Britain is one of four similar groups
undertaking fact-finding visits to United States, France and Japan,
respectively. The mission to the United States set off on Friday,
while the others are scheduled to take off on Monday.</P>
      <P>The delegations will hold talks with ranking government officials
and scholars during their visits. They will also call on overseas
Chinese representatives to exchange views on matters of mutual
concern.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUNE 4 TIANANMEN MASSACRE TO BE COMMEMORATED ACROSS EUROPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 500 cities and towns throughout
Europe this year will commemorate the 10th anniversary of the June 4
Tiananmen massacre in Beijing, according to a supporter of mainland
China's democratic movement on Friday.</P>
      <P>Marie Hozman, chairman of the French Maison de Democracie (House
of Democracy), said an international committee for the commemoration
of the massacre organized the one day Tiananmen Square activity and
has received warm support in Europe.</P>
      <P>Hozman said she and several mainland Chinese pro-democracy
activists met recently with Jacques Lang, chairman of the French
National Assembly's foreign relations committee, to discuss the
issue, and gained his support.</P>
      <P>After communication by Lang with the Association of European
mayors, 500 members have expressed their willingness to take part in
the activity.</P>
      <P>This year is also the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the
Berlin Wall. Lang, representing France, and former German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, representing Germany, are now actively organizing a
historical commemorative activity.</P>
      <P>Because the June 4 massacre means as much to mainland China's
democracy movement as the collapse of the Berlin Wall does to
Europeans, Lang will meet with Kohl on how to coordinate the two
commemorative activities to heighten the current of democracy and
perhaps bring about another round of democracy movement in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Lang said he believes that this year's June 4 commemoration will
be a spectacular and impressive display, and will put strong pressure
on Beijing to force the regime to promote the maintenance of human
rights and the reform of democracy.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese democracy activists also asked for Lang's
support to urge the French National Assembly and the European
Parliament to unite with all the governments of European countries to
pressure Beijing to release illegally indicted and detained
dissidents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SONS OF MAINLAND CHINESE HIJACKERS REPATRIATED VIA HK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two children who were brought to Taiwan by
their parents in two separate hijackings from mainland China a few
years ago were repatriated via Hong Kong on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Three staff members from the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) accompanied Luo Wanghuan, 16, and Yang Yang, 11, to
Hong Kong, where the two youngsters were handed over to
representatives from the SEF's mainland counterpart, the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>An SEF press statement said that the repatriation was handled
"according to the principles of safety, humanitarianism and
convenience."</P>
      <P>Luo Wanghuan is the son of hijackers Luo Changhua and Wang Yuing,
while Yang Yang's parents, also air pirates, are Yang Mingde and Han
Fenging. Luo's parents and Yang Yang's father will soon be
repatriated by ship together with six other mainland Chinese
hijackers. Yang Yang's mother was repatriated in 1997 after serving a
jail term here.</P>
      <P>The two youngsters looked grim and didn't utter a word before
their departure for Hong Kong. Tung Shan-chih, a teacher at the
Taipei Children's Welfare Center under the Chinese Refugees Relief
Association and who was responsible for taking care of Yang Yang,
said the center gave US$2,900 in cash to Yang Yang as a parting gift.</P>
      <P>After living and studying in Taiwan for several years, the two
children may need time to re-adapt themselves to life in mainland
China, Tung said.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-based (ARATS) asked three officials from the Hong
Kong office of mainland China's mouthpiece Xinhua news agency to
receive the two children at Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport and
complete some formalities with the SEF officials who brought them
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>SEF has also informed ARATS of its plan to repatriate nine
mainland hijackers via the Taiwan-held island fortress of Kinmen
before the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The nine are Liu Baocai, Shi Yuebo, Yang Mingde, Wang Zhihua, Luo
Changhua, Wang Yuing, Zou Weiqiang, Li Xiangyu and Lin Wenqiang, all
of whom have served jail sentences and are now qualified for parole.</P>
      <P>Two of 17 people involved in hijackings, most of which occurred
between April 1993 and June 1994, were sent back to mainland China
via Kinmen in 1997 following extensive SEF-ARATS discussions.</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of a binding agreement on the issue, Beijing
declined to inform Taipei of the fate of the hijackers, who stood
trial in a mainland court after their return to the mainland. Beijing
does not recognize judicial rulings handed down by Taipei.</P>
      <P>SEF again urged ARATS on Saturday to seal a bilateral agreement
to regulate the repatriation of cross-strait hijackers and other
criminal suspects. Without a formal agreement, SEF said the
repatriation of mainland hijackers can be processed only on a
case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>In May 1997, mainland China repatriated Taiwanese hijacker Liu
Shan-chung, who forced a domestic flight to the southeastern mainland
port city of Xiamen in March 1997.</P>
      <P>Political observers said the upcoming repatriation of the nine
hijackers will help cultivate a good atmosphere in the run-up to a
planned visit to Taiwan by ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>ARATS will reportedly send its deputy secretary-general to Taiwan
later this month or in early March to discuss details concerning
Wang's planned Taiwan visit, which is a reciprocal trip to SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu's ice-melting visit to the mainland last
October.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Malaysia's economy is becoming more stable
and forecasts for its growth in 1999 are posted at 1 percent, shaking
off the cloudy recession caused by the Asian financial storm,
according to an official Taiwan report.</P>
      <P>A Southeast Asian investment mission from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) is visiting Malaysia, a key market for Taiwan
investments in the region. The delegation's report pointed out that
Malaysia is recovering from its financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Southeast Asian nation has launched new incentive programs to
attract investment, which widely loosen limitations on foreign
investment in the manufacturing industry, the report said. But it
warned Taiwan businesses building factories there to be aware of the
lack of professional manpower and that loyalty among Malaysian
employees is not as high as that among Taiwan workers.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report said the advantages of investing in
Malaysia include the fact that the country is a key resource of
imports of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) market
and that Malaysia enjoys steady social order, stable currency, and a
complete basic economic infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The MOEA fact-finding delegation also reported that the regional
financial assault, which began in mid-1997, has damaged many Taiwan
enterprises in Southeast Asia. It suggested that the government in
Taipei provide more complete information on avoiding risks, as well
as business operation and management advice for those Taiwan
companies having or intending to develop overseas business.</P>

      <P>Taiwan sank further into a financial crisis
on Thursday as investors staged a run on a family-owned bank and a
prominent businessman flew to the United States on a one-way ticket,
a major economic newspaper in Canada reported on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EURO WILL NOT RAPIDLY REPLACE GREENBACK: US REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The euro offers certain specific
benefits and potential costs, but is unlikely to rapidly replace the
US dollar as the world's premier currency, according to US President
Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA).</P>
      <P>In a newly released annual report, the council said that for the
countries participating in the single European currency, costs in
trade among members of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
will be lowered as exchange rate risk and currency transactions
within Europe will both be eliminated.</P>
      <P>These reduced trading costs will further market integration,
enhancing price competitiveness. The countries participating in the
EMU will also be required to show more discipline in fiscal and
monetary policies, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The loss of monetary autonomy, however, will deprive EMU
countries of a tool that they can use to "respond to asymmetric
national shocks -- unexpected economic developments that affect some
countries differently than others," noted the CEA.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report said, while Europe will have a single
currency, the countries will maintain separate fiscal arrangements,
including their own tax policies and social service organizations.</P>
      <P>But the CEA stressed that the odds are against the euro's
"rapidly supplanting the dollar as the world's premier currency."</P>
      <P>An international currency is one that people use because everyone
else is using it. Two of the four determinants of reserve currency
status -- highly developed financial markets and historical inertia
-- support the dollar over the euro, explained the report.</P>
      <P>The third, economic size, is a tie (or will be if the United
Kingdom joins the EMU). The fourth, stable monetary policies, is also
a tie, as both Europe and the United States follow these policies
with the aim of keeping inflation low, said the CEA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MACEDONIAN PM STICKS TO DECISION ON TAIWAN TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski said on Friday that despite pressure from mainland China,
his government will not change its decision to establish diplomatic
ties with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Beijing can force Skopje to reverse its decision,
the prime minister acknowledged that there has been "certain
pressure."</P>
      <P>"However, the decision of the (Macedonian) government is very
clear," he added. "And we do not contemplate at this moment to
reverse it."</P>
      <P>He also said that his government hopes to continue cooperation
with mainland China and will not cut ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at Washington's National Press Club,
Georgievski shrugged off internal differences over Skopje's decision.</P>
      <P>He said that Macedonia is a democratic country with a strong
opposition, which "reacts to any decision by the government," he
said. "So in this respect, we are not much excited."</P>
      <P>Georgievski told reporters that seeking economic cooperation is
the main motive for recognizing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In cooperation with Taiwan we see an excellent opportunity to
accept their experience. Their companies can find space where they
can build factories, thus connecting their experience with our need
for foreign investment," he said.</P>
      <P>Forty percent of Macedonia's labor force is unemployed and 22
percent of the population live below the poverty line.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 27, Skopje and Taipei announced their decision to
establish diplomatic relations but Beijing apparently has not given
up hope that Macedonia might change its mind.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese officials have threatened over the last week
that, unless Skopje retracts its decision, Beijing might reconsider
an extension of the mandate for the UN Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP) in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>On this issue, Georgievski said that during his talks with US
leaders, he was assured that the presence of UNPREDEP not only
benefits Macedonia, but it is also required for the whole region.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that the international community should not
refuse to renew the UNPREDEP mandate at the United Nations Security
Council, where mainland China has the power of veto.</P>
      <P>The Security Council is expected in late February to consider
extending the UNPREDEP mandate which has been renewed every half year
since the force was first sent to the former Yugoslav republic in
March 1995.</P>
      <P>Composed mainly of US and Scandinavian troops, UNPREDEP's mission
is to prevent conflicts in other parts of former Yugoslavia from
spreading.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, the prime minister elaborated on the
concerns expressed by US Secretary Madeleine Albright over
Macedonia's decision to recognize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During their discussion on Wednesday, according to Georgievski,
Albright said that the decision "may create some complications for
Macedonia, especially in the United Nations," a point which he said
is "undoubtedly true."</P>
      <P>The US secretary of state expressed the opinion that, before
Macedonia made the independent decision, "wider international
consultation could have been made," he added.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the US State Department said that it favors
maintaining the UN force in Macedonia and opposes any linkage
between extending the mandate and Macedonia's recognition of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman James Rubin said also that Washington
does not take an official position on whether other countries should
recognize Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Less than eight months after its stunning
victory in parliamentary elections in Queensland, the One Nation
party is weakening, political analysts said.</P>
      <P>One Nation stunned Australian politics after a sweeping victory
in the June 13 election, in which the emerging party won 11 seats in
Queensland.</P>
      <P>Public polls show its support, mainly from grassroots levels in
the countryside, reached its zenith at over 13 percent across
Australia after the June election and One Nation became one of the
country's political forces.</P>
      <P>The rise of One Nation was the result of long-term frustration by
the grassroots over mainstream parties becuase these parties ignored
their pleas.</P>
      <P>One Nation's popularity started falling after Pauline Hanson, the
creator of the party, lost in her bid to be re-elected to the Federal
parliament for a second three-year term in an October 3 election. In
addition, her senior adviser and strategist -- David Oldfield -- also
failed in the same elections.</P>
      <P>Hanson, a fish and chip shop owner in Brisbane, won overnight
fame after being elected to the federal parliament and delivered a

people and multiculturalism.</P>
      <P>Hanson's controversial remarks were reported around the world,
with growing fears that Australia might return to the White Australia
Policy it followed in 1950s and 1960s.</P>
      <P>One month after Hanson's defeat, however, One Nation suffered its
first blow when one of its 11 MPs in Queensland quit the parliament,
and her new candidate also failed to win in a by-election to fill the
seat, causing the number of One Nation MPs to fall to 10.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, three more One Nation MPs from Queensland
have resigned after a wave of party infighting, accusing Hanson, now
party president, and her two senior advisers -- Oldfield and David
Ettridge -- of undemocratic practices in the party hierarchy and
financial management.</P>
      <P>The latest resignations also cost One Nation its status as a
political party because of its reduced numbers in the Queensland
parliament.

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Queensland Premier Peter Beattie is expected to decide whether to
strip One Nation of its Parliament House headquarters, staff and
funds when the parliament resumes next month.</P>
      <P>Hanson and Oldfield on Friday played down the party infighting,
telling reporters that their fledgling party was holding together
despite the latest resignations.</P>
      <P>But analysts said Hanson is distressed by the latest resignations

New South Wales.</P>
      <P>Analysts predict One Nation is facing its death if infighting
continues without any solution.</P>
      <P>In its editorial on Saturday, the Australian newspaper sums up in
its analysis:</P>
      <P>"One Nation was born from a political revolution sparked by Ms.
Hanson's complaints about the contemporary political system. It now
faces its own internal revolution which may deliver it democracy in
the most crucial step towards the party's long-term survival. If it

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG TYCOON GETS 3-YEAR-AND-2-MONTH JAIL TERM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court sentenced Hong
Kong business tycoon Lim Por-yen, who has been detained in Taiwan for
more than a year, to three years and two months in prison on Saturday
for his role in a bribery scandal.</P>
      <P>The court also required Lim, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Lai
Sun Group and a major shareholder of Hong Kong's Asia Television, to
pay an additional NT$30 billion (US$930,319) in bail in exchange for
the lifting of a ban on his departure from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lim, 88, was convicted of charges of bribery. The district court
verdict said Lim had offered US$4.14 million to Taipei County
government officials so that he could receive an exceptionally high
compensation, about NT$890 million, for the site of his Dollar
Textile Manufacturing Co. in Sanhsia, Taipei County, which was
conscripted to make way for the proposed National Taipei University.</P>
      <P>Lim was arrested in Taipei in December 1997 and was released on a
bail of NT$10 million on Jan. 19, 1998, but he was prohibited from
leaving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lim said after learning the court's decision that he is planning
to return to Hong Kong on Monday after paying the additional NT$30
million in bail. The businessman promised that he will respond to any
Taiwan court's summon in the future.</P>
      <P>Lim's lawyer said Lim will file an appeal with the Taiwan High
Court after receiving the district court verdict because the sentence
was not fair.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chuang Yu-kun, a former director of the Taipei County
Land Administration Bureau, was sentenced to 20 years in jail plus an
eight-year suspension of his civil rights for his role in the
National Taipei University land conscription scandal and another
bribery scandal involving the rezoning of a tract of land in Sanchih,
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The district court ordered the confiscation of US$4.14 million in
bribes given to Chuang by the Hong Kong business tycoon. The court
also rejected Chuang's application for bail.</P>
      <P>Chuang's in-law, Lin Chin-jung, received an 11-year prison
sentence plus a four-year suspension of his civil rights for
involvement in the Taipei University land conscription scandal.
Nevertheless, he was granted a NT$300,000 bail.</P>
      <P>Also convicted of two bribery charges were Lin Wen-nung, a
technician with the Taipei County Public Works Bureau, who received a
suspended one-year-and-two-month jail term; Cheng Ya-yun, an
entertainer, who received a two-year-and-10-month prison term plus a
two-year suspension of civil rights; and Lee Chen-tung, a business
executive, who got a suspended two-year prison term.</P>
      <P>Seven other suspects indicted by prosecution for involvement in
the two scandals were acquitted of the charges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA VICE MINISTER PLANS A VISIT TO MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
plans to send its Administrative Vice Minister Lin Yi-fu to
Macedonia, ROC's new ally in Europe, to learn about trade and
investment opportunities there.</P>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu is organizing an economic and
industrial delegation to visit the Balkan state later this month and
the MOEA planned to send Lin as its representative as a part of the
mission.</P>
      <P>However, members of the economic and trade delegation are still
awaiting final approval from Economic Minister Wang Chih-kang. If the
MOEA were to send a vice-minister level official to join the trip,
Lin -- who is responsible for economic and trade affairs -- will be
MOEA's representative, according to informed sources.</P>
      <P>A MOEA internal report pointed out that the economic recovery of
Macedonia hinges on its ability to attract foreign capital and its
determination in liberalization.</P>
      <P>The privatization of Macedonian state-run enterprises has been
successful. A total of 1,160 out of 1,261 state-owned enterprises
have completed the privatization process as of April 1998. However,
the managing and administrative powers of the enterprises are still
in the hands of their former managers. Foreign capital is therefore
needed to make a thorough reform of such operations.</P>
      <P>Seeing as Macedonia is in the vicinity of the European Union, the
world's second-largest market, Taiwan businessmen can use it as a
bridgehead for breaking into the European market if they invest in
Macedonia, noted Lin.</P>
      <P>As of date, Lin added, textile, machine and machine parts are
items worthy investments in Macedonia for Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>The MOEA vice minister further indicated that the total trade
volume between Taiwan and Macedonia up to present, has been rather
low: Taiwan's exports to Macedonia was valued at US$1.86 million in
1998, while Taiwan's imports from Macedonia was only to the tune of
US$593,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE KEY TO CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: KMT AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New   York,   Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By K. C. Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary-General John Chang said on Friday that continued
constructive dialogue between Taiwan and mainland China will ensure
peace and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks here at a lunch banquet sponsored by the
Asian Association in a speech on cross-strait ties after Taiwan's
elections in December 1998.</P>
      <P>The results of the elections are a reflection that the people of
Taiwan support the Republic of China government's policy toward
mainland China, Chang said, adding that it is apparent the KMT will
continue to play a dominant role in Taiwan's dealings with the
mainland and there will be no change in this role in the foreseeable
future.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the elections also helped clear up some facts
which include the Taiwan people's aspiration for democracy,
prosperity and a stable relationship with mainland China, and their
refusal to support political parties or candidates who advocate
"immediate unification," or "imminent independence," he noted.</P>
      <P>The poll results have also prompted the major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party to review its platform on Taiwan
independence amid the party's efforts to replace the KMT as Taiwan's
ruling party, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the "new Taiwanese" concept, all Taiwan residents
regardless of those born in Taiwan or the mainland who came to Taiwan
after 1949, have realized the importance of working together for
Taiwan's continued development and prosperity, he said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Taiwan people will never allow Beijing to
decide their future, Chang lamented Beijing's reluctance to forswear
its hostility toward Taiwan and its instance that Taiwan must unify
with mainland China under its conditions.</P>
      <P>Although Taipei differs from Beijing on the definition of "one
China," Chang asserted that the ROC government has never shifted away
from its "one China" principle. At present, Taiwan prefers to
maintain the status-quo to preserve its democratic system and
prosperity, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chang, at the head of a KMT delegation, flew into Washington D.C.
to attend the annual US prayer breakfast on Thursday. He will depart
for San Francisco on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although Chang has expressed a keen interest in visiting Madame
Chiang Kai-shek before leaving New York, the KMT secretary-general
said he is still awaiting Madame Chiang's reply.</P>

      <P>An ROC official stationed in South
Africa harshly criticized Beijing's human rights abuses and
suppression of democracy in a letter to a local newspaper on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-chue, head of the information section at the Taipei
Liaison Office in the Republic of South Africa, wrote a letter to the
editor in the largest-circulation daily, the Star.</P>
      <P>He urged the South African government, public and media to
protest the visit of mainland Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao, who
was in South Africa from Jan. 31-Feb. 4, for Beijing's atrocities
against human rights, freedom of speech and assembly. All such rights
are ensured in the South African constitution, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin is not
effectively committed to political reforms. According to Chen, Jiang
asserted in a December speech marking the 20th anniversary of the
mainland opening its doors, that the Chinese Communist Party will
hold onto the reigns of power and any element which poses a threat to
state security must be eliminated.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the arrests of several leading political dissidents
such as Wang Youcai and Hsiu Wenli late last year as example, Chen
said mainland authorities also imprisoned Lin Hai, a businessman in
Shanghai, on charges of leaking secret information to hostile foreign
organizations as part of their efforts to harass Internet users in
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen said Hu is one of the top Chinese Communist Party members

    <TEXT>
      <P>Liu Ping-hua, a deputy secretary-general of
the National Security Council (NSC), returned to Taipei early
Saturday to quell speculation about his abrupt departure for the
United States Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>The NSC issued a news release saying that Liu reported to duty
and met with NSC Secretary-General Yin Tsung-wen shortly after his
return.</P>
      <P>Liu, a younger brother of indebted Legislator Liu Ping-wei, left
for Los Angeles after his brother's financial woes were reported.</P>
      <P>Liu said he was originally scheduled to return to work on Monday.
"As my leave has caused concern and unnecessary speculation, I
decided to return to work in advance to silence speculation," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Liu, a former lawmaker, said he didn't meet with his debt-ridden
elder brother during his brief stay in Los Angeles. Nevertheless, Liu
said he believes his brother will be able to resolve his financial
difficulties after his current effort to seek funds in the US.</P>
      <P>Liu said he is sorry for all the disturbances and panic selling
in the Taiwan Stock Exchange triggered by his brother's check
defaults in the past few days.</P>
      <P>Liu said his elderly father, infuriated by his brother's improper
financial management, has suffered a relapse of his heart problems
and is now receiving medical treatment in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Liu Ping-wei, a former speaker of the now-abolished Taiwan
Provincial Assembly, has bounced checks totaling more than NT$120
million over the past three days and has some NT$1.7 billion worth of
checks due in the next couple of days. He left the island on
Wednesday night with a one-way ticket to Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>On appearing at the Los Angeles' Tom Bradley International
Airport on Thursday, Liu claimed that he was there to seek financial
assistance from his friends.</P>
      <P>"I came here to see several friends, hoping they will be able to
help me survive the financial crisis," Liu explained. "Just allow me
five days to find the money and I'll be back home to face all the
problems."</P>
      <P>Liu, whose family runs the lucrative Panchiao-based Hai Shan
Group in Taipei County, admitted on Thursday that he was responsible
for the entire crisis himself, stressing that his family's other
businesses remain unaffected by the crisis.</P>
      <P>Share prices for Advancetek Enterprise, the only Liu family
business to be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, have plunged
dramatically in recent days.</P>

      <P>Three lawmakers from the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party on Saturday accused the ruling
Kuomintang as the culprit for the unhealthy development of the Taiwan
Stock Exchange (Taiex).</P>
      <P>The lawmakers -- Chen Sheng-hung, Chen Chung-hsin and Lin
Feng-hsi -- said the KMT's Business Management Commission has long
been deeply involved local stock trading through the seven
investment holding companies under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>"The commission's complicated political and commercial
connections have sown seeds of political and economic crises in
Taiwan," the lawmakers said in a joint press release.</P>
      <P>The press statement said KMT-owned enterprises raked in
more than NT$12.5 billion in profits last year. "The amount was
five times the party's business earnings recorded five years ago. We
believe that KMT businesses have used their political clout for
windfall bonanza and that many of recent corporate financial crises
were related to KMT's business operations," the statement claimed.</P>
      <P>The three lawmakers demanded that all KMT businesses publicize
their financial reports and their stock trading records in recent
days in line with the Ministry of Finance's requirement of all
listed companies to keep their financial status transparent.</P>
      <P>They voiced strong opposition to KMT enterprises' involvement in
the local stock market, saying such operations would only destroy
normal market mechanism.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers also opposed the involvement of special government
funds in the stock trading because such activities violate fair
market rules.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the lawmakers said the Finance Ministry should not
suspend the stock transaction tax under pressure from KMT-affiliated
business heavyweights. "What the ministry should do is to work out a
comprehensive package of measures to promote structural market and
taxation reforms to ensure healthy development of local capital
markets and maintain domestic financial stability," the statement
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 300 textile workers staged a
demonstration Saturday in Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, because
they have not received any payment since last October from their
former employer.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and

      <P>The information center said that the number of workers laid off by
state-run enterprises will increase to 2.7 million next year from

    <TEXT>Today is Sunday, Jan. 7, or the 22nd day of
the 12th month of the Year of the Tiger according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1792: Austria and Prussia sign a military pact against France.

1812: Charles Dickens, the great English novelist who wrote a
number of well-loved classics like "Oliver Twist" and "David
Copperfield," is born.

1886: George Walker, an English carpenter, strikes gold in the
Transvaal in South Africa while building a cottage for a prospector.

1948: Liaoning Province falls into the hands of Chinese communist
troops.

1955: ROC government troops begin to evacuate the Tachen Islands.

1968: The ROC's Ministry of Education agrees on the establishment

of office.

1985: The Executive Yuan approves the project to make Yushan a
National Park.

1986: Both Ferdinand E. Marcos and his chief election opponent

into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 189 aboard.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Perfectly honest men I do not
expect to see; I could only meet with scrupulous men I would be
satisfied. But in a state of society in which men must pretend to
possess what they really do not possess; pretend to have plenty, when
they have really nothing; and pretend to be in affluence when they
are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is difficult to
be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In fiscal 1998 the United States was
contracted to sell US$441 million worth of arms to Taiwan, according
to a report soon to be sent to the US Congress by the US Department
of Defense.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the fourth-largest buyer of US military equipment and
services, behind Saudi Arabia, Israel and Greece.</P>
      <P>The US Department of Defense said that as of year ending Sept.
30, 1998, the United States had delivered a total of US$1.5 billion
worth of arms and equipment to Taiwan, mainly F-16 fighters, which
the United States agreed to sell to Taiwan during the Bush
administration.</P>
      <P>Major items the United States agreed to sell to Taiwan in fiscal
1998 included 61 Stinger missile systems worth US$180 million, 131
MK46 torpedoes worth US$69 million and 58 Harpoon anti-ship missiles
worth US$101 million. The package sale, with a combined value of
US$350 million, was announced last Aug. 28.</P>
      <P>After the Pentagon announced the sale, however, Taiwan decided to
reduce the number of Stinger missile systems it would purchase. The
United States suggested last year that after Taiwan acquires such
sophisticated weaponry as Mirage-2000 and F-16 fighters, it should
focus on integrating software rather than acquiring more hardware.</P>
      <P>According to the Pentagon, the United States agreed in fiscal
1998 to sell US$2.2 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, US628
million to Israel, US$531 million to Greece, US$441 million to Taiwan
and US$348 million to Japan.</P>
      <P>The five countries to which the most US arms were actually
delivered in fiscal 1998 were Saudi Arabia, which received US$3.9
billion worth; Israel, US$1.6 billion; Taiwan, US$1.5 billion; South
Korea, US$956 million; and Egypt, US$585 million.</P>
      <P>According to the report to the US Congress by the US Department
of Defense, the United States agreed to sell US$354 million worth of
arms to Taiwan in 1997, while the actual value of arms delivered that

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER WARNS AGAINST SPREADING RUMORS AIMED AT BRINGING DOWN BOURSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew vowed on Sunday to
track down people who are spreading rumors aimed at bringing down
stock prices on the local bourse, said government spokesman Chen
Chien-jen.</P>
      <P>Siew presided on Sunday over a preliminary meeting of Taiwan
finance and economics officials that comes before a full-scale
economic conference, to be held Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who briefed reporters after the meeting, said that Siew
reiterated the government's determination to maintain order in the
financial market and to root out rumormongers who are spreading false
information in hopes of causing panic selling.</P>
      <P>A task force set up under the Ministry of Justice has been asked
by Siew to step up their efforts to stop the spread of rumors by
picking up those who circulate them. Many of the rumors being spread
involve well known tycoons or business groups, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's bourse never fully recovered from last year's regional
financial storm and has seen further declines recently because of a
series of high-profile business failures.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange's benchmark weighted stock index surged
more than 235 points on Saturday after sinking to a 13-year low on
Friday. The decline came despite government moves to shore up the
market.</P>
      <P>Siew was quoted as saying at Sunday's meeting that as much as the
government would like to reinvigorate the sagging economy, it will
never try to bail out businesses that went under because of
imprudent, high-leverage investments or ventures financed largely
through loans rather than by capital raised through selling shares.</P>
      <P>Siew in his remarks was referring to Advancetek Co., owned by
business tycoon and newly elected Legislator Liu Ping-wei. Advancetek
tumbled after Liu bounced checks worth more than a hundred million
dollars and flew to the United States on Feb. 3.</P>
      <P>Friday's conference will be attended by President Lee Teng-hui,
as well as by 50 to 60 business leaders and about 20 lawmakers and
will be aimed at generating ideas on how to lift Taiwan out of its
current economic doldrums.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOHN CHANG SAYS TAIWAN NOT USING "DEMOCRACY CARD" TO DELAY REUNIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee and  Huang Kuan-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A top official from Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang on Saturday rejected allegations by mainland China that
Taiwan is "playing its democracy card" to postpone China's
unification.</P>
      <P>"It's ridiculous to say that the Republic of China is playing the
democracy card," said KMT Secretary-General John Chang at a dinner
party held in his honor by Teng Shen-sheng, director of Taiwan's
representative office in New York.</P>
      <P>Recounting the commitment of various ROC leaders to democracy,
Chang said that the late President Chiang Kai-shek urged the building
of Taiwan as "a model province of China featuring the 'Three
Principles of the People' initiated by Dr. Sun yet-sen, while the
late President Chiang Ching-kuo called for the unification of China
under the Three Principles.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added, incumbent President Lee Teng-hui has set
forth Taiwan's "Guidelines for National Unification," which calls
for a united China under freedom, democracy, and an equal
distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>He said that ROC leaders have been consistently pursuing a free
and democratic system in Taiwan with the hope of "having a positive
influence" on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang said that nothing concrete could be achieved through
negotiations between Taiwan and the mainland if both sides cannot
stand on an equal footing and if the differences between them cannot
be solved.</P>
      <P>"China cannot be unified with two totally different systems on
both sides. It's impossible to ask Taiwan to back off from its
democratization process, or even to implement communism to
accommodate itself to the mainland's system," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang was in New York as head of a Taiwan delegation to last
Thursday's prayer breakfast meeting at the White House.</P>
      <P>In an earlier meeting with leaders of New York's Chinese
community, Chang said that the ROC government is determined to
safeguard its existence and its people's interests, and it will
continue to stand firmly against Taiwan independence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Of all the prospective candidates in
Taiwan's next presidential election in 2000, current Vice President
Lien Chan is the one best able to deal with the crucial issues that
will affect the future of the Republic of China, according to survey
results released on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Shih Hsin University, which asked
political opinion leaders, namely legislators and National Assembly
deputies, about their views on the presidential election in 2000.</P>
      <P>In the survey 63.8 percent of respondents said cross-strait
relations will be the main issue affecting the future development of
the Republic of China, while 20.7 percent said the economy will be
the main issue and 5.4 percent said it would be the island's
political environment.</P>
      <P>Respondents were asked to assess the ability of various people to
deal with these issues. Lien was thought to be capable of improving
cross-strait relations by 47.4 percent of respondents. Moreover, 54.4
percent said Lien would be able to improve the island's economy and
38.9 percent said he could ensure Taiwan's political environment
remains stable.</P>
      <P>Lien's ratings on all three fronts were far higher than those of
other prospective presidential candidates.</P>
      <P>Some 91.9 percent of those surveyed said that they believe the
ruling Kuomintang would nominate Lien as its presidential candidate,
while 82.8 percent said they believe the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will nominate as its candidate former Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Fifty-three percent of respondents said Lien is the most suitable
presidential candidate for the KMT, while 23.5 percent selected
former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong as the party's best
choice. Meanwhile, 60.2 percent of respondents said Chen is the best
choice for the DPP, while former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang was
chosen by 17.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Some 15.4 percent of respondents said that if Soong is not
nominated by the KMT, he will run on his own.</P>
      <P>As for his personal attributes, Lien was noted for his stable
personality (36.9 percent), vision (35.4 percent), and tolerance
(30.3 percent). But he was said to lack amicability (46.7 percent),
not favored by the media (30.9 percent), and to lack charisma (26.4
percent).</P>
      <P>Chen's merits include his resolution in solving problems (58.7
percent), his charisma (35.1 percent) and the fact that he is well
liked by the media (29.7 percent). He was faulted, however, for being
narrow minded (34.4 percent), arbitrary in his practices (29.4
percent), and mean (27.6 percent).</P>
      <P>Soong was lauded for his amicability (45.8 percent), his charisma
(34.2 percent), and for being well liked by the media (27.9 percent).
But he was said to be unstable (38.1 percent), narrow minded (23.7
percent), and arbitrary (22.8 percent).</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Jan. 8 and Feb. 3 and
administered to 537 people. Of that number, 332 provided valid

    <HEADLINE>VFA AGREEMENT WILL NOT HELP PHILIPPINES IN SPRATLY ROW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Contrary to claims by Philippine President
Joseph Ejercito Estrada, the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) is
practically useless in the territorial conflict in the Spratly
Islands, since the United States does not recognize the disputed area
as part of the country's territory.</P>
      <P>This surfaced in Friday's Senate hearing on the VFA. The
Philippine Senate is considered a bastion of support for the
controversial agreement.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon said while being
questioned during the day's hearing that the Philippines cannot count
on US assistance in resolving the dispute over the islands since the
area is not listed in the VFA as Philippine territory.</P>
      <P>Noting that the conflict involving the islands does not fall
under the provisions of the VFA, Siazon said, "The US will not go to
war just because of the presence of armada of warships in the reef."</P>
      <P>An earlier defense agreement, signed in 1951, also fails to
identify the Spratlys as Philippine territory. The country did not
lay claim to the supposedly oil-rich island chain until 1973.</P>
      <P>Estrada has previously argued that the VFA would provide an
effective deterrent against foreign invasion, particularly against
mainland China's recent intrusions into Mischief Reef, an area within
the Spratly Islands.</P>

I never do. I read and learn everything and, choosing that which is
excellent, I adopt it; I see everything and take note of what I see:
that is, perhaps, next to having a great understanding."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan credit card holders charged a record

unaffected by the regional economic slowdown in Asia, the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Charges by credit card holders for the first 11 months of 1998
totaled NT$439.26 billion (US$13.64 billion), the highest level ever
seen in Taiwan since the introduction of credit cards in 1989.</P>
      <P>Credit card charges in Taiwan totaled NT$64.84 billion (US$2
billion) in 1992, NT$94.99 billion (US$2.95 billion) in 1993 and
NT$100 billion (US$3.1 billion) in 1994, according to MOF tallies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Macedonian Information Minister
Rezxep Zllatku reaffirmed on Monday that his country will not change
its decision to forge full diplomatic ties with the Republic of
China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zllatku, who headed a 30-member press delegation to Taipei on
Sunday for a six-day visit, made the statement after meeting with
Chen Chien-jen, director-general of the Government Information
Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>This is Zllatku's first visit to Taiwan since the two countries
established formal diplomatic relations on Jan. 27.</P>
      <P>Zllatku told local reporters that the establishment of official
ROC-Macedonian links is an unexpected joyful event for Macedonian
people.</P>
      <P>"Even though some different views were heard in Macedonia, the
majority of our people are happy with forging diplomatic ties with
the ROC," Zllatku said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that some Macedonian people's opposition to the new
ties has nothing to do with the ROC. "The opposition was
basically a partisan strife," Zllatku said, adding that such
domestic political wrangling will not affect future development
of ROC-Macedonian relationship.</P>
      <P>Asked about mainland China's intention to use its clout in the
United Nations Security Council to veto a proposed extension of the
mandate for the UN Preventive Deployment (UNPREDEP) force in
Macedonia, Zllatku said he does not think that a big power like
mainland China would really block the deployment of UN
peacekeeping force in his country to retaliate against the
establishment of ROC-Macedonian ties.</P>
      <P>Noting that maintaining world peace is the UN's main function,
Zllatku said the UNPREDEP force has contributed much to safeguarding
stability in the Balkan Peninsula and that many big powers,
including the United States, support the extension of the UN
mandate.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, GIO Director-General Chen refuted
an allegation that the ROC has offered economic aid to "bribe"
Macedonia to forge ties with it.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC itself received financial aid from the United
States in the 1950s and 1960s. "We have never regarded such aid as a
bribe. It's a mutually beneficial assistance. We believe that such a
formula can be applied to our ties with Macedonia," Chen added.</P>
      <P>During their stay, Zllatku and his group will call on government
officials and visit the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park as
well as other economic and cultural institutions.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is convinced that the Macedonian media delegation's

    <HEADLINE>OCTOGENARIAN TYCOON EXPECTING TO RETURN TO HK AFTER PAYING BAIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong business tycoon Lim Por-yen on
Monday visited the Taipei District Court, where he paid NT$30 million
(US$931,670) in bail in exchange for the lifting of a ban preventing
his departure from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lim, 88, was arrested in Taipei in December 1997 on charges of
bribery. He was released on a bail of NT$10 million (US$310,550) on
Jan. 19, 1998 after being detained for 34 days. Since his release,
however, he has been prohibited from leaving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Monday's additional bail payment, however, has cleared the way
for his departure.</P>
      <P>Lim, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Lai Sun Group and a major
shareholder of Hong Kong's Asia Television, said he will leave Taiwan
for home on Wednesday or Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court convicted Lim on Feb. 6 of offering
US$4.14 million to Taipei County government officials to ensure he
would be compensated to the tune of nearly NT$900 million for land he
owned that was to be used as the site for a new university, National
Taipei University.</P>
      <P>Located in Sanhsia in Taipei County, the plot of land was the
site of Lim's Dollar Textile Manufacturing Co., which went out of
business several years ago.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 6 he received a jail term of three years and two months,
although the court agreed to lift his travel ban for the sum of NT$30
million.</P>
      <P>Lim's lawyer, however, said Lim will file an appeal with the
Taiwan High Court because the sentence is too harsh.</P>
      <P>After learning of the court's decision, Lim promised to come back
to Taiwan whenever summoned by the court, provided he is allowed to
return to Hong Kong soon.</P>
      <P>Chuang Yu-kun, a former director of the Taipei County Land
Administration Bureau, was sentenced to 20 years in jail plus an
eight-year suspension of his civil rights for his role in the
scandal. Chuang was convicted of illegally authorizing the rezoning
of the land on which Lim's textile plant was located.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO DISPATCH DELEGATION TO MOURN KING HUSSEIN'S DEATH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Monday extended its condolences over the death of Jordan's King
Hussein and announced plans to dispatch a special delegation in the
next few days to Amman to mourn the king's passing.</P>
      <P>MOFA noted in a written statement that King Hussein had ruled
Jordan for 46 years. While in power, King Hussein not only dedicated
himself to the development of Jordan's economy, but also strived for
peace in the Middle East. He also won the love of the Jordanian
people, the statement said.</P>
      <P>With his death, not only does Jordan lose an intelligent leader,
but the international community loses a peace-loving friend, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>King Hussein visited the Republic of China in 1959. Throughout
his life, King Hussein was friendly toward the Republic of China, and
the two nations have enjoyed a strong relationship, the statement
said, adding that the ROC government is deeply saddened by the king's
death.</P>
      <P>King Hussein conferred his eldest son Abdullah with the title of
crown price on Jan. 24. Abdullah was crowned king Sunday after the
death of his father.</P>
      <P>The Western-educated Abdullah has visited the Republic of China
three times and is very friendly toward the Republic of China. He
also values the establishment of cooperative relations with the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China believes that the two countries will
maintain substantial relations after Abdullah establishes himself in
his father's place and hopes bilateral ties will be further
strengthened, the statement said.</P>
      <P>King Hussein died of heart failure Sunday afternoon, Taiwan time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TASK FORCE SET UP TO CLEAN UP INDUSTRIAL WASTE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will establish a task force to treat mercury-laced waste
recently discovered in southern Taiwan, the administration's director
Tsai Hsung-hsiung said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The ad hoc group, composed of officials from relevant agencies
under the EPA, will be headed by EPA Deputy Administrator Lin
Ta-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Tsai also ordered local environmental protection authorities in
the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas to join forces with the
cabinet-level task force to immediately begin with the cleaning
mission. The special group will also be in charge of carrying out
damage-control countermeasures after locating the whereabouts of
industrial waste.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed grave concern over the illegal dumping of
mercury-tainted industrial waste recently found in the water
resources of conservation areas in the southern region. Condemning
such immoral acts, the EPA head attributed the deplorable situation
to relevant authorities' lax control and inspections in the past.</P>
      <P>To prevent the situation from deteriorating and becoming a public
threat, Tsai said the ad hoc group will announce the results of its
investigation as soon as possible to give people a first-hand

    <HEADLINE>NSC SIGNS US$83 MILLION CONTRACT WITH DSS ON ROCSAT-2</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) on Monday
signed a contract with the German-based Dornier Satelliten Systeme
GmbH (DSS) to build a satellite bus and remote sensing payload for
ROCSAT-2.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-2 is scheduled to be launched in 2002, becoming the first
Taiwan-owned satellite with practical functions such as helping
agricultural planning and land use. ROCSAT-1, which was launched
successfully at Cape Canaveral, Florida in January, is mainly used
for scientific research.</P>
      <P>The signing ceremony took place at the NSC offices in Taipei.
Representing their respective sides, NSC Chairman Hwang Jenn-tai and
Vice Chairman Tsai Ching-yen along with DSS Executive Vice President
Hubeert Hofmann and head of Contract Department Gerhard Lotz signed
the agreement.</P>
      <P>Witnessing the event were Hsu Chia-ming, director of NSC's
National Space Program Office, its deputy director Wang Hung-chi, as
well as DSS director of the ROCSAT-2 program Bernhard Doll.</P>
      <P>The DSS won the bid at price of US$83 million to build the
satellite bus and remote sensing payload in January. The entire
ROCSAT-2 project has a price tag of around NT$4 billion (US$123
million) which also includes the ground control station and launch
vehicle.</P>
      <P>Hofmann said DSS will do everything possible to ensure the
project proceeds smoothly. He expressed the hope that during the
process of cooperation, each side will meet the needs of the other.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-2 was approved as a low-orbit remote sensing satellite
by the Executive Yuan in October 1997. The NSC National Space Program
Office then formed a task force and completed its needs analysis, its
definition of the mission and its system design.</P>
      <P>Bilateral cooperation will formally start March 1, and its
research and manufacturing is expected to be completed by September
2001, and will then undergo tests by the Space Program Office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TWO-WAY TRADE WITH ASIA SOAR REMARKABLY IN JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's two-way trade with Asian countries
soared in January leading to regained momentum in overall foreign
trade during the month, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to Asia in January made up 46.5 percent of the
island's overall exports last month, marking a six-month high since
last June. Meanwhile, imports from Asia constituted 52.9 percent of
the island's overall imports, a new high since 1994, according to MOF
statistics.</P>
      <P>The country's foreign trade is expected to resume steady growth
this year if there are no major setbacks affecting trade in months to
come, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>Battered by the Asian economic crisis, Taiwan's exports plunged
9.4 percent in 1998 from the year-earlier level, while the imports
fell 8.5 percent.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that Taiwan's foreign trade will regain its momentum
in the second half of 1999 on the grounds that the international and
regional economic slowdowns are bottoming out, while domestic
investment and consumption from the private sector are expected to
turn brisk later this year, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$9.81 billion worth of goods and services in
January this year, up 28.8 percent over the year-earlier level, while
imported US$9.29 billion worth of commodities, up 24.1 percent, MOF
tallies showed.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan posted a surplus of US$520 million in
January, up 292 percent or US$390 million from the same month of the
previous year.</P>
      <P>The MOF attributed the marked growth in January mainly to a lower
basis of comparison from January 1998 which posted a low in two-way
trade due to the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>In January, Taiwan's exports to members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations rose 21 percent from the year-earlier level,
while imports from Europe jumped 25 percent. Taiwan's surplus with
the United States and Hong Kong, meanwhile, increased US$610 million
and US$570 million respectively in the month, MOF officials said.</P>

the newly forged ROC-Macedonian relationship a showcase of mutually
beneficial cooperation in southern Europe.</P>
      <P>"We'll join forces with Macedonia to make our new ties a
successful model for bilateral cooperation with a view to attracting
other countries in southern Europe to cultivate friendly cooperative
ties with us," said Lee.</P>
      <P>He divulged that ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu will head a
delegation of government officials and business executives to visit
Macedonia later this month to shore up bilateral relationship and to
inspect market situation and general bsuiness climate there.</P>
      <P>"I myself will also lead a group of industry and commerce
executives to Macedonia in late March to look into that country's
investment climate and regulations as well as to explore trade and
investment opportunities," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macedonia is close to the main European market and
has well-developed infrastructure and low-cost labor force, Lee said
he believes that Taiwan entrepreneurs will be able to find market
niches or profitable investment opportunities there.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to
invite Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski to visit Taiwan
in the first half of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEVELOPMENT OF PUDONG PUT ON HOLD TO PROTECT HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has put on hold the development
of Shanghai's industrial area of Pudong as a financial center and
regional hub for multinationals to avoid undermining Hong Kong during
the current economic recession, The Hong Kong Standard reported
Monday.</P>
      <P>Beijing, the report said, fears that the further upgrading of
Pudong at this stage will put more pressure on the Special
Administrative Region during a very difficult period.</P>
      <P>"With support from top leaders, including President and Communist
Party chief Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, the Shanghai
municipal government had been working on a plan to turn Pudong into
an attractive area for multinationals to house their regional
headquarters," the report quoted sources as saying.</P>
      <P>But Beijing has put these plans on hold for fear their aggressive
efforts would undermine Hong Kong's status as a regional business
hub.</P>
      <P>The blueprint for Shanghai's development has drawn on the
experiences and policies of Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo.
Development plans have included a fundamental restructuring of
Pudong's legal, economic, financial, banking, foreign exchange,
investment and trade sectors to make the city as competitive as the
ones on which it is modeled.</P>
      <P>If the proposal had been endorsed by Beijing and implemented
immediately, it would give Pudong a very special status in the
mainland's economy in the next millennium, said sources, pointing out
that the district would enjoy more privileges than those granted by
Beijing to its five Special Economic Zones in the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>Under the development plans, restrictions would be removed on the
free movement of capital, goods and personnel for conglomerates based
in Pudong. Multinationals would also be allowed to conduct foreign
trade and divert their investments to other businesses or mainland
cities without formal approval from government agencies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI WILL NOT PUT RESTRICTIONS ON WANG'S TAIWAN VISIT: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei will not put any restrictions on the
topics to be discussed when mainland China's top negotiator with
Taiwan comes to the island for a visit, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Chairman Su Chi said on Monday.</P>
      <P>However, he added that political discussions alone will not help
the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), agreed to pay a reciprocal visit to
Taiwan after meeting in mainland China with his Taiwan counterpart
Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, last
October.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will not be able to make the trip to Taiwan before
May despite that he hopes to do so some time this spring. Su said Wang
is welcome to visit the island at any time, even in December when the
island will be preparing for the 2000 presidential elections. The MAC
head said a visit at that time would not disturb the election
campaign process.</P>
      <P>Su said the MAC, which charters the nation's mainland policy, is
open to the timing, agenda and itinerary of the high-level,
cross-strait meeting.</P>
      <P>ARATS should send vice secretary-general level officials to
Taiwan to work out the details of Wang's trip so both sides can avoid
any misunderstanding, Su said. He added that the MAC hopes Wang can
see as much as possible during his first visit to Taiwan in five
decades, including calling on SEF and MAC, but he said he would
respect Wang's wishes.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that Wang's visit to Taiwan will be significant,
indicating that cross-strait relations are back on track after
Beijing's intimidation tactics during the last presidential election
in 1996.</P>
      <P>The MAC chairman expressed the hope that the agenda could cover
every field, and not just political issues and the three direct links
-- trade, postal, transportation links -- between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait. Su noted that discussions on political issues and
direct links will not be conducive to the development of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during an interview by a local broadcasting
station on Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN 4TH-LARGEST US ARMS BUYER IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Defense signed
military equipment contracts to Taiwan valued at $441 million for the
fiscal year 1998, according to the current issue of the US Arms Trade
News.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the fourth-largest US arms buyer for the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30, 1998, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The Washington-based monthly publication quoted Pentagon
documents as saying that the United States agreed to sell arms worth
$8.5 billion last year and delivered a total of $13.9 billion in
weapons.</P>
      <P>It said Taiwan received $1.5 billion in US weaponry last year,
most of which resulted from the delivery of F-16 fighters the United
States agreed to sell during the Bush administration.</P>
      <P>The $8.5 billion in total US arms sales commitments for fiscal
year 1998 is the lowest level since before the Berlin Wall fell in
1989. The total for fiscal 1998 represents only one-fourth the value
of contracts signed in 1993, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The decline in weapon sales can be attributed to several factors,
including the global economic downturn and an arms glut in many
regions.</P>
      <P>Saudi Arabia was the largest US arms customer in 1998 with $2.2
billion in weapons commitments. Israel ranked second with arms
purchases valued at $628 million, and Greece ranked third with $531
million.</P>
      <P>Saudi Arabia also took delivery of the most military equipment
shipped by the United States last year with imports valued at $3.9
billion.</P>
      <P>Israel received $1.6 billion in arms for fiscal year 1998 from
the United States, while Taiwan ranked third with $1.5 billion.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of aborigines from the eastern
Taiwan county of Hualien on Monday demanded the state-run Taiwan
Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) return to them a large area of land in the
county's Fenglin township.</P>
      <P>About 50 indigenous people, wearing headbands and carrying
posters, demonstrated in front of the Taisugar headquarters in
downtown Taipei with their demand.</P>
      <P>The aborigines said Taisugar has illegally occupied their land
near the Wanli Bridge in Fenglin over the past 50 years. "We demand
that Taisugar return the land to us as soon as possible; otherwise,
we'll continue our protest," said an aboriginal representative.</P>
      <P>Over the past decades, Taisugar has developed the land into a
sugarcane farm.</P>
      <P>A Taisugar spokesman said the land belonged to Yenshuikang Sugar
Co. during the era of Japanese colonial rule. The ROC government
assigned the land to Taisugar after it reclaimed control of Taiwan at
the end of the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan in 1945, he
added.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the spokesman said, Taisugar has paid taxes for
the land in accordance with government regulations. "We have not
illegally occupied any public land or aborigine-owned land."</P>
      <P>The spokesman suggested that the aborigines file a petition
either with the Ministry of the Interior or local-level governments,
asking them to help resolve their housing problems.</P>
      <P>The Taisugar executive recalled that the company sold two pieces
of land, totaling 25 hectares, in Fenglin to the interior ministry
and the Taiwan Provincial Government in 1990 and 1996, respectively.
The land lots have since be designated as special land reserved for
aborigines.</P>
      <P>"We hope those who demonstrated at our company today will switch
their petition targets to rightful government agencies, such as the
interior ministry or local governments," the spokesman added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DGBAS REVISES TAIWAN'S 1998 ECONOMIC GROWTH DOWNWARD TO 4.83%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy in 1998 grew by 4.83
percent, a drop from the government's previous estimate, according to
statistics made public by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) on Monday.</P>
      <P>The revised economic growth rate was 0.3 percent lower than
government's latest estimate and was the lowest level since 1983,
said officials of the DGBAS under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials also predicted that the island's economic growth
in 1999 would only reach 4.74 percent.</P>
      <P>This is the first official estimate made by a domestic government
organization anticipating a worse economic performance this year than
in 1998.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS's economic growth estimate is also lower than those
made by private organizations. It highlights the fact that in the
face of the Asian monetary storm, the DGBAS is reacting with
prudence.</P>
      <P>The goal set by the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) is an annual economic growth of 5.5 percent in 1999. Against
this backdrop, the DGBAS' estimate hinted that CEPD's goal would not
be achieved.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, director general of the Government Information
Office (GIO), stressed that amid the effects of the Asian financial
turmoil, Taiwan's economic performance has been decent compared with
the performance of other Asian neighbors.</P>
      <P>Singapore and Japan registered zero and negative 2.7 percent
economic growth in 1998 respectively, pointed out the government
spokesman.</P>
      <P>In view of Taiwan's financial woes, Premier Vincent Siew met with
top finance and economic officials on Sunday at the Taipei
International Convention Center to prepare for an economic conference
this Friday. Conference members will discuss the economic problems
Taiwan is facing and ways best to deal with them.</P>

      <P>Stressing that his goal was to transform the New Party into a

      <P>Claiming that the New Party will begin to improve itself by

climate has effectively buttressed the importance of the New Party's
existence, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee also emphasized that the New Party will strengthen its

    <HEADLINE>9 MAINLAND HIJACKERS SENT TO KINMEN FOR REPATRIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan sent nine convicted mainland Chinese
hijackers to an island fortress near the southeastern mainland coast
on Monday in preparation for repatriating them via ship on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The nine hijackers, who were on parole after serving jail terms
in Taiwan, were sent to Kinmen by a chartered plane amid tight
security.</P>
      <P>They will be repatriated from Kinmen via a ship to be
dispatched by mainland China's Red Cross Society from its
southeastern port city of Xiamen on Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>Political observers said the repatriation is a goodwill gesture
to Beijing in the run-up to a planned visit to Taipei by mainland
China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, later this year.
Wang's visit will be a reciprocal event to his Taiwan counterpart
Koo Chen-fu's ice-breaking visit to the mainland last October.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of the semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and a number of police officers
from the Criminal Investigation Bureau, escorted the nine paroled
mainland hijackers to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The nine were Liu Baocai, Shi Yuebo, Yang Mingde, Wang Zhihua,
Luo Changhua, Wang Yuing, Zou Weiqiang, Li Xiangyu and Lin Wenqiang.
Worrying about their fates after their return to the mainland, the
nine hijacking convicts looked grim and kept mum throughout their
flight from Taipei to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Yang even refused to leave his seat after the plane arrived at
the Kinmen airport, and had to be removed under police guard.</P>
      <P>A mainland Chinese Red Cross Society ferry boat is scheduled to
arrive in Kinmen on Tuesday morning to take back the nine convicts.
Mainland Red Cross Society personnel and SEF officials will exchange
relevant documents and complete some formalities before the
hijackers' return.</P>
      <P>This will be the second time that Taiwan repatriates mainland
hijackers by this way. Two of the 17 people involved in hijackings of
mainland commercial airliners to Taiwan, most of which occurred
between April 1993 and June 1994, were sent back to the mainland via
Kinmen in July 1997 following extensive discussion between SEF and
its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of a binding agreement on the issue, Beijing
declined to inform Taipei of the fate of the hijackers, who stood
trial in a mainland court after their return to the mainland. Beijing
does not recognize judicial rulings handed down by Taipei.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan said he will hand over to
mainland Red Cross Society personnel documents detailing the nine
hijackers' trials, sentences and time served in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland judicial authorities will respect these
hijackers' basic human rights and give them lenient treatment since
they have already served prison terms in Taiwan," Jan said.</P>
      <P>He again urged ARATS on Saturday to seal a bilateral agreement
to regulate the repatriation of cross-strait hijackers and other
criminal suspects.</P>
      <P>Without a formal agreement, Jan said the repatriation of mainland
hijackers can be processed only on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>In May 1997, mainland China repatriated Taiwanese hijacker Liu
Shan-chung, who forced a domestic flight to the southeastern mainland
port city of Xiamen in March 1997.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, two children -- Luo Wanghuan and Yang Yang -- who
were brought to Taiwan by their parents in two separate hijackings
from the mainland were repatriated by air through Hong Kong on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Luo Wanghuan is the son of hijackers Luo Changhua and Wang Yuing,
while Yang Yang's parents, also air pirates, are Yang Mingde and Han
Fenging. Luo's parents and Yang Yang's father will among the nine
hijackers to be repatriated by ship on Tuesday. Yang Yang's mother,
Han Fengyin was repatriated in 1997 after serving a jail term here.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY TO SURPASS 1997 LEVEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than one year into the Asian financial
crisis, Taiwan's economy is forecast to recover this year to exceed
1997 levels in terms of gross national product (GNP), according to a
government prediction released on Monday.</P>
      <P>The prediction, made by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), put Taiwan's GNP at US$286.4
billion in 1999, a moderate rise from US$262.3 billion in 1998, and
almost the same as the US$284.8 billion recorded for 1997.</P>
      <P>That means the regional financial storm has set the island's
economy back only one year, said Director-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics Wei Duan.</P>
      <P>The figure, calculated on assumptions of an economic growth of
4.74 percent and a consumer price inflation rate of 1.58 percent,
will translate into a per capita income of US$13,016.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that although the island's GNP dipped in
1998 as a result of the regional financial turmoil, its economy still
grew by 4.83 percent, which is better than the forecast for this year
but still worse than expected.</P>
      <P>Wei laid the blame for the less-than-expected growth on last
year's persistent decline in private investment which, as a
percentage of the island's total investment, decreased from 39
percent in the first quarter, to 19.8 percent in the second quarter,
11.7 percent in the third quarter, and 3.8 percent in the fourth
quarter.</P>
      <P>The credit crunch following the high-profile failure of several
well-known companies last year also aggravated the slowdown in
economic expansion, said Wei.</P>
      <P>The 4.83 percent growth in 1998 ranked the island 15th in global
terms, which is three spots behind the 12th place the island enjoyed
in the previous year, Wei said.</P>
      <P>However, he added, Taiwan should take comfort in the fact that it
was much better than its Asian neighbors. The Philippines had only
0.3 percent growth; Singapore had zero growth; Malaysia and South
Korea each had negative 6 percent growth; Thailand had negative 7.2
percent growth; and Indonesia's growth was negative 13.5 percent.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan reaches its estimated growth of 4.74 percent, it should
rise to 13th in the world in 1999, the DGBAS said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,   Feb.   8  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The former chairman of Taiwan's
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Shih Ming-teh, met on
Monday met with a leading Singapore opposition leader following the
latter's release from jail.</P>
      <P>Shih said at a press conference after the meeting in a hotel room
that he visited Chee Soon Juan to extend his "concern, encouragement
and support" to an old friend.</P>
      <P>Chee, secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP),
said that he was surprised and honored to meet the renowned Taiwan
politician, who himself served time for his political beliefs.</P>
      <P>Chee was found guilty of breaking Singapore's public speech law
by delivering a speech in public without a permit on December 29. He
was fined S$1,400, but refused to pay the fine and chose instead to
serve a seven-day jail term.</P>
      <P>Shih, who spent 25 years in Taiwan prisons and is now a
legislator, said that in meeting Chee, he definitely had no intention
of "interfering in or criticizing Singapore's internal affairs."</P>
      <P>He praised Singapore for its economic development, sound social
welfare and public housing policies, and infrastructure construction,
saying that these achievements are greatly admired by the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that as a former political prisoner, he can fully
understand the pain suffered by those who are deprived of the freedom
of speech, and therefore cherishes very much the concern of others.</P>
      <P>Chee, who will face another court trial on a similar charge on
Tuesday, said that Shih's visit gave him moral support in his
struggle for human rights and freedom of speech for Singaporeans.</P>

environment in the European country.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks following talks with visiting Macedonian
Information Minister Rexhep Zllatku, who arrived in Taipei at the

weeklong visit.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Zllatku indicated his deep interest in the success

from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and representatives from
private enterprises.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, Taiwan's trade with Macedonia
in the past has been tiny. Last year, Taiwan's exports to Macedonia
stood at US$1.86 million, and imports from the Southeast European
nation, part of the former Yugoslavia, totaled just US$593,000.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>Today is Tuesday, Feb. 9, or the 24th day of
the 12th month of the Year of the Tiger according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1825: John Quincy Adams, an American politician who helped
formulate the Monroe Doctrine and advocated antislavery measures, is
elected the sixth president of the United States, defeating Andrew
Jackson.

1881: Feodor Mikhailovich Dostoevski, Russian writer who wrote
such great novels as "Crime and Punishment," "The Idiot," "The
Possessed," and "The Brother Karamazov," dies at the age of 60.

1899: The Boxer Uprising breaks out in China. Sparked by popular
discontent with internal misgovernment and anti-foreign sentiment
aroused by unequal treaties, the boxers lay siege against the foreign
legion in Peking, where a combined force of Japanese, French,
British, Russians, and American troops held out for over a month.

1921: The Living Buddha of Outer Mongolia proclaims
"independence" after Mongolian and Russian communists gain control of
Outer Mongolia. They established the Mongolian People's Republic in
1924, after the Living Buddha died.

1942: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek visits India after assuming
office as supreme commander of the China Theater of War on Jan. 2,
1942.

1945: Mia Farrow, the American actress who first made her name in
the television series Peyton Place and went on to make many films,
notably comedies with Wooden Allen, is born.

1955: With a vote of 64 to six, the US Senate approves the
Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty.

1957: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China
advocates independence for the Ryukyus. China and Japan both claimed
the Ryukyus until 1874, when the Ching court signed a treaty
recognizing Japanese rule. After Japan's defeat in World War II, the
US took over the Ryukyus. In 1953, the US returned the islands north
of Okinawa to Japan. Okinawa and the southern Ryukyus were returned
in 1972.

1962: The Taiwan Stocks Exchange formally begins operation.

1964: Beatlemania hits US as 73 million Americans watch four lads

1981: General Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland's defense minister,
becomes prime minister and chief of the Communist Party.

1993: President Francois Mitterrand visits Vietnam, ending
Vietnam's isolation in the international community. He was the first
Western head of state to visit the communist country since 1966.

1994: President Lee Teng-hui leaves for the Philippines,
Indonesia, and Thailand on an eight-day visit.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Why should one be too severe? When
a man reforms and comes to me for advice, I accept his present
reformation without inquiring what his past life has been. I am
satisfied if I find that, for the present, he has really reformed,
without being able to guarantee that he will not relapse again. But
why should one be too severe?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The sixth international multi-media
exhibition, Milia '99, kicked off in Cannes, France on Monday with
950 firms from more than 50 countries participating.</P>
      <P>Ten Republic of China firms, led by Chen Ching-wen, executive
director of a five-year program to promote the ROC's software
industry, set up a joint pavilion with the China External Trade
Development Council to display their multi-media products.</P>
      <P>Chen said although Taiwan's software development lagged behind
other countries in the initial stages, Taiwan has quickly picked up
the pace. The fact that Taiwan has become the third largest computer
hardware supplier has also prompted the progress of its software
industry, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC government has launched a five-year software
industry development program. Under the program, the government plans
to produce a variety of multi-media software products with the
Internet using technology from electronics, television, satellite
communications, stereo, video and movies. These products will in turn
supply a new international electronic information market, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Prior to the exhibition, French and Taiwan businessmen met to
exchange views on the production of multi-media software.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the global multi-media market registers an
average annual market value of US$23 billion at present, and the
figure is expected to show an average growth of 30 percent in the
next five years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO SIGN PRISONER EXCHANGE AGREEMENT WITH THAILAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By F. C. Kuo and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan nationals imprisoned in Thailand are
urging the ROC government to sign a prisoner exchange agreement with
Thailand so they can return to Taiwan early to serve their prison
terms.</P>
      <P>ROC Deputy Representative Chen Cheng-hsiung heard the requests
during his visits to five Thai prisons prior to the Chinese Lunar New
Year which falls on Feb. 16. Chen offered new year gifts and daily
necessities in the run up to the most important holiday of the
Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>Two Taiwan women found guilty of drug smuggling, tearfully told
Chen that they missed their children who are in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan man serving a life sentence for drug smuggling said only
King Bhumibol Adulyadey has the power to grant amnesty in Thailand,
adding that it was very difficult for foreign prisoners to receive
such status. He added that his family could not afford to travel to
Thailand to visit him.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwan national who has already served several years in a
Thai prison said when Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou was justice minister
he promised to sign a prisoner exchange agreement with Thailand, but
with the frequent changes in the ministerial post, his belief in such
an agreement is evaporating. The prisoner said he hopes newly
appointed Justice Minister Yeh Chin-feng will take up their cause.</P>
      <P>Taipei should consider signing a prison exchange agreement with
Thailand as the number of Thais imprisoned in Taiwan is rising,
another Taiwan prisoner said. He added that most of his cell mates
from Europe and the United States have been repatriated to serve out
their terms under respective agreements with Thailand.</P>
      <P>According to Thai statistics, there are currently 44 Taiwan
prisoners in five Thai prisons on the outskirts of Bangkok.
Among them, four have been sentenced to life imprisonment, one
sentenced to 50 years, and 11 sentenced to 40 years.</P>
      <P>Most of them have been found guilty of drug smuggling while
others were convicted of murder, followed by arm robbery, theft and
check default problems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew met with visiting
Macedonian Information Minister Rezxep Zllatku on Tuesday for
discussions on a broad range of issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taipei and Skojpe decided to forge official
diplomatic ties because the two countries share the same aspirations
for democracy, human rights and peace, Siew expressed the hope that
bilateral exchanges will be further strengthened.</P>
      <P>As two-way relations are based on mutually beneficial ties, Siew
said no third party has the right to interfere. "No matter how, the
two nations have (established relations) to gain greater
international presence," he noted.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from Macedonian reporters who accompanied
Zllatku to Taipei, Siew said Taiwan's "economic miracle" is built
upon a solid economic foundation coupled with public efforts.</P>
      <P>The premier said he believes many Taiwan businesses are willing
to invest in Macedonia as long as the government provides them with
sufficient information.</P>
      <P>Siew also related the story behind the forging of ties between
the Republic of China and the Balkan state.</P>
      <P>He said Vasil Tupurkovski, chairman of the ruling Party for
Democratic Alternatives (PDA), paid a secret visit to the ROC last
year. Tupurkovski, leader of then opposition PDA, was very impressed
with the island's economic development, and began to actively push
for the establishment of diplomatic links with Taipei after his party
won in the general presidential election late last year.</P>
      <P>Zllatku, at the head of a 30-member press delegation, arrived in
Taipei on Sunday for a six-day visit. The mission is the first of its
kind to visit Taiwan since the two countries set up officials ties on
Jan. 27.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two suspects were arrested for smuggling
heroin from mainland China, agents from Taiwan's Investigation Bureau
(IB) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Agents said that Chi Pao-chai, 48, and Chu Yu-hsin, 32, concealed
1.4 kilograms in three Jiouguei (drunkard) liquor bottles from the
mainland. Chi was also found to be carrying 1.073 kilograms of
amphetamine taped to her body.</P>
      <P>The IB was tipped off last June that Chi, who has previous
convictions for narcotics possession, had smuggled drugs from the
mainland for huge profits several times, and began a surveillance
operation on her.</P>
      <P>After staking her out for a period of time, the agents found out
earlier this month that Chi, along with her accomplice Chu, was
planning to travel to the mainland via Macau, but that they had not
booked return tickets.</P>
      <P>The agents later discovered that the two arrived back in Macau
from the mainland on Monday afternoon, and returned to Taiwan on
Monday night. They were apprehended at the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport as they were about to leave in a taxi.</P>
      <P>It is understood that Chi has taken advantage of duty free liquor
allowances to smuggle heroin before. An initial investigation found
that the drugs might have come from Shantou, in Guangdong province.</P>
      <P>The agents are conducting further investigation.</P>

      <P>Amid growing unemployment, Hong Kong is
increasingly concerned about the influx of illegal immigrants from
mainland China, the Australian Financial Review reported from the
former British territory.</P>
      <P>In the past, Hong Kong welcomed mainland immigrants to help
reduce the cost of labor, but as factories moved to the mainland and
as Hong Kong matured, it increasingly became a service-based economy
which is now in a recession.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong now has a record unemployment rate of 5.8 percent and
the figure is expected to further increase. Many Hong Kong residents
accuse mainlanders of stealing their jobs, reducing wages, and
sponging off welfare resources and draining school and health
resources.</P>
      <P>To make the matter worse, Hong Kong, under the "one country, two

immigrants because its Basic Law, promulgated by China's National
People's Congress, allows these new migrants to enter the territory.</P>
      <P>Chinese rulers have never historically accepted the institutional

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT MONITORING MAINLAND CAPITAL MOVEMENT: SECURITY CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is closely
monitoring illegal mainland Chinese capital movement in Taiwan, and
has obtained substantial information in this regard, National
Security Bureau (NSB) Chief Ting Yu-chou said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ting made the remarks during a visit to the newly installed
fourth Legislative Yuan, which will kick off its first session soon.</P>
      <P>Ting stressed that mainland China's intention to penetrate the
fabric of Taiwan, regardless of whether it is through private or
public channels, will have a serious negative impact on local
society. He told Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyin and his
deputy, Rau Yin-chi, adding that his bureau will step up monitoring
and information gathering in the runup to the island's presidential
election slated for 2000.</P>
      <P>The new NSB head promised that he will fully carry out his duties
"on the right note" while he is in the post. Saying that his bureau
will never ease its efforts in this mission, he called on the public
to join forces with the government to crack down on mainland China's
clandestine activities here to safeguard national security.</P>
      <P>Ting also called on ruling Kuomintang legislative caucus leader
Tseng Yung-chuan and Tseng's counterpart in the major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, Chang Chun-hsung, to discuss related
issues.</P>
      <P>Ting was appointed to the post of NSB chief in a recent partial
Cabinet reshuffle by Premier Vincent Siew.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIJACKER ATTACK ON SEF OFFICIAL SAID `PLANNED' ACTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese hijacker's attack on an
official from the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) was a planned
action, not an individual acting on the spur of the moment, SEF Vice
Chairman Shi Hwei-yow said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shi made the remarks after Yang Mingde, who was being repatriated
after serving a jail term for the 1993 hijacking of a Sichuan
Airlines plane to Taiwan with his wife Han Fengying, slashed the neck
of SEF Deputy Secretary General Jan Jyh-horng as he was accompanying
them on a flight from Taiwan to the ROC-controlled island of Kinmen
on Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the plane took off at 1:50 p.m., Yang reportedly
said he wanted to talk to Jan over some urgent matter. Yang's
11-year-old son Yang Yang was repatriated to the mainland on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yang requested that he be allowed to come closer to Jan, and then
suddenly pulled out a sharp object which looked like a metal door
handle and attacked Jan, who subsequently suffered a 7.5 cm cut on
the neck which required two stitches.</P>
      <P>Shi traveled to Kinmen on Tuesday morning to visit Jan and
discuss the issue with him, following which the SEF decided to
repatriate only five of the nine hijackers scheduled for
repatriation, holding the four others, including Yang, for further
questioning.</P>
      <P>Shi said that those found responsible for the incident will be
dealt with according to the law.</P>
      <P>He noted that the incident is not an isolated case, saying that
as early as last December, Yang and three others began preparing for
their uprising, and that they had hidden pieces of metal and razors
in the lining of their clothes or in the soles of their shoes.</P>
      <P>The five repatriated hijackers were picked up by a ship sent by
mainland China's Red Cross Society from Fujian province.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MARSHALL ISLANDS OPENS EMBASSY IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of Marshall Islands opened an
embassy in the Republic of China on Tuesday, heralding a new era in
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Marshall Islands President Imata Kabua, Foreign and Trade
Minister Philip Muller, and ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu jointly cut
the ribbon to inaugurate the new embassy in Taipei's diplomatic
district in suburban Tienmu.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Hu said the opening of the
Marshall Islands Embassy marks a step forward in the bilateral
relationship.</P>
      <P>"I hope our two countries will make concerted efforts to further
strengthen our cooperation in various fields," said Hu, who is
scheduled to visit the Marshall Islands between late March and early
April.</P>
      <P>On behalf of President Kabua, Muller said his country is
satisfied with the establishment of full diplomatic ties with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>"Our two countries decided to forge official links after only a
few months of negotiations. This indicates that our two governments
have strong confidence in each other's commitment. I believe our
cooperative ties will become even closer in the future," Muller said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the opening of the embassy symbolizes a
giant step forward in bilateral ties. "The embassy will do its utmost
to provide prospective Taiwan investors with the latest market
information on the Marshall Islands. I hope the ROC will assist in my
country's economic development and that more Taiwan entrepreneurs
will invest in the Marshall Islands."</P>
      <P>Kabua, heading a 46-member entourage, arrived in Taipei on Friday
for a weeklong state visit. This is Kabua's first visit to Taiwan
since the Pacific island nation forged formal ties with the ROC on
Nov. 20, 1998.</P>
      <P>The Marshall Islands delegation sang a traditional festive song
at the inaugural ceremony to express its country's joy and
satisfaction with the establishment of diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>The Marshall Islands first lady said the song is a favorite
melody of fishermen in her country. "When our fishing boats return
with full loads of fish and marine products, all the crew members and
their families will sing this song to express their gratitude and
joy. The rendition of this song symbolizes that our people attach
great importance to friendship with the ROC," Mrs. Kabua explained.</P>
      <P>The Marshall Islands is expected to appoint an ambassador to
Taipei in the near future. Meanwhile, the ROC Embassy in the
Marshall Islands is currently located in a hotel in that country's
capital of Majuro, but construction of a new ROC Embassy building
will start soon, Foreign Ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Kabua met with ROC Economic Minister Wang Chih-kang on Tuesday
morning to exchange views on ways to boost bilateral economic
cooperation.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Wang promised that the ROC will assist the
Marshall Islands in training managerial personnel to boost the
development of its small- and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ROC will also help the Marshall Islands expand its
foreign trade and establish a comprehensive trade promotion
mechanism.</P>
      <P>Among the members of Kabua's entourage is Chen Tzu-ying, chairman
of the Bank of the Marshall Islands. Chen hails from the ROC, and
used to work in Taiwan's Chang Hwa Commercial Bank before emigrating
to the Marshall Islands 17 years ago and opening his own bank.</P>
      <P>The bank did very well, and the Marshall Islands government
bought part of the bank's equity in 1992 to make it a national bank.
At present, the Marshall Islands government controls 65 percent of
the bank's equity and the remaining 35 percent is controlled by
private investors.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Marshall Islands has rich fishery and tourist
resources, and has offered many incentives to attract foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, there are about 100 ROC nationals residing in
the Marshall Islands at the moment, most of whom are business people.
Chen said he hopes direct flight services between the two countries
can be opened in the near future to facilitate bilateral exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE EXPECTED TO TOP 5% NEXT YEAR: WEFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US-based Wharton Econometric
Forecasting Association (WEFA) forecast on Monday that Taiwan's
economic growth rate will exceed 5 percent next year.</P>
      <P>The association also forecast that the island's economic growth
rate this year will be 4.5 percent, much higher than the 1.1 percent
it predicted for Asia as a whole.</P>
      <P>WEFA said that the performance of Asia's economy this year will
remain weak, with this year's growth rates of Indonesia, Malaysia,
Hong Kong and Japan estimated to remain negative, while the growth
rate for Singapore is expected to be zero.</P>
      <P>The estimated figure for global economic growth rate this year is
1.4 percent, while the average figure for G-7 industrialized nations
is 1.3 percent. All the figures are much lower than those forecast
earlier by the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>WEFA forecast mainland China's economic growth rate this year to
be 7 percent, and 7.2 percent next year. WEFA's estimated economic
growth rate for Hong Kong this year is -1.6 percent, while that for
next year will be 1 percent.</P>
      <P>WEFA indicated that several developments in mainland China will
help its economy this year, such as recent amendments to its
constitution to recognize the status of non-state enterprises, and
loosened restrictions on foreign banks operating there.</P>
      <P>It is also expected that mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will
promise to further open up mainland China's market during a visit to
the US later this year, the WEFA forecast said.</P>
      <P>The WEFA economic forecast figures are estimated based on a
supply-demand model. On the demand side, there are four main
indicators: consumer expenditure; investment; public expenditure; and
net export growth.</P>
      <P>Because foreign trade contributes significantly to Taiwan's
economic growth rate, its export performance this year will be
crucial to the upward or downward revision of its economic growth
rate.</P>
      <P>WEFA forecast that Japan's economy will shrug off its recession
to register a growth rate of 0.5 percent next year, while South Korea
and Malaysia will enjoy growth of 4.8 percent and 4.1 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>WEFA also reiterated its belief that mainland China's renminbi
will not be devalued this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TOY MANUFACTURERS ACHIEVE SUCCESS AT NUREMBERG EXHIBITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 127 toy manufacturers from Taiwan
took part in the "1999 Nuremberg Toy Exhibition," making Taiwan the
fourth-largest exhibitor in the trade show.</P>
      <P>The seven-day exhibition being held in the southern German city
started on Feb. 4 and will continue until Feb. 10. Taiwan
manufacturers together with those from Hong Kong total 342,
accounting for more than 10 percent of the participants at the event.
Counted alongside mainland China, the three regions have become the
world's principal source of toys.</P>
      <P>Altogether, 2,759 manufacturers from around the globe are
participating in the show, among which German enterprises account for
1,236, followed by Hong Kong with 215, and Italy with 186.</P>
      <P>With an eye to raising Taiwan's international image in toy
manufacturing circles, the Taipei-based China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) and the Taiwan Toy Manufacturers
Association are sponsoring a range of activities to attract
international buyers.</P>
      <P>To date, Taiwan manufacturers have received more than 300 letters
of inquiry from possible purchasers during the show, while
on-the-spot orders have already doubled over last year's figure.</P>
      <P>Lee Jia-yi, director of CETRA's Trade Service in Dusseldorf,
pointed out that 42 of the 127 Taiwan manufacturers attending the
Nuremberg exhibition are displaying their products as a group under
the auspices of the Taiwan Exhibition Pavilion, put together by
CETRA.</P>
      <P>In recent years, according to informed sources, a division of
labor has become apparent in the toy business, with Taiwan accepting
orders, mainland China being in charge of production, and the United
States responsible for sales.</P>
      <P>Toys manufacturers from Taiwan are putting great emphasis on the
advantages of this labor division at this year's show, in which they
are introducing the most popular toys made in Taiwan in 1999.</P>
      <P>Some of Taiwan's most prominent manufacturers, such as Metro
Toys, Genius Toys, Lucky Star, and Thunder Tiger Model Co., have also
established good relations with foreign customers during the
exhibition, according to the sources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO SURPASS TAIWAN IN COMBAT CAPABILITY BY 2005: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Tang Fei
said on Tuesday that mainland China is developing cruise missiles
which will eventually pose a far greater threat to Taiwan than guided
ballistic missiles and nuclear arms.</P>
      <P>Tang, a former chief of the General Staff, issued the warning at
his first news conference as defense minister.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has sufficient evidence
to believe that mainland China is devoting its full energy to
developing cruise missiles," Tang said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the MND discovered that mainland China had
acquired cruise missile technology from Russia shortly after mainland
China test-fired M-class guided ballistic missiles into waters near
Taiwan in the run-up to Taiwan's first direct presidential election
in March 1996.</P>
      <P>At that time, Tang said, the MND still didn't know whether Russia
had transferred cruise missile technology to mainland China. "By now,
however, we have come to understand that mainland China has achieved
positive results in cruise missile development," he said.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the ROC military has confirmed that
mainland China has made progress in its cruise missile technology.</P>
      <P>According to Tang, mainland China's cruise missiles are similar
to Russia's SS-N-22 missiles and the US-made Tomahawks.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that mainland China has launched an all-out
effort to modernize its weaponry systems and military equipment, as
well as its personnel training.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Tang said, mainland China is very likely
to overtake Taiwan in combat capability by 2005.</P>
      <P>Tang said mainland China is reinforcing its C4ISR technology and
combat capabilities. C4ISR refers to command, control,
communications, intelligence, electronics and reconnaissance
technologies.</P>
      <P>The minister said that the mainland has taken delivery of a
fourth Kilo-class submarine from Russia and will soon deploy advanced
missile destroyers.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tang said, the mainland is assembling a fleet of
Russian-originating Su-27 fighters and upgrading its airborne fueling
and avionics combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>"All these developments will pose an ever-increasing threat to
Taiwan's security," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang was quoted by an opposition legislator as saying
that there are 120 mainland Chinese missiles of various types aimed
at Taiwan every day.</P>
      <P>Tang reportedly made the statement during a closed-door meeting
with Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung, convener of the legislative
caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a proposal that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
establsih a military hotline to minimize possible miscalculation and
misunderstanding, Tang said such military exchanges cannot become
reality until cross-strait political dialogue reaches "some stage"
or achieves some results.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's poarticipation in the US-initiated theater
missile defense (TMD) system, Tang said the military is still
evaluate whether to import or manufacture on its own low-altitude
missile defense systems.</P>
      <P>As for the high-altitude missile defense system, Tang said the
whole development program is not yet mature. It's still too early to
make any comment on whether Taiwan should participate in TMD system,
he added.

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI NOT SURPRISED BEIJING HAS CUT TIES WITH MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister David Lee
said Wednesday the Republic of China is not surprised that Beijing
has announced the severing of diplomatic ties with Macedonia in
protest of the Balkan state's recent establishment of formal
relations with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was instrumental in the forging of ties between Taiwan
and Macedonia, said the situation is under control and that Taiwan is
now working to enhance bilateral exchanges with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The two nations established relations on Jan. 27.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced via its official Xinhua news agency Tuesday
evening that it had severed diplomatic ties with Macedonia over the
Balkan state's decision to forge official relations with Taiwan.
Mainland China announced it would also bring to a halt the
implementation of all agreements between the two governments.</P>
      <P>Lee said Beijing's bitter reaction is expected and
understandable, adding, "We are not overjoyed at the outcome, and we
are now doing what has been planned to bolster the newly normalized
relations."</P>
      <P>Beijing will likely to attempt to punish Taiwan for Macedonia's
decision to switch recognition from Beijing to Taipei, Lee said,
adding that Taipei is bracing for possible retaliation. Such
retaliation could come in the form of moves by Beijing to lure away
ROC allies or to undermine UN peacekeeping forces in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's top priority now is to firmly consolidate
relations with Macedonia, its 28th diplomatic ally and the first in
the Balkan Peninsula, Lee said.</P>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu and his Macedonian counterpart,
Aleksandar Dimitrov, signed a joint communique in Taipei on Jan. 27
that established full diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Mainland China was unaware that the two countries were planning
to establish relations. Once discovered, however, the moves drew a
strong protest from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The move also provoked a strong rebuttal from Macedonian
President Kiro Gligorov, a communist who is friendly toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>But Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski, who spearheaded
the campaign to establish relations with Taiwan, reaffirmed
repeatedly over the last days that the decision will not be changed.</P>
      <P>The Macedonian Cabinet Conference on Monday passed legislation
establishing formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Macedonian Information Minister Rezxep Zllatku is currently
visiting Taipei at the head of a 30-member delegation of journalists
who have come to the island to better understand the Republic of
China.</P>

      <P>One of nine mainland Chinese convicted hijackers who were to be
repatriated Tuesday, Yang assaulted Straits Exchange Foundation
Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyn-horng with a portion of a metal door
handle. Jan suffered a 7-centimer gash in his neck and required two
stitches.</P>
      <P>The assault occurred while the plane carrying the hijackers was
landing at Kinmen's airport on Monday.</P>
      <P>After the attack, Yang was removed from the plane under police
guard. During questioning by Kinmen police Yang admitted the assault
was premeditated.</P>
      <P>In 1993 Yang and his wife hijacked a plane and forced it to land
in Taiwan. That same year Lin, Shi and Wang hijacked another mainland
Chinese airliner.</P>
      <P>At the time repatriation proceedings were initiated, the four
were on parole after having spent several years in prison.</P>
      <P>Yang's wife was repatriated in 1997 after serving several years
in prison. Their son, 11-year-old Yang Yang, was repatriated on Feb.
6 of this year after spending five years in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Months ago the four men hatched a plan to hijack whatever type of
vehicle -- boat or plane -- was used to repatriate them to the
mainland, according to Kinmen police.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office, the four
could face trial on at least four charges: assault, attempted murder,
infringement of public order and hijacking. If prosecuted under laws
related to civil aviation, the four could face heavier punishments
than they would face otherwise, Taipei prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen on Wednesday admitted
that security oversights played a role in Yang's attack. Police did
not demand that the hijackers change into new clothes and slippers
before boarding the airplane that was going to take them from the
detention center in northern Taiwan city of Hsinchu to Kinmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESSMEN SUPPORT TAIWAN'S BID TO JOIN WHO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve US congressmen have sent a letter
to US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, asking her to inform the
House of the steps the US will pursue in securing World Health
Organization affiliation for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The move by House members followed the introduction of a similar 
Senate resolution last month.</P>
      <P>The letter, signed Feb. 8, was initiated by Sherrod Brown
(D-Ohio), who has long advocated Taiwan's participation in the WHO.</P>
      <P>Eleven colleagues co-signed the letter were Michael Bilirakis
(R-Fla.), Dan Burton (R-Ind.), Peter Deutsch (D-Fla.), Dana
Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), Peter King (R-N.Y.),
Joe Barton (R-Texas), Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.), Pete Sessions
(R-Texas), Deanna DeGette (D-Colo.), and Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.).</P>
      <P>The letter noted that Taiwan has been blocked from participating
in the WHO since 1972. As a consequence, the children of Taiwan
suffer needlessly because doctors there are "denied access to the
latest WHO protocols," according to a press release by the non-profit
Formosan Association for Public Affairs.</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, with each passing year our administration worsens
Taiwan's plight by supporting China's assertion that its neighbor is
not a nation and therefore should not be represented in the
international community," the letter added.</P>
      <P>Rather than a threat to Beijing's security, Taiwan's
participation in the WHO would enhance the quality of life of
mainland China's 1.2 billion inhabitants, the letter said.</P>
      <P>The letter said it is distressing that the US government refuses
to help Taiwan in its struggle to conquer diseases that are already
exterminated in the United States.</P>
      <P>Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced a resolution on
Jan. 20 requesting the United States help Taiwan to secure meaningful
participation in the WHO. He also called on the State Department to
report to the US Congress on what action the Clinton Administration
will take at the May 1999 WHO meeting in Geneva to support Taiwan's
meaningful participation in the world health body.</P>
      <P>The stance of the US government is that it will not support
Taiwan's membership in international organizations in which statehood
is a requirement. The WHO, a UN-affiliated agency, currently has
states as its members.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is scheduled to
repatriate a total of 400 illegal mainland Chinese immigrants before
the Lunar New Year, sources from the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The illegal immigrants will be returned on Saturday and Sunday
via the offshore island of Matsu where ferries from the mainland
Chinese Red Cross Society will be waiting to transport them home, SEF
officials said.</P>
      <P>Since there is no binding agreement on the repatriation of
illegal immigrants across the Taiwan Strait, SEF officials said the
return of the immigrants will follow the pattern used in previous
repatriations based on safety and humanitarian concerns.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said to allow the mainlanders to safely return to
their hometowns before the Lunar New Year, which falls on Feb. 16,
mainland Chinese detention homes in Hsinchu in northern Taiwan and
Ilan in eastern Taiwan have begun to send the detainees to Matsu in

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian economy will continue to
grow strongly for at least the next six months, according to a survey
by the National Australia Bank (NAB).</P>
      <P>The NAB index of business conditions in Australia rose for the
sixth consecutive month in January, suggesting that the Reserve Bank
of Australia (RBA) would continue to delay any move to cut official
interest rates due to the country's strong economic performance.</P>
      <P>NAB chief economist Alan Oster said the jump in the NAB index was
consistent with a non-farm gross domestic product growth rate of
around 5 percent. He said the economy had enough strength to continue
to expand for at least the next six months.</P>
      <P>But he also warned that Australia would still experience the
anticipated post-Asian crisis hangover -- predicting economic growth
would slow in the second half of 1999 to 2.25 percent.</P>
      <P>He said there was a 50 percent chance the RBA would cut interest
rates within the next six months.</P>
      <P>He predicted the Australian dollar would fall against the US
dollar in the next six months with weaker commodity prices and a
significant deterioration in the current account deficit expected to

      <P>The Republic of China and Hong Kong are
among the 10 most competitive telecommunications hubs in Asia,
according to a survey of 13 countries in the Asia-Pacific region by
the National University of Singapore.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review had reported that Canada led
other countries as the most competitive telecommunications hub.</P>
      <P>But in a survey of more than 100 corporate end-users of telecom
services in 13 countries, Singapore University's Center for
Tele-Media Strategy found Singapore was the most competitive with a
score of 66.</P>
      <P>Australia came second and Hong Kong third with scores of 65 and
64, respectively. Japan was fourth with a score of 62 South Korea,
New Zealand and Taiwan followed in the listings.</P>
      <P>The least competitive group comprised Malaysia, Thailand, the
Philippines, Indonesia, India and mainland China, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>The results were based on respondents' ratings of the quality and
price of, and the range of choices in, a country's telecom services,
as well as on the country's telecom regulations. Services covered by
the study were international direct dial, leased circuits, frame
relay and Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN).</P>
      <P>In terms of pricing, Singapore ranked first, followed by Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Australia. On choice, South Korea ranked first,
followed by New Zealand, mainland China and Australia.</P>
      <P>In terms of service, Japanese international long-distance carrier
KDD was rated most highly followed by Australia's Telstra, Hong Kong
Telecom and Singapore Telecom.</P>
      <P>In terms of regulation, Hong Kong was the leader, ahead of
Australia, Japan and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>In terms of Internet use, Canada ranked first, Australia second
and the United States third; they were followed by Singapore, New

      <P>In the survey of 140,000 respondents in 16 countries, ACNielsen
found that one in four people in Australia and Singapore regularly

    <HEADLINE>ZHU SPLITS WITH NPC OVER RATE OF GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's State Council and
National People's Congress are in disagreement over the economic
development for the first half of the next decade, the South China
Morning Post reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>A group headed by Premier Zhu Rongji has begun to draft the 10th
five-year plan for 2001 to 2005. The group's deputy is Vice-Premier
Li Lanqing while others include Zhu's aide Gui Shiyong, head of the
State Development Planning Commission Zeng Peiyan and State Council
Secretary-General Wang Zhongyu.</P>
      <P>However, veteran congress deputies have drafted their own
proposals in keeping with the increasing assertiveness of the
legislature which is no longer content to rubber stamp government
decisions, the report quoted a Beijing source as saying.</P>
      <P>A key difference between the two reports was the growth rate. Zhu
has said the average growth rate during the 10th five-year plan
period should be 7 percent to 8 percent. This would be better than
the development speed of well-off countries, he reportedly said,
adding that the economy must avoid fluctuation.</P>
      <P>But NPC economists support a more ambitious program, the report
said.</P>
      <P>"Heavyweight legislators think the growth rate could go up to 10
or 11 percent at least in one to two years during the plan's period,"
a parliamentary source was quoted.</P>
      <P>These deputies had criticized Zhu for "excessive force" in
cooling the economy from 1995 to 1997. They also believe a high
growth rate is needed to contain social problems such as
unemployment.</P>
      <P>It is understood that one NPC deputy, a well-known professor,
disputed Zhu's point that there was a glut of electric products in
the market such as TV sets and VCD players. The academic said the
potential for growth was vast in the countryside, where only about 5
percent of the population had color TV sets.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard has watered
down his code of conduct for his ministers by allowing them to own
shares in companies involved in their portfolio areas, reversing his
previous tough stance, which cost seven senior Cabinet officials
their jobs between 1997 and 1998.</P>
      <P>Howard on Tuesday announced his controversial change. Under the
revised regulations, ministers now will be required to transfer
control of such shares to "an outside professional nominee or trust,
providing the minister or immediate family exercises no control on
the operation of the nominee or trust."</P>
      <P>Howard introduced his tough ruling after he beat former Prime
Minister Paul Keating in March 1996 elections. The ruling was
intended to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest among
Cabinet officials.</P>
      <P>Howard on Tuesday night defended the change to his rules, denying
they had been "softened."</P>
      <P>"They're made more common sense, they're made more realistic," he
said. "You will never get a satisfactory set of guidelines and I
don't think you'll ever get rid of argument in this area, unless you
have parliament full of people who've never owned an asset, who've
never sought to be successful in business, who've never showed any
kind of independent entrepreneurial imagination."</P>
      <P>"While ever you have people who are jealous of the success of
other you are going to have criticism that guidelines aren't tight
enough," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A secret report on mainland China's
efforts to acquire sensitive US technologies will likely become a
serious bump in bilateral relations, an influential US member of
Congress said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The findings "almost certainly will strain US-China relations
over the near term" once the report is declassified, according to
Doug Bereuter, chairman of the House Asia and Pacific subcommittee.</P>
      <P>Much of the Cox Report -- so called because Christopher Cox was
chairman of the special panel that produced it -- is expected to be
made public around the same time as the first official visit to the
United States by Zhu Rongji as mainland China's prime minister.</P>
      <P>"I think that this will be a substantial bump in Sino-US
relations; it could be a very serious one," he said after a speech at
the Heritage Foundation in Washington.</P>
      <P>The senior congressman belongs to the nine-member, bi-partisan
House Select Committee on US Security and Commercial Concerns with
the People's Republic of China, which produced the 800-page report in
late December.</P>
      <P>Without disclosing any details, he said mainland China's
practices, including espionage, have caused "great and
extraordinarily damaging losses to US national security."</P>
      <P>The select committee's investigation was prompted by allegations
that two US satellite communications companies, Loral and Hughes, had
illegally transferred missile-related technology to the Chinese.</P>
      <P>Bereuter said that these cases were "minor problems" compared
with the other things that the panel discovered during their
six-month investigation.</P>
      <P>However, he also said most countries normally conduct espionage
and the primary criticism should be targeted at US administrations
over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>"The focus needs to be on the US and how we could be so inept, so
naive and so lacking in security procedures to have made this kind of
major espionage prevail," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN ERROR SHUTS DOWN MUCHA LINE FOR FOUR HOURS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A human error on Wednesday brought the
Taipei Rapid Transit System's (TRTS) Mucha Line to a standstill for
four hours on Wednesday, affecting some 20,000 commuters.</P>
      <P>The most serious shutdown of Mucha Line's operations over the
past year occurred at around 2 a.m. when a senior engineer of a
contracted company for the line's maintenance mistakenly hit
"restore" in the maintenance computer program -- erasing the entire
communication-related configurations, including that which runs the
electric power transmission.</P>
      <P>The default caused a comprehensive stop of power supply, a Taipei
Rapid Transit Co. (TRT) spokesman said.</P>
      <P>After spending two hours trying to fix the power-supplying
systems and the defaulted computer programs, TRT and the contracted
company could still not fix the problem at the central control room
for the Mucha Line operation, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>They were forced to mobilize all Mucha Line engineers to manually
and separately repair power systems at five power converting plants
located along the line, which runs through the southern and eastern
parts of downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>When scheduled operations were supposed to begin for the day at 6
a.m., workers were still unable to fix the defaulted system. At some
10 a.m., the system was still not fully recovered, the TRT officials
said.</P>
      <P>The four-hour shutdown caused an uproar among commuters who were
caught by surprise by the incident. They were forced to take
alternative transportation such as buses and taxis.</P>
      <P>While the TRT provided a supply of buses to transport commuters
into Taipei, the company still received angry complaints as MRT users
had to line up for ticket refunds and found themselves stuck on
crowded buses.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou expressed his grave apology to the
Mucha Line commuters, and stressed that efforts would be taken to
prevent a reoccurrence of the incident.</P>
      <P>Wednesday also marked the day when Lee Puo-wen officially assumed
the post of chairman to the Taipei government-run TRT. During a
morning ceremony, in which Lee was sworn in and received the TRT seal
from Ma, the new leader expressed regret over the incident.</P>
      <P>Lee said both the contracted maintenance company and TRT should
be held fully responsible for the incident. He noted he will demand
that the TRT conduct an investigation into the company's internal
operations including the function of their crisis task force.</P>
      <P>The Mucha Line, opened to traffic in March 1995, was the first
TRTS line completed Taiwan. It uses the patented VAL unmanned transit
system of France's Matra Transport Co.</P>
      <P>Construction on the Mucha Line began in 1988 at a cost of around
NT$20 billion (US$621 million). During its construction, the line was
plagued by one problem after another. Operation defects have not
stopped even after the MRT line began public services.</P>
      <P>The line has been operating well during the past year until the
latest shutdown.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF SOUND FINANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   10   (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A strong financial foundation is
indispensable in government, Premier Vincent Siew stressed on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Therefore the government must pay close attention to any
amendments to bills concerning the increase or decrease of the
government's expenditures to ensure affordability, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at the weekly meeting of the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT) Central Standing Committee after the finance
minister and head of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting &amp;
Statistics (DGBAS) made their reports.</P>
      <P>Wei Duan, director general of the DGBAS, and Finance Minister
Paul C.H. Chiu, delivered reports on the central government's budget
starting from June 1999 to Dec. 2000, according to regulations of the
new budget law.</P>
      <P>The reports revealed that the new budget for the central
government is characterized by a deficit which amounts to 20.7
percent of the whole budget. Particularly noteworthy is that the
deficit arises from a zero deficit in the 1998 budget.</P>
      <P>The premier further noted that the financial conditions of the
central government have been much improved in the past three years.
However, he said, due to the debt incurred by the central government
-- attributed to the downsizing of the provincial government -- the
central government is now facing another financial plight.</P>
      <P>Siew disclosed that a debt foundation will be established with an
eye to deal with the government's debt effectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELDERLY PAINTERS MAKE SPIRITUAL JOURNEY THROUGH ART (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A portrait of a woman of self-confidence
and strength. A street scene with a touch of nostalgia. A crayon
drawing of a lush garden that speaks of spring, sunlight, warmth and
happiness.</P>
      <P>These images are among the 104 paintings currently on display at
a gallery in the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum.</P>
      <P>The works were created by 16 elderly amateur artists who hail
from different ethnic groups and have varied family and professional
backgrounds. They began to study fine art just three years ago when
they joined a workshop organized by Liu Hsiu-mei, an accomplished
artist who has held five solo exhibitions in the past few years.</P>
      <P>Liu said she opened the workshop for elderly people with no
professional artistic training based on her belief that everybody
can paint.</P>
      <P>"I want to experiment with my ideas and concepts. Our older
generation grew up in a tumultuous period. Their lives were full of
hardship and challenges. My observation is that many elderly people
have great resilience and unused energy, and I hope to inspire them
to use paintbrushes to record their life stories and express their
emotions deep within," Liu said in an interview.</P>
      <P>With her years of experience in teaching elderly people painting
techniques and artistic creation, Liu said she has high reagard for
their creativeness and originality.</P>
      <P>"I respect these elderly students because they paint with great
passion and enthusiasm. I have often been moved by their devotion
and no-nonsense attitude toward creating art," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Participants to the workshop are all in their late 60s or 70s.
They speak different mother tongues, from the Taiwanese dialect and
Hakka to Mandarin Chinese. Some of them are retired civil servants,
schoolteachers or business executives, while others are former street
vendors, craftsmen, blue-collar workers or housewives.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, their previous social status and identity have
disappeared since they joined the workshop. All are equals before
fine art. Their love for painting has helped narrow the social gaps
between them, and they find no difficulty communicating or exchanging
artistic concepts, aesthetic views, personal experiences and
emotions.</P>
      <P>Liu said her studio is not aimed at instructing elderly art
lovers in the techniques of landscapes, floral or bird paintings. "My
workshop focuses on creative painting."</P>
      <P>At the beginning, Liu said she encouraged her students to choose
their painting medium based on their personal preferences,
specialties, disposition or flair.</P>
      <P>"For instance, I have encouraged a grandmother good at embroidery
to use crayons as her main medium. Some calligraphy fans
choose paint brushes, while others opt for oil," Liu said.</P>
      <P>All students first receive basic training, painting still
lives and self-portraits. "With their strong urge to learn, my
students work hard from the very beginning. Many of them practice
painting skills day and night, and never tire of their craft," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>"Many of my students have told me that they have become
stronger and more spirited since they began to study the art of
painting. Some of them said they feel their lives have become richer
and more meaningful. Painting has bringing them into a new world of
visual and spiritual adventure," Liu observed.</P>
      <P>In addition to pursuing technical expertise of fine portraiture,
the students are also taught basic principles of design and
composition.</P>
      <P>"I introduced some professional books to my students to help
them cultivate a good sense of color and light, discussed with them
various themes or subject matters, and encouraged them to do
soul-searching," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Gradually, Liu said, she inspired her students to contemplate
and muse on every stage of lives, from childhood, formative years,
career, marriage, parenthood to aging. "I then induce them to depict
images from the depths of their memories," Liu said.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the greatest appeal of elderly people's
paintings lie in the rich life experiences they bring to their work.

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Without the constrictions of traditional academic training,
these elderly painters enjoy great freedom to express their sad and
joyful emotions from deep within themselves. Many of their creations
are reflections of their life's challenges and rewards," Liu said.</P>
      <P>With Liu's encouragement and assistance, workshop students
formed the Ha Ha Ha Laughing Painters Club last year to boost their
pursuit of further artistic refinement. The current exhibition in
the 228 museum is the club's first major achievement in this regard.</P>
      <P>The themes or subject matter of the 104 paintings on exhibit can
be roughly divided into four categories -- war experiences,
childhood memories, women's lives, and personal emotions.</P>
      <P>Liu said the works feature many forms of pictorial expression
and arouse nostalgic feelings.</P>
      <P>"A number of paintings reflect Taiwan's past way of life, social
customs, mores, business activities, and entertainment. For
instance, one delicate work created by Hsieh Chao-chih portrays
busy, boisterous scenes in the kitchen of a wealthy family in
Taiwan's olden days," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a 70-year-old grandmother from an immense, bustling
family in Taipei's old Wanhua district is also showing a watercolor
featuring a parade of a large variety of dowries collected by a
bride from a rich family. The procession is led by a female
matchmaker sitting on a tricycle, which is followed by a long line
of rickshaws carrying various trousseaus, ranging from men's and
women's clothing, quilts, jewelry boses and footwear, to furniture,
screens, lanterns and so forth.</P>
      <P>"In the old days, local society cared about rites. Some poor
families couldn't afford to give luxury dowries to their daughters,
and had their daughters adopted by wealthy families instead. This
sometimes, resulted in the suicide of their daughters. Fortunately,
such social customs have faded away nowadays," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Some other women painters portray erstwhile women's lifestyles.
A work presented by Liao-Lin Yao is a sketch of a woman using a
thread to pluck the facial hair of a young woman in the frontyard of
a house. This was a facial skin care practice popular in ancient
Taiwan which is rarely seen today.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-nan, a retired construction industry contractor, is
showing an oil on canvas depicting a street scene he saw on his first
trip to Taipei from his rural hometown of Hsinchu to take part in a
junior high school extrance examination during the latter years of
World War II. The work features Taipei's historic "North Gate" and in
one corner of the painting can be seen a teenage boy carrying a small
bag of rice while checking into a hotel named "Chiying Hotel."</P>
      <P>"The boy is me. It was time of hardship. Taiwan was still under
Japanese colonial rule. Rice supplies were rationed, and anyone who
intended to stay in a hotel had to bring his or her ration.
Otherwise, he would be denied entry," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>Workshop instructor Liu said all these works are like pictorial
or illustrated oral histories. "I think many paintings can serve as
supplementary materials for historical, anthropological and
sociological studies," she remarked.</P>
      <P>Of all the exhibits, those featuring war experiences are the
most impressive. All the club members have experienced various types
of was and social turmoil, from World War II and the communist
rebellion, to the February 28 Incident of 1947 (more commonly known
as the 228 Incident)and the "wite terror." Memories of wartime
scenes and events still haunt these elderly arts fans.</P>
      <P>One watercolor, presented by Shen Chung-wu, depicts a
devastating scene witnessed by the painter on a voyage from Ningpo
in Zhejiang province to Shanghai aboard a passenger liner some 54
years ago.</P>
      <P>Shen, a Shanghai native, who moved to Taiwan after the Chinese
communists took control of the mainland in 1949, recalled that at the
time, the Sino-Japanese was was at its peak.</P>
      <P>"I was frightened when I saw an imperial Japanese warship
sailing close beside us. But no sooner had the ship gone by than I
sighted a second Japanese warship nearby exploding into two pieces
and many Japanese seamen aboard the ship sinking beneath the waves.
My uncle told me the ship hit an underwater mine," Shen said.</P>
      <P>The 71-year-old former civil servant said the horrific episode
made a strong impact on his outlook on life. "I still remember the
incident vividly and it always reminds me of the brevity and
fragility of human life and of the importance of making good use of
one's time."

      <P>Hsu Hsin-hsiang, a 74-year-old Hakka from rural Miaoli County
has also painted a work inspired by his wartime experiences. Hsu's
painting features a group of young soliders crowded into an air-raid
shelter. The image of a middle-age woman appears in one corner of
the picture.</P>
      <P>"I was drafted into the Japanese army in the latter years of
World War II. As Taiwan was then a Japanese colory, American
warplanes bombed Taiwan nearly every day and 'take cover, air
strike' became an order of the day. During those dreadful moments, I
always thought of my mother. Memories of my mother's courage and
fortitude in raising me and my siblings on her own helped me
overcome my fear and anxiety during my military years," Hsu recalls.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident, to which the Taipei 228 Museum is dedicated,
has also left scars on many club members. A number of their works
reflect their emotions over the tragic incident sparked by the
arrest and beating of an elderly Taiwanese female street vendor
selling untaxed cigarettes in Taipei on Feb. 28, 1947, shortly after
the ROC government recovered Taiwan from Japan in 1945. Subsequent
islandwide rioting, ethnic clashes and anti-Kuomintang protests,
followed by a brutal military crackdown, caused the death of
thousands of innocent people all over the island.</P>
      <P>Tang Ren-hsi, a Shanghai native who traveled to Keelung alone in
1946 to live with her aunt because her stepmother would not let her
continue her high school education, painted an episode she witnessed
during the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>"One morning, I saw a man with a mainland accent being chased by
a group of Taiwanese mobsters near a bustling marketplace in the
port city. Later, the man managed to run into a house for temporary
shelter. When the mobsters followed him to the house and
questioned its owner, an elderly Taiwanese woman, about the man's
whereabouts, the woman said she hadn't seen anyone pass by. I was
moved by the woman's kindness in providing shelter for the man,"
Tang says, adding that she hopes similar ethnic clashes will never
happen again.</P>
      <P>Some club members are particularly interested in painting
landscapes. Cheng Chung-jen, 77, has painted many poetic, fishing
port scenes that highlight his sentimental attachment to his coastal
hometown of Hsiangshan in Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he has long yearned for a life of quiet reflection,
study and painting. "I like landscape painting because I feel that
Nature can be viewed as the best book on living."</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-chen, a soft-spoken, warmed-hearted grandmother, has
created a series of watercolors featuring flower subjects that convey
feelings of delicacy and sensibility.</P>
      <P>"I have a fascination with floral painting. Flowers arouse an
instinct to protect and appreciate them. Their tenderness kindles a
sense of compassion and understanding. Like life, their beauty is
fleeting. I want to honor them," says the 74-year-old painter.

      <P>Singapore's population may hit four
million this year, according to government statistician Paul Cheung,
and that could make 1999 "Year X" -- the milestone planners had
expected the country to reach only after 2010.</P>
      <P>The faster-than-expected population growth, from just three
million in 1990, is the result of a rapid increase in immigration.</P>
      <P>The trend is clear from already published statistics. The
government's latest monthly digest of statistics in December put the
total population in mid-1998 at 3.87 million.</P>
      <P>The growth rate in the past two years was 3.5 percent. If that
rate is maintained, the population will break the four million mark
later this year.</P>
      <P>In the early 1990s, four million was regarded as the number of
people Singapore could house comfortably.</P>
      <P>According to the latest issue of Singapore Facts and Figures, the
land area in 1997 was about 648 square kilometers. If this is
unchanged, the population density will be higher than anticipated, at

    <TEXT>
      <P>Jean Chretien, prime minister of Canada,
apologized Tuesday for missing the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein
on Monday.</P>
      <P>The apology came after strong media and opposition criticism that
Canada was alone in the international community in not sending its
head of government or chief of state. Its Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy attended the ceremony in Amman.</P>
      <P>"I'm sorry," Chretien said last night from a family skiing
holiday at Whistler, in western Canada. "Nobody knows when somebody
will die."</P>
      <P>He offered his apology again Tuesday when he visited the
ambassador of Jordan, and "he understood very well," Chretien said.</P>
      <P>"They know that we have good relations with Jordan. I'm sorry
that I could not make it and I expressed such to the ambassador, who
understood," he added.</P>
      <P>Chretien dismissed suggestions he should have canceled his
weekend ski trip, given reports that Hussein was being flown home to
die following failed cancer treatment in the United States.</P>
      <P>"Listen, for me, I wasn't going to stay in Ottawa to wait," he
said. "I had organized this. I went skiing with my grandchildren."</P>
      <P>In the House of Commons, opposition members spent the whole day
criticizing the Liberal government for shaming Canada and snubbing
Jordan. Newspaper opinion pages and radio talks shows were also
filled up with unfavorable comments on Chretien's "unwise" decision.</P>
      <P>The Liberals were taking the charges so seriously that Gen.
Maurice Baril, the chief of staff of Canada's Armed Forces, was to
issue a statement later in the day explaining why Chretien could not
have been transported to Jordan in time for the funeral.</P>

during 1998, or 1.7 percent up on the previous year, making Taiwan
Hong Kong's second-biggest sources of visitors after mainland China.</P>
      <P>The moderate surge in the number of Taiwan visitors was credited
to a relaxation of visa regulations by the Hong Kong government.</P>
      <P>Spending in Hong Kong by this group, however, decreased to a
total of HK$10.73 billion (US$1.37 billion), which translated into an
expenditure of HK$5,924 (US$759.48) per head, or 16.2 percent lower
than the 1997 figure.</P>
      <P>The plummet in spending was blamed on the financial storm which
has been ravaging the region over the last year, leading to currency
devaluations in many Southeastern Asian states. This has made
commodity prices in Hong Kong relatively high because of the linkage
between the HK dollar and the US dollar.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States on Tuesday reiterated
its opposition to Beijing's possible veto of the extension of the
mandate of United Nations peacekeeping forces in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The US position was made clear following an announcement by
mainland China that it was suspending diplomatic relations with
Macedonia and reconsidering its position on the extension of the
mandate of the UN Preventative Deployment Force in Macedonia in
retaliation for the Balkan nation establishing official ties with the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Answering reporters at a routine State Department news briefing,
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that the issue of whether
to extend the stay of UN peacekeeping forces in a potential trouble
spot was last raised when Beijing backed down on a threat to veto a
1997 resolution to send a UN peacekeeping force to train police in
the Caribbean nation of Haiti.</P>
      <P>The US position is that the issue should not be linked to
Beijing's objections regarding the relationship between Macedonia and
its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Rubin stressed again that the US supports the extension of the UN
Preventative Deployment Force's mandate in the southeast European
country. The current mandate expires on Feb. 20.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the permanent members of the UN Security
Council should keep in mind that their special status makes them
obliged to give priority to international peace and security.</P>
      <P>Rubin also reiterated that the US should maintain its unofficial
relations with Taiwan under the US "one China" policy.

      <P>It is Beijing rather than Taipei which is
stalling over a visit to Taiwan by the head of its top negotiator
with the Republic of China, according to a statement on Wednesday by
Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF).</P>
      <P>Shi made the comment in a rebuttal of claims by Beijing's
mouthpieces in Hong Kong that Taiwan is blocking the visit of
Chairman Wang Daohan of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) by backtracking on a consensus reached by Wang
and his Taiwan counterpart, Koo Chen-fu, last October.</P>
      <P>Beijing criticized Taipei's forsaking of the Koo-Wang agreement
to open dialogue on economic and political issues during Wang's
Taiwan trip by refusing to dispatch a SEF deputy secretary-general to
exchange views with his mainland counterpart on the agenda for Wang's
visit.</P>
      <P>Accusing Beijing of trying to impose its will on Taipei, Shi said
Wang's trip, which mainland China has promised will take place within
this year, should not be subject to any preconditions.</P>
      <P>Beijing's attempt to force the island to sit at a political
negotiating table, and make this a condition of Wang's proposed
Taiwan trip is the real hurdle to the Koo-Wang meeting in Taiwan,

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIAN RULING PARTY UNDECIDED ON HABIBIE FOR PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party has not
yet decided if it will nominate President B.J. Habibie as its
presidential candidate in November, even though he now appears to be
its strongest contender, party chairman Akbar Tandjung has been
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>In somewhat cryptic remarks mirroring a reluctance among party
elders to anoint the president for a full five-year term after the
June general election, he told reporters that several other ministers
along with Habibie were potential nominees.</P>
      <P>The party will name its candidate before the June 7 election for
the 500-seat parliament, he added.</P>
      <P>The 500 MPs will join another 200 appointees -- most of whom will
be picked by Habibie -- in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR),
which will elect the new president and vice president in November.</P>
      <P>"Certainly, he is the best candidate that Golkar could nominate,"
Akbar was quoted as saying by the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The three leading opposition parties have indicated they will
contest the June polls on the strength of their presidential
candidates -- in each case their party chairman.</P>
      <P>With no party likely to win with a clear majority, the clustering
of coalition partners could pivot around their choice of presidential
candidates, with the support of the military and its bloc of 38 seats
extremely crucial in a tight contest.</P>
      <P>Several Golkar leaders, including some in the Cabinet, have
indicated that in line with a general consensus among Jakarta's
intelligentsia that Habibie would not be a popular choice because of
lingering perceptions that he is a crony of ousted former President
Suharto, they would prefer to keep the party's options open.</P>
      <P>Akbar himself is seen as a more natural choice, with Justice
Minister Muladi described as a "dark horse."</P>

      <P>The balance of import and export foreign

January, a two-year high for a single month, the Central Bank of

      <P>You attributed the apparent climb in the settlement surplus
mainly to exporters selling their foreign currencies to obtain New

returned to Hong Kong after paying NT$40 million (US$1.24 million) in
bail and spending over a year in Taiwan, including 34 days in
detention, for involvement in a land bribery scandal.</P>
      <P>Lim, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Lai Sun Group and a major
shareholder of Hong Kong's Asia Television, said upon his departure
that he is pleased be heading home before the Lunar New Year and is
thankful for the concern Taiwan people have shown him over the past

      <P>Lim was arrested in Taipei in December 1997 on charges of bribery
and was released on a NT$10 million bail on Jan. 19, 1998.</P>
      <P>The 88-year-old business magnate was convicted on bribery charges

    <HEADLINE>US DOWNPLAYS TAIWAN'S INTEREST IN TMD SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's interest in the US' theater
missile defense (TMD) system is primarily informational, US State
Department spokesman James Rubin said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Rubin was responding to a London Financial Times report stating
that the increased number of mainland Chinese missiles targeted at
Taiwan justifies providing the island with the defense system.</P>
      <P>"We carefully monitor the military balance in the Taiwan Strait
on an ongoing basis. The Defense Department is preparing a
comprehensive assessment of the military balance in the region,
including missile deployments," the spokesman said at a news briefing
here.</P>
      <P>Rubin reiterated Washington's vow to adhere to the Taiwan
Relations Act and noted that the Defense Department's report is
expected to be passed on to the Congress very soon.</P>
      <P>He said: "Consistent with our obligations under this law and part
of our policy, we regularly consult with Taiwan on its defense
requirements. As part of these defense requirements, we have briefed
Taiwan, as we have many other friends, on theater missile defense. We
do expect (the Pentagon's) report that has generated this article in
this specific newspaper to be submitted shortly, but it would be
impossible for me to talk about a report that has not yet been
submitted or to comment on information that might be of a sensitive
nature."</P>
      <P>As to whether Taiwan has sought information about the purchase of
Patriot missile systems, Rubin replied, "As I indicated, their
interest in theater missile defense appears to be primarily
informational."</P>
      <P>On the question of China's breaking relations with Macedonia and
the possibility of the Macedonian peace talks being disrupted, the
State Department spokesman said: "The decision whether or not to
recognize Taiwan is for the Macedonian government to make. The US
takes no official position on whether countries establish diplomatic
relations with other countries. We have no position on China's
decisions regarding its relations with Macedonia."</P>
      <P>The US supports the extension of the UN mission in Macedonia by
the Security Council, Rubin stated, adding that, "we will urge all
Security Council members to do the same. We believe that the UN
mission in Macedonia contributes to peace and stability in the
region, particularly in light of the continuing crisis in Kosovo. We
see no reason to connect UNPREDEP's role and mandate with other
issues."</P>
      <P>Rubin refused to comment on any potential US-China contacts about
the subject. "There is a history of times when this has been a
problem, so we're not unconcerned about it, but we hope and expect
that other countries will make their decisions based on the important
role that the UNPREDEP plays in promoting stability in the region,"
he said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Year-end bonuses for private sector workers
in 1998 generally fell below 1997 levels due to the lingering
economic slowdown, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council cited the results of a recent survey as
showing that 60 percent of private businesses planned to offer
year-end bonuses to their employees with an average amount of 1.64
months of their monthly salaries, slightly lower than 1997's 1.75
months.</P>
      <P>Of all the different employment categories, those working in
utilities topped other industrial sectors by receiving an average of
2.18 months of salary as a year-end bonus.</P>
      <P>In the service sector, banking and insurance took the lead, with
an average bonus of 2.48 months of salary, higher than 1997's 1.98
months.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA study, the average year-end bonus in the
industrial sector in the 1997-98 period was 1.63 months, down 0.2
month from the 1996 level; while that for the service sector remained
at 1.66 months for the third straight year.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the 1998 average year-end bonus in the
manufacturing sector was 1.65 months, but about 70 percent of
manufacturing companies said their year-end bonus could reach two
months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 70 percent of companies in the recession-hit
construction industry said they would offer their employees year-end
bonuses with an average amount of 1.47 months, lower than 1997's 1.68
months.</P>
      <P>The 1998 year-end bonus for workers in the mining and gravel
industries was 1.11 months on average, but about 50 percent of
workers in the two industries said their year-end bonuses fell below
the one month level.</P>
      <P>In the service sector, those working in commerce and trading
services can expect to receive an average of 1.62 months of salary as
a year-end bonus for 1998, compared to 1.51 months for those in the
transportation, warehouse and communications sectors, and 1.42 months
for those in social and personal services.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said large enterprises usually offered higher
bonuses to their employees than small- and medium-sized companies.
Survey results also showed that corporate earnings are an important
factor in determining the amount of year-end bonuses.</P>
      <P>Another interesting finding was that more and more companies
dispatched company stocks or dividends to their salaried workers as
year-end bonuses to enhance employee loyalty and work performance.</P>

in the Black Sea resort of Yalta to map out Europe's future.

A secret agreement, among other conclusion, is reached on Feb.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "In the knowledge of letters and
arts, I may perhaps compare myself with other men. But as for the
character of a good and wise man who carries out in his personal
conduct what he professes -- that is something which I have not yet
attained."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MAC REVIEWS REPATRIATION INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) met on Thursday to review the stabbing incident which occurred
during the repatriation of mainland Chinese hijackers on Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Wu An-chia headed the meeting which was
attended by Yu Yi-tan, deputy director-general of National Police
Administration (NPA); Hou You-yi, deputy director of Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB); and Hsieh Fu-yuan, Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) director of the Department of Legal Affairs, and
other related officials.</P>
      <P>The victim in the incident, Jan Jyh-horng, SEF deputy
secretary, also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>While Wu declined to reveal the contents of the meeting, he said
its purpose was to exchange views on the process of repatriation and
discuss solutions to problems to avoid similar events from occurring
again.</P>
      <P>There was no discussion on possible disciplinary measures for
those responsible for the unfortunate incident, Wu said, adding that
the MAC and SEF will take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Jan also said that the meeting was to review the repatriation
purposes and not to point fingers.</P>
      <P>As Jan was escorting the mainlanders to be repatriated, he was
attacked by one of the nine hijackers who was armed with a sharp
metal object. Jan sustained a cut to the neck which required two
stitches.</P>
      <P>The attacker, Yang Mingde, and three others -- Lin Wenquiang, Shi
Yuebo, and Wang Zhihua -- were detained and later transferred to
Taipei to face prosecution while the other five were sent back to the
mainland as scheduled.</P>
      <P>After initial investigations, authorities discovered that Yang's
attack was premeditated and that the four men planned to carry out
another hijack during the repatriation process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the NPA on Wednesday meted out disciplinary measures
against several officials over the lapse in security.</P>
      <P>Hu Yi-kang, director of Hsinchu detention center where the nine
hijackers were sent before leaving Taiwan, was reprimanded for
negligence in management which resulted in the hijackers arming
themselves with metal objects taken from the center.</P>
      <P>CIB official Chou Wen-ke, who escorted the nine mainlanders
during the repatriation process, as well as CIB Director Cheng
Chin-sung were also reprimanded.</P>
      <P>The incident has damaged the prestige of the government as well
as that of the police, NPA Director-General Ting Yuan-chin said,
adding that he will submit himself for punishment from the Ministry
of the Interior.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US HAS NO POSITION ON COUNTRIES' HAVING TIES WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has no position as to
which countries should have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Stanley
Roth, US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs, said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Roth made the remark at a hearing on US policy toward the
Asian-Pacific region, organized by the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee of
the House International Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that the US ambassador to Macedonia had
allegedly attempted to persuade Macedonia not to establish diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, Roth said he had not heard about the matter.</P>
      <P>He said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reiterated on
Feb. 3 when she met with Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski
that the United States has no position on the question of whether
other countries should have diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Roth also said that he hoped Macedonia's links with Taiwan would
not affect mainland China's role in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Beijing on Tuesday suspended diplomatic ties with Macedonia and
warned that it would reconsider whether to veto an extension of the
mandate authorizing UN peacekeeping forces in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Roth said the United States supports the mandate's extension.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a US-proposed Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system
that would cover portions of East Asia, Roth said the US Defense
Department would submit before this weekend a report on the
deployment of such a system.</P>
      <P>In regard to relations across Taiwan Strait, Roth said last
October's meeting between the top negotiators from both sides of the
Taiwan Strait was an important development in bilateral relations
between mainland China and Taiwan. The meeting showed there is room
for the two sides to proceed with dialogue, Roth said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INCREASING AMOUNT OF TAIWAN IT PRODUCTION MOVES TO MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's high-tech industries are following
in the footsteps of labor-intensive industries that have moved their
manufacturing operations to mainland China, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Noting that less than 60 percent of Taiwan's information
technology (IT) products were actually manufactured on the island
last year, while nearly 30 percent of the products were made in the
mainland, CEPD officials warned that the trend could develop into a
serious issue that would require close monitoring.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials cited statistics compiled by the Market
Information Center of the Institute for Information Industry (III) as
indicating that the volume of locally made Taiwan IT products has
fallen in recent years, while overseas manufacturing has risen.</P>
      <P>The III tallies showed that in 1995, locally made products
constituted 72 percent of Taiwan's total IT production, while 14
percent was made in mainland China and another 14 percent was made in
Thailand, Malaysia and other countries.</P>
      <P>In 1996 67.9 percent of Taiwan's IT products were made locally,
while 16.8 percent were made in the mainland. Local manufacturing
percentages fell to 62.6 and 57.3, respectively, in 1997 and 1998,
while mainland-based manufacturing rose during those same two years
to 22.8 percent and 28.9 percent.</P>
      <P>From 1995 to 1998 notebook computers were the only IT product
that Taiwan companies manufactured on the island exclusively,
according to III tallies.</P>
      <P>More than 80 percent of Taiwan's desktop personal computers,
keyboards, power supplies, and mice are now made overseas, while more
than 70 percent of the monitors and computer cases carrying
made-in-Taiwan labels are processed overseas.</P>
      <P>Desktop image scanners, which all Taiwan companies made locally
until 1997, are now being built in the mainland as well. Now 38
percent of Taiwan scanners are built there, III officials noted.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said manufacturing operations based on
well-developed technologies tend to be moved overseas to lower
production costs. But products involving relatively new technologies
or ones that require continued research and development efforts are
still being manufactured mainly in Taiwan.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After several days of warm weather,
temperatures dropped Thursday afternoon as a cold front settled over
Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Weather forecasters said the mercury will dip ever lower between
Friday night and Saturday morning. Temperatures are expected to
plunge to as low as 11 degrees Celsius, and rain is expected for some
portions of the island as well.</P>
      <P>During the Chinese lunar New Year holiday, Feb. 15 to 18, the
weather is expected to be dry and cold.</P>
      <P>Forecasters advised people to watch for rapid changes in the
weather during the holidays and to avoid catching cold.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City traffic police noted that Friday will be
the last working day for most people before the lunar New Year
holiday. The annual exodus of people from Taiwan's capital as they
return to their hometowns in the other parts of the island, is
expected to begin Friday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Anticipating congestion on the island's major highways, police

    <HEADLINE>US SOFTWARE PROVIDER AVANT! TO SET UP TAIWAN R&amp;D CENTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Avant! Corp. of the United States will
establish a Taiwan research and envelopment center that can employ
100 computer software experts, according to the company's president,
chairman and CEO, Gerald C. Hsu, who is currently visiting Taipei.</P>
      <P>After his arrival in Taiwan Wednesday, Hsu said he believed the
greater Chinese community comprising Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland
China will become a leading software producer very soon.</P>
      <P>Headquartered in Fremont, California, Avant! develops, markets
and provides support for integrated circuit design automation (ICDA)
software for designing sub-micron ICs including microprocessors and
micro-controllers.</P>
      <P>Its revenue amounted to more than US$227 million in 1998, posting
38-percent growth from one year earlier. Avant! is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange under the name VAHN.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that as a new century approaches, the information
technology industry will serve as one of the driving forces in the
world's continued economic development.</P>
      <P>The Chinese people have been successful in the production of
information technology hardware, and evidence of their ability can be
seen not only in Taiwan and mainland China but also in Silicon Valley
in the United States, said Hsu, an ethnic Chinese.</P>
      <P>But fewer Chinese people have been involved in the production of
software, a market that is only beginning to take off and which still
has enormous potential, he said.</P>
      <P>Now is the best time for Chinese companies worldwide to get into
the software business, he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the company's future research and development center
in Taiwan, Hsu said that qualified manpower is the most important
requirement for a software maker. The company's Taiwan center will
provide training in software design.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has many skillful IT product designers. Provided with the
proper training, they can become skilled software designers as well,
Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD REFOCUS ITS IT PRODUCTION EFFORTS: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average growth of Taiwan's information
technology (IT) industry production value dropped during each of the
past two years from 20 percent average growth in 1996, said officials
from the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials under the Executive Yuan suggested companies focus
on the development of high-added-value products, so that Taiwan's
information industry may have a bright future.</P>
      <P>The domestic production value of Taiwan's information industry
before 1996 had stable growth. Taiwan's total IT production value
totaled US$11.58 billion in 1994, which represented year-on-year
growth of 19.5 percent. Production values climbed to US$14.07 billion
in 1995 and US$16.99 billion in 1996, as year-on-year growth amounted
to 21.5 percent in 1995 and 20.8 percent in 1996, said CEPD officials
who were citing statistics provided by the Institute for Information
Industry (III).</P>
      <P>The growth rate declined, however, starting in 1997, when
Taiwan's IT production value totaled US$19.07 billion, only 12
percent higher than in the previous year. Growth in 1998 amounted to
a scant 1 percent, as Taiwan's IT production value totaled US$19.22
billion.</P>
      <P>The plunge in Taiwan's domestic IT production value was related
to Taiwan companies' moving their manufacturing operations to
mainland China, noted CEPD officials.</P>
      <P>The IT production value growth of several advanced countries
continues to outpace Taiwan, even though they have higher labor
costs, officials said. Last year production values climbed 10 percent
in Britain, 8 percent in the United States, 5 percent in Germany and
France, and 3 percent in Japan.</P>
      <P>This shows there is still room for growth in the production of
high-added-value products, an area on which Taiwan manufacturers
should focus, said CEPD officials.</P>

      <P>Macedonian Information Minister
Rezxep Zllatku, leading a 30-member press group, on Thursday visited
the Yunlin-based Han Kuang Fruit and Vegetable Production Cooperative
Society in central Taiwan to study the cooperative's production and
sales methods.</P>
      <P>Zllatku was accompanied by Lin Shiang-nung, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, and by several Republic of
China foreign affairs officials on the fact-finding visit.</P>
      <P>He said he was very impressed by the island's ability to grow and
sell produce, noting that cooperatives similar to Han Kuang that were
established in the former Yugoslavia during the country's period of
communist rule performed poorly.</P>
      <P>Macedonia could learn from Taiwan in trying to establish
agricultural production and sales systems, he said.</P>
      <P>Han Kuang's turnover amounted to more than NT$540 million
(US$16.77 million) last year, far above the levels of other
cooperatives around the island.</P>
      <P>The state-run cooperative currently has 213 members and its
fields span 160 hectares. Twenty different kinds of fruits and
vegetables are grown by the cooperative, according to Han Kuang
executives.</P>
      <P>Han Kuang's distribution channels include wholesale outlets and
supermarkets, while it also sells vegetables under its own brand
name. Looking to expand its markets, the group developed a membership
system in which organically grown vegetables are delivered to member
companies and households.</P>
      <P>Zllatku arrived in Taipei on Sunday for a six-day visit, which is
the first of its kind since Taipei and Skojpe set up officials links

    <HEADLINE>ROC TIGHTENS INSPECTION OF AUSTRALIAN BEEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Standards, Metrology and
Inspection (BSMI) said on Thursday it has tightened inspection of
beef from Australia after South Korea detected that a batch of
Australian beef contained excess endosulfan pesticide residue.</P>
      <P>South Korean inspection and quarantine authorities found in late
January that a batch of Australian beef contained 0.16 ppm (parts
per million) of endosulfan residue, higher than the acceptable level
of 0.1 ppm. South Korean customs service then impounded the
contaminated Australian beef.</P>
      <P>As South Korea is Australia's third largest beef market, after
Japan and the United States, the incident has caused much concern
in the Australian beef industry.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government has also expressed concern
about the incident because Australia is one of Taiwan's major beef
import sources. Taiwan imports an average of NT$2.4 billion (US$74.3
million) worth of beef from Australia annually.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health and the BSMI said
they have taken necessary steps to prevent imports of
contaminated Australian beef.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO),
which represents Australian interests in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties, said the Australian government is concerned
about the contamination incident and that the Australian quarantine
office has cooperated closely with the ROC's public health and food
inspection authorities in strengthening inspection of Australian
beef.</P>
      <P>An ACIO spokesman said that starting last November, Australian
authorities have carefully inspected each batch of Australian beef
to be imported to Japan and Taiwan. "Only those passing the
examination would be exported. After the South Korean incident, we
have even further tightened the inspection to ensure safety and
wholesomeness of our products," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The Australian representative said he feels that South Korean
media had exaggerated the incident after one of 462 samples examined
by South Korean authorities was found to contain excess pesticide
residue.</P>
      <P>An ROC inspection official said that the tolerable endosulfan
content rate is set at 0.1 ppm in Taiwan. "Since we began to
strengthen inspection of Australian beef, we have not yet found any
sample containing excess endosulfan residue," he added.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The advisory committee on oil and
electricity prices under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
decided on Thursday to lower domestic natural gas prices.</P>
      <P>The changes will go into effect immediately upon approval by the
MOEA and will be retroactive to Feb. 1. After the price reductions
are approved, China Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will then cut its natural
gas prices.</P>
      <P>Domestic-use natural gas prices will fall 11.1 percent, while
prices for industrial-use natural gas will be lowered by 5.1 percent.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that as many as 6 million domestic-use and 500
industrial-use customers will benefit from the price reductions.</P>
      <P>The CPC sells natural gas to re-sellers in cities throughout
Taiwan. The companies then sell the gas to the public, basing their
prices on the cost of purchase.</P>
      <P>The CPC is expected to enact several price reductions:</P>
      <P>-- Locally produced natural gas for domestic use that is sold to
re-sellers will fall in price from NT$7.75 to NT$6.89 per cubic

    <HEADLINE>LOCALLY BUILT HEART DEVICE TO START CLINICAL TRIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Taiwan University Hospital
(NTUH) announced on Thursday that it has successfully completed
animal experiments with a locally built ventricular assist device and
will apply to conduct human clinical trials soon.</P>
      <P>NTUH Vice President Chu Shu-hsun said the new device, dubbed
Taita (National Taiwan University) No.1, can allow patients with
serious heart disease to wait longer for a heart transplant.</P>
      <P>The device was designed and produced entirely by a group of NTUH
cardiologists and experts in chemical engineering, electric
engineering and other relevant fields from National Taiwan
University, Chung Yuan Christian University and the National Science
Council.</P>
      <P>Chu, himself a cardiologist, said the device has already
undergone trials with 30 small cattle weighing between 80 and 100
kilograms. One of the cattle died of pneumonia after the Taita No. 1
had been in place for 129 days.</P>
      <P>"The 30th cattle in the trial, which is still under way, has had
the device in place for 115 days," Chu said, adding that the cattle,
which suffers from a heart condition called mitral insufficiency, is
faring very well with the assistance of the Taita No. 1. "We hope it
will set a new record for the use of the device."</P>
      <P>Chu said NTU Hospital has applied for patent rights to the new
device. "We will also apply for permission from the Department of
Health to conduct human clinical trials on the Taita No. 1 in the
near future."</P>
      <P>With the success of the animal experiment, Chu said he is
convinced that there will be no major problems for human beings using
the new device.</P>
      <P>Chu went on to say that the Taita No. 1 is smaller, lighter and
cheaper than similar foreign-made instruments.</P>
      <P>For instance, the pump installed in the Taita No. 1 weighs only
650 grams, while its battery weighs slightly more than 2 kilograms.</P>
      <P>"The device can easily be transported by the average person. It
is equipped with an 'intelligent controller' to adapt to the
individual carrier's physiological conditions, and can be used for
six hours on a single charge. More important, it is easy to operate,
can be used repeatedly after sterilization and costs only NT$200,000
for each use," Chu explained.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chu said, similar foreign devices are usually bulky
and very expensive. "The pump installed in a similar foreign
instrument alone weighs 2 to 3 kilograms, and it costs NT$1 million
for each use," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chu said the device can help reduce the load on the heart,
allowing patients with heart deficiencies to be able to wait longer
for a heart transplant. "The longest recorded use of a ventricular
assist device at NTU Hospital is 287 days," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, an average of 200 patients need heart
transplants here each year, 10 to 20 of whom die during the waiting
period for a suitable donor organ.</P>
      <P>Chu said the new locally developed device is expected to help
some of these patients to survive until a new heart becomes available
for them.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a few years people in Singapore will
carry an Internet identity card (IC) that they can use to apply for
passports, pay traffic fees and renew drivers' licenses.</P>
      <P>Stephen Yeo, chief executive of the National Computer Board
(NCB), declined to say when the cards will be made available, though
he did say that by 2001 half of Singapore's government services will
be available online.</P>
      <P>With the cards, government agencies could verify a person's
identity before releasing important information or approving a
transaction.</P>
      <P>In the event of a dispute, the electronic trail left by the
Internet IC would help to clear things up.</P>
      <P>Yeo made the remarks at a press conference marking NCB's release
of Electronic Transactions (Certification Authority) Regulations.</P>
      <P>These regulations lay down the licensing guidelines for companies
who want to issue online ICs and electronic signatures, which certify
a person's identity in online transactions.</P>
      <P>The regulations designate the NCB as the licensing and regulatory
body of the certification industry.</P>
      <P>Singapore currently has only one certification body -- Netrust --
which is owned by NCB and the Network for Electronic Transfers. Yeo

    <HEADLINE>ROC REAFFIRMS WELCOME TO MAINLAND TOP NEGOTIATOR'S VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Thursday
reaffirmed its welcome to a planned visit to Taipei by mainland
China's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely welcome Wang Daohan's planned visit to Taiwan,"
said Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Jan was responding to an allegation by mainland China's
mouthpiece in Hong Kong, the Wen Wei Pao, saying that
Taiwan's continued refusal to open political dialogue with the
mainland will hinder Wang's Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>Jan said the Wen Wei Pao cannot represent the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"What we really care is ARATS President Wang Daohan's personal
opinion. Since Wang has expressed his desire to visit Taiwan, we'll
wait for ARATS' response to our invitation," Jan said.</P>
      <P>SEF faxed a message to ARATS on Jan. 22 inviting its mainland
counterpart to send a deputy secretary-general to Taipei in late
February to discuss details concerning Wang's planned Taiwan visit.
ARATS already agreed to send a deputy secretary-general to Taipei to
discuss the issue, but the timing has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Jan said he hopes Beijing-affiliated organizations or media
will not make unfounded allegations or politically-motivated rumors
to affect the atmosphere for cross-strait engagement.</P>
      <P>Wang's planned Taiwan visit is a reciprocal event to SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu's ice-melting visit to the mainland last
October.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a senior mainland affairs official said on
Thursday that cross-strait talks should first focus on issues related
the well-being and legitimate rights and interests of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland and
oversees SEF operations, said now is not the right time for
cross-strait political dialogue.</P>
      <P>"If the two sides start discussion on highly sensitive political
issues, such as unification, right now, no concrete results can be
achieved. Worse yet, such talks would only make cross-strait
relations become less flexible and even deadlocked," Wu
explained.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the ROC's stance on cross-strait dialogue
has been clear and consistent.</P>
      <P>"We have consistently advocated consultation on the many
practical issues arising from cross-strait civilian exchanges over
the past 12 years," Wu said.</P>
      <P>"Such issues include the repatriation of mainland hijackers,
cross-strait fishing disputes, repatriation of illegal mainland
immigrants and protection of personal safety and property rights of
Taiwan investors on the mainland," Wu said, adding that all these
problems should be resolved as soon as possible to boost the common
well-being and rights of people on both sides of the strait.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan has agreed to open its
market to limited imports of US livestock products before its entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO), it will not concede to a
similar demand from Canada, agricultural officials said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's agriculture negotiations with Canada under the WTO
framework are closed, and will not be reopened, said Cheng
Chung-chiang, an official at Taiwan's Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>In order to join the WTO, Taiwan has completed negotiations with
26 WTO member states to ensure their support for its membership bid.
All of them have signed bilateral agreements to endorse Taiwan's WTO
bid, except for Canada and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong has refused to sign out of respect for Beijing's
insistence that Taiwan should not be allowed to enter the trade
regulatory group before Beijing's membership has been granted.</P>
      <P>Canada has been stalling over its demands that it be accorded the
same preferential treatment Taiwan granted to the United States,
namely, annual imports from the United States of 1,000 metric tons of
poultry, 5,000 metric tons of pig belly and rib, and 7,500 metric
tons each of pig and cattle offal before the island's formal
initiation into the WTO -- a so-called "down payment."</P>
      <P>Cheng said that acceding to Ottawa's demands might cause other
member states to renege on their signed agreements in order to get
similar treatment.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has already had to face numerous demands from
WTO member states intent on prying open Taiwan's market, the official
said that Taipei will not complicate its own application by bowing to
Canada's demands.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Tang Fei
said on Thursday that Taiwan has not yet decided whether to join the
theater missile defense (TMD) system, but has been studying ways of
countering the missile threat from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tang made the comments in response to a foreign press report that
mainland China has deployed 150-200 M9 and M11 missiles in southern
China, aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the mainland move was apparently prompted by Taiwan's
study of whether or not to take part in the US-proposed TMD system,
adding that Beijing's move "will heighten the tension between Taiwan
and the mainland."</P>
      <P>The defense minister noted that besides the M9 and M11 missiles,
mainland China also possesses submarines, missile destroyers and
SU-27 jet fighters, deployment of which would definitely affect the
stability of the region.</P>
      <P>Tang pointed out that mainland China's missiles are certain to
greatly affect the morale of the people of Taiwan, and cited as an
example of this the worry and apprehension caused here by mainland
China's military exercises in the Taiwan Strait three years ago.</P>
      <P>Although the study of ways to defend the island against mainland
missiles is very costly, he went on, the country should maintain
sufficient defense capability to protect the security of the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER VOWS TO PULL TAIWAN THROUGH ECONOMIC STORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew expressed confidence
on Thursday that Taiwan will weather the regional financial storm and
became an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" in the economic field.</P>
      <P>On the eve of an extraordinary conference on the current economic
problems and their resolution, Siew said that Taiwan is feeling the
bite of the regional economic tumult through its finances and falling
exports, but has been spared the blunt of the crisis because of its
freedom from problems regarding trade deficit, lack of foreign
reserves, fleeing foreign capital, and fluctuating exchange rates
which have plagued its neighbors in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's problems stem from inside rather than outside, said
Siew, referring to the heavy exposure to high-leverage ventures in
the bourse and property market by some local firms.</P>
      <P>The failure of those firms threatens the fabric of the economy
and has significantly eroded investor confidence, he said.</P>
      <P>In order to address the issues, Siew said his government has
prescribed both short-term measures to calm down the market, and a
long-term cure to revamp the ailing economic structure.</P>
      <P>The short-term measures, aimed at stabilizing the economy and
financial market, will be subject to regular review to ensure they
will not disrupt the effect of the long-term measures by affecting
market forces.</P>
      <P>He spelled out five directions for the government's future
efforts: the streamlining of the financial and fiscal system; the
revamping of the labor market; the reviewing of the policies on land
and property; and the reorganization of businesses.</P>
      <P>Warning that the financial crisis is not yet over, Siew called on
the private sector to join forces with the government and work true
to form as the leader of the "four Asian tigers" by pulling the
nation through the current crisis.</P>
      <P>Friday's economic conference will bring together 140
representatives from the government, industry, academic circles, and
lawmakers for two days of discussions.</P>
      <P>The government is hoping the meeting will chart a map that will
guide the country out of the economic doldrums.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING  MISSILE DEPLOYMENT UNFRIENDLY: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's deployment of missiles targeting
Taiwan is an unfriendly move and will adversely affect the feelings
of the people of Taiwan toward mainland China, Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Su Chi said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the face of the missile threat, Taiwan is entitled to consider
ways to enhance its defenses, Su said in an exclusive interview with
CNA.</P>
      <P>He was referring to news reports that Beijing has targeted 150 to
200 of it's M-9 and M-11 missiles deployed in southern mainland China
at Taiwan, and that Taiwan is assessing the possibility of
participating in the US-initiated Theater Missile Defense system
(TMD).</P>
      <P>Su, who was deputy secretary-general to President Lee Teng-hui
before taking his MAC post on Feb. 1, urged all the countries of the
world to pay attention to Beijing's recent military build-up, saying
it will not only worry neighboring Japan, but also pose a threat to
the security and interests of the United States, Australia, and the
countries of Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's objection to Taiwan's role in the TMD system, Su
said that it's still too early to say whether Taiwan will join the
system.</P>
      <P>Beijing's opposition to the TMD, like its recent arrest of 30
mainland dissidents preparing to form a new political party, is
nothing but a strategy "to nip trouble in the bud," Su said.</P>
      <P>Rebutting Beijing vice premier Qian Qichen's allegation that the
shrinking of Taiwan's diplomatic space is becoming a trend, Su said:
"It's Beijing that has been pushing this trend.</P>
      <P>"Without the `pushing hand' (Beijing), the trend would be
reversed," he added.</P>
      <P>On the timing of a long-awaited visit to Taipei by Wang Daohan,
mainland's top negotiator with Taiwan and chairman of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Su said that Taipei
will not set any specific date for Wang's visit. "He will be welcome
here any time this year."</P>
      <P>Wang's Taipei trip in 1999 was part of the consensus reached
between Wang and Koo Chen-fu, Chairman of Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) late last year in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Spelling out his expectations for Wang's visit, Su said that the
visit, if it proceeds well, will help improve cross-strait relations,
thus giving a boost to the possibility of a historical meeting
between Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui and mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, and contributing to regional peace and
security.</P>
      <P>Su also rejected Beijing's snub of Lee's concept of "neo Taiwan
persons," a new term spelled out by the president while campaigning
for Taipei mayoral candidate Ma Ying-jeou in last December's
election.</P>
      <P>"What we term ourselves is our internal affair, one which Beijing
is not in a position to interfere with ... and if the Beijing
authorities are not happy with our calling ourselves the Republic of
China, why can't we say we are Taiwan?" he added.</P>
      <P>With regard to the stationing of mainland reporters in Taiwan on
a regular basis, Su said Taipei would welcome mainland reporters to
Taiwan, but their long-term stay in the island should be decided only
after negotiations between the two sides.</P>

President Ronald Reagan and as senior director of Latin American
affairs. His earlier Latin American experience included service at
the US embassies in Honduras and Guatemala, according to the AIT news
release.</P>
      <P>Burghardt was a political counselor in Beijing from 1987 to 1989.
He has also worked as a political officer in Hong Kong and Saigon and
as deputy director of the State Department's Office of Vietnam, Laos

    <TEXT>
      <P>The US government on Thursday played
down the significance of news reports about mainland China's missile
build-up against Taiwan, but promised to monitor closely the military
balance across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Government spokesmen also reiterated strong US interest in peace
and stability in the area and said it will continue to assist Taiwan
in meeting its defense needs.</P>
      <P>"We have a strong interest in maintaining peace and stability in

United States will continue to closely monitor the military balance

adequate defense.</P>
      <P>The assurance came after several news reports this week about
mainland China's massive missile build-up vis-a-vis Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Lockhart and the spokesmen for both the State Department and
the Pentagon refuted any suggestion of major new changes in mainland
China's missile deployment.</P>
      <P>Growing deployment near Taiwan "is not a new threat" but in fact
stretches back more than five years, said James Foley, deputy
spokesman of the State Department.</P>
      <P>"Reports that suggest that there has been a sudden new deployment
are wrong," he said.</P>
      <P>He refused to be drawn when asked whether the deployment poses a
threat to Taiwan that needs a US response.</P>
      <P>"Military capabilities are military capabilities, he said. "And
what is often as important are intentions, the political context
behind military capabilities."</P>
      <P>He reiterated the United States' intention to continue to assess
the requirements for maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>At briefings at the White House, the State Department and the
Department of Defense, the US reaction to mainland China's missile
intimidation of Taiwan three years ago was mentioned.</P>
      <P>"The testing of these missiles in 1996 precipitated the US
deploying to the area two carrier groups to the Strait," said the
White House press secretary.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether Taiwan would be included in the
US-led Theater Missile Defense (TMD) umbrella, both Foley and
Lockhart said that relevant technologies are some years away from
maturity.</P>
      <P>They said that a decision will be made in the future, "taking
into account the development of such technologies, Taiwan's defense
needs, and how, in our view, it is best to maintain peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Both Foley and Capt. Michael Doubleday, the Pentagon's deputy
spokesman, also pointed out that Taiwan is addressing its own defense
needs and so far their interest in TMD is primarily informational.</P>
      <P>Capt. Doubleday also said that two Taiwan-related studies
mandated by Congress are still being reviewed by Pentagon officials
and will be submitted in the near future.</P>
      <P>One of the reports deals with the establishment of TMD for US
allies in East Asia and the other addresses the military balance
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Their submissions have been delayed from Jan. 1 and Feb. 1,
respectively, amid reported differences between the Pentagon, the
State Department and the National Security Council over the contents.</P>

      <P>The minister of the Republic of China's
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) met with Paraguayan
President Raul Cubas Grau on Thursday and invited him to visit Taiwan
on behalf of ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chiao Jen-ho was formally introduced to Cubas at the meeting by
Paraguayan Foreign Affairs Minister Dido Florentin Bogado.</P>
      <P>After the 60-minute meeting, Chiao said in an interview with CNA
that during the talk he thanked Cubas for ensuring the protection of
ROC nationals living in Paraguay. He said such safety guarantees
would attract more ROC business investment into the Latin American
country.</P>
      <P>Chiao on Thursday also visited Chinese schools in Paraguay.
Speaking of OCAC's works to promote overseas Chinese education, the
minister stressed that promoting Chinese-language courses in schools
overseas has been one of the OCAC's major tasks.</P>
      <P>The OCAC spends half of its funds each year to supply equipment
to overseas Chinese schools and to improve the quality of instruction
at those schools. The commission is now working to develop online
Chinese-language courses available over the Internet, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiao added, the OCAC is also very willing to serve as
"matchmaker" that works to establish sister ties between educational
institutions in Taiwan and those that serve ethnic Chinese students
overseas.</P>

      <P>Objections by mainland Chinese
authorities to a decision by Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal has
set the stage for a profound crisis in mainland China's relationship
with Hong Kong, a scholar said .</P>
      <P>In an article in The Australian Financial Review on Friday, Yash
Ghai, professor of public law at the University of Hong Kong, said
central to this principle is not only a high degree of autonomy for
the region, but also the maintenance of separate economic, political
and social systems.</P>
      <P>Mainland China appeared to be taking a largely hands-off approach
to Hong Kong until last week. But the decision by a Hong Kong court
granting mainland-born children of Hong Kong citizens the right to
live in the former British colony has drawn fire from mainland
authorities.</P>
      <P>Ghai said: "Legality was always considered central to the
security of the arrangements for the autonomy of Hong Kong. First
there are international legal foundations for the autonomy in the
shape of the Sino-British Joint Declaration under which Britain
agreed to transfer Hong Kong to China in return for assurances of
high autonomy."</P>
      <P>He said the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which translates these
assurances into domestic constitutional law, has the high status of
an Organic Law of the National People's Congress.</P>

      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
is mulling over a proposal from advisers that he visit Tibet later
this year to help pacify anti-Beijing sentiment, according to a
report carried in The South China Morning Post on Friday.</P>
      <P>Pro-independence activities in Tibet and Xinjiang are deemed
serious threats to stability, the report said.</P>
      <P>It quoted a Beijing source as saying that the authorities had
mobilized new resources to ensure law and order in Tibet in the
run-up to the 40th anniversary of an anti-Beijing uprising in the
spring.</P>
      <P>"Jiang will only go to Tibet when the situation has calmed down,"
a diplomatic source was reported as saying.</P>
      <P>"His party standing will be immensely boosted if his visit there
can help cool anti-Han Chinese sentiments."</P>
      <P>The source said a trip to Tibet in the 1980s by late party

improvement in Beijing-Tibet ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JEFFREY KOO SUGGESTS GOV'T CREATE BOND FUND TO SAVE LOCAL BOURSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A domestic business tycoon suggested on
Friday that the government raise NT$400 billion by selling government
bonds and use the money to buy blue chip stocks on the local stock
market in an effort to save the bourse.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce, offered the suggestion after three major
industrial and commercial groups made similar proposals at a national
meeting on Taiwan's economic and financial situation organized by the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The national meeting on Taiwan's economic and financial situation
opened Friday and will close Saturday.</P>
      <P>Koo noted Japan's success in using funds generated through bond
sales to prop up a sagging stock market two years ago. Japanese banks
and securities brokerage companies jointly set up a 230-billion-yen
government bond fund in 1997, when Japan's stock market was in the
doldrums. The fund produced impressive results, he said.</P>
      <P>Issuing government bonds to generate funds for purchasing blue
chip stocks would not only stabilize the market but also increase the
national treasury's revenue through the imposition of securities
transaction taxes, Koo said.</P>
      <P>Kao Ching-yuan, chairman of Chinese National Federation of
Industries, said that although the government established a NT$200
billion stock market stabilization fund to prop up the market in
recent days, only NT$40 billion of the fund was used to purchase
shares. The effect of the government's purchases on the market was
not significant, he said.</P>
      <P>Kao said that if the government raises funds to purchase blue
chip stocks through the sale of government bonds, then perhaps
government intervention into the market would have the desired
stabilizing effect.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNFI CHAIRMAN HOPES TO VISIT MAINLAND IF CROSS-STRAIT TIES IMPROVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An influential Taiwan business leader said
on Friday that if Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan visits Taipei
as planned, and cross-strait talks proceed in a harmonious
atmosphere, he may consider visiting mainland China this year.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries (CNFI) and chairman of the President Group,
made the remarks during an economic conference sponsored by the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Kao is also a member of the ruling Kuomintang's policymaking
Central Standing Committee. He last visited mainland China in August
1996, at the head of a major business delegation. During that trip,
he met with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>It was the first trade promotion delegation to mainland China
since cross-strait ties became strained earlier that year when
Beijing conducted a series of war games in waters near Taiwan in an
attempt to influence the island's first direct presidential election.</P>
      <P>Kao said that he is looking forward to the visit to Taiwan by
Chairman Wang Daohan of Beijing's Association for Relation Across the
Taiwan Strait, and that he believes the visit will help improve
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He also said that a successful visit by Wang might prompt the ROC
government to relax its restrictive policy toward investment in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The policy was initiated by President Lee Teng-hui in the wake of
Kao's 1996 visit, a move which was aimed at avoiding Taiwan's
over-reliance on the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Since then, Kao has taken a low-key attitude toward the issues of
cross-strait trade and economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>The business tycoon's statement on Friday broke his silence on
the matter, as he announced his wish to lead another economic and
trade delegation on a market-inspection visit to mainland China
before he steps down from the position of CNFI chairman at the end of
February 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER VOWS TO RESHAPE ROC ECONOMIC STRUCTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday vowed to
strive to reshape Taiwan's economic structure and systems in order to
make the island into an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" in the
Asia-Pacific economic arena.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of an extraordinary conference on Taiwan's
current economic problems and their resolution, Siew said that
although Taiwan has been fortunate enough to retain its status and
flexibility as Asia's "economic little giant" amid the Asian
financial meltdown, it needs to restructure its economy and related
systems from the top down.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has not been able to free itself entirely from
the Asian economic storm, the country managed to achieve a 4.8
percent growth rate in 1998, which Siew described as "really
something, even though not very satisfactory."</P>
      <P>In recent months, however, Taiwan has become mired in a series of
economic and financial problems, which have stemmed from the inside
rather than the outside. These problems have included heavy exposure
to high-leverage ventures in the bourse and property market by some
local firms. The subsequent failure of those firms now threatens the
fabric of the economy and has eroded investor confidence, Siew
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Despite the irregularities, he said, various indices show that
most of the problems are still under control. For example, he said,
the rate of overdue loans given by domestic banks is at an average of
under 5 percent, while the rate of self-held capitalization by
enterprises averages 54 percent, much higher than in other Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that Taiwan has absolutely no need to worry about
being caught in the last stages of the Asian financial meltdown.
Taiwan has an economy which is basically healthy, solid foreign
exchange reserves, considerable creditor's rights on debts to foreign
countries, and commendable crisis-handling experience in both the
public and private sectors, he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, who also spoke at the opening session,
forecast that Taiwan's exports will resume growth this year, with
investments from the private sector being the prime mover behind the
country's overall economic growth.</P>
      <P>With the telecommunications, oil, and domestic aviation markets
opening further, Chiang predicted that Taiwan's overall economic
growth will top 5 percent this year.</P>
      <P>The economic conference has brought together nearly 200
representatives from the government, industry, academic circles, and
lawmakers, for one-and-a-half days of discussions.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the meeting will chart a map that will guide the
country out of the economic doldrums.</P>

      <P>The government is taking careful note of
reports that the Vatican would switch its embassy from Taipei to
Beijing if mainland China were to allow it, an official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>R.T. Yang, director-general of MOFA's Department of European
Affairs, said that he was not surprised by the news that the Vatican
hopes to establish ties with mainland China, pointing out that the
Vatican has always wanted to set up such ties to protect the
religious freedom of the mainland's Catholic population.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks after an AFP report quoted Cardinal Angelo
Sodano, the secretary of state of the Holy See, as saying that "the
Taipei nunciature is the nunciature in China," at a reception at the
Italian embassy to the Vatican to mark the 70th anniversary of the
Latteran accord between Italy and the Catholic city state.</P>
      <P>"The Church would move it back to Beijing this evening if the
(mainland) Chinese authorities permitted," Sodano was also quoted as
saying.</P>
      <P>But he also said that the move would not entail breaking off
relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang stressed that the ROC's ties with the Vatican have always
been close, and that exchange visits from both sides have been
extensive.</P>
      <P>The Vatican was the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe prior to
Jan. 27 this year, when ties were established with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Beijing does not recognize the authority of the Vatican over
Catholics in the mainland, and appoints its own bishops of its
"patriotic" church. This has been the main hurdle preventing the
establishment of relations between the two.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the mainland would require the Vatican to
sever ties with the ROC before it would consider entering talks about
establishing ties.</P>

      <P>Although the Vatican maintains cordial

contact with Beijing in the hope of protecting the rights and
interests of the Catholic community in mainland China, ROC Ambassador
to the Holy See Raymond Tai said on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with the CNA, Tai said that both Beijing
and the Vatican have always wanted to improve their bilateral ties,
and have constantly exchanged views on the issue through private
channels.</P>
      <P>Secretary of State of the Holy See Cardinal Angelo Sodano said on
Thursday that the Vatican would switch its embassy from Taipei to
Beijing if the Chinese communist authorities would allow it.</P>
      <P>Sodano made the remarks during a cocktail party held at the
Italian embassy in Vatican City on Thursday. He also noted that the
move would not mean breaking off formal relations with Taiwan, but
would entail returning the nunciature to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tai said that there are still a number of stumbling blocks
preventing ties between Beijing and the Vatican, including Beijing's
demands that the Vatican sever diplomatic ties with the ROC and not
interfere with mainland China's internal affairs.</P>
      <P>The Vatican, meanwhile, maintains close and cordial ties with
Taipei, and insists that all bishops around the world should be named
only by the Pope. In defiance of that rule, Beijing names its own
bishops to its rival "Patriotic" church.</P>
      <P>Some 4 million mainland Chinese belong to the "Patriotic" church,
while an estimated 10 million maintain their allegiance to the
Vatican despite harassment and persecution by the Beijing

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's sluggish economy has been mainly
caused by bad management in the country's enterprise sector,
according to Chairman Kao Chin-yen of the Chinese National Federation
of Industries (CNFI).</P>
      <P>At an Executive Yuan conference on the island's economic straits
and strategies on Friday, Kao rebutted reports blaming Taiwan's
declining economic development on the Asian financial meltdown, and
urged the government to help promote domestic business operations.</P>
      <P>The business tycoon stated that further opening of the labor
market to imported foreign workers and incentive measures to
encourage private investment and domestic demand are the only sure
ways to pump up the island's economic energy.</P>
      <P>Asked whether or not he supports a call from the business sector
demanding that the government lower the stock trading tax, Kao said
he thinks the authorities should assess the feasibility of such a
move before making any decision.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that a NT$50 billion (US$1.55 billion) reduction
could be expected in the government's tax revenue each year if the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on
Friday contacted its Beijing counterpart to offer Chinese New Year
greetings and to urge it to speed up the visit of mainland China's
top envoy.</P>
      <P>The faxed message to the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) called on authorities to send ARATS officials
to Taipei soon to discuss ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan's Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>A meeting between SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and Wang last October
laid a solid foundation for increased bilateral exchanges, SEF
Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow said. He added that efforts from both
sides, rather than prerequisites set by just one side, are needed to
implement the four points of consensus reached during the last
Koo-Wang summit.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan and mainland China should further
strengthen their dialogue, Shi said the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should first resolve pressing issues of major concern -- such
as the repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal mainland
immigrants as well as cross-strait fishing disputes -- instead of
wasting time on lofty political matters.</P>
      <P>Shi said the SEF and ARATS have already worked on these issues
during their previous talks and the two sides should continue efforts
to wrap up talks on these matters.</P>
      <P>Regarding Wang's planned visit to Taiwan, the SEF has already
sent a letter to ARATS on Jan. 22, asking it to dispatch officials of
vice secretary-general rank to Taipei by February for talks to pave
the way for the ARATS chairman's Taiwan trip.</P>
      <P>In a response dated Feb. 1, ARATS said it will send a vice
secretary-general to Taipei and will notify the SEF at a proper time.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to deal with bilateral exchanges in
the absence of official contact between the two sides.</P>

      <P>-- The government should actively crack down on people who spread

      <P>-- The Central Bank of China (CBC) should raise interest rates

      <P>-- The government should issue government bonds and treasury
bills to purchase blue chip stocks when their market prices fall
to less than their net values;</P>
      <P>-- A sound bond market should be established and the 0.1 percent

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR SEEKS TOUGHER ACTION ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Between 11.7 percent and 35 percent of
Taiwan's women are living under the threat of domestic violence,
making it an issue to which the government should pay close
attention, Legislator Pan Wei-kang said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Pan made the remarks in a press conference at the Legislative
Yuan shortly after her return from a domestic violence prevention
fact-finding mission to the United States.</P>
      <P>According to US statistics provided by Pan, one woman every 15
seconds is a victim of domestic violence, and four women die every
day as a result of this form of abuse.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's situation is not as serious as that of the United
States, several recently reported local domestic violence cases show
that deep economic problems are involved, making the issue more
complex than a simple social problem. Pan therefore urged the
responsible government agencies to give the matter the attention it
deserves.</P>
      <P>With the approach of Feb. 14 -- Valentine's Day -- Pan said the
best Valentine gift she can present to the island's families is a
pledge to cooperate with the legislature, the judiciary, the police,
and medical and social work organizations to form an alliance to
battle domestic violence, and to go even further by forging a
relationship with the US-based anti-domestic violence union.</P>
      <P>Another member of Pan's mission, who is also a high court judge,
suggested empowering the police with more authority when they are
summoned to incidents of domestic violence, to encourage them to get
more actively involved in such cases.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Sexual Abuse Prevention Committee under the
Ministry of the Interior, which was also present at the press
conference, said that new laws on domestic violence will be
implemented in June.</P>

(By Bear Lee &amp; Chung Hai-tai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Vatican's secretary for relations with
states, Jean Louis Tauran, reiterated on Friday that the Holy See's
position on the Republic of China will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Tauran made the assurance in a meeting with Raymond Tai, the ROC
ambassador to the Vatican.</P>
      <P>Tai called on the ranking Vatican official, asking him to clarify
foreign wire reports that the Vatican would move its embassy from
Taipei to Beijing if Beijing would allow it.</P>
      <P>According to an AFP report, the Catholic Church's secretary of
states, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, said at a reception at the Italian
embassy in the Vatican on Thursday "the Taipei nunciature is the
nunciature of China," and the church will move it back to Beijing
"not tomorrow but this evening if the Chinese authorities permitted."</P>
      <P>The Vatican was the only European state to maintain diplomatic
relations with Taiwan before Jan. 27 when Taiwan and Macedonian
established official ties.</P>
      <P>Taipei was concerned about Sodano's statement and asked its envoy
in the Vatican to look into issue.</P>
      <P>Tai told Tauran that the cardinal's remarks represent an ignorance
of the reality that China is divided and is ruled by two equal
political entities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Besides, Tai added, it would be inappropriate for the Vatican to
move its embassy from Taipei to Beijing as the Vatican's envoys have
presented their credentials to the ROC government in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tauran in reply said despite the statement by Cardinal Sodano,
the Vatican's stance with regard to Taipei will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>He said the Vatican would not develop relations with Beijing at
the expense of its ties with Taipei, and it will take care of the
interests of the three parties involved in the process of
establishing ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>There are over 10 million Catholic people on the mainland. It is
believed that Beijing's refusal to accept the Catholic church and the
naming of bishops for its patriotic churches is one of the major
hurdles to bilateral relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, Cardinal Paul Shan said
he believes the Vatican would not switch its embassy to Beijing
before Beijing shows respect for human rights and allows religious
freedom.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said
in an article for a Japanese magazine that Asian leaders should
cooperate to speed up the integration of an Asian economy and to
promote the "Asian dollar" concept.</P>
      <P>Siew's article, titled "Asian Financial Crisis and ROC
Countermeasures," was carried in the Feb. 16 issue of the biweekly
economic magazine "Zaikai," which has a circulation of 120,000.</P>
      <P>The premier described the Asian financial turmoil as the hardest
test for Taiwan since the energy crisis.</P>
      <P>To reduce the impact of the financial storm, he said, the ROC
government has adopted several counter measures including loosening
its monetary policy, expanding domestic demand, increasing public
investment, and enforcing supervision of financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that Taiwan fared well compared to other Asian
nations. The island registered 5 percent real economic growth last
year and its foreign exchange reserves soared to US$90.3 billion.</P>
      <P>He said the major reasons for Taiwan's performance were sound
economic fundamentals, the gradual opening of Taiwan's financial
market, and improvement of its industrial structure.</P>
      <P>For instance, the premier said, products from the heavy chemistry
and technology-intensive sectors already accounted for 76 percent of
the output by Taiwan's manufacturing industry last year, up from
1982's 56 percent and 1991's 66 percent.</P>
      <P>After the Asian financial crisis hit, Taiwan's central bank
lowered its rediscount rates while the government has devised a plan
to expand exports and will pour some US$5 billion into public
investment projects in the next two years.</P>
      <P>The premier said President Lee Teng-hui has urged Asian leaders
to be aware of the international economic situation and to promote
the "Asian dollar" concept to recreate a new economic miracle for

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>Today is Sunday, Feb. 14, or the 29th day
of the 12th month of the Year of the Tiger according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An
Assay on the Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues
that populations tend to increase faster than food supplies unless
the increase is checked by moral restraints or by war, famine, or
disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who
commanded three major voyages of discovery, charting and naming many
islands in the Pacific Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in
Hawaii.

1893: Hawaii is annexed to the United States by treaty.

1924: Thomas John Watson, the American industrialist who worked
for the National Cash Register Company (now NCR Corporation) for 15
years, is made president of a company that became International
Business Machines Corporation (IBM).

1929: Seven Chicago gangsters, rivals of Al Capone's gang, are
killed in what became known as the "Valentine's Day Massacre."

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese
puppet regime known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of
their hegemony, the Japanese invaders of northern China installed the
Manchukuo regime in 1932. This "land of the Manchu" proved to be no
more than another stepping stone for the extension of Japanese
aggression.

1943: Soviet troops recapture Rostov from German invaders.

1944: Carl Bernstein, the American journalist who along with Bob
Woodward exposed the Watergate scandal which brought down President
Richard Nixon, is born.

1950: The Chinese communist regime and the Soviet Union sign the
"Sino-Soviet Friendly Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty" in
Moscow.

1962: General Hu Chung-nan, strategic advisor to President Chiang
Kai-shek, dies in Taipei at the age of 68.

1972: Mexico establishes diplomatic relations with mainland
China.

1972: Washington relaxes trade restrictions against Beijing,
putting it on same basis as Moscow.

1975: The Marinas Islands in the Pacific become territory of the
United States.

1977: Shih Wei-liang, a noted ROC musician, dies in Taipei at the
age of 54.

1989: Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious leader, issues a
"fatwa" or death sentence against British writer Salman Rushdie for
blasphemy in his book, "The Satanic Verses," sending him into years
of hiding.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Earnestness without judgment
becomes pedantry; caution without judgment becomes timidity; courage
without judgment leads to crime; uprightness without judgment makes
men tyrannical."</TEXT>

      <P>In addition, other factors such as Taiwan's establishment of
diplomatic ties with Macedonia, the possibility of its joining the
United States-initiated Theater Missile Defense system, and a new
round of constitutional reforms slated for April which may allow the
holding a referendum to decide the fate of Taiwan, have all escalated
the tension between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Feng claimed.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Feng predicted that Wang will not visit
Taiwan by May, or even within this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MARINE CORPS OFFICER TO VISIT BUNUN HOMETOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Puli, central Taiwan, Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US marine corps officer who
belongs to Taiwan's Bunun aboriginal tribe is expected to arrive in
Taiwan on Sunday to seek her roots and thank the Norwegian missionary
couple who saved her life more than 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>Sarah Elizabeth Mangels, who served in the Persian Gulf War and
has been stationed in US bases in Japan, will visit Bjarne and
Alfhild Jensen Gislefoss, two Norwegian doctors who have devoted some
four decades of their lives to providing medical care to Taiwan's
aboriginal people in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The couple have both served as presidents of the Puli Christian
Hospital over a period spanning more than 30 years, and have taken
care of numerous sick aborigines, including the young Mangels and her
Bunun mother.</P>
      <P>Mangels, whose Bunun name was Langs, was first brought to the
hospital when she was less than five years old. A skinny child
practically dying of pneumonia, Langs was taken to the hospital
together with her mother, the 21-year-old wife of a 90-year-old Bunun
tribesman, who had also contracted the then-deadly disease.</P>
      <P>With an aged father and a sick mother, the young Langs was kept
in the hospital for a couple of years under the special care of Mrs.
Gislefoss, who in later years has been called A-Mah (grandmother) by
hospital staff and patients.</P>
      <P>Langs' father died during this two-year period, and her mother
also passed away a few years later.</P>
      <P>Contacting the Puli Christian Hospital, Mangels, who has recently
been promoted to the rank of first lieutenant, said the top priority
of her first visit to Taiwan is to pay tribute to A-Mah for her
unselfish care of the child whose life she saved from pneumonia and
who she raised until the age of seven.</P>
      <P>By the time she was seven, the young Langs was not only healthy
but as beautiful as a little doll. Mrs. Gislefoss then decided to
have the child adopted by an American GI couple, believing that if
she was taken to the United States, the child would have a better
chance at life.</P>
      <P>Soon afterward, Langs left Puli for California with her adoptive
parents, who also adopted another Taiwanese girl, and in later years,
had three children of their own.</P>
      <P>Langs became Sarah Elizabeth Mangels, and never returned to
Taiwan. Described as being as happy as a lark and an outgoing girl,
Mangels joined the US military some 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>She is expected to be met at the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport on Sunday by her older brother, who she has never met, and
staff members of the hospital.</P>
      <P>The Puli Christian Hospital, a general hospital famed for its
care of aboriginal people in central Taiwan, was established in
January 1956 by Lilian Ruth Dickson, an American missionary working
with limited church donations.</P>
      <P>In 1960, Dr. Bjarne Gislefoss, who helped train 150 local nurses
for the hospital, became the second president of the institution. In
1963, Gislefoss married Alfhild Jensen, a graduate of Oslo Medical
School who had worked as an anesthetist in the United States and was
dispatched to Taiwan on a missionary and medical mission.</P>
      <P>Mr. and Mrs. Gislefoss, who have received numerous citations from
the government and from private groups in Taiwan over the past
several decades, have always said that "Norway is our mother country,
but Taiwan is our home."</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian newspaper said on Friday that
mainland China is jumpy at the thought of a ballistic missile defense
system because its umbrella might be extended to cover Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The National Post claimed that at the moment, there are "more
than 100 Chinese ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan," which the
Beijing regime wishes to reunite with the mainland -- forcibly, if
need be.</P>
      <P>In an editorial, the daily called mainland China's criticism of
US plans to circumvent the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty a
"double standard." The treaty prohibited the Soviet Union and the
United States from building an anti-missile defense system which
would fend off chemical, biological or nuclear missile attacks by
rogue states such as North Korea and Iran.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is not party to the ABM, the daily pointed out.
However, it is mainland China that is "the world's foremost
proliferator of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology"
according to a US Senate committee report.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has pledged adherence to the Missile Technology
Control Regime, acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and
signed the Chemical Weapons Convention as well as the Comprehensive
Test-ban Treaty. Nevertheless, it has "either broken, or helped
others to break, every one of these solemn undertakings," according
to the newspaper.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
thanked the Macedonian parliament on Saturday for passing a bill
approving the decision to set up diplomatic ties with Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Macedonian parliament passed the bill on Friday by a vote
65-7, with two abstentions. It also added its seal to a joint
communique signed by ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu and his Macedonian
counterpart, Aleksandar Dimitrov.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-cheng, deputy director of the MOFA's Information and
Cultural Affairs Department, told CNA that the ROC government is very
grateful for the Macedonian parliament's backing. He voiced the hope
that the move will open the way for a bright future of bilateral ties
between Taiwan and the southeast European nation.</P>
      <P>Echoing Macedonian Information Minister Rezxep Zllatku's view,
Chen said the ROC government expects that its dealings with Macedonia
will set a good example for other European countries in the region.</P>
      <P>If the ROC government can promote its "Taiwan experience" to the
other nations of southeast Europe through Macedonia, it will benefit
both Taipei and Skopje, he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking prior to his departure following a six-day visit to
Taipei, Zllatku said that the establishment of diplomatic relations
between Taipei and Skopje will have a positive impact on Macedonia's
neighbors.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Skopje announced on Jan. 27 that they would forge
official diplomatic ties, provoking a strong protest from Beijing,
which on Feb. 9 announced the suspension of its own diplomatic ties
with the Balkan state.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>United States Representative Robert E.
Andrews (D-NJ) called attention on Friday to an article in The
Washington Post on Thursday entitled "Chinese Missiles Menace
Taiwan," and urged support for a House resolution to help Taiwan in
case of a military attack by mainland China.</P>
      <P>"The United States has a strong interest in helping to preserve
the safety and security of the people of Taiwan," wrote Andrews in a
letter, adding: "Accordingly, I have introduced House Concurrent
Resolution 22, a resolution calling on the president to seek a public
renunciation by the People's Republic of China of any use of force
against Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The congressman noted that the resolution also "acknowledges that
the United States should help Taiwan defend itself in case of threats
or a military attack by mainland China.</P>
      <P>The House passed a resolution by a vote of 411-0 last June urging
President Bill Clinton to seek a public renunciation by the PRC of
any use of force, or threat of use of force, against Taiwan. But
Beijing has refused to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Andrew's resolution reminds the Clinton administration that the
mainland Chinese military threat against Taiwan is still in existence
and, therefore, the United States should continue protecting the
security of Taiwan and maintaining peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region in accordance with the terms of the Taiwan

(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The belief by the US military that North
Korea would flatten Montreal with a nuclear missile was dismissed as
laughable on Friday by Canadians.</P>
      <P>"Based on my 17 years in the foreign service, including four in
the intelligence community, I don't think I'd be in a big rush to
sell my house in Montreal," said Daryl Copeland of the Canadian
Institute of International Affairs.</P>
      <P>The reports originated from a war game scenario cooked up by the
US Army's War College. Three Canadian members of parliament were
briefed on the scenario by US army officials during a NATO meeting,
and two of them told the media what they heard.</P>
      <P>America believes North Korea dare not attack the United States
directly, but would hit a close ally that does not have nuclear
weapons, Conservative Party MP David Price said. They consider this
"a very serious scenario," Art Hanger of the Reform Party noted.</P>
      <P>The US military wants Canada to contribute US$600 million toward
the US$10 billion it is about to spend on a North American ballistic
missile defense shield, and raising the specter of a missile strike
on Montreal would not hurt the US lobbying efforts, the Canadian
press said.</P>

      <P>The government has started arranging for
medical personnel from its African allies to come to Taiwan to
receive medical training, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Timothy Yang, director-general of MOFA's Department of African
Affairs, said that Taiwan used to send medical missions to its
African allies, but due to difficulty it has experienced in
recruiting enough people to join these missions, MOFA came up with
the idea of asking the allies to send their own teams to receive
training here.</P>
      <P>Yang said that a four-member medical team from Swaziland is
currently taking a three-month training course in an intensive care
unit at National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>A team spokesman described medical standards in Taiwan as high,
and said that this kind of training sets a fine example for bilateral
medical exchanges.</P>
      <P>Starting this year, Chad, another African ally of the ROC, will
also send a five-member medical team to the Tri-Service General
Hospital to take three- or six-month training programs. The first
such group, which is expected in early March, will include an
obstetrician, emergency unit nurses, a midwife, and an optical
technician.</P>
      <P>Yang noted that Taiwan has in the past helped improve the medical
capabilities of its African allies through sending medical missions,
providing pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and basic medical
facilities.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has also set up scholarships to help medical
staff of these allies to visit neighboring countries to study and
attend short-term camps.</P>
      <P>Eight of 29 allies that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan

there are about 200 people in Taiwan who are waiting for the surgery

      <P>The Republic and China and the United

might across the Taiwan Strait, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official made the remarks after the New York Times
reported on Friday that the number of missiles Beijing has deployed
against Taiwan will increase.</P>
      <P>The report said a study by the Pentagon on Taiwan, which is about
to be presented to the Congress, showed that Beijing began to deploy
60 missiles against Taiwan in the 1990s, and that number will
increase to 600 in the next three years.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official, who requested anonymity, said MOFA will not

chairman of the Chinese National Association of Industry and

      <P>Forum participants unanimously urged the government to thoroughly

potential damage. A DPP legislator even suggested that hasher
punishment be imposed against financial crimes such as embezzlement.</P>
      <P>As for the treasury records of listed and over-the-counter
companies, they suggested that companies allow the government access
to company records to allow for more efficient surveillance.</P>
      <P>They also recommended that investors in the stock market stick to

      <P>Taiwan furniture making businesses in
Malaysia on Saturday called on Kuala Lumpur authorities to impose a
limit on the export of rubber-tree logs as they are facing a timber
shortage.</P>
      <P>An eight-member delegation from the Taiwan businesses association
in Malaysia made the call during a meeting with Primary Industries
Minister Lim Keng Yaik.</P>
      <P>Ting Chung-cheng, at the head of the petition delegation, told
Lim that Malaysia's unlimited timber exports led most Taiwan
furniture makers in the Southeast Asian country to fall victim to a
lack of wood supply.</P>
      <P>Ting gave Lim a petition stating that costs for rubber-tree
timber material are skyrocketing due to a shortage. The fact has
considerately harmed the interests of furniture manufacturers from
Taiwan, who relocated their factories to Malaysia because of
low-overhead costs and sufficient raw material.</P>
      <P>The memorandum pointed out that decreased profits would force
Taiwan companies to shrink their operations or "again" relocate their
factories to another country. As a consequence, there would be many
lay-offs in those companies, causing the country's unemployment to
grow.</P>
      <P>In effort to lure foreign investments, Kuala Lumpur has promised
to provide an abundant workforce and raw material to Taiwan furniture
businesses. Ting said the government's promised was initially
realized, noting that was the reason why they put their interests in
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Because of these initial expectations, they are now all trapped,
the business delegates from Taiwan complained.</P>

entry to the World Health Organization (WHO), giving a boost to the
island's bid to joint international organizations.</P>
      <P>The resolutions called on US President Bill Clinton to support

Taiwan's participation in the United Nations affiliated organization
will benefit the entire region and the whole world.</P>

      <P>Tseng Ching-yuan, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office

      <P>A Taiwan fugitive who fled to mainland
China to evade swindling charges was repatriated to Taiwan under an
agreement signed between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said Liu Chiu-hwai, 60, borrowed NT$4.12 million
(US$12,716) from his victim surnamed Mao in 1994, claiming that he
needed the money to buy a tour coach.</P>
      <P>But Liu, who was previously convicted on weapons possession
charges, then defaulted on the payment and fled to the mainland in
1996.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said the repatriation was conducted under Kinmen
agreement signed between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1990.
The agreement governs the repatriation of hijackers and criminals and
their pickup locations to facilitate a cooperative effort in cracking
down on cross-border crime.</P>

      <P>Watching her husband, who has headed the Executive Yuan since

      <P>Chu said although her husband has spent all his energy on
administrative affairs in the hope of maintaining and enhancing the

calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An
Assay on the Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues
that populations tend to increase faster than food supplies unless

disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who

killed in what became known as the "Saint Valentine's Day Massacre."

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese
puppet regime known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of
their hegemony, the Japanese invaders of northern China installed the
Manchukuo regime in 1932. This "land of the Manchu" proved to be no
more than another stepping stone for the extension of Japanese
aggression.

1943: Soviet troops recapture Rostov from German invaders.

1944: Carl Bernstein, the American journalist who along with Bob
Woodward exposed the Watergate scandal which brought down President
Richard Nixon, is born.

    <TEXT>
      <P>An agreement between Taiwan and the United
States to ship Taiwan's spent nuclear fuel back to the United States
has been reached, and the agreement will go into effect after it is
approved by the Executive Yuan after the Chinese Lunar New Year
holiday.</P>
      <P>The first batch of spent fuel could be dispatched from Taiwan to
the United States as early as June. It will be carried on a ship
built exclusively for transporting nuclear fuel, said officials from
the Atomic Energy Council.</P>
      <P>The pact caps three years of strenuous negotiations between the
council and the US Energy Department.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now has about a hundred spent nuclear assemblies stored
separately at National Tsinghua University and at the Institute of
Nuclear Energy Research under the Atomic Energy Council, the two
institutes engaged in nuclear research in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The material will be ferried to the United States, along with
nuclear waste from South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines.
Neither South Korea nor Indonesia will pay to have the waste shipped
to the United States, although Taiwan has been asked to pay NT$140
million (US$4.34 million).</P>
      <P>It was the United States that originally supplied Taiwan with the
nuclear fuel, and it has been a long-standing US policy to have spent
nuclear fuel returned to its country of origin for fear that it will
be used for military purposes.</P>
      <P>The practice was interrupted because of strong opposition from US
anti-nuclear power groups. It was resumed, however, after 1997 when
the US government won a lawsuit brought by environmentalists.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was said to have kept a low profile during the
negotiations so as not to attract attention.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan's domestic economy is in
the doldrums, 42 percent of private businesses said they would raise
employees' wages this year, a survey conducted by the Council for
Labor Affairs (CLA) showed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the average monthly wage for employees
of companies in Taiwan's service and manufacturing sectors between
January and November of last year was NT$39,843, a 3.12 percent
increase over the same year-earlier period. The 1997 figure, however,
was 5.01 percent higher than during the 1996 period, indicating that
the rate of growth has slowed as a result of the region's financial
turmoil.</P>
      <P>Wages are expected to rise an average of 2.33 percent over the
coming year. Manufacturing sector wages will rise by an estimated
2.46 percent, while wages in the construction industry will rise by 2
percent; in the utilities sector, 1.58 percent; and in the mining and
gravel industry, 0.75 percent.</P>
      <P>Service sector wages are expected to rise 2.43 percent, according
to the same survey. The biggest gains will likely be seen in the
industrial and commercial services industry, where wages are expected
to rise 3.26 percent during this year. Meanwhile, transportation,
commodity warehousing and communications industry wages are expected
to rise 2.45 percent; retail industry wages, 2.42 percent; social
service industry wages, 2.16 percent; and finance, insurance and real

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE: GOVERNMENT TO FOCUS ON ECONOMIC ISSUES THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said on Monday that the government will focus on economic and
financial issues this year to boost investor confidence.</P>
      <P>The president made the statement in his message to the people on
the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, which starts Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said economic and financial issues have become the central
concern of the public in the past year, as several enterprises and
individuals have gone bankrupt one after another. Government
measures have failed to strengthen investor confidence, he noted.</P>
      <P>He urged domestic investors not to lose confidence, as many
foreign institutions still regard the Republic of China as having a
sound economy.</P>
      <P>For instance, the president said, a recent report by the US
Department of Commerce on 20 major export destinations for US goods
ranked Taiwan third in terms of its overall economic prospects.</P>
      <P>Despite the emergence of some financial problems in Taiwan, Lee
pointed out that the nation's economic performance and financial
fundamentals are better than those of most other newly developed
countries.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the government will concentrate its attention to
economic and financial issues this year, and engage in the
reorganization and reform necessary to improve Taiwan's economic and
financial fundamentals.</P>
      <P>The president noted that various changes in Taiwan and in the
international community over the past year have brought about many
new challenges to the country.</P>
      <P>He said that among the major changes were last December's
elections for legislators and Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors, the impact
of Asia's financial turmoil, US President Bill Clinton's trip to
mainland China, mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to
Japan and the resumption of talks between Strait Exchange Foundation
Chairman Koo Chen-fu and Chairman Wang Daohan of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The president said that all emerging difficulties will be
conquered eventually and that the country will march toward a bright
future through the joint efforts of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee's message was to be broadcast Monday night in Mandarin,
Taiwanese and Hakka on local and satellite television stations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S TRADE DEFICIT WITH JAPAN CLIMBS TO RECORD HIGH IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan continued
to widen in 1998 as it reached a record high of US$17.6 billion, the
Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials noted that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan has
grown over the past three years. The deficit totaled US$13.8 billion
in 1996, US$17.3 billion in 1997 and US$17.6 billion in 1998.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials attributed the increasing trade deficit mainly to
a decline in Taiwan's exports to Japan. Exports amounted to only
US$9.3 billion in 1998, down from US$11.7 billion in 1997 and US$13.6
billion in 1996.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the United States was the largest exporter of goods to
Japan, follwed in order by mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia and
Taiwan. Since then, however, Taiwan has fallen to seventh place among
exporters to Japan, while Australia and Germany have risen to third
and fourth place, according to the semi-official China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA).</P>
      <P>BOFT, in analyzing the decline in exports to Japan, said that the
top 10 Taiwan exports to Japan all suffered double-digit declines
last year. Exports of machine equipment and electrical appliances,
which together accounted for 46.5 percent of Taiwan's exports to
Japan in 1998, fell by 11.1 percent and 15.3 percent, respectively,
last year.</P>
      <P>CETRA is now formulating plans to address the ballooning trade
deficit. It is expected that there will be 70 promotional activities
this year aimed at bolstering Taiwan exports to Japan, and from these
activities as much as US$850 million is expected to be generated for
Taiwan manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Japan's slumping economy will bottom out this year and begin to
pick up next year, CETRA officials said. The organization's
promotional efforts will focus on the electronics, information
technology and communications industries, and it will work to help
domestic manufacturers to set up marketing footholds in Japan.</P>
      <P>CETRA will also encourage Japanese businesses to purchase more
Taiwan-made products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECOND TERMINAL AT CKS AIRPORT TO HELP DOUBLE ACCOMMODATION CAPACITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The construction of a second terminal at
CKS International Airport is now in its final stage, and it is
expected that after its completion the accommodation capacity of CKS
International Airport will be doubled.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said that currently
around 12 million passengers pass through the airport each year,
about double the number expected when the airport was originally
designed.</P>
      <P>To upgrade the quality of the airport, the CAA began to plan a
second terminal in 1989 and started construction in 1994. The second
terminal is expected to be completed by June this year.</P>
      <P>To avoid the chaos that surrounded the opening of a new airport
in Hong Kong, the second terminal will undergo a six-month test
period before it is officially inaugurated in January 2000.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the new terminal is carefully designed to
handle the transfers of both domestic and international passengers
and cargo. It will also help boost Taiwan's emerging service and
production industries.</P>
      <P>The second terminal, with a size of 208,000 square meters, will
cost NT$22.16 billion (US$683.95 million), and is designed to
accommodate 14 million passengers a year.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said that they are now planning to construct a
third terminal to meet the anticipated needs of the airport in the
year 2010.</P>
      <P>To fully develop Taiwan into an aviation transportation hub in
the Asia-Pacific region, the CAA will also develop the land
surrounding the airport into a commercial area that will include posh
hotels, convention centers and shopping malls to attract more
visitors from the Asia-Pacific region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER VISITS THE VATICAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu arrived in
the Vatican on Thursday at the start of a three-day visit, according
to diplomatic sources.</P>
      <P>Hu's Holy See visit has captured attention, as foreign wire
service reports quoted Vatican Secretary of State Angelo Sodano as
saying last week that if mainland China can reach consensus with the
Vatican on certain issues, the Vatican is willing to move its embassy
from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, Foreign Ministry sources said Hu's visit has nothing to
do with Sodano's remarks, but was arranged long ago and is mainly
aimed at strengthening bilateral diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Hu will meet with Sodano and Jean Louis Tauran,
the Vatican's secretary for foreign relations. Hu is not expected to
have an audience with Pope John Paul II.</P>
      <P>As Hu had to make transit stops in several countries with which
the Republic of China does not maintain formal diplomatic ties, he
had kept his travel plans secret to avoid possible sabotage by
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Vatican is one of the ROC's two diplomatic allies in Europe.
Local observers said Hu's visit is part of the government's efforts
to shore up ties with the Holy See ahead of a visit to Europe by
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in March.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu is tentatively scheduled to head a delegation of
business executives and journalists to visit the ROC's other European
ally -- Macedonia -- from March 3 through March 5. The ROC forged
full diplomatic ties with Macedonia on Jan. 27.</P>

      <P>Beijing should renounce the use of force to
solve cross-Taiwan Strait problems, said Government Information
Office Deputy Director-General Frederic Chang in an interview carried
by the Japan Times on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for a six-day visit.</P>
      <P>He said in the interview with the English-language newspaper that
mainland China should respect that Taiwan is ruled separately, and
should employ only peaceful means to solve the reunfication issue.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Taipei expects Chairman Wang Daohan of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to visit
Taipei soon to strengthen cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that Taiwan's ARATS counterpart -- the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) -- will resume consultations on
practical non-political issues such as illegal immigrants, hijacking,

      <P>The Republic of China is ready to discuss
agricultural cooperation with mainland China, said Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Su Chi on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Agricultural cooperation between Taiwan and the mainland was
among the topics raised by Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman

Zemin in Beijing last fall.</P>
      <P>Jiang indicated at the time that he had "interest" in Koo's

      <P>Su said that ROC President Lee Teng-hui first took up the issue
of cross-Taiwan strait agricultural cooperation in April 1995.</P>
      <P>Now that Beijing appears to have the intention of considering
such a proposal, he said, Taipei is ready to discuss this issue with
Beijing when the opportunity emerges.</P>
      <P>Lee's concept is that "Chinese must help Chinese," and the MAC
chairman said that Taiwan will promote agricultural cooperation with
the mainland on a "mutually beneficial, complementary, and
reciprocal" basis.</P>
      <P>Su said that Taiwan has wide experience in agricultural

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many major international financial
organizations have come to Taiwan over the past year to issue New
Taiwan dollar-denominated bonds in order to raise funds for various
development projects in emerging markets.</P>
      <P>Financial observers say such moves not only signify the Republic
of China's sound economic fundamentals and strength but also
strengthen Taiwan's status as a regional funding center and a capital
supplier in the international community.</P>
      <P>Among others, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is scheduled to
issue NT$10 billion-worth of NT$-denominated "Dragon Bonds" after the
Chinese New Year holiday to help its Asian member states revamp their
economies after the 1997-1998 financial turmoil. The ADB has issued
several batches of NT$-denominated bonds over the past few years.</P>
      <P>The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued NT$6 billion-worth of
NT$-denominated five-year bonds for the first time in April 1998. Of
the amount, NT$4.5 billion-worth of the bonds offer a fixed interest
rate, while the remaining NT$1.5 billion-worth offer floating
interest rates. The EIB was the first international financial
organization to issue NT$-denominated bonds with floating interest
rates.</P>
      <P>On April 17, 1998, the European Bank of Reconstruction
Development (EBRD) floated NT$6.6 billion-worth of NT$-denominated
three-year bonds, with a fixed annual interest rate of 6.75 percent.
It was the third time that the EBRD had issued bonds in Taiwan. The
bank has so far floated a total of NT$15.6 billion-worth of
NT$-denominated bonds.</P>
      <P>The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) issued NT$7.6
billion-worth of NT$-denominated, five-year bonds for the first time
on May 21, 1998 to raise funds for several economic stimulus plans in
Latin America.</P>
      <P>The North European Investment Bank again floated NT$6
billion-worth of NT$-denominated bonds in Taiwan on June 29, 1998,
with an interest rate of 6.9 percent per annum. It was the second

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNICATIONS WITH US OVER IPR ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative
office in the United States said on Wednesday that it will strengthen
communications with the US Trade Representative (USTR) office over
intellectual property rights (IPR) issues.</P>
      <P>Teng Chen-chung, economic division chief at the de facto ROC
embassy in Washington, D.C., made the statement after the US-based
International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) requested to the
Clinton administration on Tuesday that Taiwan should be maintained on
the "watch list" of this year's annual special 301 review.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a major US pharmaceutical industry association even
suggested that Taiwan be put on the more threatening "priority watch"
list.</P>
      <P>Teng said some of the commercial piracy allegations made by US
companies or trade associations against Taiwan are unfounded.</P>
      <P>"We have discussed some alleged IPR infringement issues with
senior IIPA executives and have offered them detailed explanations of
their concerns. We'll continue to communicate with them," Teng said.</P>
      <P>More important, Teng said, his division will strengthen
communications with the USTR office because it has the final say on
whether Taiwan should be included on the special 301 list. Individual
American companies and trade associations can only made
recommendations to the USTR and these suggestions may not necessarily
be adopted, he noted.</P>
      <P>Israel is the prime target of the IIPA's anti-commercial piracy
campaign this year. The IIPA report accuses Israel of being a key
production and marketing center for pirated music recordings, and
recommends that Israel be put on the most threatening "priority
foreign country" list.</P>
      <P>The IIPA report also mentions for the first time that
Taiwan-produced pirated music products, particularly compact discs
(CDs), have been exported to the United States via Israel.</P>
      <P>Teng said this is the first time that he has heard of such an
allegation, adding he does not believe Taiwan pirates are as smart as
the IIPA alleges.</P>
      <P>The USTR is scheduled to unveil its annual special 301 review at
the end of April. "We'll do our utmost over the next two months to
help US trade officials understand our determination to protect IPR
and eradicate commercial piracy, as well as pointing out our
achievements in this regard," Teng said.</P>
      <P>Since the United States began issuing an annual special 301
review of IPR violations by its major trade partners more than 10
years ago, Taiwan had consistently been put on various watch lists,
except for November 1996, when the USTR decided to take Taiwan off
the watch list during a special review. However, the island was put
back on the list in August 1998, on the grounds that Taiwan had not
done its best to enforce IPR protection regulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPERTS HELPING PHILIPPINE FARMERS GROW PONGLAI RICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three rice experts from the Republic of
China have successfully helped Philippine farmers grow Ponglai rice,
a special strain of Taiwan rice.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the three agronomists, the Philippine
farmers planted Ponglai rice on a 36-acre plot of farmland in
Northern Samar province and began their first harvest on Feb. 10.</P>
      <P>Reports from the province said local farmers are excited by the
success of the experiment. More importantly, the reports said, the
harvest is even better than they had anticipated.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the Ponglai strain, more commonly
known as Pineapple rice in the Philippines, has a yield three times
higher than the average Philippine rice strain.</P>
      <P>This was the first bilateral privately funded ROC-Philippine
agricultural cooperative program to have been implemented.</P>
      <P>The program was initiated by Taiwan's Hsieh Clan Association,
which donated funds to hire the three agronomists -- Pan Hsing-wang,
Chen Chun-liang and Huang Ching-hai -- to teach Philippine farmers to
grow the Ponglai rice.</P>
      <P>Emil Ong, an adviser to Philippine President Joseph Estrada,
provided the piece of farmland for the experimental crop, and in just
six months, the program has reaped a better-than-expected harvest.</P>
      <P>The Philippine government has now decided to introduce the
cooperative program throughout the country with the aim of realizing
the country's eventual goal of food self-sufficiency.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC and the Philippines is also negotiating an
official-level agricultural cooperative program. This program is
expected to be implemented in the not-too-distant future, sources
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The US-based International Intellectual
Property Alliance (IIPA) requested to the US government on Tuesday
that Taiwan should be maintained on the "watch list" of this year's
annual special 301 review.</P>
      <P>The IIPA submitted its recommendations to US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky in a 1000-plus-page industry report on the annual
special 301 review of copyright piracy and market access problems
around the world.</P>
      <P>It discussed a total of 62 countries or economies and reported
that US copyright industries lost an estimated US$12.4 billion due to
copyright piracy in these countries in 1998.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which was put back on the special 301 watch list last
August by the USTR, caused US$303 million in trade losses in 1998 to
the US copyright industries due to piracy as compared to US$237.2
million in 1997, according the IIPA.</P>
      <P>The report said the increase was attributable mainly to optical
media piracy, namely CD and CD-ROM products; piracy rates increased
for the sound recording and music industries from 10 percent in 1997
to 20 percent in 1998.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan must take further steps to bring the problems of
copyright piracy under control," said Eric H. Smith, president of the
IIPA.</P>
      <P>The report noted that Taiwan "must immediately implement
effective measures against CD and CD-ROM piracy," and the government
must conduct raids on plants producing unauthorized products, seize
infringing copies and machinery, and impose criminal penalties to
deter the organized manufacture and distribution of pirated products.</P>
      <P>The IIPA recommended that the USTR put Taiwan on the watch list
along with 32 other countries or economies. It also recommended
Israel to be on the priority foreign country list, and mainland China
and Paraguay to stay on the Section 306 monitoring to make sure of
their bilateral copyright commitments following past 301 actions
against these countries.</P>
      <P>The IIPA is a Washington-based coalition of associations
representing US copyright-based industries. Its member associations
include: The Association of American Publishers; the Business
Software Alliance; the Interactive Digital Software Association; the
Motion Picture Association of America; the National Music Publishers'
Association; and the Recording Industry Association of America.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TECHNOLOGY `WILL CHANGE LIVES': SINGAPORE SENIOR MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The technological revolution, especially
information technology, biotechnology and genetic engineering, will
radically change people's lives, Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Global Views Monthly, Lee pointed out that
the old constraints that kept people confined to a specific place and
limited them to the resources of that particular location will no
longer hold. Wherever people are, they can, if they have the means,
access information and knowledge, move rapidly from country to
country, or get food, medicines and other things transported to them.</P>
      <P>It will be a revolution in how human societies organize
themselves. And with cloning, we can replace our deceased organs. The
possibilities are as infinite, he said.</P>
      <P>The following are Lee's replies in the interview:</P>
      <P>-- Few at the end of the 19th century could have predicted the
gigantic explosion of population from 1.6 billion to six billion
people. No one foresaw the two great wars that broke up the European
empires. But the greatest changes were brought about by technological
advances. Man has conquered more of nature. He has disproved Malthus'
theory that there would not be enough food for rapidly-growing
populations. At the same time, man's inventiveness has produced
terrifying weapons of war.</P>
      <P>-- It is impossible to predict what will happen by the end of the
21st century because the population explosion will not be a simple
extrapolation at today's rate of growth.</P>
      <P>-- Asia is not at the forefront of this technological revolution.
Only Japan is keeping abreast with certain frontiers of new
technology. Therefore, the space for catch-up is vast. Those
countries that invest in their people and master new technology will
make great advances. Those peoples who quickly learn to adapt and use
new information and knowledge will make more progress.</P>
      <P>Based on past performance, they will be the people from South
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore -- because of their great
emphasis on education that is oriented to science and technology.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is likely to continue to do well because of its many
start-up companies in information technology.</P>
      <P>-- Mainland China will make great strides as its education levels
improve, with a higher percentage of its students acquiring
university and post-graduate qualifications.</P>
      <P>The mainland needs modern infrastructure, efficient
administration without red tape, and the rule of law. If it can put
right its systems, it will pose a sharp competitive challenge to the
economies of Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>-- Association of Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries will recover
from the present setbacks, varying from two to five years depending
on how they clean up their financial systems, recapitalise their
banks and their corporations. They will be able to make 4 percent to
6 percent annual growth. They have not concentrated as much on
education, and will have to do more to catch up. Their abundance of
natural resources will help them.</P>
      <P>-- It will be presumptuous for anyone in Asia to give a message
to the people of the 21st century. I can only express my hope that
nations will avoid disastrous wars that destroy and set their peoples
back.</P>
      <P>I hope that they will keep population growth under control so
that the environment will not be much further degraded. And that they
will increase trade with and investments in each other, and have free
movement of goods, capital, people and technology so that all
countries can provide better living standards and environment for
their people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Of the four so-called "Asian Tigers,"
only Taiwan is expected to grow this year, with Japan expected to
grow a mere 0.2 percent, according to an Australia-based forecasting
firm, BIS Shrapnel.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to grow 5.6 percent, and 6 percent in 2000
while mainland China might grow 7 percent this year and next year.</P>
      <P>Singapore is one of six Asian economies expected to shrink this
year -- by 1.8 percent. The others are Indonesia (-6.7 percent), Hong
Kong (-2.9 percent), South Korea (-2.8 percent), Thailand (-1.1
percent), and Malaysia (-0.3 percent).</P>
      <P>The firm's Nigel Hatcher expressed grave doubt about the
economies of Hong Kong and Singapore. In a press statement released
on Monday, the firm said Singapore's construction sector is on the
brink of a major downturn. It expects a further 25 percent decline in
construction activity this year. Private consumption spending will
likely continue to shrink, and investment in equipment will decline.</P>
      <P>"But this year will represent the bottom of the trough and more
solid signs of recovery will emerge in 2000," Hatcher said. "More
economies will reduce their financial constraints and restart
production. Exports will increase significantly, foreign investment
inflows will return and exchange rates will strengthen. Governments
will be freer to increase their own spending and reduce interest
rates, as some of the pressure comes off exchange rates."</P>
      <P>The firm expects all countries in the region to grow in 2000.
Even Indonesia is forecast to expand 2.3 percent, Thailand 3.6
percent, and Japan 2.3 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>No serious talks between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait seem possible while mainland China is stirring
fresh doubts about its appetite for negotiations, heating up the
regional arms race and alarming the people of Taiwan, according to
The Washington Post.</P>
      <P>The influential American newspaper on Sunday published an
editorial titled "Still Rattling Missiles," which said that mainland
China is back with another show of force to Taiwan. Three years ago
it fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait. Now, it is systematically
moving missiles -- reportedly by the hundreds -- into the part of
mainland China closest to the territory it regards as a breakaway
province.</P>
      <P>This development seems to have no specific trigger beyond an
evidently continuing desire to intimidate Taiwan and keep it from
eventually creeping under an American anti-missile umbrella and thus
be even less likely to reunify with the mainland, said the editorial.</P>
      <P>As signals of force, the multi-year coastal deployments are less
dramatic "but no less objectionable than the previous firings," noted
the Post, adding that in Taiwan, at any rate, the effect may be the
same -- "to advertise to the Taiwanese people the benefits of
independence from Beijing and to turn them further against any early
consideration of reunification."</P>
      <P>The United States and other interested countries should not
hesitate to remind Beijing that in their view reunification can come
about only peacefully. "Chinese missile rattling has no place in the
proceedings," noted the editorial.</P>
      <P>The rattling is also bound to increase Taiwan's appetite for
anti-missile protection. That could come to mean, over the years, the
inclusion of Taiwan under an American missile umbrella. A broad
American policy choice may be emerging. The United States is directed
by longtime bipartisan policy as well as by statute to help provide
for Taiwan's defense and to ensure that the island's future unfolds
by peaceful means, continued the newspaper.</P>
      <P>But a missile shield, once developed and deployed, does not stop
at protecting the intended beneficiary, here Taiwan. It is in the
nature of such a shield that it also could embolden Taiwan to feel it
did not really have to negotiate seriously with the mainland Chinese.
But all of this is a long way from happening, if it even happens at
all, added the editorial.</P>
      <P>The Washington Post concluded that negotiations ought to take
place without coercion and on the basis of mutual interest.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Philippine senator called on Monday for
the government to change the name of the South China Sea to the
"Kalayaan (Freedom) Sea."</P>
      <P>Senator Francisco Tatad's resolution came after it was reported
that mainland China had instructed all its missions abroad to avoid
any public discussion of the Spratlys issue which involves the
Philippines, Mainland China, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his resolution, Tatad said part of Philippines' national
territory and the 200 mile Executive Economic Zone as recognized by
the United Nations convention on the Law of the Sea lies within the
body of water known as the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Because of its name, this body of water is sometimes perceived as
belonging to the country that bears its name, he claimed. In fact, he
continued, on Feb. 25, 1992, mainland China's national assembly
passed a "Law on Territorial Waters and Adjacent areas of the
People's Republic of China," declaring the South China Sea as
territorial waters.</P>
      <P>"To avoid confusion that the body of water in question belongs to
China and to declare to the world that the sea is open to the freedom
of navigation of all innocent and friendly parties," the Philippines
should now start calling what is referred to as the South China Sea
as the Kalayaan Sea, Tatad said.</P>

      <P>Drinking less can not only improve
health, but also can allow people to perform better at work and pick
up fatter pay packets, according to the results of a new Australian
survey.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by economist Garry Narrett of the
University of New South Wales, said moderate drinkers earn more than
total abstainers and also more than heavy drinkers.</P>
      <P>His research, which was not conducted at the pub, is backed up
with complex equations that enabled him to mix and match data on
drinking behavior and wages among a wide range of workers.</P>
      <P>He said: "The major finding from the analysis is that there is a
significant, positive wage differential for moderate drinking, and a
significant wage penalty for heavy drinking."</P>
      <P>He said temperate drinkers tend to have better jobs than
employees who don't drink at all or who don't know when to stop.</P>
      <P>"The wage premium for moderate drinkers, relative to both
abstainers and heavy drinkers, is predominantly due to greater
returns to personal and job characteristics rather than to
differences in the level of those characteristics," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE  DEFENSE MINISTRY TO PLUG INTO SOLAR POWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A solar-powered Singapore military is on
the way, with the first Defense Ministry installation to harness the
power of the sun on a large scale expected to be up and running by
2002.</P>
      <P>Defense Ministry engineers concluded that solar power can be
harnessed economically here by incorporating solar panels into
buildings.</P>
      <P>In the first major test of its kind here, the ministry's Land and
Estate Organization (LEO) installed an S$80,000 (about US$50,000)
solar power system at Tuas naval base in 1997, with 56 rectangular
solar panels on the roof and part of the building's facade.</P>
      <P>From the pilot project, LEO believes that building integrated
solar panels, which are connected directly to the power grid, are the
only application of solar power which hold potential for large-scale
commercial use.</P>
      <P>A senior manager in LEO's electrical engineering department
pointed out that with the cost of solar panels expected to fall by as
much as 40 percent in the coming years, LEO expects to be able to use
the next generation of solar cells, which will be less than 50
microns thick, whereas the cells used at Tuas are 350 microns thick.</P>
      <P>Up until last December, the Tuas system generated 5,700 kW/h,
sufficient to meet the needs of an average five-room household."</P>
      <P>A LEO electrical engineer said that all the energy was collected
in an area of about 30 square meters, only 3 percent of the entire
facade.</P>
      <P>"If more panels are installed, solar energy can easily power up
to 30 percent of the building load for a two-story building during
daytime," he said.</P>
      <P>The engineer added: "This reduction in initial investment,
together with a long lifespan of more than 20 years for a solar
panel, makes it possible for solar energy to compete with a
conventional power supply."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEWLY DISCOVERED  GENE  COULD REVERSE DISEASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scientists at Montreal's McGill University
said on Thursday they have discovered a new human gene that might
eventually help "deprogram" cells in the body and reverse diseases
like cancer.</P>
      <P>The cells might also help in organ transplantation and cloning,
they believe.</P>
      <P>The researchers' early experiments on lung-cancer tissue,
published this week in the British journal Nature, reveal that an
enzyme called demethylase is key to changing how cells operate.</P>
      <P>"We've been missing the microchips of biotechnology that we need
and now we think we've found one of them," said Moshe Szyf, the
associate professor of pharmacology who led the research.</P>
      <P>He cautioned that the discovery's role in a potential cure for
cancer is still small and any practical applications in medicine are
still a long way off. His team will test their theory on mice.</P>
      <P>For decades, scientists have thought enzymes can change the way
cells work, but didn't know how, or which enzymes. They knew that, in
the embryo, cells carry in them a person's complete DNA, and that as
it develops, each cell breaks down that information for specific uses
in the body. That's how individual organs are formed.</P>
      <P>But what was less understood was how, in the embryo, humans
change the pattern of cell modification inherited from their parents
and form their own patterns, making them unique.</P>
      <P>Now, Szyf and his team of researchers have come up with an
answer: the inherited DNA patterns are "erased" by the demethylase
enzyme.</P>
      <P>With that knowledge, they believe science now has a key to unlock
people's genetic programs and change what cells do.</P>
      <P>For example, in a cancer patient whose cells have "modified"
themselves out of control, drug therapy based on the right enzymes
could be used to reverse the process, the team believes.</P>
      <P>That same ability to modify cells would be a boon for
transplantation: Organs could be grown specifically to match a
person's biological makeup, with no fear of rejection.</P>
      <P>Calling the work "very high-quality science," McGill University's
dean of medicine Abe Fuks said it is as promising as the early
research on tissue cultures that led to a vaccine for polio.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FM RECEIVES ASSURANCES FROM HOLY SEE COUNTERPART</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
called on his Vatican counterpart Jean-Louis Tauran on Thursday at
Vatican City, a press release issued by the ROC Foreign Ministry in
Taipei announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>Hu expressed Taipei's concerns over remarks made by Vatican
Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano last Thursday. At a
reception at the Italian embassy to the Vatican, Sodano was quoted as
saying that the Catholic Church would move its embassy in Taipei
"back to" Beijing immediately if the mainland Chinese authorities
allowed it.</P>
      <P>Hu told Tauran that the ROC, under the leadership of President
Lee Teng-hui, is a country which enshrines human rights and pursues
peace. It supports the Holy See's efforts to advance human rights and
peace around the world, said the press release.</P>
      <P>Noting that Pope John Paul II encourages contact between Taipei
and Beijing, Hu said that Taiwan looks forward to dialogue with
mainland China to iron out their differences and lay the groundwork
for peaceful bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that Taipei understands the Holy See's concern for
the millions of Catholics in mainland China, and urged the church not
to improve its ties with Beijing at the cost of Taipei, let alone
forsake its followers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to address Hu's concerns, Tauran downplayed the
significance of Sodano's remarks, saying that it was only the
church's wish and that there has been no progress in its contacts
with Beijing thus far.</P>
      <P>He said the Vatican is pleased with its ties with Taipei, and
understands Taipei's anguish over its reported contacts with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Until recently the ROC's only ally in Europe, the Vatican makes
no secret of its intention to forge ties with Beijing. It has shrunk
from doing so only because Beijing demands the power to appoint
bishops and insists that the Vatican should break ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu arrived in Rome on Thursday unannounced. He flew in from
Jordan where he had conveyed Taipei's condolences over the death of
King Hussein Bin Talal.</P>
      <P>Although the Foreign Ministry statement did not disclose the
length of his stay in Rome, Hu is expected to stay there until
saturday, and to have a meeting with Sodano.</P>

      <P>Recalling that the party has led the nation from poverty to
prosperity over the last five decades, Lee told those present at the

      <P>A meeting of the Cabinet on economic issues was scheduled for
later on Friday to discuss the conclusions reached at an economic
forum earlier this month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TRADE DEFICIT WITH TAIWAN HITS 9-YEAR HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to a sharp decline in exports to
Taiwan, the United States' trade deficit with the island hit a
nine-year high of US$15 billion in 1998, the US Department of
Commerce reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the US Commerce Department,
bilateral US-Taiwan trade totaled US$51.28 billion last year, down
3.2 percent from 1997. US exports to Taiwan fell by 10.8 percent to
reach about US$18.16, while Taiwan exports to the US grew by 1.5
percent to around US$33.12 billion.</P>
      <P>An ROC trade official based in the United States pointed out,
however, that US government statistics seemed to be exaggerated, as
ROC customs figures put the 1998 trade gap between the two countries
at US$9.7 billion, a difference of US$5.3 billion.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the cause of the island's sluggish demand
for foreign imports to the persistent Asian financial turmoil. As
Taiwan was not the sole country affected by the crisis, the official
said the US government should take this into consideration.</P>
      <P>As part of the island's terms for joining the World Trade
Organization, Taipei and Washington reached a bilateral agreement in
February 1998. In it, Taiwan agreed to open its agricultural market
to the United States and sent delegations on several large-scale
buy-American missions to purchase US$1.1 billion worth of US farm
products over the past year.</P>
      <P>US government statistics also showed that all Asian countries
experienced sharp declines in imports from the United States during
last year since the region's financial woes broke out in the second
half of 1997.</P>
      <P>Indonesia posted the largest decrease in US imports of 49 percent
in 1998, followed by South Korea with 34 percent, Hong Kong with 14.5
percent, Japan with 11.7 percent and Singapore with 11.4 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA VOWS TO LAUNCH RADARSAT-2 DESPITE NASA REFUSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>NASA is refusing to launch a new high-tech
Canadian radar satellite because American intelligence agencies feel
it poses a threat to US national security.</P>
      <P>"We'll launch it," Industry Minister John Manley said Thursday.
"Launching a satellite is not a difficult thing. There's lots of ways
to get satellites launched."</P>
      <P>Canada's Radarsat-2 satellite has an advanced radar scanner that
can pierce through clouds and the dark of night. The scanner can help
forecast crop yields, direct mineral exploration and help vessels
navigate around Arctic ice.</P>
      <P>The new satellite can reveal objects as small as three meters
across. An older generation Radarsat-1 can only reveal objects seven
meters across. This forward leap in technology reportedly unnerves US
officials.</P>
      <P>"Anything below five meters causes concern to the US intelligence
community," said Hugues Gilbert, director of strategic development
for the Canadian Space Agency.</P>
      <P>He said the Americans are worried they might sell sensitive
images to private businesses or other governments. "But we think that
having the three-meter resolution is really crucial to Canadian
industry. It's very important for tapping into new markets," he
added.</P>
      <P>The market for radar satellites is steadily growing. The Canadian
Space Agency said it is ready to have the C$305 million satellite
launched by another space agency if necessary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA ARRESTS RECORD NUMBER OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian authorities arrested a record
number of 70 illegal immigrants in their latest battle against
illegal migrant laborers, the Immigration Department reported.</P>
      <P>In Victoria, 51 farmhands were captured while 19 were apprehended
in Queensland, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said. The
immigrants came from mainland China, Vietnam, South Korea, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Samoa, Fiji, Israel and Britain.</P>
      <P>Authorities began investigating the situation after local
residents complained to police that they could not find jobs because
farmers were employing illegal workers.</P>
      <P>Charles Li, a Chinese-Australian, is accused of being a
Sydney-based agent who introduced illegal migrants to work in a
Victoria tomato farm. He allegedly charged about US$300 per person
plus bus fare to Shepparton, a small town in that state. Li has
denied any wrongdoing in the case.</P>
      <P>Federal officers came under public criticism after they resorted
to using rope to restrain a group after running out of handcuffs.</P>
      <P>Migration agent Marion Le said she was shocked to hear of the use
of rope to detain workers, noting that she has never known the
department to ever do so.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Victorian Agriculture Minister Pat McNamara said the
government should make it easier for backpackers and other overseas
workers to gain employment where there is a shortage of fruit and
vegetable pickers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CLAMPS DOWN ON CORRUPTION IN ITS RICHEST PROVINCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is conducting a sweeping
crackdown on corruption in Guangdong, the mainland's richest
province, but foreign analysts believe it may be an impossible task,
the Sydney Morning Herald reported.</P>
      <P>In more than 20 years of reforms, Guangdong has become a chaotic
mixture of roughneck capitalism, rampant corruption and flagging
one-party rule, the paper noted.</P>
      <P>Mainland President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji are worried
that the mess will pose a serious threat to the country's political
and economic stability and have launched an all-out offensive to
bring the province to a heel.</P>
      <P>Guangdong accounts for 10 percent of the mainland's gross
national product and 40 percent of its total exports, but the
province's economic growth is falling and unemployment is reaching
dangerous levels. The crackdown so far has exposed and punished 171
corrupt mid-level government officials in the province. From May to
July 1998, 1,252 cases involving corruption were brought to court,
the daily reported.</P>
      <P>To tighten control, local government stalwarts have been replaced
with trusted officials from other provinces, almost every customs
official has been replaced with outsiders to curb smuggling and
censorship has been intensified over what had been mainland China's
most daring and independent press, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Despite the high-profile crackdown, many ordinary people in the
province believe graft in the government is now so pervasive that it
will be impossible to remove.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the biggest challenge for mainland China's
central leadership in restraining the region may be much more
intangible than corruption and financial irresponsibility.</P>
      <P>Two decades of economic reforms have led to an increase of
private businesses and a bigger middle class among Guangdong's 70
million people than anywhere else in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe these people, who have historically been at the
forefront of political change, are becoming a much more effective
pressure group for property rights and the rule of law than the
dissident community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FM'S EUROPEAN TRIP PRIVATE: FOREIGN MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on
Saturday that Foreign Minister Jason Hu's current trip in Europe is
of a private nature and he is not taking part in any official
activity there.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to local news reports that Hu, before
visiting the Vatican, traveled to Hungary and met with Hungarian
officials.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry Spokesman Roy Wu said the minister is
vacationing with his family and other than his stay in the Vatican
City, has no official activity in Europe.</P>
      <P>After visiting Jordan with Legislative Yuan Vice President Yao
Eng-chi on Feb. 10 to extend the ROC government's condolences over
the death of King Hussein Bin Talal, Hu arrived in the Vatican, the
ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>Hu on Thursday called on his Vatican counterpart Jean-Louis
Tauran and expressed Taipei's concern over remarks made by Vatican
Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano last Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a reception at the Italian embassy to the Vatican, Sodano was
quoted as saying that the Catholic Church would move its embassy in
Taipei "back to" Beijing immediately if the mainland Chinese
authorities allowed it.</P>
      <P>Hu told Tauran that the ROC, under the leadership of President
Lee Teng-hui, is a country which respects human rights and pursues
peace. It supports the Holy See's efforts to advance human rights and
peace around the world, according to a press release issued by the
ministry on Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Pope John Paul II encourages contact between Taipei
and Beijing, Hu said that Taiwan looks forward to dialogue with
mainland China to iron out their differences and lay the groundwork
for peaceful bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that Taipei understands the Holy See's concern for
the millions of Catholics in mainland China, and urged the church not
to improve its ties with Beijing at the cost of Taipei, let alone
forsake its followers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to address Hu's concerns, Tauran downplayed the
significance of Sodano's remarks, saying that it was only the
church's wish and that there has been no progress in its contacts
with Beijing thus far.</P>
      <P>He said the Vatican is pleased with its ties with Taipei, and
understands Taipei's anguish over its reported contacts with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Until recently as the ROC's only ally in Europe, the Vatican has
made no secret of its intention to forge ties with Beijing. It has
refused to do so only because Beijing demands the power to appoint
bishops and insists that the Vatican should break ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu is scheduled to call on Cardinal Angelo Sodano late in the
day, and will return to Taipei Feb. 23.

    <HEADLINE>SUHARTO'S SON-IN-LAW DEFENDS TROOP DECISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The son-in-law of former Indonesian
President Suharto admitted on Friday to having mobilized troops last
May, but his aim was to protect newly-appointed President B.J.
Habibie, he said in a written statement.</P>
      <P>Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto, who was ousted as head of
the powerful Strategic Reserve Command after the incident, also
maintained that he had kept armed forces chief General Wiranto
informed of his actions.</P>
      <P>The signed four-page statement from Amman, Jordan, where he is
now living, was in response to Habibie's allegations that the general
launched military deployments outside the new leader's residence to
challenge his appointment following Suharto's downfall.</P>
      <P>Habibie told participants at the Asian-German Editors Forum this
week that he had received reports of the troop concentration from
Gen. Wiranto, who asked how he should respond. The president then
ordered his military commander to pull out the soldiers.</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Prabowo, who was removed from his post the next morning,
said in his statement that he was merely following procedures in
securing the capital, given the devastating riots and political
uncertainty.</P>
      <P>Prabowo said troop concentrations near the houses of the
president and vice-president were in line with operational orders
issued at that time. He maintained that it was inconceivable he would
want to challenge Habibie's appointment.</P>
      <P>It is not very clear why Habibie chose to announce Lt. Gen.
Prabowo's alleged actions more than seven months after the incident.
Political observers told The Straits Times that the German-trained
engineer was keen to impress his foreign audience that "he was not
handed power on the silver platter and that he had to fight for his
position."</P>

Saturday in the Taipei foreign exchange market, closing at 33.275 up
NT$0.75 from Friday's finish.</P>
      <P>The greenback traded at a high of 33.305 and a low of 32.511

      <P>Interbank transactions totaled US$254 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Stock Exchange was boosted by a string of
measures announced by the government aimed at propping up the local
stock market and the banking sector.</P>
      <P>Share prices opened higher and rallied by 274.33 points on the
first day of trading following the Chinese New Year holidays. The
weighted index, the bourse's key benchmark, rose above the
6,000-point level by closing at 6,072.33.</P>
      <P>Stocks in the eight major categories all surged, with financial

      <P>A total of 1.85 billion shares changed hands, while market
turnover hit NT$57.89 billion.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu expressed delight over the stock
market's performance, saying that it marked a good beginning for the
year of the rabbit. He promised that the government will do its best
to form a good investment climate for the general public and help
build a more stable capital market.</P>
      <P>The Finance Ministry's measures, which were announced on Friday,
are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- foreign investors will be allowed to hold up to 50 percent of
stocks in a single listed company, up from the current ceiling of 30
percent;</P>
      <P>-- revenue taxes for banks will be lowered to 2 percent from the
present 5 percent, a move which the Finance Ministry said is expected
to increase revenue for the banking sector by about NT$132 billion
over the next four years which banks can use to write down bad loans;</P>
      <P>-- the existing 0.1 percent tax on transactions of corporate
bonds will be abolished; and</P>
      <P>-- incentives will be implemented to encourage mergers of
financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) also announced it will slash the
average reserve requirement ratio from the current level of 7.65
percent to 6.41 percent, which hopefully will release a record high

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kaohsiung couple has lost contact with
their 18-year-old nursing student daughter who is believed to be in
Australia, the family said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liu Liang-yin reportedly left for Australia on Jan. 21, the last
day before the winter semester break, without telling her family of
her plans. Between Jan. 21 and Feb. 16, Liu contacted her home only
four times without revealing her whereabouts.</P>
      <P>According to Liu's mother, Liu last called home on Feb. 16 and
spoke with her grandmother who said Liu was crying when she said she
had run out of money.</P>
      <P>The Liu family, wanting to send her money, did not have an
address or other related information other than a telephone number.
After dialing the number, the family only heard an English-language
message on an answering machine.</P>
      <P>Liu had apparently purchased a plane ticket and had her passport
prepared through a travel agency without her parent's knowledge.</P>
      <P>Liu's mother noted that her daughter is an avid Internet user who
may have made friends in Australia through online contacts and went
there to meet them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu's father said he will apply for a suspension at
Liu's nursing school on Monday, the first day of classes, so she may
resume her studies upon returning to Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The Liu family has sought assistance from both the Taiwan and
Australian authorities to help locate the missing student.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER MEETS VATICAN SECRETARY OF STATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Rome,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Affairs Minister
Jason Hu called on Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano
on Saturday and exchanged views on a wide range of topics.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Hu stressed that ties between the Republic of
China and the Vatican represent a marriage of ideals, as both sides
uphold the principles of peace, compassion and human rights. The
Republic of China and the Vatican are good partners in the business
of accelerating religious freedom in mainland China, he noted.</P>
      <P>Hu, who arrived in the Holy See after attending the funeral of
Jordanian King Hussein Bin Talal, briefed Sodano on the latest
developments in cross-strait relations and on the present state of
the dialogue between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that through constructive dialogue, Taiwan and
mainland China will redress their differences and bolster mutual
understanding, which will ultimately lead to peaceful reunification,
Hu said. The entire process, however, will require the support of ROC
allies, such as the Vatican, he added.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the ROC government's wish that all people
throughout mainland China will be blessed with democracy, freedom and
human rights, which is also the wish of the Vatican, Hu said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Sodano said the Vatican will not normalize
relations with Beijing until religious freedom is commonplace in
mainland China. He stressed that the Vatican would never do anything
that would compromise the interests of the people of the Republic of
China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Vatican, which was the ROC's only European ally until Taiwan
forged ties with Macedonia last month, has made no secret of its
desire to establish relations with Beijing. So far, however, the two
countries have remained deadlocked over the appointment of bishops
and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing insists that it, and not the Vatican, has the right to
appoint bishops in mainland China, and that the Vatican must sever
diplomatic ties with Taipei to establish relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hu is scheduled to return to Taipei on Feb. 23.</P>

hospital, are unaware that the incident claimed the lives of her
husband and son, relatives said.</P>
      <P>Hu Chun-te and his son Hu Li-tsung both died of carbon-monoxide
asphyxiation while Hu Chun-te's wife Tseng Chao-chun and daughter Hu

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF NORTHBOUND CARS ON CHUNGSHAN FREEWAY HITS RECORD HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of automobiles traveling
northbound on the Sun Yat-sen (Chungshan) Freeway on Saturday reached
a record high over the Chinese Lunar New Year, which concludes on
Sunday, the National Freeway Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Although a total of 1.43 million cars traveled on the North-South
Freeway on Saturday -- compared to 1.58 million on Thursday and 1.50
million on Friday -- 832,000 cars were recorded on the freeway's
northbound lanes, a record for a single day.</P>
      <P>The number of passenger cars using the Chungshan Freeway on
Sunday is expected to be less than that of Saturday, bureau officials
said.</P>
      <P>Before 1 p.m. Sunday, the entire freeway will remain toll-free in
both directions. Traffic controls, which require a minimum of four
passengers per car, will also remain effective throughout Sunday.</P>
      <P>The North-South Freeway was designed to accommodate a maximum of
870,000 passenger cars per day. During the 1998 Chinese New Year,
however, as many as 1.54 million cars used the freeway daily. In
1996, an average of 1.08 million passenger cars used the freeway each
day, according to National Freeway Bureau tallies.</P>
      <P>To ease traffic conditions during the Chinese New Year, the
National Freeway Bureau imposed full-occupancy traffic controls and
dropped the toll fees.</P>
      <P>Despite the two measures, the average speeds reached 30-40
kilometers per hour during 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Saturday when traffic
was at its heaviest, bureau officials noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY WORSE LAST LUNAR YEAR THAN IN YEARS BEFORE: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 90 percent of people in Taiwan
believe the nation's economy was worse in the last lunar year than in
those before, according to survey results released on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Eighty-nine percent of respondents in the survey, conducted by
the Taipei-based Brotherhood Cultural and Educational Foundation,
said Taiwan's economy was worse off during the just-ended Year of the
Tiger than in the previous several lunar years.</P>
      <P>The Year of the Tiger ended Feb. 15, 1999.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan are pessimistic in regard to the state of
the economy, said Wu Poh-hsiung, senior advisor to the president and
chairman of the foundation, at a press conference Sunday.</P>
      <P>Questioned about the cause of Taiwan's economic problems, 40.6
percent of respondents said that an unhealthy economic system at home
was responsible. Meanwhile, 32.5 percent of respondents attributed
Taiwan's economic problems to last year's global economic
sluggishness, while 20.6 percent said both a global slowdown and an
unhealthy economic system at home were the cause. About 6 percent
said they did not know or declined to answer.</P>
      <P>The public has little confidence in both Taiwan's future economic
growth and the government's strategies to improve the economy this
year, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 53.1 percent of those polled said Taiwan's sound
economic fundamentals would help the island to overcome its current
economic turmoil, and 61.1 percent of respondents said most Taiwan
companies would survive, while only 24.2 percent answered otherwise,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Noting public apprehension regarding the state of the economy, Wu
suggested the government map out efficient and comprehensive middle
and long-term measures to pump up the economy.</P>
      <P>He added that the government must also explain its efforts to
revive the economy to the public.</P>
      <P>In the random telephone survey, which was conducted Feb. 12-13,
usable responses were obtained from 1,090 Taiwan citizens 21 and
older. The survey's margin of error was 3 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday said he
will set off for Australia on Feb. 28, and during his trip he will
try to persuade Australia to send to Taipei a pair of koala bears
promised by Australia's Gold Coast.</P>
      <P>Ma revealed the plan during a Chinese Lunar New Year activity at
the Taipei City Zoo. He explained that his predecessor, Chen
Shui-bien, had arranged for two koalas to be presented to Taipei as a
gift by Taipei's Australian sister-city Gold Coast.</P>
      <P>The presentation has not yet taken place because the Australian
government has not yet approved it, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The city zoo has built a koala home stocked with eucalyptus
trees, Ma said, noting the Australian animals can move into their new
home at any time.</P>
      <P>Ma is traveling to Australia to take part in an upcoming Cities
of Asia-Pacific Conference that will be held in Brisbane. It is his
first foreign visit aimed at promoting city-to-city diplomacy since
winning Taipei's mayoral election last Dec. 5.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN AS BEST AMONG ASIAN DRAGONS: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's economic growth for
1999 will likely rank on top among Asia's four dragon economies, said
senior officials with the economic research office of the Central
Bank of China (CBC).</P>
      <P>CBC officials made the remark on Sunday despite the downward
revision on projections for Taiwan's 1999 economic growth by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
under the Executive Yuan before the Chinese Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>Among the four Asian dragons, the economic growth for South
Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong are expected to register 0.6 percent,
zero and negative 1 percent respectively, a far cry from Taiwan's
estimated 4.7 percent, according to CBC officials.</P>
      <P>Even compared with the growth of European and American economies,
Taiwan's economic performance can be considered rather outstanding,
said Shea Jia-dong, CBC's deputy governor. Taiwan's economic
prospects will soon be at the end of the tunnel, Shea added.</P>
      <P>The deputy governor expressed hope that people in Taiwan will not
be too pessimistic about the country's economic prospects.</P>
      <P>The economic growth of the US, Germany, Britain, France, Canada
and Italy are expected to be 2.4 percent, 1.9 percent, 1 percent, 2.1
percent, 2.2 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>While in regard to Southeast Asian countries, figures for the
Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are 3.7 percent, 0.5
percent, negative 0.8 percent and negative 3.9 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>What is noteworthy is that Japan, Asia's economic giant, is
expected to register a negative 1.3 percent growth this year,
indicating that Japan is still under a shadow of economic recession,
noted CBC's officials.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese man who accidentally stabbed
himself in the eye with a chopstick could lose his eyesight in that
eye, staff members of National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Satoshi Kinoshita stabbed himself with a chopstick in his right
eyeball Sunday morning at Taipei's Lai Lai Sheraton Hotel, where he
was staying. He was eating a bowl of instant noodles and packing when
he tripped over something on the floor.</P>
      <P>The chopstick pierced his eyeball and lodged itself inside to a
depth of about 3 centimeters. The stick was embedded so far into
Kinoshita's eye that he could not remove it, he said.</P>
      <P>After the accident, Kinoshita called room service and asked for
help. When hotel staff and an interpreter arrived, Kinoshita
apologized for his carelessness and asked to be sent to the hospital.</P>
      <P>He was rushed to nearby NTU Hospital, where doctors determined
that his injury was not life-threatening, although they said he
could lose his eyesight in his right eye.</P>
      <P>The doctors were expected to remove the chopstick Sunday, and
Kinoshita will have to stay at the hospital for several days for
observation, NTU Hospital staff said.</P>
      <P>According to Luo Wei-chun, manager of Lai Lai Sheraton's Room
Service Department, both the chopsticks and the bowl of instant
noodles were bought into Taiwan from Japan by Kinoshita.</P>
      <P>The hotel has informed Kinoshita's wife, who is leaving for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The hotel expressed its regret over the accident and has offered
to give Kinoshita a discount on his stay. He was to have left Taiwan
for Japan Sunday afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO BIG PROBLEM IN TAIPEI-VATICAN TIES, SAYS FM HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Rome,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no problem in relations between the
Vatican and the Republic of China, and differences between the two
are not as great as has been speculated, ROC Foreign Affairs Minister
Jason Hu said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu, who concluded a three-day visit to the Holy See and left for
New York Sunday, said both sides have come to understand each other
better as a result of his visit.</P>
      <P>"How to work out a formula of interaction that is comfortable for
both sides is a challenge to us, and we should strive to accomplish
it," Hu said upon his departure.</P>
      <P>Over the last three days, Hu has met with ranking officials in
the Holy See, including Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo
Sodano, for in-depth talks.</P>
      <P>Hu said he recognized that the common goal of Taipei and the Holy
See is to avoid harming the interests of the Taiwan people under any
circumstances, even as the Vatican expands its contacts with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Taipei shares the Holy See's ideals in regard to promoting
religious contacts with people in mainland China, Hu added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a recent spate of remarks by Vatican officials
about a desire for closer relations with mainland China, Hu said the
true purpose of such remarks is to bring about greater religious
freedom for the people of mainland China. There are no significant
differences between Taipei and the Holy See on that point, Hu added.</P>
      <P>It is challenging to work out a formula to achieve the goal of
promoting religious freedom in mainland China on the one hand while
ensuring that the Vatican is not being used by Beijing or sacrificing
Taiwan's interests on the other, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu, who attended the funeral of Jordanian King Hussein Bin Talal
before visiting the Vatican, left Saturday evening for New York,
where he will meet with his family.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister is expected to hold a press conference after

    <HEADLINE>CARDINAL SHAN EXPLAINS VATICAN'S RECENT CALL TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cardinal Paul K. H. Shan on Sunday
explained that a recent call to Beijing by the Vatican in which
Vatican officials mentioned the possibility of relocating the Holy
See's Taiwan embassy was simply aimed at urging mainland authorities
to respect the religious beliefs of the people of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Cardinal Shan offered the explanation after the appearance of
foreign-wire reports that Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's
secretary of state, indicated the Vatican would relocate its embassy
from Taipei to Beijing, a move that implies a switch in relations.</P>
      <P>Shan, who is scheduled to leave for the Holy See on Monday, said
Sodano's remarks came during a regular call to authorities in
Beijing. Such calls have been made for dozens of years, he said.</P>
      <P>"This is no longer newsworthy," Shan said, adding that the Holy
See has never lost concern for the religious freedoms of mainland
China's 15 million Catholics, nor has it ever stopped working to
ensure greater religious freedoms for the church's mainland Chinese
followers.</P>
      <P>He noted that as a Pole, Pope John Paul II did not forge formal
relations with his motherland until it ridded itself of its Communist
regime and embraced democracy. It is impossible for the pope to
change his pro-democratic stand now, Shan stressed.</P>
      <P>Anyone who knows anything about diplomacy will know that the call
is not cause for worry, Shan said, adding that he will not mention
the call in an upcoming meeting with the pope.</P>
      <P>There are now more than 2,000 ethnic Chinese living in Rome, and
Shan said he would lobby during an upcoming visit to the Vatican for
a special church to be set up for them. Shan is visiting the Holy See
to take part in a meeting of Asian bishops. He is scheduled to return
to Taiwan on March 7.</P>

      <P>Most of the 30 were from Hong Kong, Macao and Southeast Asia.
Their ability to enter Taiwan was aided by the similarity of their
languages and hair and skin color to those of the people of Taiwan,
according to MJIB authorities.</P>
      <P>In 1993 Hong Kong police authorities informed their Taiwan
counterparts through Interpol that a gangland figure and drug
trafficker suspected of having committed homicide and whose capture
carried a HK$100,000 reward might have snuck into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After a lengthy investigation Taiwan police discovered that the
man was working as a waiter at a tea house in western Taipei's Wanhua
District. The man, who had been leading a quiet life during his stay
in Taiwan, was apprehended and repatriated.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the MJIB received information from the Philippine
government that a murderer from that country may have fled to Taiwan.
The Philippine government asked for Taiwan's help in tracking down
the man.</P>
      <P>MJIB investigators found that the Filipino had entered Taiwan
with a phony passport and was working as an overseas laborer at a
factory in central Taiwan's Nantou. He was apprehended and
repatriated.</P>
      <P>In another case, one of Thailand's most notorious drug lords
lived in Taiwan for two years before being caught by police, who
found the man working as a senior executive at a multinational
company in Taipei, according to MJIB officials.</P>
      <P>Canadian officials once asked Taiwan police authorities to help
track down an "easy rider" gang leader who merchandised heroin with
postal stamps. Local police found the man teaching English in the
eastern Taiwan city of Taitung.</P>
      <P>In addition to tracking down suspected foreign criminals in
Taiwan, police have also cooperated with foreign police authorities
in finding foreign nationals who have gone missing.</P>
      <P>Acting on information provided by British police authorities,
MJIB investigators located an Englishman who went missing after
having a fight with his wife in Britain. The man was found teaching
English at a Taipei cram school.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGAL, TAX SERVICES MOST SOUGHT BY TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN MAINLAND</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The services most needed by Taiwan
businessmen investing in the mainland are legal and tax counseling
services, a survey conducted by the China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) showed on Monday.</P>
      <P>CETRA conducted the survey recently to learn the difficulties
faced by Taiwan businessmen in the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to the survey Taiwan businessmen also frequently need
help in obtaining bank loans from mainland banks, obtaining
information on mainland Chinese trade and its economy, communicating
with various Taiwan manufacturers, solving management problems in
mainland plants, training mainland officials and resolving trade
disputes.</P>
      <P>Extra expenses resulting from social activities were cited as the
most nagging problem facing Taiwan businessmen. Other management
problems included the trouble companies' Taiwan staffs had adjusting
to living in the mainland, difficulties in obtaining local bank
loans, intervention by mainland Chinese bureaucrats and the
difficulty in prying local markets there.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen also complained of a lack of sincerity among
mainland businessmen in implementing contracts, rising inventory
costs, an insufficient infrastructure -- such as electrical,
communications and transportation facilities -- difficulties
remitting profits overseas and disputes between labor and management.</P>
      <P>To help Taiwan businessmen CETRA will increase its collection of
information on the mainland market, help Taiwan businessmen establish
marketing networks, upgrade the image and profile of Taiwan-produced
products and promote a strategic alliance between Taiwan and foreign
businesses in the mainland to help tap the mainland market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US PRESIDENT CARTER TO VISIT TAIWAN IN LATE MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US President Jimmy Carter will
visit the Republic of China on Taiwan in late March at the
invitation of a private think tank here, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said the itinerary and other details
concerning Carter's Taiwan visit have yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>Wu said as the MOFA is not responsible for organizing Carter's
visit, it is not proper for the ministry to make any comment on
Carter's activities here at the moment.</P>
      <P>"At any rate, we welcome Carter's visit," Wu told a routine news
conference, adding that the MOFA will make necessary explanations of
Carter's itinerary when the time is right.</P>
      <P>This will be Carter's first visit to Taiwan. His visit is
expected to inspire much discussion in local society as his handling
of switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing 20 years
ago had hurt the ROC's national dignity and interests.</P>
      <P>According to a local newspaper report, Carter is scheduled to
make a three-day visit to Taiwan in late March. The report said
Carter will deliver a public speech and meet with ROC President Lee
Teng-hui and Vice President Lien Chan during his visit. Carter may be
accompanied by his wife and three grown-up children on his planned
visit.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen extended a warm welcome to
Carter's visit, saying it is a good thing for Carter to come to
Taiwan to witness the island's phenomenal political and economic
development over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>Chen was working in the ROC embassy in the United States when
Carter abruptly announced in late 1978 that his administration would
"normalize" relations with mainland China and cut diplomatic ties
with the ROC from Jan. 1, 1979.</P>
      <P>"It is painful to recall that moment," Chen said, adding that he
believes if Carter himself or his key aides had visited Taiwan
before making such a crucial decision, his administration's handling
of the issue might not have been so hurting.</P>
      <P>Chen said even though the ROC disagrees with Carter's decision,
it still welcomes his visit. "We hope to make friends with as many
people as possible," he noted.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said he is convinced that Carter will come to a
better understanding of Taiwan after his visit.</P>
      <P>"We have not been daunted by Washington's switch of diplomatic
allegiance. Instead, we have managed to weather through many
adversities and have grown even stronger and become a mature
democracy since that dark moment," he stressed proudly.</P>
      <P>Chen said Carter has won much acclaim for his diligent efforts
to promote world peace, human rights, global democratic development
and many other public-spirited programs since he ended his
presidential tenure in January 1981.</P>
      <P>Noting that Carter is a devout Christian, Chen said he is
impressed by Carter's sincerity and down-to-earth working style.</P>
      <P>Carter set up a "Carter Center" in his hometown of Atlanta,
Georgia to promote global peace, democracy and human rights shortly
after stepping down from the presidency. Over the past 20 years, he
has traveled to Ethiopia, Haiti, Bosnia, the Korean Peninsula and the
Middle East as a special envoy of the US president to mediate peace
in those turbulent areas.</P>
      <P>Carter has made five trips to mainland
China over the past two decades. He last visited the mainland in July
1997.</P>
      <P>Carter has seldom made comments on US foreign policy in recent
years. But he said after the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis that
one consensus reached between him and the late mainland Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping while discussing normalization of bilateral ties
was that any Taiwan-mainland disputes should be resolved by peaceful
means, not by military force.</P>
      <P>Mainland China test-fired missiles and conducted live-fire war
games in waters near Taiwan in the run-up to Taiwan's first direct
presidential election in March 1996. The event is now commonly called
the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's right-wing political forces
decided Sunday to create a new party to replace the current Reform
and Conservative parties.</P>
      <P>Delegates at the United Alternative conference in Ottawa voted in
favor of creating a new political party in an effort to
unite-the-right in Canada.</P>
      <P>The right-wingers know that without a united right, they will
never unseat the Liberals in the federal government.</P>
      <P>The 1,500 delegates at the conference voted on a number of
options that would allow the Reform and Tory parties to join forces
so they will have a chance of defeating the Liberals in the next
federal election.</P>
      <P>The options included: uniting behind an existing party; merging
established parties; cooperating in choosing candidates at the riding
level; or the creation of a new party.</P>
      <P>The voting was by preferential ballot with delegates ranking the
options in order of preference. The last option was the only one to
receive a majority vote.</P>
      <P>But Conservative leader Joe Clark has rejected the conference,
which means it is uncertain whether the vote will have any real
impact on the right. Many delegates have questioned the value of
creating a new party when there is already a national conservative
party that is established across the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-MACEDONIA TIES ARE FIRM AND SOLID, MOFA STRESSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) on Monday said the newly established diplomatic
relations with Macedonia are firm and solid, and will not be altered
by any foreign intervention or scenario.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said the ministry is keeping abreast of the
latest foreign reports concerning relations among the ROC, Macedonia
and mainland China as the deadline for the renewal of UN troops in
Macedonia nears.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taipei is closely monitoring all relevant situations in
regard to Macedonia, but the truth and validity of formal diplomatic
relations between the ROC and Macedonia are unaffected by any
reports, allegations or suggestions from the international community.</P>
      <P>The latest foreign wire reports have said that France is hoping
Macedonia will review its diplomatic ties with Taiwan before Feb. 28,
the date the mandate for the UN Preventive Deployment Force known as
UNPREDEP, expires.</P>
      <P>Reports said France wants Macedonia to maintain only economic
relations with Taiwan but not recognize Taiwan as a separate state.</P>
      <P>Some international diplomats also fear that Beijing will make
good on its threat to veto the UN troop operation in retaliation of
Skopje's new relations with Taiwan, the reports added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the news, Wu said France's efforts are at most a
suggestion and formal diplomatic relations between Taipei and Skopje
forged last month is a firm, formal and precise diplomatic agreement.</P>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu and his Macedonian counterpart,
Aleksandar Dimitrov, signed a joint communique in Taipei on Jan. 27
on the establishment of full diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Macedonia, which achieved independence from the former Yugoslavia
in 1991, became the second European state to have diplomatic ties
with the ROC, after the Vatican.</P>
      <P>Wu reiterated that the Taipei-Skopje ties, forged in the spirit
of sovereignty and principles of equality and reciprocity, are fully
supported by the government and the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that although there have been noises in Macedonia
resistant to the new diplomatic shift, the establishment of ties was
officially passed by the Macedonia cabinet and parliament.</P>
      <P>Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski, who spearheaded the
campaign to establish relations with Taiwan, reaffirmed repeatedly at
home and during a visit to Washington, D.C. recently that the
decision to forge formal ties with the ROC will not be changed.</P>
      <P>Wu repeated that international concerns, either out of goodwill
or not, are not affecting the truth and validity of formal diplomatic
ties between the ROC and Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The UN peacekeeping force was deployed in Macedonia in 1995 to
monitor borders and deter the spread of fighting to Macedonia from
Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who was originally
scheduled to leave for Macedonia on Feb. 23 for a formal visit, has
postponed his trip.</P>

      <P>Chiou, who once served as DPP's secretary-general, said prior to

      <P>Chiou will attend a change-over ceremony to be held at the DPP's

      <P>During his stay in Washington, Chiou will visit US Congress and
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which is authorized by the US

ties.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiou will call at prestigious US think tanks,
including the Heritage Foundation, the Brooking Foundation and
the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), as well as
meet with senior American media executives.</P>
      <P>Chiou will also visit New York before returning to Taipei on
March 5. Chiou will formally assume his new post in late March.</P>
      <P>Chiou said he will develop extensive contacts with the US
executive branch, Congress, private think tank researchers and media
organizations to allay their misgivings about the DPP's stances on
Taiwan independence and several other major political issues.</P>
      <P>"Americans still have plenty of misunderstanding about our
party, including our pro-independence platform and our positions on
Taiwan's national security, foreign policy and trade strategy,"
Chiou said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the DPP, while advocating Taiwan
independence, will fully respect Taiwan people's free will in
deciding the island's future.</P>

      <P>Former US Defense Secretary William Perry
will visit both sides of the Taiwan Strait next month, as he did in
January 1998, a Hong Kong daily reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Sing Tao Yih Pao reported that Perry will visit in March amid
rising concerns regarding a visit to Taiwan by Wang Daohan, mainland
China's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), agreed during a meeting with his Taiwan counterpart
Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), in
October in the mainland to pay a reciprocal visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing are still discussing the date of Wang's visit.</P>
      <P>In January 1998 Perry headed a delegation to Taiwan that included
former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, former Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili, former
Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Command Ronald Hayes and several
senior researchers. During that visit Perry conveyed the message that
the United States encouraged both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
resume dialogue.</P>
      <P>The main issues to be dealt with during next month's visit are
expected to be Wang's visit to Taiwan and the sensitive question of
whether a US-proposed theater missile defense system would cover
Taiwan, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Reports said that Perry met with Wang in July 1998 in Hawaii,
which Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency said was a "second tract"
of dialogue, complementing the official one.</P>
      <P>After the Hawaii meeting, the mainland delegation invited Perry
to a follow-up meeting in Shanghai in March this year.</P>
      <P>Reports said that Perry is expected to visit mainland China in
early March and Taipei in mid-March, suggesting that he is continuing
his attempt to promote "second tract" dialogue with the two sides of

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  February  22  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>German businessmen in Asia are
optimistic that the region's economic crisis will bottom out by the
middle of this year, with mainland China, Taiwan and Singapore
emerging as the least affected, results of a recent poll indicated.</P>
      <P>Only 22 percent of those questioned fear that 1999 will be worse
than last year, according to the findings of a survey of 1,500 German
firms in 10 Asian countries by the international management
consultant firm Droege &amp; Comp.</P>
      <P>Singapore would likely see positive growth by the start of 2000,
and might chalk up 5 percent growth by the start of 2002, businessmen
predicted. Meanwhile, they said Asia as a whole had to accept the
fact that the years of 10 percent annual economic growth were over as
a more realistic outlook for the coming years was annual growth at 3
percent to 5 percent, they added.</P>
      <P>Evaluating the impact of the crisis on German business, the
survey found that the credit crunch has been the biggest obstacle to
doing business, with 40 percent saying "funding is urgently
required."</P>
      <P>This is in stark contrast to the pre-crisis days, when German
business cited the lack of skilled personnel as their main obstacle
which is now a distant second, according to the survey which also
polled 500 firms based in Germany with operations in Asia.</P>
      <P>Some 96 percent of the German firms surveyed felt that Asia will
become more important in the future, and 84 percent intend to
increase their presence in Asia.</P>
      <P>The highest rate of growth in market share is expected in
mainland China, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore, but there is concern
that the German market share may contract in Indonesia, Hong Kong and
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Signaling their confidence in the region, 94 percent of those

against the US dollar in the last few days is due mainly to the
decline of the Japanese yen and is a short-term phenomenon, an
economic official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Thomas Yeh, director of the Economic Research Department under
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, made
the remark to reporters during a press briefing.</P>
      <P>As more than a half of Asia-Pacific countries are destinations
for Taiwan exports, the recovery of the economies in the region would
be conducive to the stability of NT dollar, he noted.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the local currency's downward trend in the last few days
has indeed been affected by short-term market factors. He added that
the phenomenon will not last long.</P>
      <P>Citing the yen's dramatic drop to 150 against the greenback from
110 in July 1997 and then its rally to the 110 level within a half
year, Yeh said the drop and rise of the yen was a natural market
reaction in view of the fact that Japan's economy has not achieved a
prompt improvement.</P>
      <P>As long as Asian-Pacific economies recover, Japan's economy does
not decline further, and the renminbi remains stable, the NT dollar
exchange rate is expected to be stable in the second half of 1999,
Yeh stated.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar registered three consecutive days of decline and
has slid to 33.275 against the greenback last Saturday, falling for
the first time in two and a half months to below the 33-level. It
closed at 33.102 on Monday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar jumped against the
greenback on Monday in the Taipei foreign exchange market, rising
NT$0.155 to close at 33.102.</P>
      <P>It marked the largest single-day appreciation over the past four
months. However, the appreciation was reportedly due to intervention
by the central bank.</P>
      <P>Dealers said continued weakness of the Japanese yen pulled down
the value of most Asian currencies in recent days, and the NT dollar
was unable to free itself from the trend.</P>
      <P>At the opening of Monday's session, the local currency initially
fell against the US dollar and did not post gains until halfway into
the trading session, brokers said, noting the rise was attributed to
the central bank's move to make "adjustments."</P>
      <P>In the near future, the local unit will continue to face pressure
to depreciate due to the fact that the Japanese government supports
the yen's devaluation which is seen enhancing the competitiveness of
Japanese exporters.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar opened at 33.05 and fluctuated between 33.035 and
33.45.</P>
      <P>The interbank US dollar trading amounted to US$651 million on the
on Monday, the largest single-day turnover in the past 45 days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE TO REBOUND IN THIRD QUARTER: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials are taking a prudently optimistic view of Taiwan's economic
prospects in 1999 which are expected to rebound in the third quarter,
said the head of MOEA's Statistics Department on Monday.</P>
      <P>A sharp devaluation of the island's currency, which lost close to
NT$1 against the US dollar over the past two trading days, will
surely benefit Taiwan's foreign trade, noted Chang Yao-tsung,
director-general of the Statistics Department under the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The MOEA had planned to release figures for the total volume of
export orders received by Taiwan manufacturers on Monday, but
postponed the announcement due to the busy Chinese Lunar New Year
holiday season, noted the director-general.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic prospects are expected to bottom out in the
first quarter of this year, level off in the second quarter, and
rebound in the third quarter, Chang added.</P>
      <P>Although the NT dollar is actually under-valued, its recent
devaluation is following the suit of the yen-dollar rate, remarked
Chang.</P>
      <P>Currency devaluation is aimed at defending competitiveness of
Taiwan products abroad, many of which compete with Japanese products.
Therefore, the NT dollar's exchange rate closely mimics the
yen-dollar rate.</P>
      <P>Chang indicated further that January's volume of exports would
certainly exceed that of the same period last year, because the Lunar
New Year holidays fell on January 1998.</P>
      <P>In view of having more working days in January this year than
last year, double-digit growth can be expected. A total of US$8.46
billion worth of exports was recorded in January 1998, while the
figure for January 1999 can be expected to reach US$9 billion,
concluded Chang.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) signed a memorandum of academic cooperation with the
Philippines' mass communications research center on Monday to form an
"ROC-Philippine forum" mechanism.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu said at the signing
ceremony that in light of the intensive commercial activities between
the ROC and the Philippines, the bilateral academic cooperation will
be conducive to the collection of commercial information and market
research in the future.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan and the Philippines are close in proximity and it
would be very convenient to technically support Taiwan's
manufacturers in the Philippines. He added that the signing of the
pact will help achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>TIER said the ROC-Philippine forum mechanism is to combine the
two nations' industrial, government and academic sectors knowledge to
help promote substantial bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Through the mechanism, scholars and experts from the two sides
will release articles on bilateral politics, economy, agriculture,
labor and cultural issues to provide the governments with suggestions
for various policies.</P>
      <P>TIER and the Philippine mass communications research center will
hold the first ROC-Philippine forum meeting in May with "the
development of agriculture and manpower resources" as the topic of
the meeting.</P>
      <P>The first ROC-Philippine forum meeting will emphasize the use of
Taiwan capital and agriculture technology in helping make the
Philippines Taiwan's agricultural overseas processing base, granary
and overseas leisure resort.</P>
      <P>In addition, forum delegates will also discuss issues related to
some 200,000 Philippine laborers working in Taiwan, and the use of
high ranking technical personnel to help Taiwan develop its economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CLAIMS JURISDICTION OVER KILLINGS ABOARD MUTINY VESSEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has asked Mauritius
to repatriate for trial the captain of a Taiwan-registered fishing
boat who allegedly killed two of his crewmen, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Roy Wu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"We have received a report from our representative office in
Mauritius concerning the killing by Kung Tai-an of two mainland
Chinese sailors aboard the Kaohsiung-based Ching Ching No. 12 tuna
fishing boat in the Indian Ocean on Feb. 16," Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Kung was taken into custody by Mauritius
police authorities when the 500-ton vessel docked at that country's
Port Louis on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Nine other surviving crew members, including four from Taiwan,
three from mainland China and two from the Philippines, have also
been detained for questioning, while the Ching Ching is still docked
at Port Louis, the report said.</P>
      <P>Kung allegedly shot to death two mainland sailors -- Li Xingzheng
and Yang Yong -- on Feb. 16 when the Ching Ching was operating in the
Indian Ocean some 1,000 nautical miles northwest of Mauritius.
Thirteen other mainland crewmen jumped ship in panic, and their fates
remain unclear.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as the incident took place on the high seas aboard a
Taiwan-owned ship, and because the suspect is a Republic of China
national, the ROC has full jurisdiction over the case.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that the Foreign Ministry has ordered ROC
Representative to Mauritius Lee Tzi-nan to negotiate with Mauritius
for Kung's speedy repatriation for trial.</P>
      <P>However, Wu pointed out, because the ROC does not maintain formal
diplomatic ties with Mauritius and there is no extradition agreement
between the two countries, there may be some difficulty obtaining
Kung's repatriation. "But anyway, we'll try our best to seek Kung's
return to stand trial in our court," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The fishery department under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture said it will ask the Criminal Investigation Bureau to
send police officers to Mauritius as soon as possible to escort Kung
back to Taiwan for trial.</P>
      <P>Local press reports said mainland China's embassy in Mauritius
has asked the Indian Ocean island nation to turn over the case to its
jurisdiction because all the killed and missing sailors were mainland
nationals.</P>
      <P>However, ROC representative Lee said in a telephone interview
with CNA that he had not heard of any such reports. Lee said he met
with Kung on Saturday evening, adding: "The 42-year-old captain told
me that he will assume full responsibility for the incident."</P>
      <P>Lee also said that he has already assisted the Ching Ching's
agent in Mauritius to hire a lawyer to help handle the case and
protect Kung's legal rights.</P>
      <P>He further said that one Taiwan crewman, identified as Lee
You-lai, sustained injuries to his arm in the incident. "The sailor
is in stable condition after receiving surgery," he added.</P>
      <P>The Ching Ching No. 12 left Kaohsiung on Feb. 20, 1996 to fish
for tuna in the Indian Ocean. A total of 25 men were aboard the ship
when the incident occurred.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Ching Ching Fishing Co., owner of the vessel,
said initial investigations show that only the ship's captain was
involved in the tragic incident.</P>
      <P>"We feel regret over the incident. Kung had just been promoted
from first engineer to captain. He has worked in our company for 10
years. He is moderate and has a good performance record. It is hard
to believe and beyond our imagination that the incident has
occurred," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He said two of the company's senior executives will leave for
Mauritius on Tuesday to handle the situation. He said the company
will offer generous compensation to the families of the two dead
sailors.</P>
      <P>"We have also asked ships operating in the Indian Ocean near
Mauritius to help in the search and rescue of the 13 missing mainland
crew members," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Mauritius press reports, mainland Chinese members of
the crew had refused to work since the ship left Port Louis last
August on grounds that their contracts had expired. The incident
might be related to mainland sailors' refusal to work, the reports
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>157 JOBLESS WORKERS APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 157 Taipei citizens have applied for
unemployment assistance to the Taipei City Government since the
beginning of this year, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Taipei labor affairs and the city's
economic outlook for 1999, Ma admitted that Taipei's unemployment
rate has already increased to 2.5 percent. Although the ratio is not
the highest compared to figures for other parts of the island, the
mayor said, it is already an alarming level.</P>
      <P>Attributing the rising joblessness to persistent sluggish
business conditions islandwide, Ma said his administration has
allocated a larger budget for economic development for the next
fiscal year, in the hope of creating more job opportunities by
implementing public construction projects.</P>
      <P>On the new unemployment assistance, Ma said the Employment
Service Center under the city government began screening applications
for the subsidy from Taipei citizens on Jan. 4. So far, a total of
157 applications have been approved, he added.</P>
      <P>Judging from the information obtained from unemployed applicants,
the center's director, Hsiao Shu-yen, said that contrary to what is
widely assumed, joblessness is most noticeable in the construction
sector and small trading companies, which have been hardest-hit by
the Asian financial crisis, rather than in the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The worst-affected are those in the 30-40 age group, with women
outnumbering men, she noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the next 10 years, equities will not
likely achieve the high nominal returns they have enjoyed during the
last 20 years, but they should outperform bonds or cash, a Hong Kong
investment advisor said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Simon Rigby, director of Schroder Investment Management (Hong
Kong) Limited, said in a document entitled "Investment Strategy for
Hong Kong Retirement Plans," that since 1970, the average Hong Kong
dollar return for Hong Kong equities has been 20.7 percent a year.</P>
      <P>This is well above the 9.8 percent annual return that would have
been achieved by investing in US Treasury bonds.</P>
      <P>"Periods of poor performance during the 1970s and during the
early 1980s have more than made up for the period as a whole. The
higher return from equities is compensation for market volatility,"
he said.

eligible to live in Hong Kong, according to a recent estimate by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is willing to open a dialogue with
mainland China on any topic, so long as the island's security is
assured and Beijing acknowledges that mainland China and Taiwan are
ruled by two different administrations, said Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Su Chi on Monday.</P>
      <P>At a New Year reception for Taiwan businessmen investing in
mainland China, the MAC head reiterated a call made by Premier
Vincent Siew on Nov. 2 at a conference on mainland affairs.</P>
      <P>Siew said at that time that Beijing's respect for the actual
division between Taiwan and mainland China, and its renouncement of
military threats against the island will dispel Taiwan's concerns
about security.</P>
      <P>Su also called for Beijing's cooperation in maintaining stability
in bilateral ties, and its help in making this stability a positive
factor with regard to peace in Asia as a whole.</P>
      <P>Hailing the trip to the mainland by Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu last October as ushering in a new
chapter in Taipei-Beijing ties, Su described the visit as the result
of the government's persistent efforts which have laid the groundwork
for systematic exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Admitting that there is no sign that the confrontation between
Beijing and Taiwan will disappear any time soon, given Beijing's
continuous military build-up and its incessant diplomatic campaign to
isolate Taiwan, Su said Taiwan still holds out cautious rather than
wishful hopes for a better relationship with Beijing this year.</P>
      <P>He spelled out four priorities in handling bilateral ties:
pressing ahead with constructive bilateral dialogue; exploring the
possibility of agricultural cooperation with Beijing; improving the
organization of bilateral exchanges; and seeking better protection
for Taiwan's investments in mainland China.</P>

great competition in gathering retail and corporate deposits as they
strive to regain their strength in the wake of the regional financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>A survey by The Asian Banker Journal has also revealed that the

seven of the region's economies.</P>
      <P>Many banks want to compete for retail deposits, according to the
survey, while fee-based activities, including trade finance, credit
cards, cash management, and third party funds, were the other areas
where competition is expected to be fierce.</P>
      <P>The survey, which sought to determine the impact of the financial

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will not split because of internal disputes
on the party's presidential candidate, the DPP's new representative
to the United States said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, who once served as DPP secretary-general, made the
remarks before leaving on a 12-day trip to the United States, when he
will formally assume his new responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that he will use his new position to build improved
communication channels with the US authorities, and to forge mutual
trust.</P>
      <P>Chiou said he knew nothing about a reported March meeting between
DPP presidential hopefuls Hsu Hsin-liang and Chen Shui-bian, who are
supposed to negotiate with each other on who will be the presidential
candidate for the party.</P>
      <P>However, he added that if Hsu and Chen cannot reach agreement on
which of them should run, the party will seek to settle the problem
in the National Congress, the DPP's highest authority.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who is one of DPP's founders and has served as party
chairman, has never renounced his interest in running in Taiwan's
second democratic presidential election in 2000, while Chen's
presidential ambitions have wide party support.</P>
      <P>The situation has created a dilemma in the DPP, with reports
saying the party might be split, a situation which occurred once
before when some DPP radical members advocating Taiwan independence
left the party to establish the Taiwan Independence Party in 1996.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, asked about his new job, Chiou indicated that he will
not move to the United States to carry out his tenure because his
party cannot provide funds for the move. Instead, he said, he will be
forced to commute between Taipei and Washington.</P>
      <P>During his upcoming US visit, Chiou said, he will only tour
Washington and New York to visit US congressmen and officials dealing

      <P>"Seek common ground and agree to disagree"
is the best way for mainland China and Taiwan to break their current
impasse in ties, Premier Vincent Siew said on Monday.</P>
      <P>In a speech at a dinner hosted by heads of Taiwan businessmen
associations around mainland China, the premier urged Beijing to
shelve the issues on which the two sides are far apart, while
engaging constructively in talks on issues on which the two sides see
eye to eye.</P>
      <P>"In this way, and with patience," ties will move in a positive
direction, the premier said.</P>
      <P>He recalled the trip to Beijing last August by Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu, saying it signaled the thaw
of a three-year hiatus in ties, and touted the four-point consensus
Koo reached with his mainland China counterpart Wang Daohan,
including a promise from Wang to reciprocate Koo's trip by visiting
Taiwan within this year.</P>
      <P>In a gesture to Beijing, Siew said that Taiwan has completed its
preparations for Wang's visit and is looking forward to maintaining
the momentum started by Koo's mainland trip.</P>
      <P>Reiterating the principles he announced on Nov. 2, Siew said that
Taiwan could ease its state of alertness against Beijing, or relax
its "avoid haste, exercise restraint" policy toward mainland China
investment, and could even weigh the possibility of opening direct
postal, trade and transportation links with mainland China, so long
as Beijing respects the fact that Taiwan is governed separately and
renounces military intimidation against the island.</P>
      <P>He also vowed to stick firmly to the current policies of beefing
up exchanges with Beijing to deepen mutual understanding and dispel

    <HEADLINE>CABINET AGREES TO CONDITIONAL STOCK TRANSACTION TAX ADJUSTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of tremendous pressure from
leading business groups and legislators, the Executive Yuan on Monday
said it would allow a "reasonable adjustment" of the stock
transaction tax.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen said that the Cabinet will
seek a revision of the regulations on stock trading tax as long as
the change complies with the principle of justice and fairness.</P>
      <P>He said that the scale of the adjustment and its timing will have
to be further discussed by a task force comprised of representatives
from academic, industrial and official sectors.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement after Finance Minister Paul Chiu met
with Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng on the proposed cut for
the tax, which is currently at 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Several leading business bodies and lawmakers have vigorously
pressed for a cut in the stock trading tax in an effort to shore up
the sagging stock market, which has lost steam in the face of Asia's
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Lo Chung-chin recently proposed lowering
the tax to 0.05 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the proposed adjustment will not necessarily mean
a cut only, adding that it could also take the form of an increase.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
immediately expressed opposition to the Cabinet's plan, saying it will
only increase stock speculation and widen the government budget
deficit.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, DPP Legislative Yuan party whip Chang
Chun-hsiung said that the move once again exposes the government's
irregularities in "trying to safeguard the interests of some
privileged corporations at the expense of those of individual
investors."</P>
      <P>Chang said in order to protect these individual investors, all
the DPP lawmakers will act unanimously to boycott the passing of the
revision of the stock transaction on the legislative floor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO TIGHTEN SUPERVISION OF DEEP-SEA FISHING BOATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fisheries Administration under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture said on Tuesday it will tighten
its supervision of deep-sea fishing boats to prevent them from
illegally hiring foreign sailors.</P>
      <P>The administration made the statement after the captain of a
Kaohsiung-based tuna fishing vessel allegedly killed two mainland
Chinese crewmen last Tuesday and frightened 13 other mainland sailors
who jumped overboard.</P>
      <P>The administration said the incident, which took place on board
the Chin Ching No. 12 in the Indian Ocean some 1,000 nautical miles
northwest of Mauritius, has again exposed the problems regarding the
employment and management of foreign sailors by local deep-sea
fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-chen, head of the Fisheries Administration's deep-sea
fishing division, said the 490-ton Chin Ching No. 12 apparently
violated government regulations by hiring more non-ROC nationals onto
its crew than permitted.</P>
      <P>According to current regulations, a fishing boat weighing between
300 tons and 500 tons should employ at least six Taiwan crew members.
The Chin Ching had only hired five Taiwan crewmen, including its
captain. The 20 other crewmen included 18 mainland Chinese and two
Filipinos.</P>
      <P>Present rules also stipulate that the number of foreign sailors,
including those from mainland China, working aboard a local fishing
boat do not exceed half of its total crew members.</P>
      <P>Chen said some of the Chin Ching crew members boarded the ship
not in Taiwan, but at its overseas operational base.</P>
      <P>It is not uncommon for Taiwan-registered deep-sea fishing boats
to employ a larger proportion of foreign and mainland sailors, Chen
said, adding that this is partly because the cost of hiring foreign
and mainland crew members is cheaper than employing Taiwan nationals.
The salary for a Taiwan crewman is far higher than that of a mainland
sailor.</P>
      <P>Another reason is that the penalty for violators is too lenient,
Chen said. "The maximum fine for a ship owner who violates the
employment rule is only NT$150,000 (US$4,630)," he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan fishing boats have usually hired
mainland Chinese sailors through the mediation of shipping companies.</P>
      <P>"Many mainland crewmen do not have previous experience in fishing
operations on the open seas. Long working hours, sometimes 18 hours a
day, and heavy workloads have often led to clashes between mainland
sailors and Taiwan management aboard the ships," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the face of so many problems, Chen said, the Fisheries
Administration has decided to conduct a comprehensive review of all
existing regulations and make necessary amendments.</P>
      <P>"We will more tightly inspect the number of crewmen aboard local
deep-sea fishing boats and will impose harsher penalties on law
breakers," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chin Ching captain Kung Tai-an, 42, has been taken into custody
by Mauritius police, and the nine surviving crew members, including
four from Taiwan, three from mainland China and two from the
Philippines, have also been detained for questioning. The ship is now
docked at Mauritius' Port Louis while the fate of the 13 mainland
crewmen who jumped ship in panic last Tuesday remain unclear.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA PLANS SWEEPING TAX RATE CUT TO LURE FOREIGN INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government is planning
sweeping tax reforms aimed at reducing its tax rate to 30 percent
from the current 36 percent to attract more foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The plan was revealed by John Ralph, who chaired the Review of
Business Taxation, at a news conference on Monday. He said a 30
percent corporate tax rate would entice more foreign companies and
create more jobs especially in the service sector.</P>
      <P>Ralph said the 30 percent tax rate "is a move to encourage people
to set up businesses here, but because of that, it means you will
have less investment in fixed capital, plant and equipment."</P>
      <P>"The offset we'd be looking for is an increase in the kinds of
jobs in the service sector and areas of business that don't have high
capital costs," he noted, adding that the tax changes would
"certainly disadvantage" manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing sector was concerned rather than alarmed by the
tax changes, given that the 10 percent goods and services tax already
delivers significant advantages for capital investment.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello said the 30 percent rate would
help make Australia one of the best places to do business in Asia.</P>
      <P>The difference in the tax rate would be made up by axing special
tax breaks, particularly accelerated depreciation, saving businesses
around US$1.3 billion a year.</P>
      <P>The plan is expected to be finalized on June 30.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian companies are at the forefront
in the mining of gold in Thailand after Bangkok eased its rules to
allow foreigners to mine bullion due to the Asian financial crisis,
the Australian Financial Review said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Leading Australian companies such as BHP, CRA and Phelps Dodge &amp;
Nemont gave up mining gold in Thailand years ago because the Thai
government was reluctant to have foreign firms make away with
precious local resources.</P>
      <P>Renewed interest from gold mining companies, mainly smaller
outfits from Australia and Canada, has now found a much more
sympathetic ear from the Mineral Resources Department of Thailand.
The easing of restrictions was the result of Thailand's economic
meltdown, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Australian miners said they estimated Thailand's gold reserves
could become the second largest in Southeast Asia, trailing behind
only those in Indonesia. They said the production cost for gold
mining in Thailand is within the lower 10 percent of world gold cost
production.</P>
      <P>Australia is the world's third gold producer and exporter,
selling its bullion to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, India and other

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA TOP DESTINATION FOR INTERNATIONAL CALLS FROM ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China was again the top
destination of international telephone calls made from Taiwan in
1998, the Ministry of Transportation of Communications said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said calls from Taiwan to mainland China
totaled 240 million minutes last year, accounting for 27.4 percent of
the total amount of time spent on international calls from the
island.</P>
      <P>This was followed by calls to the United States, a total of 160
million minutes accounting for 18.8 percent; calls to Hong Kong and
Macao, a total of 76.17 million minutes, or 8.9 percent; and calls to
Japan with 75.46 million minutes, or 8.8 percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of the growth of international calls over the past
decade, the officials noted that since the opening of calls to
mainland China in June 1988, growth has been rapid, averaging 61.9
percent growth each year over the ten-year period.</P>
      <P>In 1994, calls to the mainland surpassed those to the United
States for the first time, and 1998 marked the fifth consecutive year
that the mainland has been the top destination of international calls
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But in terms of average length of calls, calls to the US topped
the list with an average of 4.7 minutes, followed by 3.3 minutes for
Japan, 3.1 minutes for the mainalnd, and 2.3 minutes for Hong Kong
and Macao.</P>
      <P>However, the officials noted that the growth of international
calls has slowed somewhat, adding that people in Taiwan made 260
million international calls last year for a total of 860 million
minutes last year, up 7.4 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, from
the previous year.</P>
      <P>The figures are well down in comparison with the average growth
rate of 16.6 percent and 18.7 percent, respectively, over the past
decade, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They also pointed out that with the rising use of fax machines
and the Internet, changes in the methods of international
communications are well worth watching.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian Defense Force Academy in
Canberra has replaced its regular exercise regime with the
traditional Chinese form of martial arts known as tai chi, the Sydney
Morning Herald reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The academy's commander, Commodore Brian Adams described tai chi
as the "thinking person exercise," and introduced it to cadets due to
its versatility in light of the changing demands of their duties.</P>
      <P>"Adaptability is a trait required of all officers in the defense
force in the 21st century as they are required to deal with a wide
range of situations, from disaster relief and peacekeeping to
potential conflict," Adams was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Officer cadets and midshipmen have been learning the art of tai
chi for the past five weeks as a part of a new program designed to
make the transition from civilian to military life smoother. They
have also received training in conflict resolution, negotiating
skills as well as equity and diversity.</P>
      <P>All 302 cadets underwent the five-week tai chi lessons, headed by
Hua Wang who doubles as a lecturer in oceanography at the academy.
And cadets can now choose whether they will continue with the
exercises, Adams said.</P>
      <P>Although there was no formal assessment of the program, staff
said they received fewer reports of injury and a lower drop-out rate
than in previous years, Adams noted.</P>

      <P>A Calgary company, eyeing mainland China's
huge consumer market, has developed a way to cram complex Chinese
characters into the memory of a cell phone, the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Zi Corp. cell phone users may program their own phone directory in
Chinese by using a set of eight basic keystrokes, and send written
messages to another phone.</P>
      <P>The developers said this was only the beginning. Their device can
also be used to write Chinese characters in other electronic
equipment.</P>
      <P>"It'll be in everything, from cameras, digital cameras to VCD
players to cell phones," the CBC quoted Wally Ritchie of Zi Corp. as
saying. "The cell phone is the starting point. It's an exciting
market -- there's 12 million cell phones shipped per year in China
today, many more than computers."</P>
      <P>The technology, which has been approved by the mainland Chinese
government, can eventually be adapted to other countries that use
Chinese characters, like Japan and Korea.</P>

      <P>Plastic vinyl intravenous bags that deliver

      <P>These medical products "are delivering their toxic additives

      <P>More than 80 percent of intravenous bags, and many bags used to
store blood products, are made of plastic vinyl chloride (PVC)
containing the additive DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), according
to Greenpeace. The softening additive is a cancer-causing agent
linked to heart, lung, liver, testicle and kidney damage, it added.</P>
      <P>However, a Health Canada spokeswoman said the cancer-causing

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Chamber of Commerce chief economist
Martin A. Regalia predicted on Monday that the US' real GDP will grow
3.1 percent in 1999 -- much slower than in previous years.</P>
      <P>"While the outlook for 1999 is not as rosy, we nevertheless
expect the economy to continue to expand," said Regalia during a
meeting of the US Chamber board of directors.</P>
      <P>Regalia attributed slower growth to global economic problems and
warned that net exports would continue to drag down growth.</P>
      <P>He forecasted that the inflation rate as measured by the
percentage change of consumer price index (CPI) will be 2.1 percent
this year, half a percent higher than that of last year.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate, which was at 28-year low of 4.5 percent
last year, will rise to 4.7 percent this year, according to the
forecast.</P>
      <P>The White House predicted in its annual "Economic Report of the
President" early this month that the GDP will grow 2.0 percent in
1999, while the CPI and unemployment rates will grow 2.3 percent and
4.8 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>"In both 1997 and 1998, strong growth in consumption and
investment offset a deteriorating trade sector, I'd expect that
pattern to hold true in 1999 as well," said Regalia.</P>
      <P>He expected consumption to slow noticeably in 1999, bottoming out
at about a 2.5 percent rate in the second half of 1999. This slower
growth, however, is strong enough to keep the economy moving forward
despite continued weakness in international trade.</P>
      <P>"The trade sector is expected to remain the weak link, as it will
take some time for Asia and Latin America to stabilize and ultimately
improve," Regalia continued.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Raymond J. Sander, who has been on the
frontlines of numerous trade negotiations with Taiwan in the past 10
years, will leave the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) on March 26
to pursue a career in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Sander, who is the AIT's director of trade and commercial
programs, told CNA he will join the New York Life Insurance Co. as
vice president for international government affairs.</P>
      <P>He joined the AIT in July 1988 after a 22-year career in the
federal service. His previous posts included being the associate
director of the management programs and budget staff at the US
Department of Justice; four years as director of the office of
management planning in the office of the Secretary of Transportation;
and eight years as the executive director of the urban mass
transportation administration.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, chief of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office (TECRO) and de facto ROC ambassador to the
United States, said his impression of Sander was that he was "very
smart." Chen noted that Sander has the rare ability to make friends
during trade negotiations with his Taiwan counterparts and maintain
US interests.</P>
      <P>John Deng, director for the economic division with TECRO, praised
Sander for his successful role as a bridge between the US and Taiwan
in trade issues over the decade.</P>
      <P>Although Sander does not read and write Chinese, he managed to
learn Chinese idioms to add more spice into his speeches delivered to
Chinese audiences.</P>
      <P>Sander would almost always watch the late night news on Taiwan
television. Although he was unable to understand every word, he took
note of what he saw and asked his TECRO friends about the news items
he was interested in the next morning</P>
      <P>Richard C. Bush, chairman and managing director of AIT, said
during a congressional reception last year, Sander was an "invaluable
treasure" the AIT had. Several former AIT chairmen, including David
N. Laux and Natale H. Bellocchi felt the same way.</P>
      <P>Sander has been involved in over 75 negotiation sessions with
Taiwan in the last 10 years. Covering the full spectrum of trade and
market liberalization issues including intellectual property
protection, banking and financial services, as well as tariffs and
trade barriers. Last February, Sander participated in the 17th-round
of WTO bilateral negotiations with Taiwan which resulted in a final
open market agreement.</P>
      <P>Sander will start his new job on March 1. The AIT's Washington,
D.C. headquarters have planned a reception in his honor for Feb. 25.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE INSURANCE FIRM APPROVED TO SET UP TAIWAN BRANCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced on
Tuesday that it has given its approval for Japan's Mitsui Marine and
Fire Insurance to set up a branch in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MOF officials said Mitsui will be the first Japanese insurance
company to set up a branch here since the opening of the domestic
insurance market to foreign companies.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance, set up
in 1918, has a capital of NT$19.5 billion (US$600 million). It
now has written premiums of about NT$168.2 billion (US$5.17 billion),
ranking it third in Japan in terms of premium income. The company's
major premium income includes voluntary automobile insurance and
savings-type fire and earthquake insurance.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the Japanese insurance company has been
in business in Asia for 50 years, and that the premium income from
the region has topped that of all other Japanese property insurance
companies. It also has businesses in America, Europe, and the Middle
East. Standard &amp; Poors gave Mitsui an AA+ rating in 1998.</P>
      <P>The officials said that after setting up its Taiwan branch,
Mitsui will help speed up the globalization of the local insurance
market, upgrade the damage investigation system in the automobile

    <HEADLINE>MOJ ASSIGNS PROSECUTOR TO HANDLE SHIPBOARD KILLINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) on Tuesday
appointed Su Wei-ta, a chief prosecutor at the Kaohsiung Prosecutor's
Office, to handle a case involving two deaths aboard a Taiwan fishing
boat.</P>
      <P>Su, who has previous experience of this type of case through
his work on the controversial Maersk Dubai case in 1996, said he will
immediately start collecting evidence relating to the alleged killing
of two mainland Chinese crewmen by the captain of the Chin Ching No.
12 on Feb. 16 when the ship was operating in the Indian Ocean some
1,000 nautical miles northwest of Mauritius.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Su said, he will travel to Mauritius to collect
first-hand information about the case, in which 13 other mainland
sailors are said to have been panicked by Captain Kung Tai-an's
shooting rampage into jumping overboard.</P>
      <P>"Even though the suspect has not yet been repatriated, I'll start
working on the case," Su said, adding that he has asked local police
authorities to furnish him with transcriptions of police interviews
with Chin Ching Fishing Co. executives for reference.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu reiterated that
the Republic of China has full jurisdiction over the case in
accordance with international law, as the incident took place aboard
a Taiwan-registered vessel and the suspect is an ROC national.</P>
      <P>Some local observers said there might be some difficulty in
obtaining the captain's repatriation, because Mauritius recognizes
Beijing, not Taipei, and because all 15 of the dead and missing
crewmen are mainland Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>A senior official at mainland China's embassy in Mauritius has
reportedly expressed Beijing's concern to Mauritius authorities over
the issue. According to local press reports, Beijing may claim
jurisdiction over the case and ask Mauritius to extradite the suspect
to the mainland for trial.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said he hopes Mauritius will handle the
case strictly in accordance with the law, and will avoid allowing
political forces to influence its decision.</P>
      <P>"We also hope the mainland authorities will fully adhere to
international regulations governing this kind of case, and understand
our determination to handle the case in a just and impartial manner,"
Hu said, adding that the ROC does not wish to become embroiled in
political wrangling over the incident.</P>
      <P>A legal affairs official with the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said the relevant government authorities should also
send a lawyer to Mauritius to study its regulations governing the
repatriation or extradition of criminal suspects.</P>
      <P>Acceding that Mauritius has the right to decide on whom to hand
over jurisdiction of the case -- Taiwan or mainland China -- the
official said Taiwan should negotiate with Mauritius, not mainland
China, for the return of the suspect for trial.</P>
      <P>According to international law, the country where a crime takes
place has priority over the right to demand extradition of the
suspect; followed by the country to which the suspect belongs; and
finally the country to which the victim belongs.</P>
      <P>"In the Chin Ching case, the ROC has priority jurisdiction
because the shooting took place on a Taiwan fishing boat, which is
seen as the ROC's floating territory," the MAC official said.</P>
      <P>Chin Ching captain Kung Tai-an, 42, has been taken into custody
by Mauritius police, and the nine surviving crew members, including
four from Taiwan, three from mainland China and two from the
Philippines, have also been detained separately for questioning. The
ship has been docked at Mauritius' Port Louis since Feb. 20 while the
fate of the 13 mainland sailors who jumped ship in panic remain
unclear.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Chin Ching Fishing Co., owner of the ship, said
two senior company executives already arrived in Port Louis on
Tuesday to handle relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>"As far as we know only the captain was involved in the case.
We hope Mauritius will allow other crewmen and our ship to leave
for home as soon as possible," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, the shipboard killings might be
related to mainland sailors' demand for pay raises and their refusal
to work in recent weeks on grounds that their contracts had expired.</P>
      <P>The 490-ton tuna fishing boat left Kaohsiung for operations in
the Indian Ocean on Feb. 20, 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAKARTA `AT FAULT' FOR DISPLACING CHINESE: INDONESIAN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Indonesia government is to be blamed
for the number of ethnic Chinese who study abroad and take up
citizenship elsewhere because of its past discriminatory practices,
Indonesian Education and Culture Minister Juwono Susarsono said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"I told President Habibie during meetings that it is basically
our fault for displacing the Chinese," he told Singapore's The
Straits Times newspaper in an interview. "It is time we recognize our
mistakes and not blame everything on the Chinese."</P>
      <P>He said that the former Suharto regime in particular pursued a
policy of imposing a 10 percent limit on Chinese entry into the
medical, engineering, science and legal studies in universities.</P>
      <P>It is not difficult to predict the response of a minority group
that is not given equal opportunities, he said.</P>
      <P>"Many went abroad to study and later resided with their families
in countries like Singapore and Australia because of the
opportunities given to them, and their children were born in these
places."</P>
      <P>He said Justice Minister Muladi had brought to Habibie's
attention the large number of Chinese Indonesians studying in
Singapore, some of whom had been called up for national service
there.</P>
      <P>A 1958 law stipulates that Indonesians will have their
citizenship revoked if they are inducted into the military of a
foreign country. Dual citizenship is also prohibited.</P>
      <P>Habibie has become concerned about the "divided loyalties" of
Indonesians, according to the newspaper, so much so that in December,
he wanted to ban Indonesians from studying abroad. He later changed
his mind.</P>
      <P>Juwono said he advised Habibie that the only way to keep
Indonesians, especially ethnic Chinese, in the country, was to
discard past discriminatory practices in the education system.</P>
      <P>Habibie has pledged to eradicate biases against ethnic Chinese,
who number between eight and 10 million in the country, but political
observers say that institutional and social discrimination is still
all-pervasive.</P>

      <P>A blueprint aimed at strengthening Taiwan's
economic system over a longer time frame will be sent to the
Executive Yuan for approval on Thursday, the head of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A detailed plan will then be released within one to three months,

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) announced on Tuesday that it has approved the sale in Taiwan of
Xeloda -- a new, orally administered tablet for treating breast
cancer.</P>
      <P>Hu Yo-fu, director of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs,
told a news conference that Xeloda is suitable for the treatment of
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancers where chemotherapy with
paclitaxel and anthracycline has failed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Xeloda is non-cytotoxic, Hu said the new will not
kill healthy cells as it destroys the malignant cancerous growth.
Nevertheless, Hu warned pregnant and lactating women not to use the
product.</P>
      <P>Xeloda, which contains capecitabine as its active ingredient,
will be available in the local market in doses of 150 mg and 500 mg.
It will be positioned alongside F-HU, another established product for
breast cancer therapy, and will be available only with a doctor's
prescription.</P>
      <P>Hu said that local distributors will be required to provide the
DOH with regular six-month reports over the next seven years
regarding any side-effects reported, either at home or abroad.</P>
      <P>The number of breast cancer patients has increased significantly
over the past decade, according to DOH tallies. Breast cancer is now
the fifth-biggest killer of women in Taiwan, and its incidence rate
ranks second.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 Taiwan women die from the disease each year, and
the number of new breast cancer victims increases by 3,000 annually.</P>
      <P>The addition of Xeloda in the arsenal of anti-cancer treatments
is expected to bring new hope to patients of locally advanced and
metastatic breast cancer, Hu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER CLARIFIES MACEDONIAN TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly forged Taipei-Skopje ties are
based on mutual agreement, but that does not mean Taipei can shrug
off Beijing's attempts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically in the
future, Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that mainland China has never ceased in its efforts to
isolate Taiwan in the international arena, Hu said the establishment
of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Macedonia was approved by
both governments, but added: "We will never start believing that our
ties will continue happily ever after without work."</P>
      <P>Hu, who had just returned from a damage-control trip to Vatican
City that morning, made the remarks after foreign wire services on
Monday reported a French "suggestion" that Macedonia maintain only
economic links with Taiwan, rather than recognize the island as an
independent state.</P>
      <P>After an investigation of the reports by the ROC Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Hu said the report has been proved "groundless."
Macedonia's decision to set up ties with Taiwan was "an act by a
sovereign country," and France did not make any official or
unofficial comment in this regard, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Skopje announced the formation of diplomatic ties on
Jan. 27, provoking a strong protest from Beijing and a threat by the
communist regime to veto the continuation of a United Nations
peacekeeping operation in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is one of the permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council with the power of veto over any security
council decisions, and the threat is considered a serious one.</P>
      <P>Hu had originally planned to visit Macedonia this month, but
postponed his departure for the Balkan state to March 1 after being
notified by the Macedonian government that his Macedonian counterpart
will be in Bulgaria until then.</P>
      <P>In addition to media reporters, a delegation composed of
government trade officials and representatives of state-run
enterprises will accompany Hu on his visit to Macedonia to seek
business and investment opportunities in the southeastern European
country.</P>
      <P>The leader of the delegation, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin
Yi-fu, said bilateral Taiwan-Macedonia trade remains limited. In
1998, Taiwan exports to Macedonia totaled US$1.86 million, while
imports from that country were just US$593,000.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Macedonia's investment climate will be suitable
for Taiwan's textile and machinery sectors to set up footholds there.</P>
      <P>Apart from building a distribution warehouse in Macedonia, an
economic cooperative package worked out by the ROC government also
suggests that Taiwan businesses increase their purchases of raw
materials and liquor from there.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada ordered Tuesday a review of the government's efforts to reach
a peaceful settlement with the Communist Party of the
Philippines-National Democratic Front (CPP-NDF) to ascertain if the
negotiations "are still in keeping with our national interests."</P>
      <P>The president told the Cabinet Committee on the Peace Process
headed by Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora and the government peace
panel dealing with the CPP-NDF under Ambassador Howard Dee to
re-evaluate the negotiations in the wake of a series of terrorist
acts perpetrated by leftist rebels.</P>
      <P>The chief executive was referring to the abduction by the New
People's Army (NPA) of Gen. Victor Obillio, commander of the 55th
Engineering Brigade, and his aide, Capt. Eduardo Montealto, in Davao
City, followed by the kidnapping of Chief Police Inspector Roberto
Bernal of the Philippine National Police in Sorsogon.</P>
      <P>Estrada said the government has been faithfully executing
confidence-building measures to end more than 30 years of bloody
confrontation with communist rebels. The NDF, however, has yet to
prove its sincerity.</P>
      <P>"These acts of the communist rebels are simply unacceptable,"
Estrada said. "The abduction of non-combatant military officers and a
police officer, who was trying to go after a wanted person in the
area, is contrary to the goals of the peace process."</P>
      <P>"We have yet to see the NDF prove their sincerity. While we are
initiating confidence-building measures, the NDF-NPA have been doing
the exact opposite," the chief executive said.</P>
      <P>In response to an NDF request, he said, his administration has
been reviewing the cases of jailed members of the NPA, the armed wing
of the CPP-NDF.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said the government has extended safe conduct passes
to NPA leaders so they could resurface and consult with their cadres.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's consumer price index in
January 1999 rose 0.4 percent compared with the previous month.</P>
      <P>Food prices rose 1.1 percent mainly because of dearer leafy
vegetables and seafood. The cost of transport and communication edged
up by 0.3 percent because of higher car prices, while clothing prices
rose 0.4 percent and the nation's education index, 1.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The cost of housing and the price of miscellaneous items fell 0.5
percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, while the cost of health care
remained unchanged from its December 1998 level.</P>
      <P>Compared to the same month a year ago, the consumer price index
in January 1999 fell by half a percent, the eighth consecutive
monthly decline.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index is the most widely used indicator of
inflation for consumption expenditures. It measures the average
change in prices over time on a fixed basket of goods and services
commonly consumed by households.</P>
      <P>The basket of goods and services is deliberately kept fixed so
that changes in the index reflect only price changes uninfluenced by
changes in the types of goods and services purchased.</P>
      <P>This series is based on the fixed basket as determined in the
Household Expenditure Survey conducted from October 1992 to September
1993. The average price during this period is taken to be 100 index
points against which indexes of subsequent periods are compared to
measure price changes. The index is compiled monthly.</P>

      <P>Secretary Domingo Siazon Jr. of the Department of Foreign Affairs

      <P>"The issue has to be discussed because it relates to political

political and security conditions also in Europe," Siazon said in an

      <P>He added that while delegates to the meeting may not refer
directly to the territorial dispute between the Philippines and
mainland China, there may be other ways to refer to the issue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Anger by Taiwan's main opposition party
over the Cabinet's support for a reduction in Taiwan's stock
transaction tax is swelling, as the Democratic Progress Party (DPP)
threatened on Tuesday to sponsor a no-confidence vote against Premier
Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Tsai Min-hsian, the DPP's whip in the Legislative Yuan, said his
party will propose a no-confidence vote if Siew does not explain to
the DPP's satisfaction why his Cabinet now endorses the tax
reduction, which it opposed until recently.</P>
      <P>Siew had been opposed to the tax's reduction or elimination,
which some business leaders had proposed. On Monday, however, he
agreed to set up a panel to mull the possibility of lowering Taiwan's
stock transaction tax.</P>
      <P>The DPP has vowed to boycott any attempt by the legislature to
approve the measure, but the party's ability to influence the
legislature's actions is limited, as it has only 70 seats in the
225-seat body.</P>
      <P>Citing Siew's fierce opposition to the idea during an economic
conference last week, Tsai said Siew's about-face demonstrates his
vulnerability to pressure from business magnates. It has also cost
him the DPP's trust and will spell his doom as premier, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus among legislators familiar with economic
issues that the proposed reduction is not a guaranteed bourse
booster, and that is why the opposition has reservations about the
measure, said Tsai.</P>
      <P>If the ruling Kuomintang tries to railroad the proposal through
the legislature, the DPP will do its utmost to block it, and it will
appeal to the public and to scholars for support, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin Chung-cheng, a DPP member and legislator at large, likened
the proposed reduction to short-term stimulants that become addictive
over time. Moreover, the benefits brought by the reduction would be
wiped out by further financial turmoil, either at home or abroad, he
said.</P>
      <P>Blaming the stock market's plunge over the past several months on
the collapse of Taiwan's real estate market, Lin said tumbling
property prices increased the number of bad loans by banks and led to
a credit crunch that deprived companies of access to cash and
triggered the current crisis.</P>
      <P>The bourse, as a secondary market, has no direct impact on
economic development, said Lin. Instead of pulling out all the stops
to shore up stock prices, the government should boost consumption,
improve Taiwan's investment environment and prod banks to offer
businesses reasonable credit, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO CHANGE AT PRESENT ON TAIPEI-VATICAN RELATIONS: HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While explaining on Tuesday the state of
relations between Taiwan and the Vatican, Foreign Minister Jason Hu
sighed, noting that although no changes are expected at the present
time, he cannot guarantee that relations will never change.</P>
      <P>Hu made the statement at a Taipei press conference after
returning from a Feb. 12-23 visit to Jordan and the Vatican. While in
Jordan he extended condolence to the Jordan government over the death
of King Hussein Bin Talal.</P>
      <P>Speaking on his visit to the Holy See, Hu said he made clear to
Vatican authorities that while Taiwan supports the promotion of
religious freedom in mainland China, it does not want efforts to that
end to harm relations between the Vatican and the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes the Vatican will remain mindful of Beijing's
hostility toward Taiwan and that it will not "neglect the one sheep
at home while searching for the 30 or 40 lost sheep," Hu said.</P>
      <P>He said it is understandable that the Holy See is concerned above
the well-being of mainland China's estimated 11 million Catholics,
but he noted that there are also 300,000 Catholics in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister told reporters that the Vatican and mainland
China could forge relations only if the mainland were to grant its
people greater religious freedom and relax its control over church
affairs or if the Vatican were to abandon its push for greater
religious freedom for the people of mainland China.</P>
      <P>While there are currently no signs either event is likely to
happen, Hu said he cannot predict whether the situation will change
in the future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cannot unilaterally dictate its fate with regard to the
Vatican, he said. All Taiwan can do is to strengthen communications
with the Catholic Church and try to help them better understand the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"We need the Holy See to know that the democracy, freedom and
human rights that the Republic of China has been sparing no efforts
to promote and defend are not different from the religious freedom
and democracy the Vatican is trying to introduce to mainland China,"
Hu said.</P>

      <P>Two Taiwan officials were named winners of
the 1998 Beresshit Prizes by a group of Italian journalists last
week.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative to Rome, Joe Hung, was
honored for his achievements as a diplomat, while the deputy director
for public affairs at the Presidential Office, Ting Yuan-chao, was
noted for his contributions to journalism.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony on Feb. 20, Mario Ciotti, president of "Journalist
Without Boundaries," the group that administered the prizes,
complimented Hung on his efforts to consolidate ties between Taipei
and Rome over the last five years, despite the absence of formal
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ting was praised by Ciotti for his performance on job and for the
two books he wrote on ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Ciotti said Ting's works help shaped Taiwan's image in the West,
helping to clear away some of the outdated stereotypes about Taiwan
portrayed in the Western press.</P>
      <P>Describing the award as a great honor, Hung vowed at the awards
ceremony to work to continue improving ties between Italy and the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Ting, who was absent from the ceremony, will be presented with

      <P>Beijing's envoy to the United Nations on
Tuesday said mainland China opposes the six-month extension of a UN
peacekeeping mission in Macedonia, according to diplomatic sources.</P>
      <P>In closed-door discussions by the UN Security Council, mainland
Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun spelled out Beijing's opposition,
saying the UN force had already accomplished its mission.</P>
      <P>Of the 15 nations taking part in the discussions, mainland China
was alone in opposing the extension. Qin mentioned no connection
between Beijing's stance on the issue and Macedonia's recent
establishment of formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of
China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu and his Macedonian counterpart,
Aleksandar Dimitrov, signed a joint communique in Taipei on Jan. 27
that established full diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Macedonia, which achieved independence from the former Yugoslavia
in 1991, became the second European state to have diplomatic ties
with the Republic of China, after the Vatican.</P>

said the Security Council will continue to discuss on Wednesday the

Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>The 1,049-member UN peacekeeping force was deployed in Macedonia
in 1995 to monitor borders and deter the spread of fighting to

    <HEADLINE>MOFA KEEPING CLOSE WATCH ON DEVELOPMENT IN UN FORCE IN MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Wednesday it will keep close watch on the development of a
proposal to extend the mandate for UN peacekeeping force in
Macedonia.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu made the statement after mainland China
said on Tuesday it opposed plans for a further six-month extension
of the UN Preventive Deployment Force, known as UNPREDEP, in the
former Yugoslav republic.</P>
      <P>"We have taken note of mainland Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun's
comments made during a UN Security Council (UNSC) closed-door meeting
on the UNPREDEP mandate issue," Wu said.</P>
      <P>As the UNSC will continue to discuss the issue in the next two
days, Wu said the MOFA will closely monitor follow-up developments
concerning the mandate extension proposal.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MOFA has collected information about the full text of
Qin's speech and general reactions to his remarks through proper
channels.</P>
      <P>Macedonia forged formal diplomatic ties with the Republic of
China last month, making it the ROC's second ally in Europe. The
other European state which recognizes the ROC is the Vatican.</P>
      <P>"We attach great importance to our newly won diplomatic ally. We
treasure our friendship with Macedonia and are highly concerned
about its national security, well-being and stability in the
region," Wu said.</P>
      <P>UN Secretary-General Kofi Anna recommended last week that the
UNPREDEP in Macedonia be extended until Aug. 31. The UNSC must vote
this week to renew the UNPREDEP mandate which expires on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 1,100-member force includes about 360 troops from the United
States, 640 from Scandinavia and about 50 from Indonesia. It was
originally deployed to monitor borders and deter the spread of
fighting to Macedonia from Bosnia. It is also monitoring a UN embargo
against Yugoslavia, including Kosovo province where ethnic Albanians
are battling Serbian security forces. Macedonia also provides
logistical support for European civilian monitors in Kosovo, and is a
base for NATO operations in the region.</P>
      <P>Mainland China severed diplomatic relations with Macedonia
because of the Balkan country's new ties to the ROC. It remains
unclear whether mainland China, a UNSC permanent member, would
use its veto to kill the UN peacekeeping mission in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Beijing exercised its first veto in nearly 25 years in January
1997 against 155 military observers to monitor peace accords in
Guatemala, which has maintained diplomatic ties with Taiwan as do
several other Central American and Caribbean nations. Beijing
reversed its decision two weeks later, with diplomats presuming
Guatemala had promised not to back UN membership for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Previously, mainland China also twice threatened to veto UN
troops in Haiti for the same reason. The move forced the UNSC to
change the name of the Haiti mission and then have the United States
and Canada pay for the troops.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>American hardware makers on Tuesday
said their Taiwan counterparts are the second-toughest competitors in
the world, after those from mainland China.</P>
      <P>In a world market survey report, the American Hardware
Manufacturers Association (AHMA) said hardware manufacturers from
mainland China are the toughest competitors, followed in order by
those from Taiwan, Germany, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Delegates from the AHMA, which comprises 1,100 American hardware
manufacturers, presented the report during a hearing sponsored by the
federal International Trade Commission on the impact of mainland
China's joining the World Trade Organization on US industries.</P>
      <P>The AHMA survey looked at 10 types of hardware, including
building materials, manual and electrical tools and kitchen utensils.
On a ratings scale in which higher numbers indicated greater
competitive threats, mainland China received a rating of 67.1, while
Taiwan was assigned a rating of 51.2 and Germany, 23.2.</P>
      <P>For American hardware manufacturers, the greatest competitive
threats come from mainland China and Taiwan.</P>

Brazil, Canada, Germany and mainland China, according to the same

products bought a total of US$1.53 billion worth in 1998, down 22.2

    <HEADLINE>EXPORT MONITORING SYSTEM ACTIVELY HELPS CRACK DOWN ON PIRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Export Monitoring System (EMS), a
newly established center that monitors Taiwan's computer software
exports in an attempt to stem product piracy, is speeding up its
monitoring operations to curb infringements on intellectual property
rights (IPR), a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Devised by the Directorate General of Customs through the
concerted efforts of the ministries of finance and economic affairs
and the Institute for Information Industry, the EMS identified
between August 1998 and January 1999 131 products suspected of having
violated IPR laws.</P>
      <P>Of that number, however, only one was found to be a pirated
product, said Lin Tsan-huei, deputy executive secretary of the
Intellectual Property Office, MOEA.</P>
      <P>Established last Jan. 26, the office oversees Taiwan's efforts to
protect intellectual property and to crack down on piracy.</P>
      <P>According to the US Department of Treasury, the US Customs
Service seized US$8.61 million worth of pirated products from Taiwan
in 1998, up 44.5 percent from year-earlier levels. According to that
figure, Taiwan was the second-largest source of pirated products to
the United States last year. Most of the goods were computers and
their peripherals and components.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the latest report, Lin said that cracking down on
piracy is a painstakingly long-term project. Even in industrially
advanced countries such as the United States and Japan, piracy has
not been eliminated.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies from the Intentional Intellectual Property
Alliance Lin noted that about 27 percent of the computer software
used in the United States is pirated, compared with 40 percent in
Japan and 60 percent in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's effort to stem such piracy, Lin said, "Better
late than never," adding that the EMS is effectively doing its job
and will speed up its monitoring operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US GOVERNMENT REJECTS HUGHES' SATELLITE EXPORT REQUEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration has decided
to reject a request by Hughes Electronics Corp. to sell a
communications satellite to Beijing, saying that the transaction
poses a threat to national security because the technology could be
used by the People's Liberation Army, Tuesday's Los Angeles Times
cited a US government official as saying.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that the rejection of the export request by
Hughes is the first such rejection since the recent eruption of a
controversy over technology transfers to mainland China.</P>
      <P>In interagency consultations, officials of the State Department,
Pentagon and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency opposed the
sale, while the Commerce Department alone favored it, according to
The Los Angeles Times.</P>
      <P>Hughes officials had told the State Department that the potential
financial loss to the company and impact on its work force would be
substantial if the license application was rejected.</P>
      <P>For years, the administration has promoted sales of commercial
satellites to Beijing and other nations. But in recent months, it has
faced criticism that the sales could aid mainland China's military
and improve Beijing's missile-launching capabilities.</P>
      <P>The US$450-million satellite Hughes seeks to export is intended
to help expand badly needed civilian communications capacity in
mainland China and 20 other East Asian countries. But the craft's
sophisticated 40-foot-long antenna would make it useful for military
purposes, the report noted.</P>
      <P>For example, the satellite could facilitate communications
between military units on the ground. It also could be used for
electronic eavesdropping, according to Henry Sokolski, a former Bush
administration defense official who is now with the Nonproliferation
Policy Education Center in Washington.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>About eight months after an unprecedented
election victory in state elections, Australia's One Nation Party is
disintegrating after five members of the Queensland Parliament
resigned from the party.</P>
      <P>The latest resignations have reduced the number of party members
in the state parliament to five from 11 in June 1998.</P>
      <P>Criticizing One Nation as undemocratic, the five said the party
is controlled only by its president, Pauline Hanson, and her two
senior advisers -- David Oldfield and David Ettridge.</P>
      <P>The party has been regarded by many as anti-Asian,
anti-immigration and anti-Aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>In her maiden speech in September 1996 after being elected to the
House of Representatives, Hanson captured the attention of the nation
by declaring that "Australia is in danger of being swarmed by
Asians." Her remarks sparked a nationwide debate on racism.</P>
      <P>Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said One Nation should lose its
status as a recognized political party because it does not contain
enough members of parliament to qualify as one.</P>
      <P>Hanson on Tuesday denied the defections would damage her party in
elections in New South Wales (NSW) on March 27.</P>
      <P>"People in NSW are not concerned about what's happening in
Queensland. They are concerned about what's happening here," she told
reporters during a campaign stop in western NSW.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE TOURISM INDUSTRY DOWN IN 1998, BUT REBOUND EXPECTED THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's tourism industry was hit by
the Asian financial crisis in calendar 1998 with a decline in visits
by foreign tourists and losses in revenue, but a turnaround will be
seen in 1999, the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to CNA, ATC Managing Director John Morse
said preliminary figures show the total number of foreign tourist
arrivals in Australia was down 3.7 percent in 1998 from 1997 levels.</P>
      <P>Revenue losses, meanwhile, amounted to about US$430 million in
1998.</P>
      <P>But the 3.7 percent decline in the number of inbound tourists in
1998 was still better than the 7.1 percent drop predicted by earlier
forecasts, he said.</P>
      <P>"The forecasters predicted a decline in overall numbers of around
7 percent in 1998. Today's figures indicate the reality was
considerably better, with a decline of just 3.7 percent," Morse said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the lower-than-expected decline to strong gains in
the arrivals of tourists from the Americas, Europe and New Zealand,
which together offset the decline from major markets in Asia,
including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia
and Thailand.</P>
      <P>He said another factor contributing to the lower decline was the
depreciation of the Australian dollar, which made Australia more
attractive and competitive as a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>Tourist arrivals from Taiwan fell about 2 percent in calendar
1998 from 1997, according to the ATC.</P>
      <P>In December, however, 10,800 Taiwanese tourists went to
Australia, up 5.7 percent from the same 1997 month.</P>
      <P>In all Australia attracted 4.32 million foreign tourists in
calendar 1998.</P>
      <P>Federal Tourism Minister Jackei Kelly said the overall drop of
3.7 percent in the flow of inbound tourists in 1998 was "minuscule"
and contrary to predictions of a massive downturn off the back of the
Asian economic collapse.</P>
      <P>"Last year was always going to be the year which broke the
pattern of record growth rates and in the circumstances the results
are a commendable achievement," she said.</P>
      <P>Both Morse and Kelly were optimistic about a tourism turnaround
in 1999.</P>
      <P>"While I am confident we will return to around 5 percent growth
this year, the most important issue for the industry will be
preparing for the enormous opportunities available to us in 2000,"
Morse said.</P>
      <P>He said growth in 2000 could range from 5 percent to 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Tourism industry promoters expect more visitors from Taiwan and
Hong Kong after the two areas are included in an electronic travel
authority agreement that facilitates entry into Australia. The
service will be extended to the two regions starting July 1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHIPBOARD KILLINGS SHOULD NOT AFFECT CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government hopes the recent
shooting deaths of two mainland Chinese crewmen allegedly by the
captain of a Taiwan deep-sea fishing boat will not affect relations
across the Taiwan Strait, a senior official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Johnnason Liu, director of the Legal Affairs Department under the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's
policy toward mainland China, was responding to reports that the
skipper of the Kaohsiung-based Chin Ching No. 12 tuna fishing boat
killed two mainland sailors on Feb. 16 while the ship was in the
Indian Ocean some 1,000 nautical miles northwest of Mauritius.</P>
      <P>Liu said relevant ROC government agencies, including the Ministry
of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Council of
Agriculture (COA), are actively handling the case in which 13 other
mainland sailors were said to have jumped overboard in panic
amid the shootings.</P>
      <P>"We are determined to handle the tragic incident in a just and
impartial manner, and we are hopeful that the case will be dealt with
strictly in accordance with the law to minimize its possible
adverse effect," Liu said, adding: "Only by so doing can the rights
and interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait be fully
protected and cross-strait relations not be affected."</P>
      <P>Fishery officials said in the past, key suspects involved in
similar criminal cases which occurred aboard Taiwan-owned fishing
boats, regardless of their nationalities, had all been repatriated to
Taiwan to stand trial.</P>
      <P>"We hope Mauritius will repatriate the sole suspect in the Chin
Ching case to Taiwan for trial as soon as possible since the killings
took place in open seas aboard a Taiwan fishing vessel, which is
considered our floating territory," said a COA official.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a senior executive with the Kaohsiung-based Chin Ching
Fishery Co. -- owner of the 490-ton tuna fishing vessel -- said
skipper Kung Tai-an, 42, has confessed to the shootings and promised
to assume full responsibility for the incident.</P>
      <P>Chin Ching Co. manager Wang Ming-chi said two company executives
have arrived in Mauritius and met with Kung as well as seven other
surviving crewmen who have been detained by Mauritius police for
questioning since the ship arrived at Port Louis on Feb. 20 after the
incident.</P>
      <P>"Kung admitted that he had gunned down the two (mutineering)
mainland crewmen. He also said he is sorry for all the trouble he has
caused to the company and will take full responsibility for the
incident," Wang said, quoting a report from Mauritius by the
company's two executives there.</P>
      <P>Wang said the company's agent in Mauritius has helped employ a
prestigious lawyer to assist in handling the case.</P>
      <P>As there is still 50-plus tons of tuna aboard the Chin Ching No.
12, Wang said the company's local agent and lawyer are negotiating
with Mauritius authorities for an early release of three Taiwan
crewmen to take care of the catch.</P>
      <P>"We will also do our best to seek an early repatriation of the
skipper for trial and the return of our vessel," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang would not speculate on the fate of the 13 missing mainland
crewmen, but he said the sailors had not used a lifeboat when they
jumped ship. Despite strenuous search and rescue efforts launched by
Mauritius authorities in the past few days, the whereabouts of the 13
mainland crewmen remain unknown.</P>
      <P>The two mainland sailors killed in the incident were identified
as Li Xingzheng and Yang Yong. Local press reports said the cause of
the shootings may have been related to the victims' demands for pay
raises and their refusal to work in recent weeks as their contracts
had expired.</P>
      <P>The boat left Kaohsiung for the Indian Ocean on Feb. 20, 1996. It
originally had 25 crew members, including the skipper. Nine sailors
survived the incident, including four from Taiwan, three from
mainland China and two from the Philippines. One Taiwan sailor
remains in hospital after sustaining injuries to his left arm during
the melee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF COUNTERFEIT GOODS: US CUSTOMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was listed as the US' second
largest source of counterfeit goods in fiscal 1998, behind only
mainland China, according to statistics released Monday by US Customs
officials.</P>
      <P>The figures showed that the value of forged products seized from
Taiwan by US Customs reached US$8.61 million last year, up 40 percent
from the previous year. Authorities made 250 seizures of Taiwan
products involved in violations of intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Timing for the news is sensitive for Taiwan as the US Trade
Representative Office will release its annual "Special 301 Watch
List" on April 30, meanwhile, the island is working to be removed
from the "black list."</P>
      <P>Customs officials said in the 1998 fiscal year, which ended last
September, authorities cracked down on 3,400 foreign counterfeiting
cases and seized US$75.89 billion worth of illicit goods. The figure
grew by 75.5 percent and 40.2 percent, respectively, against the
levels of the previous fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Of those items seized from Taiwan, computers as well as computer
parts and components comprised the lion's share, valued at US$4.86
million and accounting for 56 percent of the total in fiscal 1998. In
fiscal 1997, the most popular forged items were cellular phones and
their parts and components, Customs authorities said.</P>
      <P>Counterfeit electrical fans, lamps and lamp-related goods, and
other electronic appliances, with a value of US$1.74 million, were
the second most popular counterfeit products from Taiwan shipped to
the US, followed by cellular phones and their parts and components.</P>
      <P>Mainland China was the US' largest source of counterfeit goods.
Some US$28.95 million worth of forged products from the mainland were
seized in fiscal 1998, according to the customs statistics.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong and South Korea ranked behind the mainland and Taiwan,
the tallies showed, while India rounded off the top five countries.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that the number of Taiwan counterfeit goods
surged despite efforts to stem such activity, an economics official
from Taipei's representative office in the United States said they
will put more effort into studying the cause and cooperate with US
authorities in the battle against illegal business activities.</P>

(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US President Jimmy Carter and
his wife Rosalynn are scheduled to visit Taiwan in late March, a
charity organization founded by the former president announced on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Carter Center, based in Atlanta, Georgia, said Carter will
speak at Taipei's Institute for National Policy Research about his
non-profit center and the challenge of bridging the gap between rich
and poor in the next century.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Carter Center said in a news release, the
Carters "have been invited to make an unofficial, courtesy call on
President Lee Teng-hui."</P>
      <P>In Washington, ROC officials and US observers welcomed the visit
as a "friendly gesture" to Taiwan from the president who broke off
official US relations with the country in favor of Beijing 20 years
ago.</P>
      <P>James Lilley, former director of American Institute in Taiwan,
said Carter has always been a champion of human rights and democracy
and these are Taiwan's "trump cards."</P>
      <P>Stephen S. F. Chen, the ROC representative to the United States,
said the Republic of China is "a real McCoy" when it comes to
democracy, human rights and the distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should welcome visitors from all foreign countries
and should not fear being compared with other places, much less
mainland China.</P>
      <P>AIT Chairman Richard Bush also said that it is a good thing for
Carter to visit "one of East Asia's most successful democracies."</P>
      <P>After he left office in 1981, Carter won much respect and
admiration for his work in promoting peace, democracy and better
livelihood for people in such countries as Haiti and several African
nations.</P>
      <P>The Carters will arrive in Taiwan on March 29 for a three-day
visit after a week of building homes as volunteers for Habitat for

    <HEADLINE>SUHARTO'S SON LIKELY TO FACE GRAFT CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The flamboyant youngest son of former
Indonesian President Suharto is one step closer to facing corruption
charges in a multi-million dollar land scam, The Straits Times
reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Attorney-General's Office in Jakarta has transferred the
dossier of Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Purtra to the prosecutor's office
which has a week to look into the case before making a recommendation
on whether to begin trial proceedings.</P>
      <P>"The dossiers of the suspects have been submitted to the
prosecutor," said Antonious Sujata from the Attorney-General's
Office. "If the dossiers are deemed complete, the case will
immediately be transferred to the court."</P>
      <P>Hutomo, who was prohibited from leaving the country after he was
declared a suspect in the case, is believed to be involved in a scam
surrounding a 1997 real estate deal between the National Logistics
Agency (Bulog) and a private company, Goro.</P>
      <P>The deal allowed Goro, which is 40 percent owned by Hutomo and
businessman Ricardo Gelael, to build a retail center on land in an
affluent residential area in North Jakarta owned by Bulog. But Goro
failed to keep its side of the bargain, which was to give 63 hectares
of land to the agency. This resulted in an estimated loss of 52.5
billion rupiah (US$6.39 million) to the government.</P>
      <P>Political observers in Jakarta said if Hutomo, who at one point
refused to obey a summons by the attorney-general, is charged and
convicted he may face a maximum of 20 years in jail. Some, however,
speculate that the government's latest initiative is an attempt "to
show the public it is sincere in its efforts to act against the
Suharto family" in the wake of a potentially damning telephone
conversation between President B.J. Habibie and Attorney-General Andi
Muhammad Ghalib.</P>
      <P>Hutomo, who has a playboy reputation and one of the highest
profiles among Suharto's six children, is the first in the family to
come close to be being charged. His elder sister Siti "Tutut"
Hadiyanti Rukmana and brother Bambang Trihatmodjo are also facing
investigations into their business activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STOCK TRANSACTION TAX ISSUE LIKELY TO REACH CONSENSUS THURSDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of slashing Taiwan's stock
transaction tax rate will likely reach a consensus within the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) during a party-sponsored seminar on Thursday,
according to informed legislative sources.</P>
      <P>To date, there are two proposals for the flexible adjustment
measures of the stock transaction tax rate -- zero to 0.6 percent and
zero to 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>As business leaders have been in favor of cutting the transaction
tax rate to provide incentives and to boost investor confidence, the
approval of a zero to 0.6 percent flexible adjustment measure seems
unlikely, said the sources, adding that an option of zero to 0.3
percent flexible tax rate will most likely be approved.</P>
      <P>Although Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng declined to make any
comment on that possibility, he stressed that the tax reduction
measure is simply a kind of stimulant with an ultimate goal of
attracting capital back to the financial market so a healthy
operation of industries can be maintained.</P>
      <P>Wang also clarified that the flexible adjustment tax rate
measures was his idea rather than that of the legislature.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's KMT Central Standing Committee meeting, party
Chairman Lee Teng-hui expressed confidence in Taiwan's economic
prospects, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>In the face of an economic crisis, Taiwan should develop its own
way to handle it, Lee was cited as saying. In addition to the
transaction tax cut, there will be many other measures to tackle
Taiwan's economic problems, added Lee.</P>
      <P>Wang emphasized that in view of the troubles Taiwan has been
experiencing, an attempt to boost people's confidence in Taiwan's
economic performance is justified. This will keep Taiwan's banking
system from being dragged down by a poor financial market, he further
indicated.</P>

familiar with Liu's family said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"It all depends on Liu himself whether he will come back or not.
His family here has no way to control his itinerary," the sources

      <P>Liu, a ruling Kuomintang legislator and former speaker of the

denied that Premier Vincent Siew had filed his resignation amid
debate over the lowering of the securities transaction tax.</P>

      <P>KMT Central Standing Committee members discussed the current

of lowering the securities transaction tax.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, who is also KMT chairman, reiterated his

merely an issue of lowering the tax, but the securities transaction
tax should also be flexibly adjusted according to the external

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, the new representative to
the United States from Taiwan's largest opposition party, assumed his
post here on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
representative office in Washington, D.C. held a cocktail reception
at the US National Press Club to celebrate Chiou's inauguration.</P>
      <P>Among the well-wishers were Stephen Chen, ROC representative to
the United States, and Richard Bush, chairman of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) which is authorized by the US government to
handle relations with Taiwan in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Chen said the Republic of China is now
a mature democracy. "Our government is pleased to see any political
party set up a representative office in the United States under our
constitutional framework," he noted.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC ambassador to the United States went on to say
that although he and Chiou may have different opinions on some
issues, he looks forward to maintaining close contact with Chiou and
cooperating with him to promote ROC-US relations.</P>
      <P>Bush said the AIT hopes to develop extensive contact with
Taiwan's various political parties. "We welcome Chiou's arrival and
hope to maintain regular contact with him," he added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chiou said his priority is to understand
Washington's political operations and its attitudes toward Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chiou's predecessor Parris Chang said the DPP's representative
office is aimed at promoting mutual understanding between Taiwan and
the United States.</P>
      <P>"Since its establishment in April 1995, the DPP office has scored
achievements in three fields -- expressing our party's views on major
issues related to Taiwan, forging contacts with the US executive
branch, Congress, media and think tanks, and clarifying US
misunderstanding about the DPP," said Chang, who is an incumbent ROC
legislator representing overseas Chinese community.</P>
      <P>Chang, a scholar-turned-politician, said he hopes the American
friends he has made during his tenure will offer their support to
Chiou.</P>
      <P>Other prominent guests at the cocktail included former AIT
Chairman Natale Bellocchi and former US Ambassador to mainland China
James Lilley.</P>
      <P>Chiou, a former DPP secretary-general, recently arrived in
Washington. While here, he will meet with researchers at major US
think tanks. He will also visit New York before returning to Taiwan

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China
is committed to sustaining and protecting its accomplishments in
political democratization, economic development and social
modernization, ROC Representative to the United States Stephen Chen
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the Center for National Policy, a Washington-based
think tank, Chen also noted that on the eve of the new century, the
peoples of the United States and Taiwan can look ahead to cooperation
in almost every field of human endeavor and the cause of universal
peace, progress, and freedom for mankind in the face of daunting
challenges in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hoped that all the participants could comprehend the
sincerity and merit of Taiwan's appeal for justice and understanding,
saying the people of Taiwan "ask only for the same considerations
enjoyed by all people the world over. In the process, they do not
wish to antagonize or complicate life for anyone else.</P>
      <P>"Simply allow us the same opportunity to work for justice,
democracy, human rights, and peace along with others, and give us the
chance to participate energetically in the (Asia-Pacific) region's
economic recovery and prosperity. We ask no more, and we could ask no
less," said the senior ROC diplomat.</P>
      <P>After speaking on Taiwan's democratic development and economic
dynamism, Chen told the audience that given their positive
experiences of the past half-century, the people of Taiwan face the
three-fold challenges ahead "with optimism and a sense of historic
destiny."</P>
      <P>First, the ROC government has a responsibility to consolidate and
extend the achievements of the past two generations, while moving
forward confidently toward new levels of prosperity and fulfillment
for its people. "The people's right to enjoy peace, security,
freedom, justice, and a comfortable standard of living must be
defended and strengthened against all odds," he said.</P>
      <P>Second, Taiwan must continue the task of improving its relations
with mainland China. No one knows exactly when conditions will be
ripe for political reunification, he said, but until they are, "we
are committed to achieving better understanding and cooperation with
our compatriots on the mainland."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he stressed, China's reunification will not be
achieved overnight, or by force. In fact, until the free and
democratic people of Taiwan see the benefits of unification with the
mainland, they will not support it. Therefore, he said, "both sides
need to work toward reunification through a peaceful, evolutionary,
and cooperative process in the new century."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's third challenge will be to enhance the international
identity and role of the 22 million people of Taiwan, based upon the
economic stature and solid democratic system they have built.</P>
      <P>For now, Chen said, "there are obviously two equal parts of a
divided China under separate rule, with very different social and
political systems." Thus, until reunification is realized, both
peoples are entitled to separate and equal representation in the
international community and in international organizations.</P>
      <P>He went on: "Our people expect and deserve no less, and we ask
only that Washington continues to observe its longtime practice of
`parallel engagement' with both parts of divided China, rather than
leaving Taiwan isolated or `in the dark.'"</P>
      <P>Taiwan abandoned the "zero-sum game" approach to the China issue
long ago, Chen said, and the world should adhere to the same
pragmatic reality.</P>
      <P>"Why anyone would intentionally reject or exclude Taiwan's
valuable resources, talents, and willing cooperation on matters
affecting stability, prosperity, and democracy in the Asia-Pacific
region is beyond rational understanding. It accomplishes nothing at
all," said Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>US-based Compaq was one of several foreign
computer giants awarded on Wednesday for purchasing large quantities
of computers, computer parts and components in Taiwan in 1998.</P>
      <P>In presenting the awards, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang noted that foreign information technology (IT)
manufacturers have a high regard for Taiwan's IT industry and have in
recent years set up their own semiconductor research and development
centers, operation centers, distribution centers and PC research
centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the prospects of Taiwan's IT industry, Wang said the ministry
will continue to push for Taiwan to become the world procurement
center of parts and components, and promote strategic cooperation
relations between local high-tech companies and their foreign
counterparts.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Compaq's international procurement offices (IPO)
in Taiwan topped the purchases by other foreign computer firms by
more than US$5 billion in 1998, while IBM, Dell, HP purchased between
US$1.5 billion and US$2.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Despite the current international economic downturn, the US and

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday refuted mainland China's allegation that
Taiwan is an obstacle to its relations with the Vatican.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to foreign wire service reports which
quoted mainland China's Foreign Ministry spokesman as alleging that
the Vatican's diplomatic relationship with the ROC is a major
obstacle to the improvement of Vatican-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said mainland China's accusation was a
distortion of the facts.</P>
      <P>"The greatest hindrance to the development of Beijing-Vatican
ties lies in mainland China's lack of religious freedom, and has
nothing to do with Taiwan or its relations with the Vatican," Wu
stressed.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, mainland China's
Foreign Ministry spokesman also criticized ROC Foreign Minister Jason
Hu's recent visit to the Vatican.</P>
      <P>Wu said the mainland spokesman's criticism represented an
interference in the Vatican's internal affairs. As mainland China has
no diplomatic ties with the Vatican, Wu said, it is not in a position
to make any comment on the Vatican's high-level exchanges with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is convinced that Beijing would often accuse the
Vatican of interfering with its own internal affairs if the Vatican
were to forge formal ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Vatican is one of the ROC's two diplomatic allies in Europe.
The other ally is Macedonia which forged formal relations with
the ROC on Jan. 27 this year.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday gave a
positive appraisal of the performance of Premier Vincent Siew and
denied the reports that Siew has tendered his resignation.</P>
      <P>Siew, who earlier said that he would never consider slashing the
stock transaction tax, reportedly tendered his resignation on Monday
because of the controversy over the Cabinet's about-face toward
adjusting the tax rate.</P>
      <P>At a lunar New Year banquet, Lee categorically denied that Siew
had tendered his resignation, and said that he has confidence in
Siew's performance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National
Association of Industry &amp; Commerce, said that Siew should not step
down, as compared with other major national policies, the stock
transaction tax issue is not very important.</P>
      <P>He stressed that there is no one more qualified than Siew, with
his rich background and experience in handling financial and economic
problems, to be premier.</P>
      <P>Koo said that the Executive Yuan's decision to slash the 0.3
percent stock transaction tax in the face of the sluggish stock
market is a good one which will boost investor confidence.</P>
      <P>He said that the government can raise the rate again when the

      <P>To date, there are two proposals for the flexible adjustment
measures of the stock transaction tax rate -- zero to 0.6 percent,

      <P>More Singapore companies are now looking
toward emerging markets such as mainland China, India, Indo-China,
the Middle East, South America, Central &amp; Eastern Europe, Africa, and
Central Asia, for business opportunities, according to the Singapore
Trade Development Board (TDB).</P>
      <P>In 1998, the Singapore Trade Development Board organized a total
of 19 fairs and missions to emerging markets around the world. The
participating companies explored non-traditional markets such as
Uganda, Iran, Latvia and Kazakhstan, which many would not have even
considered for their market expansion plans a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Not only do these emerging markets have huge consumer bases and
business opportunities, they have also yielded a few success stories
among local firms, such as Thakral, Excel Group, Keppel FELS, G &amp; W
Trading, Tolaram Group and Intraco.</P>
      <P>Tay Thiam Peng, Deputy Chief Officer of TDB, said: "Increasingly,
we are seeing a change in the local business community's perception
of emerging markets. No longer are they viewed as far-flung
inaccessible places, but rather as bright spots with great business
opportunities."</P>
      <P>G &amp; W Trading, a company trading in consumer electronics, has
been doing business with Africa since 1991. With the experience
gained and the need to service their African customers, the company
opened an office in West Africa. Recently, the company also set up a
bonded warehouse in East Africa as a direct result of participating
in a TDB mission to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in July 1998.</P>
      <P>In August 1997, Keppel FELS, recognizing the vast potential in
the oil boom in the Caspian Sea, entered into a joint venture to
establish and operate a shipyard in Baku, Azerbaijan. In addition,
the company has also embarked on the construction of residential and
service quality apartments for upmarket clientele and expatriates in
Azerbaijan.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the high interest in emerging markets, the TDB is
planning 28 fairs and missions to those markets this year.</P>

that the Republic of China's recent diplomatic efforts have borne
fruit, despite the efforts by mainland China to strangle Taiwan
diplomatically.</P>

      <P>Mainland China is the No. 1 source of
refugee claimants and inadmissible travelers to Canada, Canada's
ambassador to the Asian country said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Howard Bullock said in Vancouver, "China still is the source of
our largest number of inadmissible passengers on airlines, our
largest source of refugee claimants of any country in the world."</P>
      <P>He told a China-oriented business luncheon that Canada has been
accepting more independent immigrants from the Chinese mainland, but
more open migration policies have increased problems of crime.</P>
      <P>Bulloch was answering questions about the high rejection rate for
student-visa applications from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Visa rates have actually increased more than 100 percent, he
said, while the refusal rate last year dropped below 50 percent from
more than 60 percent in 1997. Some might view that as still too high,
he added.</P>
      <P>Despite recent crackdowns on pro-democracy activists, Bulloch
said the Canadian government believes the trend toward reform in

      <P>Canada is helping mainland China in many areas, from legal reform

      <P>"I can tell you that everywhere among the senior leaders who are

      <P>The shift to capitalism has created widening income disparity,
and the sell-off of huge, over-manned state-run industries has fueled
unemployment.</P>
      <P>That makes the country's leaders fearful of political upheaval,
he said, citing a conversation he had with one official.</P>

It's stability for reform; it's not stability versus reform,'" he

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's military activities in the South
China Sea make it the greatest potential threat to regional
stability, Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with visiting President Edwin J. Feulner Jr. of the
Heritage Foundation, a right-wing US think tank , Siew said the
publication of aerial photographs of Beijing's military installations
on Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands has caused great panic among
the countries of Southeast Asia, especially the Philippines.</P>
      <P>This demonstrates that Beijing is becoming the biggest threat to
the stability of Southeast Asia, and brings home the necessity of
some kind of collective defense mechanism among the states of Asia,
Siew said.</P>
      <P>The Spratlys is a chain of islets in the South China Sea claimed
wholly or in part by mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the
Philippines, Indonesia and Brunei.</P>
      <P>In a jab at Beijing's inability to judge international public
opinion, Siew pointed out that mainland China is beefing up its
supervision and control of dissidents to quiet the voice of protest
from within in the hope of reversing the international community's
judgment of the Tiananmen Square Massacre before the tragedy's 10th
anniversary.</P>
      <P>Beijing denies that the massacre in Tiananmen Square, when
hundreds of unarmed students and workers were gunned down and crushed
by communist tanks, ever took place, insisting that only a few people
were killed in a legal crackdown on rebellion and sabotage.</P>
      <P>Feulner, who came to Taiwan following a visit to Hong Kong and
the Philippines, told Siew that his foundation, in conjunction with
American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, will host
an international seminar on the Taiwan Relations Act in March.</P>
      <P>The seminar will bring together US congressmen, officials and
scholars to discuss the purpose and implementation of the Taiwan
Relations Act to mark the 20th anniversary of its enactment, said

    <HEADLINE>BOFT HEAD EXPRESSES REGRET OVER US PIRACY LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government's efforts to stem piracy
production are so strenuous that no other country in the world can
compare, Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Director General Chen
Ruey-long said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said he regrets that Taiwan was identified by the
United States recently as the second-largest source of pirated
information technology products in America last year after the
government has done so much to curb the infringement of intellectual
property rights (IPR).</P>
      <P>According to the US Department of Treasury, the US Customs
Service seized US$75.9 million worth of imported pirated products in
1998, with US$8.6 million worth of goods from Taiwan. According to
those figures, Taiwan was the second-largest source of pirated
products to the US last year. Most of the goods were computers and
their peripherals and components.</P>
      <P>It is the second year in a row that Taiwan has been named the
second-largest source of pirated products shipped to the US.</P>
      <P>When it received news of this charge last year, BOFT asked US
authorities for concrete evidence behind the list's compilation,
including the names of the accused companies, the names of export and
import sites, freighters or cargo companies, as well as the type of
piracy (such as violations of trademark, patent or copyright), Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Instead of providing Taiwan with the information, the US
government said the Customs authorities did not have enough manpower
to compile the data and offering such details may violate relevant US
statutes, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the government has established an Export
Monitoring System (EMS), a new arm that monitors Taiwan's computer
software exports; established a CD-ROM identification system which
allows the export of only those products with legitimate
identification marks; and early this year, all of Taiwan's CD-ROM
makers signed an anti-piracy self-restraint agreement to help
eradicate computer software piracy, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He added that in addition to all these measures, police working
under the instruction of related government agencies made a great
number of raids on illicit software counterfeiters, seizing caches of

      <P>Chen said an equal effort from the private sector is required if
Taiwan wants to effectively curb infringements on IPR. Any
achievement would be limited if only the government makes an effort

    <HEADLINE>JIMMY CARTER WILL SEE TAIWAN'S PROGRESS FIRST-HAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By N.K. Han)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US President Jimmy Carter's
forthcoming trip to Taiwan will be an important opportunity for him
to "see first-hand the dramatic advances Taiwan has made both
economically and democratically in the last two decades," Jody
Powell, White House spokesman during the Carter administration, said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a written statement issued in response to a press query about
Carter's planned trip to Taiwan in late March, Powell noted that the
people of Taiwan have created "one of the most mature and vibrant
democracies in the world." He praised Taiwan as "a society that is a
model for all of Asia."</P>
      <P>"One of the issues most important to President Carter, both
during his time in the White House and in the years afterward, is
respect for basic human freedoms. Taiwan has embraced freedom of the
press, freedom of religion and freedom of speech," Powell said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's advances in human rights, including its support of
independent labor unions, respect for the rule of law and for the
diversity of opinion through free media, is recognized all over the
world, he continued.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Powell added, Taiwan's system of free and open
elections for representatives at all levels of government is "a
triumph of democracy in Asia."</P>
      <P>"These are all accomplishments of which Taiwan should be
extremely proud," he said.</P>
      <P>The former White House spokesman said he was pleased to learn
that Carter will visit Taiwan next month, and that he has great
admiration for the work Carter has achieved in many areas in the
years since he left the presidency.</P>
      <P>"Americans consistently rate him as one of our country's most
respected statesmen," Powell said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALBRIGHT CITES PROGRESS IN MAINLAND CHINA ENGAGEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Wednesday that she expects serious discussions
concerning the prevention of renewed tensions related to Taiwan as
well as other important issues during her visit to mainland China
March 1-2, stressing that "in our relations with China, engagement is
not endorsement."</P>
      <P>Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) noted in a budget hearing of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee on US foreign policy that President Bill
Clinton had uttered acceptance of Beijing's long-awaited "three noes"
policy towards Taiwan while in China last July. However, Beijing then
returned the favor with a draconian crackdown on dissidents, plus
military exercises in November that mocked missile attacks on Taiwan
as well as on US forces in Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Helms, the Senate committee chairman, then wondered, "just what
are we getting from our policy of so-called 'engagement' with China?"</P>
      <P>Albright sited in her testimony areas where the United States has
seen progress in its strategic dialogue with China: weapon
non-proliferation, economic reform, and the responsible role China
has played during the current Asian financial crisis. "We need to
recognize progress even as we press for more," she added.</P>
      <P>Albright promised more tough talk with mainland Chinese leaders
during her visit early next week. "I will reaffirm our commitment to
dialogue and straight talk. I expect serious discussions about
possible Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization, export
controls, and the need to prevent renewed tensions related to
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The secretary promised the senators that "I will also bring (to
Beijing) a strong message of support for international norms of
respect for human rights."</P>
      <P>Albright said this will come as no surprise to Beijing, as the
Clinton administration has repeatedly emphasized this principle in
recent months by condemning the arrest of mainland Chinese citizens
who peacefully tried to establish an opposition political party.</P>
      <P>"Let me stress that in our relations with China, engagement is
not endorsement. We continue to have sharp differences with Beijing,
but we also believe that the best way to narrow those differences and
to make progress where our interests coincide is through regular
contacts and dialogue," continued Albright.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said, the United States is working with its allies
and partners in the Asia-Pacific region to improve security
cooperation, restore economic momentum and build democracy, noting
that "In this region, there is no greater threat to peace and
stability than the situation on the Korean Peninsula."</P>
      <P>The United States along with its allies, Japan and South
Korea, are having discussions with China and North Korea aimed at 
achieving a permanent end to tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The
United States is also engaging in direct talks with North Korea on
ways to resolve concerns regarding suspicious underground
construction activities and long-range missile programs, added the
secretary of State.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR TO VISIT HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou is scheduled to
visit Hong Kong in his official capacity next week after attending
the Asia-Pacific mayoral summit meeting in Brisbane, Australia, city
government sources said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma will leave for Brisbane on Sunday for his first overseas trip
since assuming his current post last December. The Harvard-trained
mayor is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on March 4 to preside over
an inaugural ceremony for a representative office there of the Taipei
City Government-owned Taipei Bank.</P>
      <P>Political observers said Ma's Hong Kong visit carries special
significance because the former British colony is now under mainland
China's sovereignty. Ma had applied for a visa to attend activities
marking Hong Kong's handover on July 1, 1997 as a university
professor, but his application was rejected.</P>
      <P>To avoid possible conflict, Ma has kept a low profile on his Hong
Kong visit.</P>
      <P>Ma was born in Hong Kong and enjoys a high level of popularity
there. When Ma was campaigning for the Taipei mayoral post last year,
many Hong Kong residents threw their moral support behind his bid.</P>
      <P>In addition to presiding over a cocktail reception to mark the
opening of the Taipei Bank's Hong Kong representative office, the
bank's sixth overseas foothold, Ma will also pay a courtesy call at
the National Taiwan University (NTU) Alumni Club. Ma is an NTU
graduate.</P>
      <P>Ma will also tour some of Hong Kong's hillside residential
communities to study its slopeland management strategy and
supervisory measures. Improving Taipei's hillside management is one
of Ma's main campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Ma will head a large delegation of Taipei City Government
officials and senior commerce and industry executives to attend the
Second Asia-Pacific Mayoral Summit to be held in Brisbane, the
capital city of the Australian state of Queensland, from March 1
through March 3. This will be the first time Ma will attend an
international meeting in his capacity as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Ma, a legal professor-turned-politician, once served as vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, minister of
justice and a minister without portfolio before becoming the
administrative chief of Taiwan's largest city.</P>
      <P>Several other Taiwan local government chiefs, including Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh, Tainan Mayor George Chang, Taichung Mayor Chang
Wen-ying, Keelung Mayor Lee Chin-yung and Tainan County Magistrate
Chen Tang-shan, have also been invited to attend the Asia-Pacific
mayoral meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the mayors of Beijing and several coastal cities of
mainland China, including Shanghai, will also attend the meeting. The
summit agenda will focus on the region's economy, business, finance
and the environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISA CARD SPENDING IN 1998 TOPS US$10.51 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan consumers charged over NT$360
billion (US$10.51 billion) worth of goods and services on their Visa
cards last year, accounting for 68 percent of total credit card
spending in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Albert Hsiung, vice president and country manager of the Great
China Region, said on Thursday that the number of Visa cards issued
climbed to 9.4 million in 1998 from 1.92 million in 1994.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the number of cards issued would top 10
million in March or April this year. The amount spent by Visa card
holders also surged to a record high of NT$362.7 billion in 1998 from
NT$82.2 billion in 1994.</P>
      <P>Hsiung said in consideration of the island's economic growth and
other factors, Visa card usage in Taiwan will grow by 25 percent this
year, showing that the credit card market has room to further develop
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that growth of circulated currency in Taiwan
has dropped in the past five years, also an indication that credit
card payment has gradually taken the place of cash.</P>
      <P>Hsiung noted that of their total expenditures last year,
consumers chose to pay on credit over cash in 9.1 percent of the
cases, which is up from 3.5 percent from five years ago. He estimated
that the rate would top 10 percent this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MUST END ITS 'ENGAGEMENT' POLICY WITH MAINLAND: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington should take advantage of the
US secretary of State's coming visit to mainland China to reassess
the Clinton administration's policy of engagement with Beijing,
according to the Center for Security Policy.</P>
      <P>The Washington-based think tank said in a newly published
decision brief titled "Time for a Course Correction on China," that
perhaps the most compelling piece of evidence to do so is China's
growing propensity to utilize its ballistic missile force as a
coercive instrument.</P>
      <P>Last month, the Washington Times revealed that the United States
has evidence that the mainland has conducted simulated missile
attacks against US forces and facilities in East Asia during recent
exercises.</P>
      <P>What is more, Beijing's missile threat to both American personnel
and assets and those of its allies has been sharply heightened of
late. The Financial Times of London reported on Feb. 10 that a
classified Pentagon report indicates that, "The Chinese military has
stationed 150 to 200 M-9 and M-11 missiles in its southern regions
aimed at Taiwan. It plans to increase the number to 650 missiles over
the next several years."</P>
      <P>Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA) said this build-up is part of Beijing's
"effort to preempt US efforts to promote theater missile defense in
East Asia -- efforts that are barely in the planning stage." The
Chinese are no less adamantly opposed to the Clinton administration's
purported interest in building a limited national missile defense.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the US Commerce Department, the agency that has shown
itself most determined to press ahead with high technology sales to
China, is growing uneasy about the mainland's behavior.</P>
      <P>A February 1999 report commissioned and published by the
department's Bureau of Export Administration said, "Continued
pressure on foreign (including American) high-tech firms to transfer
advanced commercial technologies, if successful, could indirectly
benefit China's efforts to modernize its military."</P>
      <P>As a practical matter, the danger inherent in the Clinton
administration's ambitious program of Sino-American defense exchanges
and other Chinese practices, including espionage, technology theft
and drug smuggling, "are exacerbating the dangers of US-Chinese
conflict," the think tank said.</P>
      <P>The United States, therefore, is left with no choice: "It must
abandon 'engagement' as practiced by the Clinton administration in
favor of a new approach, one that reasserts America's commitment to
protecting its friends and interests in Asia and thwarting Chinese
policies that threaten them. Such an alternative is made all the more
practical given the PRC's internal problems ranging from
unemployment, labor and ethnic unrest to corruption."</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Center for Security Policy noted, if US
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has her way, she would surely
prefer her trip to the mainland be like President Bill Clinton's
visit last year -- emphasizing the positive and downplaying, if not
denying outright, the negative.</P>
      <P>Under present circumstances, she must not be allowed to have her
way, the center said. "The fact is that the People's Republic of
China is not now, and will never be, a reliable 'strategic partner'
for the United States and the free world," the Center for Security
Policy stated.</P>
      <P>Albright is slated to visit mainland China from March 1-2.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang Chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thai exporters as well as small and medium
scale manufactuers are expected to receive loans totalling US$ 1.35
billion from Japans's Export-Import Bank (Jexim) according to the
official Thai News Agency.</P>
      <P>The action comes as high levels of non-performing loans are
limiting the ability of Thai banks to make new loans.</P>
      <P>Jexim is expected to give US$500 million to the Industrial
Finance Corporation of Thailand, US$2250 million to Krung Thai Bank
and US$600 million in a co-financing arrangement.</P>
      <P>The loans are parts of Japan's US$30-billion bail-out fund for
regional economies.</P>
      <P>Yohei Nishiyami, Jaxim's senior economist, said Thai exports were
unlikely to increase significantly in the short term due to high
levels of non-performing loans that limit Thai banks from making new
loans, as well as uncertain global economic prospects.</P>
      <P>In addition, the poor state of the Japanese economy also affects
Thai exporters, he said.</P>
      <P>Nishiyami suggested the Thai government restructure its export
industry to focus on high-technology products such as electronics and
computer products instead of labour-intensive goods.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MJIB SEX SCANDAL NOT POWER STRUGGLE, SAYS JUSTICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Yeh Chin-feng on Thursday
ridiculed allegations that a sex scandal involving a Ministry of
Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) investigator was a power struggle
within the bureau, stressing that it was only a simple and isolated
incident of lack of discipline.</P>
      <P>Yeh said a formal investigative report on the scandal, involving
MJIB investigator Hua Jung-kan and a female journalist with whom Hua
admitted to having improper physical contact during a Chinese New
Year drinking binge, is not available yet, but that Hua and his
supervisors were dealt with fairly according to the law.</P>
      <P>Hua, an investigator of the MJIB's north Taiwan division,
attempted suicide Wednesday after he was forced to resign for
allegedly having sexually harassed the journalist.</P>
      <P>Hua cut his wrist and poisoned himself with gas at his home in
Peitou, northern Taipei Wednesday night. He was rushed to the Veteran
General Hospital, where doctors on Thursday morning said Hua's wounds
were not life-threatening, however the long term effect of gas to his
brain remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>According to other reporters who were at the Chinese New Year
party on February 6 hosted by the MJIB at its headquarters in Taipei,
the female journalist was drunk and began vomiting after consuming
Kaoliang liquor. Hua offered to escort her to the lady's room where
he allegedly sexually harassed her.</P>
      <P>In a recent investigation, Hua denied rape, but admitted to
"improper physical contact," saying he had lost control of himself
after drinking too much.</P>
      <P>The journalist, whose identity was concealed, reportedly said she
didn't want to bring the harassment case to court.</P>
      <P>After a preliminary investigation, the MJIB announced on
Wednesday that Hua's resignation was accepted, while his immediate
supervisor will be disciplined for inadequate supervision and
reassigned to another post. Two other supervisors were also
disciplined.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is actively working with the World
Trade Organization's (WTO) working party to arrange for multilateral
talks on Taiwan's admission into the world body as soon as possible,
said Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>His remarks came in reaction to scheduled talks between
Washington and Beijing on mainland China's WTO entry. The talks will
take place when mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji visits the United

      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a briefing

has not yet held multilateral talks or completed all required
bilateral talks with WTO member economies necessary to gain WTO
entry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed bilateral talks with 26 members of the WTO.
At present, only Canada and Hong Kong have not signed agreements with
Taiwan on Taiwan's WTO entry. Canada is expected to sign an agreement

      <P>With great courtesy, Barshefsky declined to answer whether the
United States supports Taiwan gaining entry to the WTO before
mainland China. Instead she said, "I think Zhu Rongji's visit
provides China with a possible opportunity to seek progress."</P>
      <P>She made the remarks in response to questions by Hong Kong news
media after a lecture at the Foreign Press Center on US trade policy
toward Africa.</P>
      <P>The United States is urging mainland China to take advantage of
this opportunity to reach a bilateral agreement with the United
States on mainland China's WTO entry, she said.</P>
      <P>Discussing the upcoming multilateral talks between Taiwan and the
WTO, Lin said the Ministry of Economic Affairs is now working with
the WTO's working group to determine the scope and substance of
the talks.</P>
      <P>As to whether Zhu's US visit will speed mainland China's WTO
entry, Lin said the matter is between the United States and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will continue to adhere to its present position
that the WTO entry of Taiwan and mainland China should be handled
separately and that whichever side first completes all entrance
requirements should be the first admitted into the WTO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S WORKFORCE SHRINKS TO 17-YEAR LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's workforce, also known as the labor
participation rate, dropped last year to 58.04 percent of its total
population aged 15 or over, its lowest level since 1982, according to
statistics by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>A DGBAS report attributed the decline to the fact that an
increasing number of college graduates are opting for advanced study
instead of entering the workforce. An increase in the number of men
retiring early and an aging population were factors as well,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Because older people are accounting for a growing proportion of
Taiwan's population, the labor participation rate is expected to drop
1.43 percentage points over the next 15 years, the DGBAS warned.</P>
      <P>The report indicated that in the past decade, more men than women
have been dropping out of the workforce. The labor participation rate
among men in Taiwan has declined from 75.24 percent of Taiwan's male
population in 1987 to 70.58 percent in 1998. During the same 11-year
period, the labor participation rate among women slid only 1
percentage point.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the average age of a worker being pensioned off was
57.79. Last year the average age was 56.44. Moreover, a survey of
workers' attitudes found that workers aged 30 and under intend to
retire eight years earlier than do workers 55 and older.</P>
      <P>Anticipating a further decline in the size of Taiwan's workforce,
DGBAS officials said, "Measures aimed at pumping up labor
participation to help maintain economic development should be mapped
out and carried out as soon as possible."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A notorious
Taiwan weapons smuggler who has fled the country for 10 years was
repatriated by the Philippines to Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-ming, 45, was convicted of smuggling guns and
ammunition via a fishing boat into Taiwan from the Philippines in
1989.</P>
      <P>Chang and his accomplice, Wu Ho-kuo, were put on Taiwan police's
wanted list in January 1990 after the pair fled the island during an
investigation in late 1989.</P>
      <P>Through the help of Interpol, Taiwan police authorities
determined that Chang and Wu were hiding in the Philippines. In late
1990, Wu was nabbed by Philippine police and was repatriated to
Taiwan on Dec. 4 of that year.</P>
      <P>In April 1995 Philippine police had Chang nearly cornered in a
fishing village called Bulan Sursgon in the central Philippines. In
1998 he again eluded police, who were tracking him.</P>
      <P>Police successfully apprehended him on Feb. 22 and transferred
him from the southern city of Tacloban to Manila on Feb. 23.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau, the
agency has had 141 convicted criminals from Taiwan repatriated since
the bureau established a cross-border operations unit in 1984.</P>

      <P>Fishermen on Taiwan's western coast on
Thursday protested against the smuggling of fish from mainland China
into Taiwan, where they are dumped on the local market.</P>
      <P>Fishermen unfurled large white banners Thursday morning in
Fangyuan Village, located in central Taiwan's Changhua County, to
mark the start of their campaign. Fishermen from Changhua to Pingtung
in southern Taiwan are expected to join the protest.</P>
      <P>They intend to display more than 4,000 banners along Taiwan's
western coastal highway to protest the smuggling into Taiwan of fish
caught by mainland fishermen and to call for the protection of local
fishermen's rights.</P>
      <P>Fisherman Lin Kuan-tian from Changhua County said that the
mainland began to dump large numbers of fish onto the Taiwan market
late last year.</P>
      <P>In particular, claims from mainland waters are larger than local
ones and consequently more appealing to Taiwan seafood buyers.</P>
      <P>Merchants can buy a kilogram of mainland clams for NT$7.8 and
sell them for NT$75, while local clams go unsold, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin called for local people to boycott mainland clams, saying

    <HEADLINE>EARLY ECONOMIC REFORM IMPROVES CHANCES OF AVOIDING RECESSION: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The earlier Taiwan takes action to reform
its economy, the better its chances of avoiding a long-term
recession, such as the one now affecting Japan, said Premier Vincent
Siew on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The primary task of the Executive Yuan is to tackle the economic
and financial issues that are of concern to all people in Taiwan,
noted Siew.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a Kuomintang (KMT) central
policy coordination convention, which was held to iron out possible
resistance to measures that would introduce flexibility to the
island's stock transaction tax.</P>
      <P>In response to the current economic problems Taiwan is
experiencing, said Siew, the Executive Yuan has offered a
wide-ranging economic revitalization package. The chief goals of the
new stimulus package are to address Taiwan's economic and financial
ills in a more fundamental way over the short-, medium- and
long-term, Siew added.</P>
      <P>Short-term measures will not interfere with Taiwan's long-term
economic performance, while medium- and long-term measures will focus
on a structural and systematic reform of the economy.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet will submit to the legislature by the end of May a
bill detailing all the Cabinet can do in this regard, Siew indicated.</P>
      <P>The revitalization package involving structural and systematic
economic reform was designed not at the behest of large business
interests that have experienced financial hardships, said Siew. It
was instead designed to deal with the global economic situation in
the coming century, he added.</P>
      <P>Six special measures taken last Friday by the Central Bank of
China and the Finance Ministry to address Taiwan's financial woes in
its money, bond and stock markets are all designed to strengthen
Taiwan's economic structure, he said. One of the proposed measures is
a reduction in banks' business income tax from the current 5 percent
to 2 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY CLARIFIES SHIPBOARD KILLING REPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative
office in Mauritius said on Thursday it will do its utmost to seek
the extradition of the captain of a Taiwan fishing boat who allegedly
killed two of his mainland Chinese crewmen in the Indian Ocean
on Feb. 16.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to Mauritius Lee Tzi-nan made the statement in
a telephone interview with CNA in response to a press report that
mainland China's Foreign Ministry has claimed jurisdiction over the
alleged Chin Ching No. 12 shipboard killing case, in which 13 other
mainland sailors are also said to have jumped overboard in panic.</P>
      <P>Lee said he had not heard that mainland China's embassy has asked
Mauritius to turn over the case to its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Lee said, the ROC's representative office has
been focusing its efforts on pushing Mauritius to hand jurisdiction
of the case over to the ROC and to repatriate the ship's captain for
trial in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper quoted Chen Meng-ning, the vessel's first
engineer, as complaining on Wednesday that the ROC's representative
office in Mauritius has not offered the surviving crew of the Chin
Ching No. 12 any assistance since the ship arrived in Port Louis last
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen also told a China Times reporter that two mainland Chinese
embassy staff members had expressed concern for the surviving crewmen
and had accompanied them during police questioning.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, the de facto ROC ambassador to
Mauritius admitted that mainland Chinese Consul Li Gueixi attended a
police questioning session as a spectator on Monday afternoon. "Li
left the Mauritius police office after the interrogation had
finished, and all the surviving sailors were allowed to return to
their ship," Lee said.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that none of the mainland embassy staff had
visited any of the ship's crew.</P>
      <P>Lee further pointed out that as Mauritius has been in turmoil in
recent days with clashes between protesters and police, the
investigation of the case has been disrupted.</P>
      <P>Lee said only three of the 10 surviving crew members -- skipper
Kung Tai-an, Chen Meng-ning and Lee You-lai -- have so far not been
questioned.</P>
      <P>"Kung's lawyer insisted that Kung can be questioned only in the
company of his lawyer; Chen was allowed to return to the vessel to
take care of its catch; and Lee You-lai is in a hospital receiving
treatment for arm injuries sustained during the shooting melee," Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Responding to another China Times report that Kung shot a total
of 11 of the mainland crewmen, and that four others jumped ship in
panic, Lee said he cannot comment on such shocking reports before
there has been further investigation.</P>
      <P>Thus far, Kung has confessed to Mauritius police that he killed
just two of the mainland crewmen, and that 13 others jumped
overboard. The fate of the missing mainland sailors remains unclear.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung-based Chin Ching Fishery Co., owner of the 490-ton tuna
boat, also said on Thursday that it cannot confirm the veracity of
the China Times report regarding the number of deaths.</P>
      <P>The boat left Kaohsiung for the Indian Ocean on Feb. 20, 1996. It
originally had 25 crew members, including the skipper. In
addition to Kung, nine other crewmen survived the incident, including
four from Taiwan, three from mainland China and two from the
Philippines. The tragic incident took place in the Indian Ocean some
1,000 nautical miles northwest of Mauritius.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECURITY NO. 1 CONCERN IN SATELLITE EXPORT LICENSING: LA TIMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Increasingly concerned about Beijing's
progress in acquiring advanced military technology, the Clinton
administration has decided to reject Hughes Electronic Corp.'s
request to sell a $450 million communications satellite to a mainland
Chinese consortium with ties to the People's Liberation Army, an
editorial in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times noted.</P>
      <P>The decision has focused attention on the issue of technology
transfers to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The editorial pointed out that the satellite Hughes seeks to
export was developed to greatly expand telephone and other types of
communications across mainland China and much of East Asia. But
intelligence agencies and others believe it could also be used to
bolster the mainland Chinese military's command and control systems
and to carry out electronic eavesdropping against the United States
and its allies.</P>
      <P>According to a report in Britain's Financial Times, US officials
had an even larger concern: Launching the satellite aboard a mainland
Chinese rocket would have required sharing with Beijing potentially
sensitive information of possible use in mainland China's missile
program. Improved accuracy in mainland Chinese missiles, some of
which are capable of reaching the United States, has captured
Washington's attention.</P>
      <P>A few months ago a select House committee issued a report, much
of which will soon be declassified, calling for tougher security
standards in the transfer of satellites and other technology to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Senate Intelligence Committee will soon release its own
cautionary study. Strengthening economic and other ties with mainland
China has been a fairly consistent goal for more than two decades,
but that policy must be subordinate to US security interests,
according to the Times editorial.</P>
      <P>The editorial concluded by asking whether security concerns are
being properly considered.</P>

      <P>Conservative syndicated columnist
Pat Buchanan urged on Wednesday President Bill Clinton to take a
strong position in dealing with mainland China's potential threat to
the security of Taiwan and American's interest in the region.</P>
      <P>"No one wants a war with China, but appeasement invites it,"
wrote the famous columnist and commentator on current issues in an
article titled "Chinese Missiles: Taiwan Gambit?"</P>
      <P>Citing recent news reports that Beijing conducted mock strikes on
US bases in Korea and Japan and that the mainland Chinese military
has stationed 150-200 M-9 and M-11 missiles in its southern regions
aimed at Taiwan, Buchanan asked why Beijing, by threatening Taiwan,
would risk the disruption of trade ties that provide it with US$ 60
billion every year.</P>
      <P>Clearly, mainland China fears that a window of opportunity is
closing, said Buchanan, adding that with North Korea building rockets,
mainland China may worry that Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may
follow the example of India and Pakistan and develop independent
nuclear deterrents.</P>
      <P>"That would checkmate China's drive for hegemony in Asia," he
noted.</P>
      <P>When mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji arrives in Washington
this spring, President Clinton should tell him to stop targeting
Taiwan and US forces or start looking elsewhere to sell his exports,
Buchanan said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MARCHES INTO 21ST CENTURY WITH CONFIDENCE: GIO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Melbourne,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is marching into
the 21st century with confidence despite facing enormous challenges
ahead, Chen Chien-jen, director-general of the Government Information
Office, said in a message to the 1999 Taiwan Update Conference in
Melbourne on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a keynote message at the opening ceremony of the two-day
conference at Monash University, Chen, who had to abandon at the last
minute plans to attend to the conference, said Taiwan is facing three
big challenges in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>The message, read by Professor Bruce Jacobs of Monash University,
said Taiwan is facing economic challenges despite the fact that its
economy has emerged relatively unscathed from the Asian financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>Chen said to sharpen Taiwan's competitive edge in the world
market, "the (ROC) government has placed top priority on
strengthening and upgrading the economic structure at the earliest
date."</P>
      <P>"Internally, Taiwan also faces the enormous challenges of social
transformation. Taiwan continues to go through a painful and
confusing transformation from a simple, traditional society to a
pluralistic, industrial society," he said.</P>
      <P>He cited major problems such as widening income disparity among
the island's 22 million people, rising crime rates, and concentrated
power in the hands of special interest groups.</P>
      <P>"To counter these problems, the ruling Kuomintang Party proposed
a fair, just and new society in addition to prosperity, stability and
a goof life," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the second major challenge involves cross-strait
relations between mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Peking has yet to renounce the use of military force against
Taiwan; therefore, relations between Taipei and Peking are a major
factor affecting our existence and development," he said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that mainland China's "one country, two systems"
policy "ignores reality" and "is unacceptable to the people of
Taiwan. Peking and Taipei should reduce differences and promote
mutual trust by holding constructive consultations and strengthening
private exchanges."</P>
      <P>"We are confident that under this gradual, progressive course,
the two sides can be unified as a free, democratic, and equitably
prosperous new China. This vision of a new China can meet the
expectations of all people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," he
said.</P>
      <P>The third challenge is facing comes from the international
community, Chen said. He said Taiwan's efforts to promote political
democratization and economic liberalization not only reflect domestic
needs, but are also in accord with international trends because the
Republic of China aims to play an active and constructive role in the
international community.</P>
      <P>"During the past five decades, we have not only shared the
successful experiences of Taiwan's development with the Third World,
but we have also repaid the international community with substantial
assistance programs," he said.</P>
      <P>But Chen said Taiwan's contributions "have not always resulted in
fair treatment, since Peking repeatedly disrupted our normal
diplomatic relations with other countries, tried to isolate us from
the international community and malevolently described Taiwan as a
'troublemaker.'"</P>
      <P>Despite the pressure from the Chinese mainland, however, "We will
continue to forge ahead with a diplomatic policy of developing
pragmatic relations with friendly countries," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S PRE-SCHOOLERS BECOMING STRONGER, TALLER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's youngsters have become taller and
stronger over the past 17 years, the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The department was reporting on an extensive survey of heights,
weights and head sizes of local children aged between zero and six
years conducted during the 1996-97 period.</P>
      <P>"The growth curve based on the survey results show that the local
pre-school children's growth curve is higher than Hong Kong's 1993
level and Japan's 1990 level," said Chang Tan-jung, a DOH public
health expert.</P>
      <P>Chang said the survey results also indicate that local
pre-schoolers' growth situation matches levels in advanced countries.</P>
      <P>Compared with figures recorded in a similar 1982 survey, the
average height, weight and head size of local newborn babies in the
1996-97 survey were similar to the 1982 figures. One year later,
however, they were found to have grown faster.</P>
      <P>Two-year-olds were heavier than their counterparts in 1982 by an
average of 0.5 kg.; 3-year-olds were heavier by 1 kg.; 4-year-olds
were heavier by 1.5 kg.; 5-year-olds were heavier by 2 kg.; and
6-year-olds by 2.5 kg.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 2-year-olds were 1 centimeter higher than their 1982
counterparts; 3-year-olds were higher by 2.5 cm; 4-year-olds were 3
cm higher.</P>
      <P>The average head size of 2-year-olds was also 0.5 cm bigger than
their 1982 counterparts, according to the 1996-97 growth curve.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION PARTY TO LAUNCH NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION AGAINST PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The tiny opposition New Party legislative
caucus decided on Thursday to put forward a no-confidence motion
against Premier Vincent Siew on Friday to express their grave
discontent with Siew's political flip-flops.</P>
      <P>The move came as result of the Executive Yuan's abrupt about-face
over the stock transaction tax dispute, according to Chen Yung-shui,
deputy convenor of the caucus.</P>
      <P>Yielding to pressure from the island's business magnates and
President Lee Teng-hui's instructions, the Cabinet backed down on its
once-insistent policy of no transaction tax cuts, and on Monday, Siew
nodded his approval for the forming of a panel to mull the
possibility of lowering or eliminating the tax in order to pump up
the local bourse.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his party has received a growing number of
complaints from members of the public over deteriorating political,
economic and social order attributed to a constitutional crisis --
the president holds absolute power over policymaking, but takes no
responsibility for any policy failures.</P>
      <P>The premier, who should be governing the country, now merely
plays the role of the president's rubber-stamp, Chen claimed, while
having to be responsible for all the consequences of his
administration. Chen also described Siew as no longer the premier of
the country, but only the president's chief consultant.</P>
      <P>This weakness has aroused mistrust of the administrative
authorities among the people, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The no-confidence motion will be carried out at the opening of
the legislature's first session of 1999 on Friday, in which the
premier has to brief the legsilature on policy, and receive
interpellation from legislators.</P>
      <P>The New Party move has won major support from the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), claimed Chen. DPP legislators are
said to be prepared to add their signatures to the planned
no-confidence bill, which needs the signatures of one-third of the
225 members of the Legislative Yuan to be put onto the formal
legislative agenda, although it can only be passed with the approval
of half of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will seek signatures from legislators with
"consciences" from the ruling Kuomintang and other parties to give
their support to his motion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD NOT ENGAGE WITH BEIJING AT THE EXPENSE OF TAIWAN: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The success of Taiwan's decade-long
experiment with democracy, which stands as shining proof of what free
people can achieve in a Chinese society, should prompt the US
government to reassess its policies toward Beijing, the president of
an American research institute said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner was speaking on the
relationship between the United States and Taiwan over the last 25
years at the joint invitation of the Taipei-based Sino-American
Cultural and Economic Association and the Vanguard Foundation, which
is headed by former legislator Wei Yung.</P>
      <P>Feulner began his speech with a review of the US relationship
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration's pursuit of a "constructive strategic
partnership" with mainland China consists of little more than
"soaring rhetoric and frequent meetings," and does nothing to
recognize and reward Taiwan, which is the real partner of the United
States in democracy and free markets," said Feulner.</P>
      <P>According to US policy toward the mainland, democracy should have
spread and the market should have become more liberal, Feulner said.
However, after the so-called "engagement" policies of the Clinton
administration, instead of achieving these goals, Beijing is
continuing to modernize its missile and space programs, technology
for which is allegedly being given by or stolen from US companies,
the head of the conservative think tank noted.</P>
      <P>Regarding the free market, Feulner said that despite the
mainland's strenuous efforts to obtain membership of the World Trade
Organization, the United States still has to send high-level
officials to push for faster market opening, as American economic
policies toward the mainland are not being fully achieved.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he continued, Beijing's constant military deployments
in the Spratly Islands not only create unstable tension in the
region, they also illustrate the poor performance of Washington's
security policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>These factors, Feulner stressed, have given the foundation every
reason to urge Washington to reassess its policies regarding the
mainland, and to continue to support the economically thriving and
politically democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By consistently supporting Taiwan over the last two decades --
ever since the passage of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act -- the United
States has witnessed a "dramatic transformation" in Taiwan, Feulner
noted. "Freedom has spread from the marketplace to the ballot box,
making Taiwan one of Asia's best and proudest examples of a
free-market democracy," he said.</P>
      <P>US interests in the region have not changed since the passage of
the Act, and neither should US policy toward Taiwan, Feulner said.
"Even though the American government no longer recognizes Taipei as
the legal government of all of China, the American people remain
committed to the cause of freedom -- for that is the only principle
that can give any government moral legitimacy," Feulner was quoted as
saying.</P>
      <P>The United States must honor its commitment to Taiwan by
maintaining close unofficial ties with the government of Taiwan and
by helping Taiwan become a full participant in international
organizations such as the WTO, Feulner said.</P>
      <P>The administration should also join Taipei in calling on Beijing
to renounce its threat of military force to take the island, and
should employ a regional missile defense system to protect US allies
in North Asia, he went on.</P>
      <P>As an important first step toward giving Taiwan the recognition
it deserves, the US government should receive Taiwan's democratically
elected leaders in the United States, Feulner said. The heads of
several other states without diplomatic standing in the United States
have already been received by the Clinton administration, such as
Cuba's Fidel Castro and Palestine's Yasser Arafat. How, then, Feulner
asked, can the administration justify shunning Taiwan's leaders?</P>
      <P>As for the island's concerns over its inclusion in the
US-initiated Theater Missile Defense system, Feulner expressed
confidence that the US Congress will bring this into serious
discussion, though he did not give a specific timetable.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, Feulner said that the US-Taiwan partnership should
play an important role in shaping American policy toward mainland
China and in securing American interests in Asia.</P>

have already been reported in southern Taiwan since the beginning of
the year.</P>
      <P>Currently, about 50 children are being sent to hospital every
week for treatment of enterovirus-like symptoms, according to the
bureau.</P>
      <P>Judging from the children admitted in the first two months of the

      <P>Most people in Hong Kong hope that
bilateral Hong Kong-Taiwan ties can be further strengthened,
according to the results of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The poll, carried out by Hong Kong University, found that 53.1
percent of the residents of Hong Kong think the Hong Kong government
should build a closer relationship with Taiwan. About 56.9 percent
support Taiwan's efforts to create a greater international presence,
while 27.6 percent voiced disagreement with the concept, the survey
found.</P>
      <P>Some 48.7 percent of the respondents said Hong Kong-Taiwan
relations have gone through no major changes since the former British
colony returned to mainland Chinese rule in July 1997, down from the
52.5 percent in a similar survey in June 1998. Only 13.7 percent said
they believe two-way ties have improved, a slight increase from the
11.9 percent in the previous poll.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the Hong Kong government should set up
a representative organization in Taiwan, the poll found that 78

    <HEADLINE>US TO REITERATE TO BEIJING POSITION ON CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid seemingly heightened tension
across the Taiwan Strait, the United States will soon reiterate its
position to Beijing that any resolution of cross-strait issues should
be peaceful, a senior US official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will "send a very clear
message" to mainland China when she visits Beijing next week,
according to the State Department official.</P>
      <P>The message will be "first about the importance which we attach
to resumption of cross-strait dialogue," he said. "And she'll be
sending the message that any outcome has to be peaceful."</P>
      <P>This reiteration of the US position will come after a series of
recent news reports on mainland China's missile build-up vis-a-vis
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a background briefing on Albright's visit to Asia, the
official played down the significance of these reports, which were
based on two Pentagon studies due to be released soon.</P>
      <P>The official said that the Pentagon reports indicate "that China
is in the process of ongoing military modernization, not in any kind
of alarming stark or dramatic sense, but, rather, in terms of a
long-term process."</P>
      <P>"I don't think there should be any surprises," he said. "So I
don't expect any increase in tensions as a result of either of those
reports.</P>
      <P>According to the official, one of the most important purposes of
Albright's two-day visit to Beijing is to continue the regular
strategic dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said that North Korea and South Asia will be high on the
agenda.</P>
      <P>In addition, said the official, with Premier Zhu Rongji's
upcoming visit to the United States, many bilateral issues will be
discussed, including mainland China's WTO accession and market
access.</P>
      <P>Issues such as nonproliferation and human rights will also get
high priority during the trip.</P>
      <P>Albright is due to arrive in Beijing on Feb. 28 at the start of
her three-nation tour. She will later visit Thailand and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>On the possibility of agreement on mainland China's WTO accession
being reached before Zhu's visit in the spring, the official said
that "it is certainly conceivable; it is not definite."</P>
      <P>"Both sides are negotiating seriously with good intent," he said.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the United States will resume support
for a resolution condemning Beijing at the annual conference of the
United Nations Human Rights Commission, the official said that no
decision has yet been taken.</P>
      <P>The official also said that Albright will discuss Tibet with her
Chinese counterparts, "and we'll reiterate our concerns in a very

    <HEADLINE>FIXING ECONOMY RAPIDLY WILL BENEFIT EVERYONE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A rapid fix of the wavering economy will
benefit the people of Taiwan as a whole rather than just a small
bunch of individuals or firms, President Lee Teng-hui said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an effort to drum up support for the government's economic
policies, especially the controversial decision to cut the stock
transaction tax, the president told a lunar New Year gathering of
business and labor leaders that all the economic policies are
designed to remedy the ailing economy, and that their beneficial
effects will trickle down to everyone on the island.</P>
      <P>Lee put the blame for the current economic crisis on the island's
decreasing exports; plummeting real estate market; businesses being
deprived of normal access to credit; mounting bad loans on the part
of financial institutions; and the investor pessimism about the
country's economic prospects.</P>
      <P>Although those issues are all intertwined, the government has
worked out a package of measures to redress them, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remark in response to criticism that the
government's economic policy favored a coterie of industrialists and
business magnates at the expense of the general public.</P>
      <P>Critics complained that soft loans offered by the government to
first-time house buyers, rather that allowing market forces to set
house prices, serve only to provide the construction industry with an
unexpected windfall, while the proposed cut in the stock transaction
tax is no less than a ploy to "rob the poor to pay the rich," whose
funds are trapped in the bourse by plummeting stock prices.</P>
      <P>The extension of a grace period to some troubled businesses by
the same token is seen as a privilege to certain business tycoons.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech at the gathering, Lee pressed home his
point that economic recession hurts everybody and economic recovery
helps everybody.</P>
      <P>Later on Thursday, Lee forcefully denied that he dictated policy
to Premier Vincent Siew, the chief of the executive branch under the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>In a meeting of legislators of the ruling Kuomintang, he said
that Siew consulted with him on the issue of the stock transaction
tax out of respect for his economic expertise.</P>
      <P>The local press said that Siew, who dismissed categorically the
proposal of cutting the stock transaction tax at an economic
conference two weeks ago, was forced by the president to eat his
words after Lee ordered him to heed the advice of business tycoons
and lower the tax in a desperate attempt to revive the bourse.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed reports about Siew's offer to resign over the ensuing
embarrassment caused an outcry in Taipei political circles, with
critics accusing Lee of trespassing on Siew's Constitutional
authority.</P>
      <P>Denouncing the reports as "groundless," Lee said his knowledge of
the Constitution is enough for him to be well aware that the premier
is the national executive head accountable to the legislature and the
president, and that although he appoints the premier, the president
is not supposed to pull the strings in the government's policymaking
process.</P>
      <P>However, the vigorous denial failed to explain why Siew reversed
his stance after meetings with Lee on Feb. 19 and 22, and opposition
legislators, angered by Siew's sudden about-face on the issue, are
threatening a motion of no confidence against him on Friday.</P>
      <P>However, there is little chance of the motion passing through the
chamber, as the ruling party commands a comfortable majority in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>

we know that their future will not be as good as we are now? Only
when a man is forty or fifty without having done anything to
distinguish himself, does he then cease to command respect."</TEXT>

(By K.C. Huang and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar in Asian studies at Seton Hall
University on Thursday called on Taiwan to seek to further improve
the quality of its democracy.</P>
      <P>Winston Yang, who heads Seton Hall's Asian studies department,
delivered a speech at New York-based St. John's University on the
democratization of the two sides across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The ethnic Chinese expert in cross-strait affairs praised
Taiwan's efforts to embrace democracy, citing the existence of
legitimate opposition parties that serve to check the government. He
also complimented Taiwan for the watchdog functions performed by its
legislative institutions and media.</P>
      <P>But elections in Taiwan are still tainted by allegations of
bribery and violence, while criminal elements continue to wield power
in local governments, as well as in the legislature, Yang said,
calling this the dark side of Taiwan politics.</P>
      <P>Speaking of mainland China's democratization, Yang said that
while he doubts much will change in the short term, over the long
term, democracy will take root in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The present mainland Chinese leadership will eventually give way
to a new generation, comprising intellectual elites educated in the
United States and Europe, where freedom, democracy and human rights
are advocated. The new leadership will build a country based on the
principles of humanitarianism, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA REPORT REVEALS TAIWAN'S BEST-SELLING FRUITS AND FLOWERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Liucheng, also known as Taiwanese oranges,
were the most popular fruit in Taiwan last year, as 17,270 metric
tons were consumed by the public, sources from the Council of
Agriculture (COA) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, shueimitao, a type of peach that are particularly
flavorful and juicy, were the most expensive fruit in Taiwan, with
wholesale prices topping NT$136 (US$4.20) per kilogram, according to
officials from the council's Food and Agriculture Department.</P>
      <P>In its latest market survey the council found the nine most
popular types of fruit in Taiwan last year were, in order, liucheng,
lianwu (wax apples), ponkam (Taiwanese mandarins), papayas,
watermelons, bananas, mini watermelons, guavas and melons.</P>
      <P>Wax apples were the star of Taiwan's fruit kingdom last year,
climbing from sixth in 1997 to second last year in terms of
popularity. In 1998 they ranked fifth in terms of cost.</P>
      <P>The most expensive fruits in Taiwan last year were, in order,
shueimitao, persimmons, sugar apples -- also known as custard apples
-- litchi nuts, wax apples, chestnuts, loquats and pears.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imported, thick-stemmed roses were the "queen" of
fresh and cut flowers in Taiwan in 1998, with wholesale unit prices
amounting to NT$312 (US$9.70) per dozen.</P>
      <P>The roses were the most expensive flower sold in Taiwan last
year, followed in order by Casablanca lilies, imported chrysanthemums
and orchids.</P>
      <P>Anthuriums were the most popular type of flower last year, as
9.54 million bunches, each of which contains 10 to 12 flowers, were
sold. After anthuriums the most popular flowers were, in order,
chrysanthemums, roses, potted plants, Casablanca lilies, African
daisies, and gladioluses.</P>
      <P>The COA report also noted that sunflower seed oil replaced
soybean oil as Taiwan's best-selling cooking oil last year.</P>
      <P>COA officials attributed the sunflower seed oil sales growth to
increased health-consciousness among Taiwanese consumers. The oil
contains alpha-type vitamin E, which can be absorbed directly by the
human body. It is considered a good edible oil, said COA officials.</P>
      <P>Sales of olive oil, not commonly used in Chinese cooking, rose as
well last year, while sales of butter and lard declined slightly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MACEDONIAN UN ENVOY REAFFIRMS TIES TO ROC AFTER BEIJING'S UN VETO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Macedonian Ambassador to the United
Nations Naste Calovski said on Thursday that Beijing's veto of a
proposed extension of the UN peacekeeping mission in Macedonia will
not affect his country's relations with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Calovski made the statement in response to a press inquiry after
mainland China vetoed a UN draft resolution which had proposed a
further six-month extension of the UN Preventive Deployment Force,
known as UNPREDEP, in the former Yugoslav republic.</P>
      <P>Stressing that ROC-Macedonian ties are strong and steadfast,
Calovski said Beijing's veto will not change the reality of this
situation.</P>
      <P>Mainland China cut diplomatic relations with Macedonia shortly
after the Balkan country forged official ties with the ROC on Jan.
27.</P>
      <P>Calovski said he deplores the fact that mainland China has acted
outwith "bilateral considerations" to cast its veto. He called for
the continuation of the UN peacekeeping mission because of "the very
real possibility of a new bloody war in the Balkans."</P>
      <P>Calovski also said during a UN Security Council (UNSC) session
before the vote on the peacekeeping mandate extension that no UNSC
permanent member should abuse its veto power to hurt the rights and
interests of other UN member states, because such moves violate the
UN charter.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's veto means that the 1,049-strong UN force in
Macedonia, tasked with ensuring that ethnic tensions do not spill
over from neighboring Kosovo, should technically be wound up when its
mandate expires on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although mainland Chinese UN Ambassador Qin Huasun did not refer
to Macedonia's ties with Taiwan in his speech during Thursday's
Security Council open session, other council envoys made it clear
that Beijing's veto was linked to the so-called Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended last week that the
UNPREDEP in Macedonia be extended until Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>The force includes about 360 troops from the United States, 640
from Scandinavia, and about 50 from Indonesia. It was originally
deployed to monitor borders and deter the spread of fighting to
Macedonia from Bosnia. It is also monitoring a UN embargo against
Yugoslavia, including Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanians are
battling Serbian security forces. Macedonia also provides logistical
support for European civilian monitors in Kosovo, and is a base for
NATO operations in the region.</P>
      <P>US Ambassador to the UN Peter Burleigh said after Beijing's veto
that his delegation hopes to "begin work immediately" with other
council members "to find a way to allow the international community
to continue to meet this critical need without disruption."</P>
      <P>Beijing exercised its first veto in nearly 25 years in January
1997 against 155 military observers who were to monitor peace accords
in Guatemala, which also maintains diplomatic ties with Taiwan as do
several other Central American and Caribbean nations. Beijing
reversed its decision two weeks later, presumably when Guatemala
promised not to back UN membership for Taiwan, according to
diplomats.</P>
      <P>Mainland China in the past has also twice threatened to veto UN
troops in Haiti for the same reason. The move forced the UNSC to
change the name of the Haiti mission and then have the United States
and Canada pay for the troops.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Jewish service group B'nai B'rith said
Thursday that anti-Semitism is on the rise in Canada.</P>
      <P>In its annual audit, the League of Human Rights of B'nai B'rith
Canada said there were 240 incidents of anti-Semitism reported last
year, up 14 percent from 1997. Last year's growth reversed a
two-year decline.</P>
      <P>The report noted that many of the incidents involved threats,
slurs or the distribution of hate propaganda.</P>
      <P>Toronto, which has Canada's largest Jewish population, accounted
for more than 50 percent of all anti-Semitic incidents in the
country, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The president of B'nai B'rith Canada, Lawrence Hart, said hate
groups appear to be moving their operations to the suburbs and the
Internet.</P>
      <P>"I have received some pretty disgusting hate mail over the last
several years," said Frank Dimant, executive vice president of B'nai
B'rith Canada. "But I must admit it was particularly terrifying to be
the target of a death threat on the Internet."</P>
      <P>On the positive side, there were 42 reported incidents
of anti-Semitic vandalism in 1998, down a significant 28 percent from
the 58 incidents reported in the previous year.</P>
      <P>This trend is consistent with police reports across the country
and may be the result of a crackdown by a special Canadian police
unit that focuses on hate crimes, said the group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JANUARY GROWTH CLEAR AND POSITIVE: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Taiwan's export orders and industrial
production grew substantially in January, showing a remarkable
turn-around from sluggishness over the past year, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exporters and manufacturers received US$9.81 billion
(US$305 million)-worth of export orders in January, up 15.89 percent,
or US$1.35 billion, over the year-earlier levels, according to MOEA
tallies.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials attributed the remarkable growth to stabilized
prices of electronic products, particularly those of semiconductors
and related products, and a relatively lower comparison basis posted
in January of 1998.</P>
      <P>Unlike 1999, the 1998 Chinese New Year holiday fell in January,
which resulted in fewer working days in that month compared with
January 1999. The 1999 Chinese New Year holiday fell in February.</P>
      <P>If export orders received in February exceed US$8.2 billion, the
MOEA will be comfortably safe to say that Taiwan's export orders in
the first quarter of this year is likely to switch from deficit to
growth, said Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the MOEA's
Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>Bearing the brunt of the Asian economic meltdown, Taiwan's export
orders had posted month-on-month declines since last March, resulting
in an annual fall of 4 percent, or US$4.95 billion, from the 1997
figure. This decline represented the first annual negative growth in
that category in Taiwan for 16 years.</P>
      <P>In January, export orders placed by importers from the United
States totaled US$3.48 billion, up 21.84 percent over the same month
of the previous year. Export orders from Hong Kong soared 30.63
percent to US$1.64 billion, while those from Japan jumped 16.93
percent to US$970 million and those from Europe rose 2.28 percent to
US$1.71 billion, MOEA tallies show.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's industrial production also rose significantly
in January, with the month's industrial production index climbing
14.97 percent over that of the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Evident growth in semiconductor manufacturing, iron and steel
processing, and the information technology and telecommunications
industries were cited as the prime movers behind January's industrial
growth, said Chang.</P>
      <P>Among all categories in the industrial arena, the manufacturing
sector posted a growth of 14.34 percent in January over the same
month of 1998, compared with growth of 56.13 percent in the housing
and real estate sector, growth of 13.59 percent in mining, and growth
of 8.78 percent in the public utilities sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DAMNING  AUSTRALIAN  REPORT CITES INEQUALITIES AGAINST TAIWAN WOMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Melbourne,  Feb. 26 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Taiwanese women would prefer to be
men if they had a choice, while the mjaority of European and
Australian women are glad to be women, according to a survey by an
Australian expert.</P>
      <P>Presenting his paper at the 1999 Taiwan Update Conference in
Melbourne on Friday, Dr. David Schak, head of the Taiwan Studies Unit
at the School of Modern Asian Studies of Griffith University in
Brisbane, said two-thirds of the Taiwanese mothers surveyed would
rather be men.</P>
      <P>"This is not surprising, given the inequality for girls growing
up in Taiwan and seeing their brothers pampered, doted upon and
privileged," he said.</P>
      <P>"Parents do more for boys (in Taiwan), expect less domestic help
from them while growing up, and give them more freedom as teenagers
and young adults," he said.</P>
      <P>He said that in Taiwanese families hard pressed to give all their
children the standard of education each aspires to, boys are far more
likely to receive family assistance, which sometimes means that a
sister denied the education she may have wanted has to work to
support her brother.</P>
      <P>He said women in Taiwan also suffer disadvantages in the
workplace.</P>
      <P>He cited a survey by the Interior Ministry of Taiwan which shows
employed women get only half to two-thirds of the pay given to men
doing the same job.</P>
      <P>He said sexual harassment is also a problem for women, both on
the job and in generally in society. He said a street survey of women
found that sexual harassment is relatively common in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Female night school students are regarded as most vulnerable, but
the most common form of harrassment is deliberate touching in crowds
or public buses.</P>
      <P>In an earlier survey, Schak said most female victims did not
complain because it could endanger their jobs and because it is so
hard to prove. There is no legal definition of sexual harrassment in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But this changed in early 1998 when the Taipei District Court
handed down a ruling awarding US$3,100 to a woman who had accused her
supervisor of sexual harassment.

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Second-generation Chinese in Australia
and elsewhere need proper Chinese language education so that they can
speak and write in their mother language, according to scholars.</P>
      <P>The issue was raised on Friday at the 1999 Taiwan Update
Conference in Melbourne, Australia, when several participants, mainly
Chinese Australian scholars, asked why the Republic of China
government has not provided financial help to set up Chinese schools
in major cities in Australia so that their children can receive
proper Chinese language education.</P>
      <P>They said Chinese associations in Australia's major cities have
to lease classrooms from Australian schools to give Chinese language
education for only two hours per week.</P>
      <P>They said two hours per week of Chinese education is not enough,
and that they wanted proper schooling so that the children of Chinese
descendants and even other ethnic groups can have the chance to learn
about Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>This issue came after professor Chen Tung-jung, director of the
Cultural Division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural office in
Canberra, finished presenting a speech by Deputy Education Minister
Yang Kuo-shih, who was absent from the conference due to his busy
schedule in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Yang said the ROC government has given top
priority to education reform with the approach of the new millennium.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE TO VOTE ON NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION AGAINST PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A no-confidence motion against Premier
Vincent Siew, filed by 82 legislators, was accepted by the
legislature on Friday, the first day of the first session of the 4th
legislature.</P>
      <P>The motion is scheduled to be put to the vote next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 82 lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
and the New Party put forward the no-confidence motion to express
their discontent with Siew's policy swing regarding the stock
transaction tax.</P>
      <P>It is the first no-confidence motion to be brought against the
premier since the last amendment of the nation's Constitution.</P>
      <P>At a meeting on the economic and financial situation held on Feb.
12-13, Siew had insisted that the Cabinet would not lower the stock
transaction tax.</P>
      <P>However, following a meeting with President Lee Teng-hui, he
abruptly reversed his decision, although Lee later vigorously denied
that he had instructed Siew to take such a course of action in order
to benefit a small coterie of the island's business tycoons at the
expense of the small investor.</P>
      <P>The move resulted in fierce criticism from the opposition, who
have branded the premier as nothing more than a rubber stamp for the
president.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, one-third, or 76, legislators'
signatures are needed to form a no-confidence motion.</P>
      <P>The Constitution also stipulates that once a no-confidence motion
is lodged, the president of the Legislative Yuan must send the motion
to the floor for a screening within 72 hours, while an open ballot
must be held within 48 hours.</P>
      <P>The no-confidence vote needs the approval of half of the
legislators to secure the premier's resignation, whereupon he would
have to resign within 10 days and request the president to dissolve
the Legislative Yuan, according to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>If the motion fails, no further no-confidence motions can be
filed against the same premier within one year, the Constitution
stipulates.</P>
      <P>Siew's scheduled administrative report to the Legislative Yuan on
Friday, and a general interpellation by the Legislative Yuan, were
suspended because of the motion, and will not be resumed until after
next Tuesday's vote.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday issued a
report which said that resolving the nation's financial and economic
turmoil is the top priority of his administration, and that he
retains an open mind to any suggestions which can promote economic
stability.</P>
      <P>In a briefing to the Legislative Yuan on his administrative
policies, Siew said his Cabinet will never yield to proposals which
violate economic principles, and will be fully responsible to the
public.</P>
      <P>His determination to settle the island's financial and economic
troubles, such as the sluggish economic development and bearish stock
market, can be proved by the fact that in his 52-page written report,
15 pages are devoted to covering his ideas for resolving the economic
problems, Siew said.</P>
      <P>The report points out that financial crises dogging several
domestic enterprises, and the bearishness of the stock and housing
markets, should not be attributed solely to the Asian financial
meltdown. The key factor, according to Siew, is that Taiwan opened
its financial market without setting in place complete regulations on
its management.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances, the report said, some enterprises
misused their loans or overplayed their hands in the trading of stock
and real estate.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the report indicated that "stability" and
"reformation" will be the principle guidelines of the premier's
economic and financial policy.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the short-term measures of encouraging
domestic consumption, providing assistance to financially strained
companies, and providing low-interest housing loans have been
effective.</P>
      <P>In the near future, it adds, the Cabinet will take steps to
formulate long-term measures to bring about comprehensive economic
and financial reforms.</P>

Taiwan Strait in response to a provision of the FY99 Appropriations
Bill.</P>
      <P>The 27-page, non-confidential report addresses Taiwan's ability
to defend against current and emerging capabilities of mainland
China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).</P>
      <P>The report addresses PLA and Taiwan force planning, strategy, and
doctrine; projected PLA and Taiwan capabilities in 2005 in the areas
of conventional theater ballistic and cruise missiles; information
operations (C2W); air and air/missile defense assets; naval systems;
special operations and conventional ground forces; and intangibles
such as leadership, training, personnel and morale.</P>
      <P>The report concludes with a dynamic balance assessment of
mainland China's ability in 2005 to implement a naval blockade;
establish air superiority; conduct an amphibious invasion of Taiwan;
and gain information dominance.</P>
      <P>The report points out that during the 20-year period from 1979 to
1999, the security situation in the Taiwan Strait has exhibited
simultaneously both significant change in some aspects and remarkable
constancy in others.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the greatest change has occurred in the
political and diplomatic arenas, a reflection of the political
changes which have taken place in both Taipei and Beijing, and
between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the report says, despite the modest
qualitative improvement in the military forces of both Taiwan and
mainland China, the dynamic equilibrium of those forces in the Taiwan
Strait has not changed dramatically over the past two decades, except
in a few niche areas like mainland China's deployment of short-range
ballistic missiles (SRBMs).</P>
      <P>However, the report adds that despite anticipated improvements to
Taiwan's missile and air defense systems, by 2005, the PLA will
possess the capability to attack Taiwan with air and missile strikes
which would degrade key military facilities and damage the island's
economic infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The report further says mainland China will continue to give
priority to long-range precision-strike programs.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the report says, despite improvements in Taiwan's
ability to conduct anti-submarine-warfare (ASW) operations, mainland
China will retain the capability to interdict Taiwan's sea lines of
communication (SLOCs) and blockade the island's principal maritime
ports.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report reminds mainland China that should it
invade Taiwan, such an operation would require a major commitment of
civilian air and maritime transport assets, would be prolonged in
duration, and would not be automatically guaranteed to succeed.</P>
      <P>"In the end, any of these options would prove to be costly to
Beijing -- politically, economically, diplomatically and militarily,"
the report stresses.</P>
      <P>Beyond 2005, the report says, development of a modern military
force capable of exerting military influence within the region,
achieving deterrence against potential enemies, preserving
independence of action in domestic and foreign affairs, protecting
its economic resources and maritime areas, and defending the
sovereignty of its territory will remain Beijing's national
priorities.</P>
      <P>By then, the report says, Beijing will strive to create a
smaller, more modern, better trained, more professional, and better
logistically supported force, with an emphasis on air, naval and
missile forces.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the Taiwan Strait, the report says: "By
2005, Taipei will possess a qualitative edge over Beijing in terms of
significant weapons and equipment.</P>
      <P>The report says Taiwan's air force will have over 300
fourth-generation fighters by 2005. "And six French-built
Lafayette-class frigates, eight US Knox-class frigates, and eight
Perry-class frigates will form the nucleus of Taiwan's naval force."</P>
      <P>By 2005, the report says, Taiwan will also possess an advanced
air defense network, comprising an airborne early warning (AEW)
capability, an automated C2 system, and several modern
surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, which will provide Taiwan with
an enhanced defensive capability against both aircraft and missiles.
Taiwan has purchase the Modified Air Defense System (MADS), an
imporved variant of the Patriot SAM system.

      <P>Meanwhile, the report says, the mobility and firepower of
Taiwan's ground forces will have been improved with the acquisition
of additional tanks, armored personnel carriers, self-propelled
artillery and attack helicopters.</P>
      <P>The report further says that Taiwan's primary security goal
beyond 2005 will be to maintain the status quo, while retaining its
long-term objective of eventual peaceful reunification with mainland
China on terms favorable to Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will seek to advance its international status, maintain a
strong economy, modernize its military forces, and further
democratize the island's political system," the report says.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the report says, Taiwan will endeavor to expand
political, cultural and economic ties with Beijing, thereby reducing
tensions with mainland China and lessening the prospects of military
conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The report also points out that Taiwan's military strategy will
remain defensive.</P>
      <P>"Its success in deterring potential (mainland) Chinese aggression
will be dependent on its continued acquisition of modern arms,
technology and equipment and its ability to deal with a number of
systemic problems -- primarily the recruitment and retention of
technically-qualified personnel and the maintenance of an effective
logistics system -- lest Taipei once again risk losing its
qualitative edge," the report remarks.</P>
      <P>As for the current Taiwan Strait situation, the reports says that
nearly three years after communist China conducted provocative
military exercises opposite Taiwan on the eve of the island's first
popular presidential election in 1996, the security situation in the
Taiwan Strait remains calm with no threat of imminent hostilities.</P>
      <P>"There has been little change in the military balance; Beijing
has limited its military activity in the region to routine training;
Taipei has reduced the size and scope of its military exercises and
played down other activities which Beijing might misconstrue as
provocative and destabilizing," the report notes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC TO STUDY MAINLAND SPOUSES' WORKING RIGHTS IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) is to study issues arising from Taiwan people marrying spouses
from mainland China, including the spouses' right to work in Taiwan
and their right to National Health Insurance coverage.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said on Thursday that issues concerning mainland
spouses will be evaluated in terms of humanitarianism, the law,
government policy, and social concerns. The council is also
considering raising quotas for mainland spouses seeking entry to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both the MAC -- the nation's top agency in charge of Taipei's
mainland policy -- and the Ministry of the Interior attach much
importance to problems attributed to cross-Taiwan Strait marriages,
the officials noted.</P>
      <P>According to current regulations, mainland spouses who are not
permitted residency here are also prohibited from working in Taiwan
while making family visits, but because many of them are forced by
their economic condition to work illegally here, "social problems"
arise as a result, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They also said the issue has been discussed by the Council for
Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to the fifth item of the 17th article under the Statute
Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
People of the Mainland Area, said a council official, people who have
been permitted to live in Taiwan are allowed to work in the Taiwan
area during their stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To date, government statistics show that a total of about 6,000
mainland spouses have been given legal resident status in Taiwan,
while there are approximately 22,000 applications pending.</P>
      <P>The current annual entry quota stands at 1,800, and although a
proposal to raise the figure to 2,400 is under review by the relevant
organizations, it will still require legislative approval before
implementation, said informed sources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S VETO ON UNPREDEP MANDATE AN INSULT TO UN: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Friday that mainland China's veto on a proposed extension of
the UN peacekeeping mission in Macedonia is an outright insult to the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the remarks in a written statement issued
after mainland China vetoed a UN draft resolution which had proposed
a further six-month extension of the UN Preventive Deployment Force,
known as UNPREDEP, in Macedonia during a UN Security Council (UNSC)
session on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Beijing has totally ignored the world's hope
for peace in the Balkan region.</P>
      <P>"Its veto to obstruct the renewal of mandate of the UNPREDEP in
Macedonia not only undermines the UN's long-term effort and
achievement in promoting peace in this region but also manifests
Beijing's abuse of its veto rights and its hegemonic mentality
against world peace," the ministry said in the press statement,
adding: "Beijing's action is an outright insult to the UN and
detrimental to the prospects of world peace."</P>
      <P>The ministry went on to say that the establishment of diplomatic
ties between the Republic of China and Macedonia is the behavior of
two sovereign nations exercising their diplomatic rights.</P>
      <P>"Such an action is not aimed at any third nation and should not
be subject to interference by other nations," the ministry said.
"Beijing's claim that our efforts in expanding the ROC's role in the
international community 'undermines' world peace, implying that
Macedonia's establishing official ties with us deserves punishment
is absolutely not acceptable to us."</P>
      <P>The ministry further said Beijing's claim is bound to be
rejected by an overwhelming majority of nations in the world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry said, it recognizes the efforts of the
UN, the European Security Council, NATO, the European Union and
other international organizations to maintain peace and stability in
the Balkan region.</P>
      <P>"We are convinced that the ultimate means of resolving the
Balkan disputes lies in the establishment of a democratic system and
a prosperous economy," the ministry said, adding that the ROC will
continue to share its experience and resources in democratic reform
and economic development with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it believes cooperation between the ROC and
Macedonia will directly and fundamentally contribute to promoting
peace and stability in Macedonia and the Balkan region.</P>
      <P>"This cooperation coincides with the aim of the peacekeeping
force in Macedonia sent by the UN and NATO to eradicate the
scourges of war," the ministry said.</P>
      <P>It urged Beijing to view its diplomatic ties with Macedonia and
the mandate of the UNPREDEP with reason and objectivity and adjust
position by refraining from actions that counter the efforts of
other nations in the world to maintain peace in the Balkan region.</P>

      <P>The Philippine government will closely
monitor the distribution of US$150 million in Marcos wealth to human
rights victims to make sure that each claimant gets his or her share,
a Philippine official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview that
the agreement forged between the government, the human rights
victims, and the Marcos family will be submitted to President Joseph
Estrada for approval, and eventually to the United States court which
will oversee the distribution of compensation.</P>
      <P>Zamora said the money will be divided according to a formula in
which compensation will be based on the gravity of atrocities
suffered by the claimant.</P>
      <P>Zamora said the money will go to 10,000 human rights victims who
won a class-action suit before a Honolulu court against the Marcos
estate for torture, summary execution and disappearances.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the government wants the agreement to be very
transparent, noting that the accord was forged not just by the

    <HEADLINE>RISING TAIWAN NATIONALISM VERSUS MAINLAND CHINESE PAN-NATIONALISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Melbourne,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rise of Taiwan nationalism, helped
by the democratization process, is challenging mainland China's
pan-nationalism and putting China's reunification at risk, a China
expert said on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a paper delivered at the 1999 Taiwan Update Conference here,
Associate Professor Baogang He of the Tasmanian University said the
Chinese pan-nationalists play up the fact that most people in Taiwan
are Han Chinese, and that mainland China and Taiwan share a Confucian
legacy.</P>
      <P>He said the pan-nationalist identity "constitutes a source of
reunification cause. However, the rise of Taiwan nationalism,
assisted by the democratization process, challenges the basic
assumptions of Chinese pan-nationalism."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan and mainland China face different forms of the
national identity question. "Taiwan has only the straightforward
question of independence, while China confronts not only secession
movements within the mainland, it also faces the question of
reunification with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"China therefore has a more complex national identity than Taiwan
has," he said.</P>
      <P>He said an independent Taiwan would provide political leverage to
the separatists of Tibet and Xingjiang in the eyes of Beijing.</P>
      <P>"From the standpoint of Beijing, preventing Taiwan's independence
and achieving reunification is one key to containing other
secessionist movements in China," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the rise of Taiwan nationalism has been associated
with the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which, he said, has
invented and promoted Taiwan's identity as distinct from Chinese
identity.</P>
      <P>But he also said Taiwan nationalism had its birth following the
ouster of Taiwan from the United Nations, the reduction of diplomatic
ties with other nations, and the isolation by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Mainland China wants to downgrade Taiwan by governing it under
the "one country, two systems" formula used in Hong Kong, but Taipei
insists it is a separate political entity and should be treated on an
equal footing with Beijing. Taiwan also insists that reunification
can only come about when the mainland embraces democracy under
freedom and equitable distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>"The solution to the problem is very, very difficult and will
take years or possibly decades to solve," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China appreciates US
concern about peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Roy Wu said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the statement in response to reports that the US
Department of Defense has provided to Congress a 27-page report
detailing the security situation in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon report says mainland China will possess the
capability to attack Taiwan with air and missile strikes which would

      <P>Responding to the Pentagon report, Wu said the ROC has
consistently maintained close contact with the United States
concerning peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wu said US views on Taiwan Strait security issues have not only
been expressed in this Pentagon report but also divulged in
statements released by the White House, the Department of State and
the Pentagon in recent years.</P>
      <P>"Statements or comments made by senior White House, Pentagon and
State Department officials in the past few years fully indicate that
US authorities have taken note of mainland China's military threat
to Taiwan," Wu said, adding that the US government has repeatedly
reaffirmed its commitment to providing Taiwan with adequate
defensive arms and military equipment in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act and keeping close monitoring and constant assessment of
military balance in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wu went on to say that the head of the US Central Intelligence
Agency has expressed similar views on the Taiwan Strait security
issues during a recent congressional hearing.</P>
      <P>"We recognize the US concern about the security situation
in the Taiwan Strait," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC has insisted that cross-strait issues be
resolved strictly by peaceful means, Wu said the ROC is hopeful that

    <HEADLINE>NO THREAT OF IMMINENT HOSTILITIES IN TAIWAN STRAITS: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee and Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly three years after Beijing's
provocative military exercises caused unease in Taiwan the security
situation in the Taiwan Straits remains calm with no threat of
imminent hostilities, according to a report prepared by the US
Defense Department.</P>
      <P>The report, which was forwarded to the US Congress in both
classified and unclassified forms on Thursday, was prepared in
response to a provision inserted to the FY Defense Appropriation Act
at the request of Senator Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska).</P>
      <P>The report gives an analysis of the military balance between
Taiwan and mainland China and addresses Taiwan's ability to defend
against current and emerging capabilities of the People's
Liberalization Army (PLA).</P>
      <P>The report said that Taiwan currently has, and will continue to
have, the more modernized air force and more advanced navy, but that
mainland China's quantitative advantage in the number of its military
personnel, vessels, submarines and fighters will ensure its
capability to blockade the island.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Beijing is likely to gain air superiority over Taiwan
in the future under its military buildup program which has been
underway the past two decades.</P>
      <P>The report said that Beijing's continuous efforts to develop
ballistic missies and cruise missiles will enable it to posses
overwhelming superiority over Taiwan by 2005.</P>
      <P>The reports emphasized that missiles deployed in southeastern and
southern parts of the Chinese mainland pose an especially serious
threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Senators from both the Democratic and Republican parties
expressed their concerns over the report's findings.</P>
      <P>"I am especially troubled by the findings that Taiwan's most
significant vulnerability is its limited capacity to defend against
the growing arsenal of Chinese ballistic missles," Sen Murkowski
said.</P>
      <P>"This report provides important new information that the Congress
should consider in determining the quality and quantity of defense
articles and services it provides to Taiwan in the coming years," he
added.</P>
      <P>"It is important that Congress engage in a serious analysis
of the findings of these reports, especially as the findings relate
to the effect of the modernization of the People's Republic of
China's military on Taiwan's deterrent forces and on the need for
cooperation on security issues between the US government and the
government of the Republic of China on Taiwan," the senator said.</P>
      <P>He said that based on the report, the US should reevaluate its
priorities and reaffirm its commitment to Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>Sen. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N. J.) said that Beijing's
reluctance to renounce using force against Taiwan poses a continuous
threat to regional security.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT SEES GROWING PAINS IN TAIWAN DEMOCRATIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Melbourne,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The defeat of former Taipei Mayor Chen
Shui-bian and setbacks of other minority party candidates in the Dec.
5 mayoral and parliamentary elections in Taiwan will help prolong the
growing pains of the island's democratization, said an analyst on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Presenting his paper at the 1999 Taiwan update conference here on
Friday, Associate Professor C.L. Chiou of the University of
Queensland said that many are now pondering the difficulties of
consolidating democracy in Taiwan after Chen's mayoral defeat and the
poor performance of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the
December election.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang was the biggest winner, not only in the
Taipei race but also in the legislature, where it now holds a
comfortable majority.</P>
      <P>According to Chiou, the way in which the KMT used traditional
politics to win the elections will "maintain the continuous existence
and effectiveness of traditional political culture and behavior."</P>
      <P>He said the DPP's efforts to replace the KMT as the ruling party
in order to end the dominant party system and democratize Taiwan's
political culture, now seem further away.</P>
      <P>He went on: "The election results show that the growth momentum
of the DPP has been stopped, the New Party and the other opposition
parties have become rather inconsequential in Taiwan democracy, and
the steady erosion of the KMT ... has been arrested."</P>
      <P>He noted that the way in which KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou won the
Taipei mayorship should cause particular concern, as he won on an
"ethnic line." He pointed out that most "mainlanders," (referring to
those who came to Taiwan following the 1949 defeat of Nationalist
forces by the communists) who make up 30 percent of Taipei's
population, cast their votes for Ma, including most New Party
supporters.</P>
      <P>"This is traditional ethnic, not modern party, politics in
action," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that traditional socio-cultural elements are still alive
in Taiwan politics, but that there is little likelihood of Taiwan's
return to authoritarian rule in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, if these socio-cultural elements -- money
and gangster politics, factionalism, paternalism, nepotism,
corruption and charismatic leadership -- which are still
all-pervasive in Taiwan politics, are allowed to continue to dictate
Taiwan's political agenda and distort Taiwan's democratic
institutions, democratization will have a long and bumpy road ahead.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIN YUAN GROUP HAS LARGEST ASSETS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Lin Yuan Group was Taiwan's largest
business conglomerate in 1997, with total assets worth NT$894.5
billion (about US$27 billion), according to the results of a survey
made public on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yuan, which owns Cathay Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Taiwan's
largest life insurance company, also scored the number one spot in
the list of pre-tax profits in 1997, with figure hitting NT$24.2
billion, according to the survey conducted among Taiwan's 141
business conglomerates by the China Credit Information Service Ltd.</P>
      <P>The Tatung Group, the champion concern registering the highest
level of pre-tax profits in 1996, fell to 16th place in 1997, the
survey indicated.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that large business conglomerates are playing
an increasingly important role in the Taiwan economy, as business
incomes made by the 141 business groups in 1997 totaled more than
NT$4 trillion, accounting for 45.6 percent of the island's overall
gross national product in 1997.</P>
      <P>Although affiliates belonging to the 141 largest business groups
comprised just 1 percent of Taiwan's total firms, the survey pointed
out that they contributed nearly 20 percent to the island's overall
business revenues in 1997.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's armed forces are
fully aware of Beijing's military building-up, according to Tang
Yiau-min, the country's new chief of general staff.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks, on Friday, when asked to respond to an
assessment of the US Defense Department that Beijing will have an
overwhelming military advantage over Taiwan with the deployment of
its newly-developed missiles by the end of 2005.</P>
      <P>The assessment was included in a report presented by the US
Defense Department to the Congress on the military strength of both
Taiwan and mainland China at a time when Congress is considering
inviting Taiwan to join the US theater missile defense system. The
system would supposedly shield the island from missile attacks.</P>
      <P>Contents of the report were made public in Washington on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hosting a dinner in Taipei for a group of journalists, Tang said

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON REPORT NOTES LOW MORALE PROBLEMS IN TAIWAN MILITARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  25  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Defense, in a
report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait, has given
higher evaluation of the quality of Taiwan's military servicemen than
its mainland Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Pentagon report, which was sent to the US
Congress earlier this week, pointed out some problems facing
Taiwan's armed forces, including poor morale among the enlisted
ranks and difficulties in retaining competent, educated service
members in the face of stiff private sector competition.</P>
      <P>The 27-page, non-confidential report said Taiwan's military
leadership generally is competent and capable.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan officers of all services and ranks exhibit a relatively
high degree of professionalism. They generally are well educated,
operationally proficient, and technically sophisticated --
especially when contrasted with their PLA (People's Liberation
Army) counterparts -- and pro-US in their outlook," the report said.</P>
      <P>However, the report added that Taiwan's officer corps functions
within a culture that values caution over innovation and initiative.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan military also faces an ongoing challenge in retaining
qualified junior officers as employment opportunities in the
civilian sector remain enticing, the report said.</P>
      <P>It went on to say that morale, especially among the enlisted
ranks, is generally assessed as poor, amidst efforts to retain
competent, educated service members in the face of stiff private
sector competition.</P>
      <P>According to the report, continued personnel shortages stemming
from low retention rates -- especially among non-commissioned
officers -- will remain a serious problem affecting morale.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's armed forces are also hampered by systemic problems of
poor, antiquated management and a traditional military culture with
very rigid command structures which discourages low-level
risk-taking, decision-making, and innovation, the report said,
adding that the Taiwan Army especially is facing morale problems
stemming from the ongoing restructuring and downsizing.</P>
      <P>The report further said President Lee Teng-hui strongly supports
the promotion of native Taiwanese officers to senior military
positions. "This trend will continue and probably will have a
positive effect on the morale and cohesion of the lower ranks of the
armed forces, who themselves are overwhelmingly native Taiwanese."

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the government claims the island's
economy is turning the corner, newly-released statistics show the
unemployed population increased in January.</P>
      <P>Data compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) indicated that there were 265,000 jobless
workers in January, translating into an unemployment rate of 2.67
percent or a record high for any January.</P>
      <P>Among the jobless, 89,000 were laid off due to plant closure or
slack business which is the second highest one-month total, only
behind the 90,000 of December.</P>
      <P>The broad-scaled jobless rate jumped to 4.14 percent from 3.38
January of 1998, by taking into account 139,000 "disappointed labors"
or those who didn't pursue new jobs although they intended to.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics, the unemployed have been out of work
for an average of 24 months, and 13,000 were first-time job seekers.</P>
      <P>Putting a brave face on the worsening employment figures, the
DGBAS said in an accompanying analysis that Taiwan's jobless rate is
still the best in Southeast Asia, compared to 7.9 percent in South
Korea, 5.8 percent in Hong Kong, 4.5 percent in Singapore and 4.3
percent in Japan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade between Taiwan and mainland China
plunged 7.9 percent to US$22.51 billion in 1998, according to
statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The figure comprised 10.5 percent of Taiwan's foreign trade.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the statistics shows that Taiwan exported US$18.4
billion worth of goods to mainland China, or 10.3 percent less than
the previous year. Exports to the mainland were responsible for 16.6
percent of Taiwan's total exports.</P>
      <P>Data released by mainland China's customs, however, shows that
imports from Taiwan grew by 1.1 percent in the same period.</P>
      <P>An analysis made by the Board of Foreign Trade under the MOEA
attributed reduced mainland-bound exports to the Asian financial
crisis which led to a slowdown of Beijing's exports and a weakened
demand for raw materials, as well as, equipment from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The strong competitiveness posed by goods and materials from
other Southeast Asian countries and Beijing's crackdown on smuggling,
tax evasion and stricter foreign exchange regulations also
contributed to the slowdown.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan imported US$4.11 billion worth of goods
from mainalnd China in 1998, accounting for 3.9 percent of the
island's total imports, an increase of 5 percent over the previous
year.</P>
      <P>The reasons behind the rise in imports were still booming foreign
orders for Taiwan's information and telecommunication products as
well as the expansion of the island's electrical power stations and
electronic industries, all of which rely on raw materials from
mainland China, according to the analysis.</P>
      <P>As a result, even though Taiwan still enjoyed a trade surplus of
US$14.29 billion with mainland China, the figure is 13.9 percent
lower than one year ago.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government budget for fiscal
2000 will total approximately NT$2.25 trillion (US$59 billion),
according to the budget proposal submitted to the Legislative Yuan on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The figure, representing a decrease of 7.2 percent from
1999, will likely cause a squeezing of administrative affairs.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan outlined three objectives -- government
restructuring, economic development and upgrading, and social
rebuilding -- as the central government's major policy goals for the
next fiscal year. At the same time, other major missions include
increased environmental protection, strengthened national security,
increased diplomatic offensives, educational reforms and a boost for
aborigines and minority groups.</P>
      <P>On the economic front, some NT$353 billion is earmarked for
public construction and development projects. About NT$147 billion is
allocated for national defense purposes, while NT$44 billion is
budgeted for diplomatic missions, with a similar level put aside for
educational spending.</P>
      <P>More than NT$375 billion is allocated for a social rebuilding
campaign, of which NT$52.7 billion will go to projects by the
Interior Ministry to improve public security and social order.</P>
      <P>According to the Executive Yuan, personnel spending for fiscal
2000 will top NT$676.9 billion, accounting for approximately 30
percent of the its overall budget of fiscal 2000.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan admitted the ratio is high, only a slight 0.9
percent fall from the previous year, but promised it will do its best
to reduce spending on personnel affairs in order to create a "small,
beautiful but efficient" administration.</P>
      <P>The number of government officials, including those in the
central government and in the already downsized provincial
government, is 172,662 at present, a drop of more than 3,500 people
from a year ago, according to the Executive Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US REPORT BLASTS MAINLAND CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States said on Friday that
mainland China's human rights record "deteriorated sharply" late last
year and that Beijing "continued to commit widespread and
well-documented human rights abuses".</P>
      <P>In its annual human rights report, the State Department said
that, during Beijing's latest crackdown against organized political
opposition, dozens of political activists were detained for trying to
register a political party.</P>
      <P>"Three leaders were given harsh sentences in closed trials that
flagrantly violated due process," the report added.</P>
      <P>These developments overshadowed an earlier loosening of
restrictions on political debate and Beijing's signature last October
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Human rights abuses in mainland China during the past year
included extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of
prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention,
lengthy incommunicado detention and denial of due process.</P>
      <P>In 1998, according to the report, the Communist government
infringed on citizens' private rights, continued restrictions on the
freedom of speech and of the press with the infringements tightening
towards the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Other abuses included severe restriction on freedom of assembly,
and continued restriction on freedom of association, religion and
movement, etc.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan, the 1998 Human Rights Report said that with the 1996
direct presidential election, Taiwan "completed its transition to an
open, democratic system".</P>
      <P>Problems remain, however, and these include corruption and
political influence within the judiciary, as well as occasional
instances of police abuse of detainees, physical abuse of military
inductees and prison overcrowding.</P>
      <P>Other negatives include some restrictions on freedom of
association, discrimination and violence against women, child
prostitution, child abuse, restrictions on workers' freedom of
association and on their ability to strike.</P>
      <P>The report noted Taiwan authorities have in the past resorted
occasionally to libel laws, apparently to deter criticism of senior
leaders, although in 1998, no such cases were reported.</P>

his conduct. If you speak to a man in parables, he will probably be
pleased with your story; but the important point is that he should
apply the moral to himself."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>SOME US PRODUCE MAY HAVE UNSAFE LEVELS OF PESTICIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan consumers should take note of
the fact that some US-originating fruits and vegetables may have
unsafe levels of residual pesticide, since the island is a major
importer of US produce.</P>
      <P>According to a recent report published by the Consumers Union of
the United States, although virtually all the 27,000 fruit and
vegetable samples tested were safe to eat, with pesticide levels
within legal limits, some products had such high levels of toxic
residue that they could be dangerous for children.</P>
      <P>Seven of the fruits and vegetables sampled -- apples, grapes,
green beans, peaches, pears, spinach and winter squash -- had up to
several hundred times higher toxicity than other foods analyzed, the
report said.</P>
      <P>In the largest-ever analysis of US government data on pesticide
levels in domestic and imported produce, the Consumers Union said
when the residue indices showed under 20, the toxic threat was
considered "negligible," while indices in excess of 100 were
considered "worthy of concern."</P>
      <P>The report showed that squash had indices as high as 1,706,
compared with apples (550), pears (435), spinach (349), grapes (228),
and green beans (222).</P>
      <P>It also showed that the above-mentioned seven items, along with
tomatoes, had higher levels of toxic residues than produce from other
countries, with American peaches having the highest levels of all at
4,848, about 11 times higher than those from Chile.</P>
      <P>According to the US Department of Agriculture, Taiwan is
currently the sixth-largest overseas market for American agricultural
products. The island's imports of fresh fruit alone was valued at
US$155 million in 1998, with apples, grapes, peaches and pears
topping the list.</P>
      <P>Edward Groth, Consumers Union director of technical policy and
public service, said the analysis reveals that for a child, even one
serving of some fruits and vegetables would exceed safe daily limits
for certain pesticides. The findings were particularly pertinent to
children because they eat more produce per pound of body weight than
adults.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that people should not be afraid to feed their
kids fruit and vegetables because of the report. "We only want this
information to enable them to make the best choices" of fresh
produce, he added.</P>
      <P>The Consumers Union, meanwhile, advised parents to avoid feeding
their children produce with high levels of toxic residue, and to
always peel apples, pears and peaches before serving.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH CALLS FOR ACTION AGAINST MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Human
Rights Watch on Friday challenged the Clinton administration to act
on its acknowledgment of the mainland Chinese government's terrible
human rights record.</P>
      <P>Pelosi said in a brief statement that "The Chinese government has
once again embarked on a severe crackdown on the brave supporters of
freedom and liberty in China. The regime will not tolerate any
attempt to question the authority of the Communist Party."</P>
      <P>"The State Department Human Rights Report documents that reality.
The question is whether this administration will adjust its policy to
reflect its report," noted Pelosi.</P>
      <P>She added that "If this hard-hitting report is to mean anything,
the administration must now act on its words. It can start by
immediately announcing it will pursue a resolution condemning China's
human rights practices at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said that the
Clinton administration should do more to put its annual human rights
report into practice.</P>
      <P>"We're glad that the State Department made a special effort on
human rights today," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of the
largest human rights organization in the United States. "But what is
the Clinton administration doing about human rights the other 364
days of the year? It's all very well to report that a country is
abusing human rights. But the US government then ought to act on that
information."</P>
      <P>Roth urged the US government to use diplomatic, political and
economic means to put stronger pressure on countries such as mainland
China that abuse human rights. He also welcomed a unanimous Senate
vote on Thursday calling on the Clinton administration to sponsor a
resolution condemning mainland China's human rights practices at the
upcoming session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON: BEIJING CANNOT BUY STABILITY AT EXPENSE OF FREEDOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton said on
Friday that he believes mainland China will have to realize that in
today's world, a country as full of potential as mainland China
"simply cannot purchase stability at the expense of freedom."</P>
      <P>In a foreign policy address delivered in San Francisco, Clinton
noted that beyond economics, beyond the transformation of Russia and
mainland China, beyond even many of America's security concerns, "we
also have to recognize that we can have no greater purpose than to
support the right of other people to live in freedom and shape their
own destiny. If that right could be universally exercised, virtually
every goal I have outlined today would be advanced."</P>
      <P>He continued: "We have to keep standing by those who risk their
own freedom to win it for others," adding the United States must make
concentrated efforts to help Indonesia and Nigeria achieve the
potential transition to democracy. But he failed to mention mainland
China, which was criticized for its human rights practices in the
annual human rights report published by the State Department on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Clinton said the first challenge for the United States in the
21st century is to build a more peaceful world, while the second
challenge is to bring Russia and mainland China into the
international system as open, prosperous and stable nations, because
"the way both countries develop in the coming century will have a lot
to do with the future of our planet."</P>
      <P>The question mainland China faces is how best to assure its
stability and progress. In Clinton's judgment, only a path of
openness and engagement can really answer the challenges mainland
China faces.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has made incredible progress in lifting people out
of poverty and building a new economy, but now its rate of economic
growth is declining just as it is needed to create jobs for a growing
and increasingly more mobile population. Most of mainland China's
economy is still stifled by state control. "We can see in China the
kinds of problems a society faces when it is moving away from the
rule of fear but is not yet rooted in the rule of law," Clinton said.</P>
      <P>The president claimed that mainland China's leaders know that
more economic reform is needed, and that they know reform will cause
more unemployment and unrest. At the same time and, perhaps for those
reasons, they remain unwilling to open up their political system to
give people a peaceful outlet for dissent, he said.</P>
      <P>A third challenge is to build a future in which people are safe
from dangers from proliferation, terrorism, drugs and the multiple
catastrophes that could arise from climatic change. "In our case,
that means recognizing that the most likely future threat to our
existence is not a strategic nuclear strike by Russia or China, but
the use of weapons of mass destruction by an outlaw nation or a
terrorist group," said Clinton.</P>
      <P>He added: "We are using all the means at our disposal to deny
terrorists safe havens, weapons and funds. Even if it takes years,
terrorists must know there is no place to hide."</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE EXPERT DOUBTS BEIJING'S ABILITY TO TAKE TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By F.M. Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While there is today only a slight
difference in the air power of Taiwan and mainland China, Taiwan will
likely gain an advantage over the next five years as it makes
enhancements to its F-16 and Mirage fighters, a Japanese military
strategist said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Professor Shigeo Hiramatsu of Kyorin University made the remarks
in response to a recent report by the US Defense Department on the
security situation in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon report predicts that by 2005 mainland China's
People's Liberation Army (PLA) will possess the ability to attack
Taiwan with air and missile strikes that would degrade key military
facilities and damage the island's economic infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Hiramatsu, however, said in an article carried in Saturday's
Yomiuri Shimbun that Beijing's present missile capabilities already
give mainland China virtual superiority over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing's current missile systems are sufficient to intimidate
Taiwan, Hiramatsu said, adding that Beijing could do so merely by
calling attention to its arsenal of M9 missiles.</P>
      <P>But military action by the mainland against Taiwan would likely
result in US intervention, he said, adding that he doubts the PLA
would be able to repel the US military.</P>
      <P>Hiramatsu said Taiwan and mainland China are at present about
equal in terms of air power. In five years, however, after further
enhancements are made to Taiwan's F-16 and Mirage fighters, it will
have an edge over mainland China, he said.</P>
      <P>He said it is unlikely that the PLA will launch a naval blockade
and conduct an amphibious invasion of Taiwan in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The 27-page unclassified US Defense Department report indicated
that by 2005 Beijing would have the ability to implement a naval
blockade and conduct an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. It would also
have an advantage over Taiwan in terms of air power and information
control by 2005, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD QUICKEN PACE IN JOINING WTO: US TRADE OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should quicken its pace in
seeking to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) if it hopes to
join the world body at the same time as mainland China, US trade
officials said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will visit the United States
in early April, and it is expected that Zhu will reach an agreement
with the United States then on opening up mainland China's market on
a phase by phase basis.</P>
      <P>Robert Cassidy, US assistant trade representative for mainland
Chinese and Taiwan affairs, is now in Beijing at the head of a
three-member delegation for talks with mainland Chinese officials on
the country's WTO entry. Deputy Trade Representative Richard Fisher
is contacting the delegation every day to monitor the progress of the
talks.</P>
      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is scheduled to visit
Beijing next week. Officials said that Washington and Beijing hope to
reach an agreement on the opening of mainland Chinese markets and to
make an announcement to that effect during Zhu's US visit.</P>
      <P>Although a consensus was reached among signatories to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the WTO's forerunner, that Taiwan
should not be permitted to join the WTO before mainland China, that
agreement has no binding effect on Taiwan's WTO entry status,
officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said the agreement reached Feb. 20, 1998, between
Taiwan and the United States on Taiwan's WTO entry was the impetus
for European Union members' signing agreements with Taiwan on
Taiwan's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan hopes to join the WTO at the same time as mainland
China, it should work to complete bilateral talks with WTO members as
soon as possible. If mainland China were to join the WTO before
Taiwan, it could work to delay or prevent Taiwan's WTO entry, they
noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed bilateral talks with 26 WTO members. At
present, only Canada and Hong Kong have not signed agreements with
Taiwan on Taiwan's WTO entry, and Canada is expected to sign an
agreement in one to two months.</P>
      <P>Because Hong Kong has returned to mainland Chinese sovereignty,
it is possible that the territory will not sign an agreement with
Taiwan until mainland China has finished completing its WTO entry
requirements.</P>
      <P>The officials said that if Hong Kong is the only WTO member that
has not signed an agreement with Taiwan on Taiwan's WTO entry, the
WTO can still regard Taiwan as having completed bilateral talks. This
would allow Taiwan to begin the next phase of the application process
-- multilateral talks with WTO members.</P>
      <P>Taiwan could join the WTO at the same time as mainland China if
the move were agreed to by two-thirds of the WTO's members, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Although talks on mainland China's WTO entry have dragged on for
more than a decade, Beijing will eventually achieve a breakthrough in
its WTO entry negotiations, officials said. So Taiwan should work to
quickly complete negotiations so that it will be ready to enter the
WTO at the same time as mainland China.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fifth International AIDS Conference in
Taipei opened at Veteran General Hospital Saturday with more than 100
AIDS specialists and researchers from home and abroad taking part.</P>
      <P>Discussions during the three-day conference will focus on the
proliferation and treatment of AIDS in Asia, where there are now more
than 10 million people with the disease.</P>
      <P>Leading US AIDS researcher David Ho is taking part in the
conference, where he will present a paper detailing his latest
research.</P>
      <P>Ho, who is of Chinese descent, was last year named an academician
of Academia Sinica, the Republic of China's highest research
institute.</P>
      <P>During a press conference on Saturday, Ho said Asia is home to at
least one-third of the 35 million people suffering from AIDS
worldwide, and over the next few years more than 4 million new cases
will be seen in Asia alone, he said.</P>
      <P>According to World Health Organization (WHO) tallies, the number
of people carrying HIV, the virus thought to cause AIDS, is expected
to increase to 38 million worldwide by the end of the century. Asia
will experience the fastest growth in the number of HIV carriers, he
said.</P>
      <P>The WHO said AIDS transmission through sexual contact is
occurring at an appalling speed throughout much of Asia, particularly
in India, Pakistan and mainland China, where the gap between the rich
and poor is wide and where women are not well respected or educated.</P>
      <P>Liu Wu-cheh, a local AIDS researcher, said finding ways to
prevent AIDS from spreading across Asia is imperative since people in
many of the countries where AIDS is spreading most quickly cannot
afford expensive treatments for the disease, such as the
"three-in-one cocktail" created by a group of researchers led by Ho.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that many poor Asian countries cannot
afford the expensive long-term treatments for AIDS available today,
the conference has selected "HEART: highly effective anti-retroviral
transmission" at the theme of this year's conference.</P>
      <P>Sponsors hope that by emphasizing prevention over treatment, safe
sex and the equality of the sexes that doctors and researchers will
be able to check the spread of AIDS in Asia.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei police on Saturday raided the
underground arsenal of a member of one of Taiwan's four largest
gangs, seizing a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and drugs.</P>
      <P>Police confiscated 13 handguns and rifles, 5,290 cartridges, 735
shotgun shells, a grenade and 21 knives, as well as some 1,800 grams
of amphetamines and heroin.</P>
      <P>The ammunition seizure was the largest ever by Taiwan police.</P>
      <P>The ammunition belonged to 42-year old Hsiung Tzih-chun, a member
of Taiwan's Pine United Gang.</P>
      <P>The police arrested Hsiung, nicknamed Hsiao Hsiung (Little Bear),
at his apartment in downtown Taipei Friday night. Some ammunition was
found in the apartment, although the lion's share was found Saturday
morning by police in a van owned by Hsiung.</P>
      <P>Police allege that Hsiung was serving as the gang's provider of
ammunition, although he has claimed the ammunition was left by a
former gang leader, known as "Chih-wei," who was killed in mainland
China four years ago.</P>
      <P>Police speculated that Hsiung was stockpiling ammunition in hopes
of expanding Pine United's power in Taiwan's underworld. "His motives
for stocking ammunition are questionable," police said.</P>
      <P>The police added that they also suspect "Little Bear," who has a
record of assault and battery, theft, and offenses against personal
freedom, was involved in several recent gun-related crimes.</P>
      <P>The amount of ammunition seized was equal to one-seventh the
amount confiscated islandwide by police in all of 1997. Size of the
seizure has prompted concern by the National Police Administration.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AGAIN LISTED AS MAJOR DRUG-TRANSIT COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite protests from Taipei, a US
government report has once again listed Taiwan as one of the major
illicit drug producing and/or transit countries.</P>
      <P>For the third time in a row, the annual US International
Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), released on Friday, also
classifies Taiwan as one of the world's major money laundering
countries.</P>
      <P>However, President Bill Clinton has given Taiwan certification
for its efforts in fighting drugs-related activities.</P>
      <P>The US government cuts off non-emergency aid to those who are
listed in the INCSR as major drug producing and drug-transit
countries but who fail to win the presidential certification.</P>
      <P>Taiwan objects to being listed out of concern for its image
rather than for any practical reasons because Taiwan does not receive
any foreign assistance from the United States.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the United Nations removed Taiwan from its list of major
drug transit countries. "Everyone agrees, however, that individuals
from Taiwan continue to be involved in international narcotics
trafficking," the INCSR for 1999 said.</P>
      <P>"This assessment derives from regional trafficking patterns and
concern that Taiwan's ports are used by narcotics traffickers to
transship drugs destined for the United States," according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future of bilateral cooperation in the fight
against drugs, the report said that a mutual legal assistance
memorandum of understanding is a high priority.</P>
      <P>The United States also hopes that a framework will be set up to
allow Taiwan authorities to perform end-user pre-export checks for
narcotics precursors.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan, 27 others are listed in this year's INCSR
as major illicit drug producing and drug-transit countries, including
mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Guatemala, Haiti, etc.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is also listed as a major precursor chemical
source country and a major money laundering country.</P>
      <P>The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy announced
Friday that, of the 28 "majors", only Afghanistan and Burma fail to
win certification for US aid.</P>
      <P>The president determined that even though Cambodia, Haiti,
Nigeria and Paraguay did not fully meet the criteria for
certification, their certification should be granted on grounds of
vital US national interests.

occasion, said that it was the abuse of power by the government
rather than ethnic rivalry that triggered the 2-28 incident in 1947
and the subsequent white terror in the 1950s, noting that the victims
covered the spectrum from all provinces, gender and ages.</P>
      <P>Ma said that most of the mainlanders that withdrew to Taiwan in
1949 following a Nationalist Government defeat in the Chinese civil
war should not be held responsible for the tragedy that took place
two years before.</P>
      <P>Ma also presided over the opening of Ke Chao-chih artifact
exhibition. Ke has collected materials related to the 2-28 incident
and turned them over to the government for reference.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed the hope that the public face the history in
sincerity, identify with local culture and devote themselves to the
democratic development on the island.</P>
      <P>Siew, Ma and Huang Ta-chou, chairman of the 2-28 incident
foundation, later laid wreaths before the 2-28 memorial monument,
rang a peace bell, released doves, and prayed for the victims of the
incident.</P>
      <P>Similar ceremonies were held in Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan and
Taichung in central Taiwan respectively.</P>
      <P>The 2-28 incident was triggered by a monopoly bureau inspector's
beating of a woman selling countermand cigarettes in Feb. 28, 1947.
Thousands of casualties were reported in the subsequent riots and
crackdown.</P>
      <P>Public discussion on the incident was suppressed for decades. But
the government lifted the lid on discussion of the incident in the
early 1990s, and the first native-born president, Lee Teng-hui, has
apologized to the public on the state's behalf.</P>
      <P>The government has also set up a foundation to handle
compensation or assistance to the victims or their spouses and
subsidized research on the incident and related activities.</P>
      <P>The foundation reported that in the past three years it has
issued NT$5.9 billion (US$181.53 million) in compensation, a far cry
from the original estimate of nearly NT$100 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS DISPUTE US CRITICISM OF TAIWAN OVER  DRUGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is victim of narcotics rather than a
transit point for drugs, said law enforcement officials on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a rebuttal of a US report which named Taiwan as a major
drug-producing and drug-transiting country, anonymous officials from
the Investigative Bureau pointed out that Taiwan's all-out efforts to
crackdown on narcotics has been acknowledged by US President Bill
Clinton and that they cannot understand why the Department of State
will put the opposite in its report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is clear of drug-producing plants because of the island's
unfavorable climate for opium crops or coca shrubs, and a draconian
anti-drug law. The strict enforcement of that the anti-drug law has
ridded the island of major drug manufacturers, said the officials.</P>
      <P>Citing the 30-odd drug rings busted last year in Taiwan, with a
narcotics haul of more than 500 kg., including some 200 kg. of
heroine, the drug agents said that most of the contraband was
smuggled in from other countries, with only a few was made on the
island.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Taiwan's anti-drug crusade, including
education programs among students to raise their awareness of the
danger of consuming amphetamines, has made the island an "high risk
area" among drug-traffickers, said the officials.</P>
      <P>As a result, according to officials, many drug-producers have
shifted their illegal operations from Taiwan to southern China.</P>
      <P>As to containers transited from Taiwan's ports, Taiwan
authorities are not in a position to check their contents, and should
not be blamed for any drugs stashed in them.</P>
      <P>Also repudiated was the charge made in the report that Taiwan is
a major money laundry center, saying that the island is the first
country in Asia with a law outlawing money laundering.</P>
      <P>The law obliges banks to report to law enforcement authorities
any transaction with a sum beyond NT$1.5 million (US$45,454), said
the officials.</P>
      <P>Regular financial checks conducted by the Ministry of Finance on
financial institutions as well as the alertness of a special
anti-money-laundering unit under the Investigative Bureau has left
little space, in any, for money laundering, said the officials.</P>
      <P>The US Department of State was asked by the Congress to submit an
annual report assessing the anti-drug efforts by countries around the
world which will be taken into account by the Congress in approving
the government's foreign aid programs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is regularly covered by the report, although it is not a
recipient of any US aid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BRAIN-DEAD PATINET BECOMES JAPAN'S FIRST ORGAN DONOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Feb.  28  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 44-year-old female Japanese brain-dead
patient on Sunday became the first donor of organs in Japan since the
country's Organ Transplant Law went into effect in October, 1997, as
well as only the second heart transplant donor in Japan since August,
1968.</P>
      <P>The woman, whose organs were removed Sunday afternoon, was taken
to a Kochi Prefecture hospital February 22 after suffering a
subarachnoid hemorrhage and falling into a coma. She was diagnosed as
brain dead after two legal tests.</P>
      <P>Organs including the heart, liver, kidneys and eyeballs were
removed for transplants to several patients. Doctors failed to remove
her lungs. Transplant operations are to be conducted by several
medical university hospitals, including Osaka University, Shinshu
University, Tohoku University and Nagasaki Central Hospital.</P>
      <P>Since being hospitalized February 22, the woman, who gave prior
written consent for organ transplants, never recovered consciousness
and was judged by doctors as "clinically brain death" on Feb. 25. Her
family members approved the donations under condition that her brain
death was legally certified.</P>
      <P>The first test for brain death was carried out on the evening of
Feb. 27, with the second test six hours later. Both test results,
met a five-point requirement and led to a judgment of legal brain
death. To ensure the objectiveness, Japan's law requires two or more
doctors, not involved in transplant operations, conduct the diagnosis
and produce a document to certify the results.</P>
      <P>A set of guidelines by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1985
defines the conditions that determine brain death as: deep coma,
dilated pupils, loss of voluntary breathing, loss of brain-stem
response and flat brain waves.

    <HEADLINE>COMMERCIAL TRADE REVENUE SET RECORD IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to the launch of a five-day work
week every other week, Taiwan's commercial trade revenue set a new
record in 1998 despite the regional financial storm.</P>
      <P>The data prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
showed that Taiwan's commercial trade stood at NT$3.48 trillion
(US$105.66 billion) in 1998, up 5.24 percent over one year ago.</P>
      <P>Retail trade grew by 5.92 percent to NT$2.3 trillion (US$69.9
billion), while wholesale trade grew 5.92 percent to NT$1.17 trillion
(US$35.72 billion). The two categories compose commercial trade.</P>
      <P>The increase, a happy surprise amid the regional economic tumult,
was credited mainly to increased consumption triggered by the
lengthened leisure time people enjoyed under the shorter work week.</P>
      <P>The proliferation of convenient stores and hypermarkets also
contributed to the booming business of commercial trade, said the
MOEA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE SURVEY SHOWS OPINIONS DIVIDED ON ORGAN DONATION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey released by the Japanese Prime
Minister's office Sunday, the day of the country's first organ
donation, shows opinions on the part of the Japanese people are
almost equally divided on whether to donate organs in the event they
become brain-dead.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, held last October, 31.6 percent would
donate their organs in case of brain death, with a majority of
younger people responding positively, while 37.6 percent said they
would not donate.</P>
      <P>While some 63 percent knew about donor registration cards, 30
million of which have been distributed by the Ministry of Health and
Welfare as of the end of January, only 2.6 percent held the cards,
and of those approximately 60 percent had not yet decided whether to
fill out the card.</P>
      <P>The three major reasons given by those without donor registra-
tion cards were: a negative feeling towards organ transplants
(29.2%), not knowing how to obtain a registration card (23.5%), and
not knowing enough about organ transplants (21%).</P>
      <P>The survey held last October, among 3,000 men and women aged 20

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS URGE CORRESPONDING POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The lack of corresponding rights and
responsibility of government leaders has resulted in the first
no-confidence motion in the Legislative Yuan's history, according to
scholars participating in a seminar over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the major opposition parties, Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and New Party, presented a no-confidence
motion on Friday over the controversy surrounding the stock
transaction tax.</P>
      <P>Local reports earlier this week stated that Premier Vincent
Siew had tendered his resignation because of difference with the
president over the stock transaction tax.</P>
      <P>The scholars, in a seminar sponsored by a foundation to discuss
the first no-confidence proposal in ROC history Saturday, said that
the reason behind the recent flap could be attributed to
constitutional reforms in 1997, which they said gave too much power
to the president.</P>
      <P>Professor Lu Ya-li of National Taiwan University said that
after the constitutional reforms two years ago, the president could
appoint the premier without the approval of the Legislative Yuan. The
premier therefore is responsible to the president but not to the
public. The president has real power, but does not take corresponding
responsibility.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Siew, who had insisted in not adjusting the stock
transaction tax, softened his stance after President Lee said that he
is in favor of lowering the tax. The about-face in such a short time
showed that the decision making power lies in the president, not in
the premier, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Another NTU professor Chang Lin-cheng said that current system
has allowed the president to intervene too much in policies, and she
asked that a clear line be drawn between the power of the president
and the premier.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the president should not be involved in every
matter, suggesting that the president provide opinions on major
policies such as national defenses, diplomacy and cross-strait
relations, but give a free rein to the premier on matters concerning
the everyday life of the public.</P>
      <P>Legislature Chen Chung-hsin of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, who pushed vigorously for constitutional reform in
1997, said that the 1997 reforms indeed are deficient.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that the original intention was that if the
president belongs to the majority party of the Legislative Yuan, then
the president will have real power, but if the president is not in
the majority party, then the power will lies with the premier.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is expected to cast a vote on the
no-confidence motion next Tuesday. As the ruling Kuomintang holds
123 seats in the 225-seat legislature, it is expected that Siew will
survive the no-confidence motion, which requires one half to pass.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VIAGRA TO DEBUT IN S'PORE SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore, February 28 (CNA): Viagra is set to make its debut in
pharmacies in Singapore in about four or six weeks' time, after its
manufacturer, Pfizer, said it could comply with the Ministry of
Health's (MOH) conditions for the sale of the anti-impotence drug.</P>
      <P>The Health Ministry has already reviewed the drug and set seven
conditions last November for the drug company to meet before it
would approve the sale of Viagra.</P>
      <P>It required that Pfizer insert warning pamphlets into the
packaging and produce information booklets for all users.</P>
      <P>The ministry had said then that it was taking a cautious approach
because Viagra was a new drug and had been linked to deaths in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Mr. Michael Khor, Pfizer's marketing director in Singapore said
that as of Friday afternoon, the firm had received verbal con-
firmation that all of the MOH conditions had been met.</P>
      <P>"Going by the registration of previous drugs, I expect a product
license for Virgra in about two weeks," he said.</P>
      <P>It will take two to four weeks after receiving the license for
stocks of the little blue pill to arrive.</P>
      <P>After that, doctors can start prescribing it.</P>
      <P>Pfizer's product license will be valid for six months before MOH
re-evaluates the situation, Khor said.</P>
      <P>In line with ministry conditions, Viagra's insert will carry a
list of statements on proper use. One is a warning for heart patients
on nitrates. Another is directed at men with certain eye conditions.</P>
      <P>Reports have surfaced that some men on the drug have blue-tinted
vision, and ophthalmologists have voiced concern that the long-term
use of the drug could damage eyesight.</P>
      <P>Viagra will be available in Singapore only on prescription.
Each pill is expected to cost around US$10.</P>
      <P>The pill has been approved in more than 42 countries, including
Taiwan, Australia, most of Europe, the Philippines and Thailand.

    <HEADLINE>MAJORITY OF FAMILIES WILLING TO TAKE CARE OF AIDS PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of families of AIDS patients
are willing to take care of them, and the care provided by the
mothers and wives to their children and spouses is most admirable,
according to a staff member of the Veteran General Hospital on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su Yi-hung, chief of nurses at the hospital, spoke of her
experience in observing more than 100 patents during the second day
of a three-day International AIDS Conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Su said that 90 percent of families are willing to take care
of their sick children, spouses or siblings, but fathers, husbands
and male siblings have not given the same degree of care to their
infected children, wives, and female siblings as their female
counterparts.</P>
      <P>She also said that as AIDS patients have suffered from the stigma
of shame and agony of uncertain treatment, they are more incline to
commit suicide than the average patient.</P>
      <P>She noted that several studies show that many families will
not let their relatives, friends and colleagues know that they
have AIDS patients at home. Many families, as a result, suffer from
hypertension due to the long-term care needs of the patients with no
way to seek emotional consolation.
 All indications show that families of AIDS patients need
support to help them tide over the difficulties, adding that such
groups are very limited in Taiwan, Su said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics released by the Department of Health
(DOH) showed that the ratio of patients contracting AIDS has topped
one case per day since last year.</P>
      <P>DOH said that the first AIDS case was reported in Taiwan in 1984,
and the number only reached 100 in the subsequent five years. But in
last year alone, local AIDS cases topped 398 and combined with the
number of foreigners living in Taiwan discovered to have contracted
the virus, the cases totaled 440, topping the one new case per day
ratio for the first time.</P>
